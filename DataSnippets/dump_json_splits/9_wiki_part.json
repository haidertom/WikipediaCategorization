The latter, often abbreviated as ''The Wealth of Nations'', is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the first modern work of economics.\n\nSmith studied [[social philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot [[John Snell]]. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at [[Edinburgh]], leading him to collaborate with [[David Hume]] during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments''. In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\n\nSmith laid the foundations of classical [[free market]] economic theory. ''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of [[Division of labour#Adam Smith|division of labour]] and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of [[William Hogarth]] and [[Jonathan Swift]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\">[http://www.list.co.uk/articles/100-best-scottish-books/adam-smith/ \"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\"].

Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him.{{refn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes: \"In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found. But presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously. Scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated, and they came upon the woman in Leslie wood.

In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], under the [[Snell Exhibition]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}</ref>\n\nSmith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 41\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=41}}</ref> In Book V, Chapter II of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith wrote: \"In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\"\nSmith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of [[David Hume]]'s ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'', and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it.<ref name=\"rae 1895 5\" /><ref name=\"rae 1895 24\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=24}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\">{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=12}}</ref> According to William Robert Scott, \"The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Introductory Economics |publisher=New Age Publishers |isbn=81-224-1830-9 |page=4}}</ref> Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large [[Bodleian Library]].<ref name=\"rae 1895 22\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=22}}</ref> When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters.<ref name=\"rae 1895 24\u201325\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|pp=24\u201325}}</ref> Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\">{{harvnb|Bussing-Burks|2003|p=42}}</ref> He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 42\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=29}}</ref>\n\nIn Book V of ''The Wealth of Nations'', Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at [[List of universities in England|English universities]], when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 12\" />\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"\u2014a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.<ref>Scott, W.&nbsp;R. \"The Never to Be Forgotten Hutcheson: Excerpts from W.&nbsp;R.

In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Smith, Adam (bap. 1723, d. 1790) |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=September 2004 |author=Winch, Donald}}</ref>\n\nIn 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching [[logic]] courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the [[Professor of Moral Philosophy (Glasgow)|head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow]] died the next year, Smith took over the position.<ref name=\"Bussing-Burks 2003 43\" /> He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as \"by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]\".<ref name=\"rae 1895 42\">{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}</ref>\n\nSmith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\n\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - David Hume, 1711 - 1776.

At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from [[Charles Townshend]]\u2014who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume\u2014to tutor his stepson, [[Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch|Henry Scott]], the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 16\">{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=16}}</ref>\n\n===Tutoring and travels===\nSmith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners.<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 16\" /> He was paid [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]300 per year (plus expenses) along with a \u00a3300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher.<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 16\" /> Smith first travelled as a tutor to [[Toulouse]], France, where he stayed for a year and a half.<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 16\"/> According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he \"had begun to write a book to pass away the time\".<ref name=\"Buchholz 1999 16\" /> After touring the south of France, the group moved to [[Geneva]], where Smith met with the philosopher [[Voltaire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|pp=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], one of the leaders of the [[Physiocrats|Physiocratic school of thought]]|alt=A drawing of a man sitting down]]\nFrom Geneva, the party moved to Paris.

Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2002|p=xv}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations''; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest.<ref>{{harvnb|Viner|1991|p=250}}</ref> In recent years, however, some scholars<ref>Wight, Jonathan B.

Rather than viewing ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and ''The Wealth of Nations'' as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. [[James Otteson|Otteson]] argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar \"market model\" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language.<ref>Otteson, James R. 2002, ''Adam Smith's Marketplace of Life''.

Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's [[invisible hand]],<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Wealth of Nations'' edited by R.&nbsp;H. Campbell and A.&nbsp;S.

Cambell and A.&nbsp;S. Skinner, Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> (1776). This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways.\n\n<blockquote>As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.</blockquote>\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 26\u201327.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The first page of ''The Wealth of Nations'', 1776 London edition|alt=The first page of a book]]\n\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Bernard Mandeville|Mandeville's]] contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\".<ref>Mandeville, B., 1724, ''The Fable of the Bees'', London: Tonson.</ref> It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, pp. 145, 158.</ref> Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or [[Monopoly|monopolies]], fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\".<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 79.</ref> Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Adam |title=Market Man |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |issue=18 October 2010 |page=82 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\n<blockquote>It is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (''The Wealth of Nations,'' I.i.10)</blockquote>\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its concept of [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] \u2013 [[Paul Samuelson|Samuelson's]] \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, ''Economics'', 13th edition, N.Y. et al.: McGraw-Hill, p. 825.</ref> quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson<ref>Samuelson, P.&nbsp;A./Nordhaus, William&nbsp;D., 1989, idem, p. 825.</ref> concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\n\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay|Quesnay]]. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living\u2014\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"\u2014for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\n<blockquote>The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,\n* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added].<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 2a, p. 10, idem</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"<ref>Smith, A., 1976, vol. 1, p. 10, para. 4</ref>\n\n===Criticism and dissent===\n[[Alfred Marshall]] criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]] says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the [[invisible hand]] often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"<ref>''The Roaring Nineties'', 2006</ref>\n\n===Other works===\n[[File:Adam Smith Grave.JPG|thumb|upright|Smith's burial place in [[Canongate Kirkyard]]|alt=A burial]]\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'', a history of [[astronomy]] down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on [[ancient physics]] and [[metaphysics]], probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. ''[[Lectures on Jurisprudence]]'' were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of ''The Wealth of Nations'', published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include ''Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms'' (1763) (first published in 1896); and ''Essays on Philosophical Subjects'' (1795).<ref>''The Glasgow edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith'', 1982, 6 volumes</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===In economics and moral philosophy===\n''The Wealth of Nations'' was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=11 February 2010 |url=http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |title=Adam Smith \u2013 Jonathan Swift |publisher=University of Winchester |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128233435/http://journalism.winchester.ac.uk/?page=343 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2005, ''The Wealth of Nations'' was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time.<ref name=\"100 Best Scottish Books, Adam Smith\" /> \n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain embraced free trade and Smith's ''laissez-faire'' economics, and via the [[British Empire]], used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.<ref>L.Seabrooke (2006). \"Global Standards of Market Civilization\". p. 192. Taylor & Francis 2006</ref>\n\n[[George Stigler]] attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.<ref>Stigler, George&nbsp;J.

Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Schumpeter History of Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=185}}</ref>\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"[[labour theory of value#The theory's development|labour theory of value]]\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of [[Karl Marx]]'s major work, ''Capital'', was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital.<ref name=\"Roemer\">[[John Roemer|Roemer, J.E.]] (1987). \"Marxian Value Analysis\".

This contrasts with the modern contention of [[neoclassical economics]], that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\n[[File:Adam Smith Theatre, Bennochy Road, Kirkcaldy.jpg|thumb|The Adam Smith Theatre in [[Kirkcaldy]]|alt=A brown building]]\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"[[marginalism#The Marginal Revolution|marginalism]]\" formed from about 1870 to 1910.

It dispensed with the [[labour theory of value]] of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a [[marginal utility]] theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.<ref>Campos, Antonietta (1987). \"Marginalist Economics\", ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, p. 320</ref>\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of ''The Wealth of Nations'' was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'' and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both ''The Wealth of Nations'' and ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His ''[[homo economicus]]'' or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher,<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=\u00a7Book I, Chapter 2}}</ref> and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.<ref>\"The Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy\" in ''Postclassical Economics'' [http://www.wfu.edu/~hammond/review%20of%20Peart&Levy,%20final.pdf]</ref>\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\n<blockquote>Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all.

''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.<ref>E. A. Benians, \u2018Adam Smith\u2019s project of an empire\u2019, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249\u201383</ref>\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]].<ref>Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846\u20131946'' (Oxford, 1997)</ref> By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation.<ref>J. Shield Nicholson, ''A project of empire: a critical study of the economics of imperialism, with special reference to the ideas of Adam Smith'' (London, 1909)</ref> As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith\u2019s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire \u2018on the cheap\u2019. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith\u2019s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.\"<ref>Marc-William Palen, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9159669&fileId=S0018246X13000101 \u201cAdam Smith as Advocate of Empire, c. 1870\u20131932,\u201d] ''Historical Journal'' 57: 1 (March 2014): 179\u201398.</ref> Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.\n\n===Portraits, monuments, and banknotes===\n[[File:Adam Smith statue by Alexander Stoddart.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A statue of Smith in [[Edinburgh]]'s High Street, erected through private donations organised by the Adam Smith Institute]]\n\nSmith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 notes issued by the [[Clydesdale Bank]] in Scotland,<ref name=\"clydesdale\">{{cite web|url=http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |title=Clydesdale 50 Pounds, 1981 |publisher=Ron Wise's Banknoteworld |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185820/http://aes.iupui.edu/rwise/banknotes/scotland/ScotlandP209-50Pounds-1981-donatedowl_f.jpg |archivedate=30 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"scotbanks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |title=Current Banknotes : Clydesdale Bank |publisher=The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers |accessdate=15 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003071439/http://www.scotbanks.org.uk/banknotes_current_clydesdale_bank.php |archivedate=3 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of [[Bank of England \u00a320 note|\u00a320 notes]] issued by the [[Bank of England]], making him the first Scotsman to feature on an [[Bank of England note issues|English banknote]].<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |title=Smith replaces Elgar on \u00a320 note |accessdate=14 May 2008 |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324062831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6096938.stm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\n[[File:6 Burlington Gardens facade Smith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Statue of Smith built in 1867\u20131870 at the old headquarters of the [[University of London]], 6 Burlington Gardens]]\n\nA large-scale memorial of Smith by [[Alexander Stoddart]] was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh.

[[Herbert Stein]] wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and [[limited government]]\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stein, Herbert |date=6 April 1994 |title=Board of Contributors: Remembering Adam Smith |journal=[[The Wall Street Journal Asia]] |page=A14}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' that in the 20th-century United States, [[Reaganomics]] supporters, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and [[supply-side economics]]\".<ref name=\"Brown93\">{{cite journal |author=Brown, Vivienne |date=January 1993 |journal=[[The Economic Journal]] |volume=103 |issue=416 |pages=230\u201332 |doi=10.2307/2234351 |title=Untitled review of 'Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy' and 'Adam Smith and his Legacy for Modern Capitalism' |last2=Pack |first2=Spencer J. |last3=Werhane |first3=Patricia H. |jstor=2234351}}</ref> In fact, ''The Wealth of Nations'' includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\n<blockquote>The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.<ref name=\"Smith 1977 loc=bk. V, ch. 2\">{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V, ch. 2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them [[Luxury tax|luxury-goods taxes]] and tax on rent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/10/18/101018crbo_books_gopnik |title=Market Man |date=18 October 2010 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I''. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (''Wealth of Nations,'' V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk. V}}</ref> In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\n\n<blockquote>The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.<ref>Smith, A., 1976, ''The Glasgow edition'', vol. 2a, p. 468.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\" (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV.ii.39).\n\n[[Economic historian]]s such as [[Jacob Viner]] regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of ''laissez-faire''.<ref name=\"Viner 1927\">{{cite journal |author=Viner, Jacob |date=April 1927 |journal=[[The Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=198\u2013232 |doi=10.1086/253837 |title=Adam Smith and Laissez-faire |jstor=1823421}}</ref>\n\nEconomist [[Daniel B.

Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\">Buchholz, Todd (December 1990). pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.<ref name=\"New Ideas From Dead Economists\"/>\n\nSome have also claimed, [[Emma Rothschild]] among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage,<ref>Martin, Christopher. \"Adam Smith and Liberal Economics: Reading the Minimum Wage Debate of 1795\u201396,\" ''Econ Journal Watch'' 8(2): 110\u201325, May 2011 [http://econjwatch.org/articles/adam-smith-and-liberal-economics-reading-the-minimum-wage-debate-of-1795-96]</ref> although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (''The Wealth of Nations'', Book 1, Chapter 8)</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an [[equality of bargaining power|imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power]]:<ref>A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8</ref>\n<blockquote>A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Adam Smith}}\n* [[Organizational capital]]\n* [[List of abolitionist forerunners]]\n* [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society of Arts]]\n* [[List of people on banknotes#Scotland|People on Scottish banknotes]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=N}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n}}\n\n==References==\n* Robert L.

Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role [[oxygen]] plays in [[combustion]]. He recognized and named [[oxygen]] (1778) and [[hydrogen]] (1783) and opposed the [[phlogiston theory]]. Lavoisier helped construct the [[metric system]], wrote the first extensive [[history of the periodic table#Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier|list of elements]], and helped to reform [[chemical nomenclature]]. He predicted the existence of [[silicon]] (1787)<ref>In his table of the elements, Lavoisier listed five \"salifiable earths\" (i.e., ores that could be made to react with acids to produce salts (''salis'' = salt, in Latin)):  ''chaux'' (calcium oxide), ''magn\u00e9sie'' (magnesia, magnesium oxide), ''baryte'' (barium sulfate), ''alumine'' (alumina, aluminum oxide), and ''silice'' (silica, silicon dioxide). About these \"elements\", Lavoisier speculates:  \"We are probably only acquainted as yet with a part of the metallic substances existing in nature, as all those which have a stronger affinity to oxygen than carbon possesses, are incapable, hitherto, of being reduced to a metallic state, and consequently, being only presented to our observation under the form of oxyds, are confounded with earths. It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies. It is even possible that all the substances we call earths may be only metallic oxyds, irreducible by any hitherto known process.\" \u2013 from [https://books.google.com/books?id=adYKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA218 p. 218] of:   Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans., ''Elements of Chemistry'', ..., 4th ed.

The ''Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' was one of the most hated components of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schama | first = Simon | authorlink = Simon Schama | title = [[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]] | publisher = Alfred A Knopf| year = 1989 | location = | pages =  73}}</ref> All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the [[French Revolution]], he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated [[tobacco]], and was [[guillotined]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nAntoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parliament of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother.<ref>{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier}}</ref> Lavoisier began his schooling at the [[Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations]], [[University of Paris]] (also known as the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760\u20131761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied [[chemistry]], [[botany]], [[astronomy]], and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of [[Abb\u00e9 Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a [[law degree]] and was admitted to the [[bar association|bar]], but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time.\n\n=== Early scientific work ===\nLavoisier's education was filled with the ideals of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the time, and he was fascinated by [[Pierre Macquer]]'s dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by [[\u00c9tienne Condillac]], a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Guettard]]. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the [[French Academy of Sciences]], France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulfate]]), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban [[street lighting]]. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"Yount\">{{cite book|last1=Yount|first1=Lisa|title=Antoine Lavoisier : founder of modern chemistry|date=2008|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|isbn=978-0-7660-3011-4|pages=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9ifbmgWLAIC&pg=PA115|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref> In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.\n\n=== Lavoisier as a social reformer ===\n\n==== Research benefitting the public good ====\nWhile Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public.<ref name=\"Supplement\">{{cite book|last1=Duveen|first1=Dennis I.|title=Supplement to a bibliography of the works of Antoine Laurent Lavoisier, 1743\u20131794|date=1965|publisher=Dawsons|location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"Bibliographic\">{{cite book|last1=McKie|first1=Douglas|title=Bibliographic Details Antoine Lavoisier, the father of modern chemistry, by Douglas McKie ...

The goal was to bring in water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water.

On behalf of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a [[Wall of the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale|wall]] around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city.<ref>Citizens, Simon Schama Penguin 1989 p.236</ref> His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the [[Reign of Terror]] began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution.\n\nLavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze]], the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the ''Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale''.<ref name=cnrs /> She was to play an important part in Lavoisier's scientific career\u2014notably, she translated English documents for him, including [[Richard Kirwan]]'s ''Essay on Phlogiston'' and [[Joseph Priestley]]'s research.

He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the \"earthy\" sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French [[monetary system|monetary]] and taxation system to help the peasants.\n\n=== Adulteration of tobacco ===\nThe Farmers General held a monopoly of the production, import and sale of tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: \"When a spirit of [[vitriol]], ''aqua fortis'' or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise.\" Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco.  Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote \"His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated.\" Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed.<ref name=\"Poirier1998\">{{cite book|author=Jean-Pierre Poirier|title=Lavoisier: Chemist, Biologist, Economist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u5h0BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=1998|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1649-0|pages=24\u20136}}</ref> To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers [[Dozen#Baker's dozen|seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen]].<ref name=\"Aykroyd2014\">{{cite book|author=W.

He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the [[Sologne]], an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of [[ergotism]] among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.<ref>Citizens, Simon Schama, Penguin 1989 p.313</ref>\n\n=== Gunpowder Commission ===\nLavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the ''Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale''. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French [[gunpowder]] greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.\n\nLavoisier was a formative influence in the formation of the [[DuPont|Du Pont]] gunpowder business because he trained [[\u00c9leuth\u00e8re Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont]], its founder, on gunpowder making in France; the latter said that the Du Pont gunpowder mills \"would never have been started but for his kindness to me.\"<ref name=\"Dutton_1942\">{{Citation |last=Dutton |first=William S. |year=1942 |title=Du Pont: One Hundred and Forty Years |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WEtZAAAAYAAJ |lccn=42011897 |postscript=.}}</ref>{{rp|40}}\n\n=== During the Revolution ===\nIn June 1791 Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to [[Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours]] to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish a newspaper, ''La Correspondance Patriotique''.

The statue was melted down during the Second World War and has not been replaced. However, one of the main \"[[lyc\u00e9e]]s\" (high schools) in Paris and a street in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] are named after Lavoisier, and statues of him are found on the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]] and on the fa\u00e7ade of the ''Cour Napol\u00e9on'' of the [[Palais du Louvre|Louvre]]. His name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names]] of eminent French scientists, engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the [[Eiffel Tower]] as well as on buildings around Killian Court at [[MIT]] in [[Cambridge, MA]] US.\n\n== Contributions to chemistry ==\n\n=== Oxygen theory of combustion ===\n[[File:Lavoisier decomposition air.png|thumb|Antoine Lavoisier's phlogiston experiment. Engraving by [[Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze|Mme Lavoisier]] in the 1780s taken from ''Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie'' (Elementary treatise on chemistry)]]\n\nDuring late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of [[combustion]], the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when [[phosphorus]] burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce [[phosphoric acid|acid spirit of phosphorus]], and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of [[sulfur]] and went on to add that \"what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause.\"\n\n==== Joseph Black's \"fixed air\" ====\nDuring 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly \"fixed air,\" and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled ''Opuscules physiques et chimiques'' (Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of [[Joseph Black]], the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, [[chalk]] ([[calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]), and the caustic form, for example, [[quicklime]] ([[calcium oxide|CaO]]), lay in the fact that the former contained \"fixed air,\" not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n==== Joseph Priestley ====\n[[File:Priestley.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Priestley]], an English chemist known for isolating [[oxygen]], which he termed \"dephlogisticated air.\"]]\nIn the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist [[Joseph Priestley]] visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the [[red calx]] of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance. The result was his memoir ''On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight'', read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with [[charcoal]], giving off Black's fixed air in the process.<ref name=\"in French\">Lavoisier, Antoine (1777) [http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&type=text&bdd=lavosier&table=Lavoisier&bookId=26&typeofbookDes=Memoires&pageOrder=1&facsimile=off&search=no \"M\u00e9moire sur la combustion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617155750/http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&type=text&bdd=lavosier&table=Lavoisier&bookId=26&typeofbookDes=Memoires&pageOrder=1&facsimile=off&search=no |date=17 June 2013 }} (\"On Combustion in General\"). ''M\u00e9moires de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des sciences''.  [http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/lavoisier1.html English translation]</ref> When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air, and that it was the air itself \"undivided, without alteration, without decomposition\" which combined with metals on calcination.\n\nAfter returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was \"five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air.\" He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.\n\n=== Pioneer of stoichiometry ===\nLavoisier's researches included some of the first truly [[stoichiometry|quantitative chemical experiments]]. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no [[gas]]es could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry.<ref>Petrucci R.H., Harwood W.S. and Herring F.G., ''General Chemistry'' (8th ed. Prentice-Hall 2002), p.34</ref> In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of [[conservation of mass]]. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his \"[[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]\" to ''\"Rien ne se perd, rien ne se cr\u00e9e, tout se transforme.\"'' (''\"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\"''). [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1711\u20131765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include [[Jean Rey (physician)|Jean Rey]] (1583\u20131645), [[Joseph Black]] (1728\u20131799), and [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810).

The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the \"ic\" termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the \"ous\" ending. Similarly, salts of the \"ic\" acids were given the terminal letters \"ate,\" as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the \"ous\" acids terminated with the suffix \"ite,\" as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name \"[[copper sulfate]]\" with the old term \"vitriol of Venus.\" Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.\n\n=== Chemical revolution and opposition ===\nAntoine Lavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the [[chemical revolution]]. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the wide spread acceptance of the [[Conservation of mass|law of conservation of mass]]. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. However, Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Kirwan]], [[James Keir]], and [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|author=Golinski, Jan |title=Precision instruments and the demonstrative order of proof in Lavoisier\u2019s chemistry|journal= Osiris|year=1994|pages=30\u201347|jstor=301997|volume=9|doi=10.1086/368728}}</ref> Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, [[Jean-Baptiste Biot|Jean Baptiste Biot]], wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, \"one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> His opposition, however, argued that precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasoning. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated: <blockquote>If it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the ''exactitude scrupuleuse'' of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs ''de l'ordre demonstratif''.<ref>Kirwan, ''Essay on Phlogiston'', viii, xi.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Notable works ==\n\n=== Easter memoir ===\n[[File:Antoine lavoisier illust.png|thumb|Antoine Lavoisier portrait]]\nThe \"official\" version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but \"nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air\" or the \"eminently respirable part of the air\". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning \"acid former\".<ref name=\"in French\" /><ref>Lavoisier, Antoine (1778) [http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&type=text&bdd=lavosier&table=Lavoisier&bookId=31&typeofbookDes=&pageOrder=1&facsimile=off&search=no \"Consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la nature des acides\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617161431/http://www.lavoisier.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&type=text&bdd=lavosier&table=Lavoisier&bookId=31&typeofbookDes=&pageOrder=1&facsimile=off&search=no |date=17 June 2013 }} (\"General Considerations on the Nature of Acids\"). ''M\u00e9moires de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie des sciences''. lavoisier.cnrs.fr</ref> He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.\n\n=== Dismantling phlogiston theory ===\nLavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his paper entitled ''R\u00e9flexions sur le phlogistique'' (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of [[Henry Cavendish]]'s inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed [[hydrogen]] ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for \"water-former\"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Pierre Simon de Laplace]], Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite these experiments, Lavoisier's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water, attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with [[Jean Baptiste Meusnier|Jean-Baptiste Meusnier]], Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel, allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in April 1784, reporting his figures to eight decimal places.<ref name=\":0\" /> Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions, and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which utilized a pneumatic trough, a set of balances, a thermometer, and a barometer, all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus, convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier's theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment, however, proved subpar, as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was \"more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition\" of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries.<ref>Lavoisier and Meusnier, \"D\u00e9veloppement\" (cit. n. 27), pp. 205209; cf. Holmes, ''Lavoisier'' (cn. 8), p. 237.</ref> [[File:Liebig Company Trading Card Ad 01.12.004 front.tif|thumb| right|250px| Lavoisier and Berthollet, Chimistes Celebres, [[Liebig's Extract of Meat Company]] Trading Card, 1929]]\n\n=== ''Elementary Treatise of Chemistry'' ===\nLavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his ''[[Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire de chimie]]'' (''Elementary Treatise on Chemistry''), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern [[textbook]] on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of [[conservation of mass]], and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for ''Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire'' as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.<ref>See the \"Advertisement,\" p. vi of Kerr's translation, and pp. xxvi\u2013xxvii, xxviii of Douglas McKie's introduction to the Dover edition.</ref> In any event, the ''Trait\u00e9 \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire'' was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.[[File:Laboratoire-de-Lavoisier.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lavoisier's Laboratory, [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]], Paris.]][[File:Lavoisier humanexp.jpg|thumb|250px|Lavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s]]\n\n=== Physiological work ===\n[[File:Calorimeter.gif|left|thumb|184x184px|[[Constant-pressure calorimeter]], engraving made by madame Lavoisier for [[thermochemistry]] experiments]]\n[[File:\u0152uvres de Lavoisier Paris, Imprimerie imp\u00e9riale, 1862-93 RGNb10341936.22.vol III.plate IX.tif | thumb|250px |Lavoisier (wearing goggles) operates his solar furnace to prevent contamination from combustion products]]\n\nThe relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration physiology]]. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782/1783 in association with [[Laplace]]. The result of this work was published in a memoir, \"On Heat.\" Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice [[calorimeter]] apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of {{nowrap|0 \u00b0C}} around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of [[carbon dioxide]] and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated, ''\"la respiration est donc une combustion,\"'' that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.<ref>[http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/5/899S Is a Calorie a Calorie?] ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', Vol. 79, No. 5, 899S\u2013906S, May 2004</ref>\n\nThis continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789\u20131790 in cooperation with [[Armand Seguin]]. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body [[metabolism]] and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:SeimiKaisouChemistry.jpg|thumb|upright|The work of Lavoisier was translated in Japan in the 1840s, through the process of [[Rangaku]]. Page from [[Udagawa Y\u014dan]]'s 1840 ''Seimi Kais\u014d'']]\nLavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the [[chemical balance]], used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).\n\nLavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with [[Laplace]]. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of [[carbon dioxide]] produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.[[File:Lavoisier-statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Statue of Lavoisier, at [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris]]]]\n\nLavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of [[allotropy]] in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a [[allotropy|crystalline form of carbon]].\n\nHe was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer, an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these, he also created smaller, cheaper, more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Transforming Matter|last = Levere|first = Trevor|publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8018-6610-3|location = Maryland|pages = 72\u201373}}</ref>\n\nHe was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out\u2014without always adequately recognizing their claims\u2014and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, expounding the true explanation of the results.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.\n\nOverall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.<ref>Gillespie, Charles C.

He was a Professor at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]] and [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]]. Kolbe coined the term [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and contributed to the philosophical demise of [[vitalism]] through synthesis of the [[organic chemical|organic substance]] acetic acid from [[carbon disulfide]], and also contributed to the development of [[structural theory]]. This was done via modifications to the idea of \"radicals\" and accurate prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary alcohols, and to the emerging array of organic reactions through his [[Kolbe electrolysis]] of carboxylate salts, the [[Kolbe-Schmitt reaction]] in the preparation of [[aspirin]] and the [[Kolbe nitrile synthesis]]. After studies with [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler|W\u00f6hler]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]], Kolbe was involved with the early internationalization of chemistry through overseas work in London (with [[Edward Frankland|Frankland]]), and rose through the ranks of his field to edit the [[:de:Journal f\u00fcr praktische Chemie|''Journal f\u00fcr Praktische Chemie'']]. As such, he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences  won the [[Royal Society of London]]'s Davy Medal in the year of his death. Despite these accomplishments and his training a storied next generation of chemists (including [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev|Zaitsev]], [[Theodor Curtius|Curtius]], [[Ernst Otto Beckmann|Beckmann]], [[Carl Graebe|Graebe]], [[Vladimir Markovnikov|Markovnikov]], etc.), Kolbe is remembered for editing the ''Journal'' for more than a decade, where his rejection of [[August Kekul\u00e9|Kekul\u00e9]]'s structure of benzene, [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van't Hoff]]'s theory on the origin of [[chirality]] and [[Adolf von Baeyer|von Baeyer]]'s reforms of nomenclature were personally critical and linguistically violent. Kolbe died of a heart attack in [[Leipzig]] at age 68, six years after the death of his wife, Charlotte. He was survived by four children.\n\n==Life==\n\nKolbe was born in Elliehausen, near [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (Germany) as the eldest son of a [[Protestant]] pastor. At the age of 13, he entered the G\u00f6ttingen Gymnasium, residing at the home of one of the professors.  He obtained the leaving certificate (the [[Abitur]]) six years later.  He had become passionate about the study of [[chemistry]], matriculating at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in the spring of 1838 in order to study with the famous chemist [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]].<ref name=BRIT1>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Kolbe | title=Hermann Kolbe - German chemist |author=Alan J. Rocke|accessdate=2016-07-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 1842, he became an assistant to [[Robert Bunsen]] at the [[University of Marburg|Philipps-Universit\u00e4t Marburg]]. He took his doctoral degree in 1843 at the same university.  A new opportunity arose in 1845, when he became assistant to [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] at the new ''Museum of Economic Geology'' in London and  a close friend of [[Edward Frankland]].  From 1847, he was engaged in editing the ''Handw\u00f6rterbuch der reinen und angewandten Chemie'' (''Dictionary of Pure and Applied Chemistry'') edited by [[Justus von Liebig]], [[W\u00f6hler]], and [[Johann Christian Poggendorff]], and he also wrote an important textbook.  In 1851, Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg and, in 1865, he was called to the [[Leipzig University|Universit\u00e4t Leipzig]]. In 1864, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rocke |first=Alan J. | title=The Quiet Revolution: Hermann Kolbe and the Science of Organic Chemistry |editor=University of California Press | location=Berkeley |date=1993 | isbn=0520081102  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1853, he married Charlotte, the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben. His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage.  They had four children.\n\n==Work in chemical research==\n\nAs late as the 1840s, and despite [[W\u00f6hler synthesis|Friedrich W\u00f6hler's synthesis of urea]] in 1828, some chemists still believed in the doctrine of [[vitalism]], according to which a special life-force was necessary to create \"organic\" (i.e., in its original meaning, biologically derived) compounds. Kolbe promoted the idea that [[organic compound]]s could be derived from substances clearly sourced from outside this \"organic\" context, directly or indirectly, by substitution processes. (Hence, while by modern definitions, he was converting one [[organic compound|organic molecule]] to another, by the parlance of his era, he was converting \"inorganic\"\u2014''anorganisch''\u2014substances into \"organic\" ones only thought accessible through vital processes.) He validated his theory by converting [[carbon disulfide]] to [[acetic acid]] in several steps (1843\u201345). Kolbe also introduced a modified idea of structural [[radical theory|radicals]], so contributing to the development of [[structural theory]]. A dramatic success came when his theoretical prediction of the existence of secondary and tertiary [[alcohol]]s was confirmed by the synthesis of the first of these classes of organic molecules. Kolbe was the first person to use the word [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] in its present-day meaning,<ref>Kolbe coined the word \"synthesis\" during his attempt to transform carbon disulfide into acetic acid.

Technical term, necessary for Wikipedia articles; don't assign for wiktionary -->\n\nIn [[linguistics]], an ''' allomorph''' is a variant form of a [[morpheme]], that is, when a unit of meaning varies in sound without changing the meaning. The term ''allomorph'' explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes.\n\n==In English suffixes==\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\nEnglish has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning such as for the past tense and for the plural.\n\nFor example, in [[English language|English]], a past tense morpheme is ''-ed''.  It occurs in several allomorphs depending on its phonological environment, assimilating voicing of the previous segment or inserting a [[schwa]] after an alveolar stop:\n\n*as {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} or {{IPA|/\u026ad/}} in verbs whose [[Word stem|stem]] ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'hunted' {{IPA|/h\u028cnt\u026ad/}} or 'banded' {{IPA|/b\u00e6nd\u026ad/}}\n*as {{IPA|/t/}} in verbs whose stem ends with voiceless phonemes other than {{IPA|/t/}}, such as 'fished' {{IPA|/f\u026a\u0283t/}}\n*as {{IPA|/d/}} in verbs whose stem ends with voiced phonemes other than {{IPA|/d/}}, such as 'buzzed' {{IPA|/b\u028czd/}}\n\nThe \"other than\" restrictions above commonly occur in allomorphy: if the allomorphy conditions are ordered from most restrictive (in this case, after an alveolar stop) to least restrictive, then the first matching case usually \"win.\" Thus, the above conditions could be rewritten as follows:\n\n*as {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} or {{IPA|/\u026ad/}} when the stem ends with the alveolar stops {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}\n*as {{IPA|/t/}} when the stem ends with voiceless phonemes\n*as {{IPA|/d/}} elsewhere\n\nThe {{IPA|/t/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/t/}} although the latter is voiceless is then explained by {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} appearing in that environment, together with the fact that the environments are ordered. Likewise, the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final {{IPA|/d/}} because the earlier clause for the {{IPA|/\u0259d/}} allomorph takes priority; the {{IPA|/d/}} allomorph does not appear after stem-final voiceless phoneme because the preceding clause for the {{IPA|/t/}} takes priority.\n\nIrregular past tense forms, such as \"broke\" or \"was/ were,\" can be seen as still more specific cases since they are confined to certain lexical items, such as the verb \"break,\" which take priority over the general cases listed above.\n\n==In suffixes in the Sami languages==\n\nThe [[Sami languages]] have a [[trochaic]] pattern of alternating stressed and unstressed syllables. The vowels and consonants allowed in an unstressed syllable differ from those allowed in a stressed syllable. Consequently, every suffix and inflectional ending has two forms, and the form that is used depends on the stress pattern of the word it is attached to. For example, in [[Northern Sami]], there is the causative verb suffix ''-hit''/''-ahttit'', where ''-hit'' is selected when it would be the third syllable (and the preceding verb has two syllables), and ''-ahttit'' is selected when it would be the third and fourth syllable (and the preceding verb has three syllables):\n* ''goarru-t'' has two syllables, so when suffixed the result is ''goaru-hi-t''.\n* ''nanosm-it'' has three syllables, so when suffixed the result is ''nanosm-ahtti-t''.\nThe same applies to inflectional patterns in the Sami languages as well, which are divided into even stems and odd stems.\n\n==Stem allomorphy==\nAllomorphy can also exist in stems or [[Root (linguistics)|roots]], as in [[Classical Sanskrit]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''V\u0101k''' (voice)\n|-\n!\n!'''Singular'''\n!'''Plural'''\n|-\n!

[[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]\n|{{IPA|/va\u02d0t\u0361\u0283-a\u02d0/}}\n|{{IPA|/va\u02d0\u0261-b\u02b1is/}}\n|-\n! [[Locative case|Locative]]\n|{{IPA|/va\u02d0t\u0361\u0283-i/}}\n|{{IPA|/va\u02d0k-\u0282i/}}\n|}\n\nThere are three allomorphs of the stem: {{IPA|/va\u02d0k/}}, {{IPA|/va\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/va\u02d0\u0261/}}.  The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes.\n\nThe form of the stem {{IPA|/va\u02d0k/}}, found in the nominative singular and locative plural, is the etymological form of the morpheme. Pre-Indic palatalization of [[velars]] resulted in the variant form {{IPA|/va\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}}, which was initially phonologically conditioned. The conditioning can still be seen in the locative singular form for which the {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}} is followed by the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nHowever, subsequent merging of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} into {{IPA|/a/}} made the alternation unpredictable on phonetic grounds in the genitive case (both singular and plural) as well as the nominative plural and instrumental singular. Thus, allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes.\n\nPhonological conditioning also accounts for the {{IPA|/va\u02d0\u0261/}} form in the instrumental plural in which the {{IPA|/\u0261/}} assimilates in voicing to the following {{IPA|/b\u02b1/}}.\n\n==History==\nThe term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure. It was first applied to language (in writing) in 1948, by Fatih \u015eat and Sibel Merve in Language XXIV.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary Online: Entry 50006103.

That has led to some debate over how real and how universal phonemes really are (see [[phoneme]] for details). Only some of the variation is significant, by being detectable or perceivable, to speakers.\n\nThere are two types of allophones, based on whether a phoneme must be pronounced using a specific allophone in a specific situation or whether the speaker has the unconscious freedom to choose the allophone that is used.\n\nIf a specific allophone from a set of allophones that correspond to a phoneme must be selected in a given context, and using a different allophone for a phoneme would cause confusion or make the speaker sound non-native, the allophones are said to be ''complementary''. The allophones then complement each other, and one of them is not used in a situation in which the usage of another is standard. For complementary allophones, each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a [[phonology|phonological]] process.<ref name=\"ref47qoref\">{{Citation | title=English L2 reading: getting to the bottom | author=Barbara M.

Complementary distribution means that the allophones are 'distributed' as complements....''}}</ref>\n\nIn other cases, the speaker can freely select from ''[[free variation|free variant]]'' allophones on personal habit or preference.\n\nAnother example of an allophone is [[assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], in which a phoneme is to sound more like another phoneme. One example of assimilation is [[consonant voicing and devoicing]], in which voiceless consonants are voiced before and after voiced consonants, and voiced consonants are devoiced before and after voiceless consonants.\n\n==Allotone==\nAn '''allotone''' is a term that is sometimes used for a [[tone (linguistics)|tonic]] allophone, such as the [[neutral tone]] in [[Standard Mandarin]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== English ===\n{{main|English phonology#Allophones of consonants|English phonology#Allophones of vowels}}\n \nThere are many allophonic processes in English: lack of plosion, nasal plosion, partial devoicing of sonorants, complete devoicing of sonorants, partial devoicing of obstruents, lengthening and shortening vowels, and retraction.\n\n* [[Aspirated consonant|Aspiration]]: In English, a voiceless plosive {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} is aspirated (has a string explosion of breath) if it is at the beginning of the first or a stressed syllable in a word. For example, {{IPA|[p\u02b0]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words (in fact, they occur in [[complementary distribution]]). English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are different: the first is aspirated and the second is [[unaspirated]] (plain). Many languages [[Aspirated consonant#Usage patterns|treat the two phones differently]].\n* Nasal plosion \u2013 In English, a plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k, b, d, \u0261/}}) has nasal plosion if it is followed by a nasal, whether within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Partial devoicing of [[sonorant]]s: In English, sonorants ({{IPA|/j, w, l, r, m, n, \u014b/}}) are partially devoiced after a voiceless sound in the same syllable.\n* Complete devoicing of sonorants: In English, a sonorant is completely devoiced after an aspirated plosive ({{IPA|/p, t, k/}}).\n* Partial devoicing of [[obstruent]]s: In English, a voiced obstruent is partially devoiced next to a pause or next to a voiceless sound within a word or across a word boundary.\n* Retraction: In English, {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} are [[Retracted (phonetics)|retracted]] before {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\nBecause the choice among allophones is seldom under conscious control, few people realize their existence. English-speakers may be unaware of the differences among six allophones of the phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}: unreleased {{IPA|[ t\u031a]}} as in ''cat'', aspirated {{IPA|[t\u02b0]}} as in ''top'', glottalized {{IPA|[\u0294]}} as in ''button'', flapped {{IPA|[\u027e]}} as in [[American English]] ''water'', nasalized flapped as in ''winter'', and none of the above {{IPA|[t]}} as in ''stop''. However, they may become aware of the differences if, for example, they contrast the pronunciations of the following words:\n\n*''Night rate'': unreleased {{IPA|[\u02c8n\u028c\u026at\u031a.\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}} (without a [[word space]] between {{IPA|.}} and {{IPA|\u0279}})\n*''Nitrate'': aspirated {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u02b0\u0279\u0325e\u026at\u031a]}} or retracted {{IPA|[\u02c8na\u026a.t\u0283\u0279\u02b7e\u026at\u031a]}}\n\nA flame that is held before the lips while those words are spoken flickers more for the aspirated ''nitrate'' than for the unaspirated ''night rate.'' The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips. For a [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}} are separate phonemes, the English distinction is much more obvious than for an English-speaker, who has learned since childhood to ignore the distinction.\n\nAllophones of English {{IPA|/l/}} may be noticed if the 'light' {{IPA|[l]}} of ''leaf'' {{IPA|[\u02c8li\u02d0f]}} is contrasted with the 'dark' {{IPA|[\u026b]}} of ''feel'' {{IPA|[\u02c8fi\u02d0\u026b]}}. Again, the difference is much more obvious to a [[Turkish language|Turkish]]-speaker, for whom {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u026b/}} are separate phonemes, than to an English speaker, for whom they are allophones of a single phoneme.\n\n===Other languages===\nThere are many examples for allophones in languages other than English. Typically, languages with a small phoneme inventory allow for quite a lot of allophonic variation: examples are [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]] and [[Toki Pona#Allophony|Toki Pona]]. Here are some examples (the links of language names go to the specific article or subsection on the phenomenon):\n* Consonant allophones\n**[[Consonant voicing and devoicing#Final devoicing|Final devoicing]] particularly [[final-obstruent devoicing]]: [[Arapaho language#Allophony|Arapaho]], [[Consonant voicing and devoicing#English|English]], [[Nahuatl#Allophony|Nahuatl]], and many others\n** [[Consonant voicing and devoicing#Sound change|Voicing of initial letter]] \n** [[Consonant voicing and devoicing#Voicing assimilation|Anticipatory assimilation]]\n** Aspiration changes: [[Algonquin language#Aspiration and allophony|Algonquin]] <!-- also Arapaho_language#Allophony, Xavante_language#Allophony, ... -->\n** Frication between vowels: [[Dahalo language#Allophony|Dahalo]]\n** [[Lenition]]: [[Manx language#Consonants|Manx]] \n** Voicing of clicks: [[Dahalo language#Allophony|Dahalo]]\n<!-- from here on sorted alphabetically -->\n** Allophones for /b/: [[Arapaho language#Allophony|Arapaho]], [[Xavante language#Allophony|Xavante]]\n** Allophones for /d/: [[Xavante language#Allophony|Xavante]]\n** Allophones for /f/: [[Bengali phonology#Allophony|Bengali]]\n** Allophones for /j/: [[Xavante language#Allophony|Xavante]]\n** Allophones for /k/: [[Manam language#Allophony|Manam]]\n** Allophones for /p\u02b0/: [[Garhwali language#Allophony|Garhwali]]\n**[g] and [q] as allophones: a number of [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]]\n** [l] and [n] as allophones: Some dialects of [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]]\n** Allophones for /n/\n*** [\u014b]: [[Finnish language#Phonology|Finnish]] and many more.\n*** wide range of variation in [[Japanese phonology#The moraic nasal /\u0274/|Japanese]] (as [[archiphoneme]] /N/) \n** Allophones for /r/: [[Xavante language#Allophony|Xavante]]\n** Allophones for /\u027d/: [[Bengali phonology#Allophony|Bengali]]\n** Allophones for /s/: [[Bengali phonology#Allophony|Bengali]], [[Taos phonology#Consonant phonetics and allophony|Taos]]\n** [t] and [k] as allophones: [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]]\n** Allophones for /w/:\n*** [v] and [w]: [[Hindustani phonology#Allophony of %5Bv%5D and %5Bw%5D|Hindustani]], [[Hawaiian language#Consonants|Hawaiian]]\n*** fricative [\u03b2] before unrounded vowels: [[O'odham language#Allophony and distribution|O'odham]]\n** Allophones for /z/: [[Bengali phonology#Allophony|Bengali]]\n* Vowel allophones\n** [e] and [o] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ in closed final syllables in [[Malay language|Malay]] and [\u026a] and [\u028a] are allophones of /i/ and /u/ in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]].\n**[<nowiki/>[[Close central rounded vowel|\u0289]], [[Near-close back rounded vowel|\u028a]],<nowiki/> [[o\u031e]], <nowiki/>[[Close-mid back rounded vowel|o]]] as all<nowiki/>ophones for short /u/, and [<nowiki/>[[Close central unrounded vowel|\u0268]], <nowiki/>[[Near-close front unrounded vowel|\u026a]], e\u031e<nowiki/>,<nowiki/> [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|e]]] a<nowiki/>s alloph<nowiki/>ones f<nowiki/>or short /i/ in various [[Varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]] (long /u\u02d0/, /o\u02d0/, /i\u02d0/, /e\u02d0/ are separate phonemes in most Arabic dialects).\n**[[Polish phonology#Vowel allophony|Polish]]\n**[[Russian phonology#Allophony|Russian]]\n** Allophones for /i/, /a/ and /u/: [[Nux\u00e1lk language#Allophony|Nux\u00e1lk]]\n* Vowel/consonant allophones\n** Vowels become glides in diphthongs: [[Manam language#Allophony|Manam]]\n<!-- The above list has been created from the results of https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&search=allophony&fulltext=Search&ns0=1&ns9=1&ns11=1&profile=advanced. Not included yet: [[Quenya#Morphophonemics_and_allophony]], . Also the following has relevance here: [[Free variation]]. -->\n\n== Representing a phoneme with an allophone ==\nSince phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds, not the sounds themselves, they have no direct [[phonetic transcription]]. When they are realized without much allophonic variation, a simple [[broad transcription]] is used. However, when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme, the allophony becomes significant and things then become more complicated. Often, if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe, in the sense of not requiring diacritics, that representation is chosen for the phoneme.\n\nHowever, there may be several such allophones, or the linguist may prefer greater precision than that allows. In such cases, a common convention is to use the \"elsewhere condition\" to decide the allophone that stands for the phoneme. The \"elsewhere\" allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules.\n\nFor example, English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels. The pattern is that vowels are nasal only before a nasal consonant in the same syllable; elsewhere, they are oral. Therefore, by the \"elsewhere\" convention, the oral allophones are considered basic, and nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes.\n\nIn other cases, an allophone may be chosen to represent its phoneme because it is more common in the languages of the world than the other allophones, because it reflects the historical origin of the phoneme, or because it gives a more balanced look to a chart of the phonemic inventory.\n\nAn alternative, which is commonly used for [[archiphoneme]]s, is to use a capital letter, such as /N/ for [m], [n], [\u014b].\n\nIn rare cases, a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols, such as [[dingbat]]s, to avoid privileging any particular allophone.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Allo-]]\n*[[Allophonic rule]]\n*[[Allomorph]]\n*[[Alternation (linguistics)]]\n*[[Diaphoneme]]\n*[[List of phonetics topics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110212012436/http://www.elloandfriends.uni-osnabrueck.de/wikis/1/show?n=PhoneticsandPhonology.PhonemesAndAllophones Phonemes and allophones]\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]", "sha1": "h25fhkeq01pa50i5ptwt25b76o8k2g6"}}, {"title": "Affix", "ns": "0", "id": "1835", "revision": {"id": "862983896", "parentid": "862983828", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T23:57:30Z", "contributor": {"username": "Diamond Blizzard", "id": "34107224"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 2 edits by [[Special:Contributions/2601:2C0:8600:BFF0:F425:BE7D:F8BC:EC49|2601:2C0:8600:BFF0:F425:BE7D:F8BC:EC49]] ([[User talk:2601:2C0:8600:BFF0:F425:BE7D:F8BC:EC49|talk]]) to last revision by Allforrous.

Affixes may be [[Morphological derivation|derivational]], like English ''-ness'' and ''pre-'', or [[inflection]]al, like English plural ''-s'' and past tense ''-ed''. They are [[bound morpheme]]s by definition; [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es may be [[separable affix]]es. Affixation is the linguistic process that speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.\n\n==Positional categories of affixes==\nAffixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. ''Prefix'' and ''suffix'' are extremely common terms. ''Infix'' and ''circumfix'' are less so, as they are not important in European languages.

Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.\n\n==Lexical affixes==\n''Lexical affixes'' (or ''semantic affixes'') are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as [[incorporated noun]]s within verbs and as elements of [[noun]]s. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.\n\nLexical affixes are relatively rare. The [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]], [[Salishan languages|Salishan]], and [[Chimakuan languages]] all have lexical suffixes \u2014 the presence of these is an [[areal feature]] of the Pacific Northwest of the [[North America]].\n\nThe lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of [[Saanich language|Northern Straits Saanich]] written in the Saanich orthography and in [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist notation]]:\n\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #efefef;\"\n! colspan=\"3\" | Lexical Suffix\n! colspan=\"3\" | Noun\n|-\n| -o,\n| -a\u0294\n| \"person\"\n|, e\u0142t\u00e1l\u1e49ew\u0331\n| \u0294\u0259\u026ctel\u014b\u0259x\u02b7\n| \"person\"\n|-\n| -n\u00e1t\n| -net\n| \"day\"\n| s\u023ci\u0107el\n| sk\u02b7i\u010d\u0259l\n| \"day\"\n|-\n| -sen\n| -s\u0259n\n| \"foot, lower leg\"\n| sxene,\n| sx\u0323\u0259n\u0259\u0294\n| \"foot, lower leg\"\n|-\n| -\u00e1wtw\u0331\n| -ew\u0315tx\u02b7\n| \"building, house, campsite\"\n|, \u00e1,le\u1e49\n| \u0294e\u0294l\u0259\u014b\n| \"house\"\n|}\n\nLexical suffixes, when compared with free nouns, often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such \"saltwater\", \"whitewater\", etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to various degrees.\n\nSome linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic [[Verb argument|arguments]] just as free nouns are and, thus, equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the [[Halkomelem language]] (the [[word order]] here is [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]]):\n\n:{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #bbbbff\" | VERB\n| style=\"background: #ffebad\" | SUBJ\n| style=\"background: #ffbbbb\" | OBJ\n|-\n| (1)\n| ni\u0294\n| \u0161ak\u2019\u02b7-\u0259t-\u0259s\n| \u0142\u0259 s\u0142eni\u0294\n| <span style=\"color:#008000\"><u>\u0142\u0259 qeq</u></span>\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"the woman washed <span style=\"color:#008000\"><u>the baby</u></span>\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n| bgcolor=white colspan=5|&nbsp;\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #bbbbff\" | VERB<span style=\"color:#009900\">+LEX.SUFF</span>\n| style=\"background: #ffebad\" | SUBJ\n|\n|-\n| (2)\n| ni\u0294\n| \u0161k\u2019\u02b7<span style=\"color:#009900\"><u>-\u0259y\u0259\u0142</u></span>\n| \u0142\u0259 s\u0142eni\u0294\n|\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"the woman <span style=\"color:#009900\"><u>baby</u></span>-washed\"\n|}\n\nIn sentence (1), the verb \"wash\" is '''\u0161ak\u2019\u02b7\u0259t\u0259s''' where '''\u0161ak\u2019\u02b7-''' is the root and '''-\u0259t''' and '''-\u0259s''' are inflectional suffixes.

Allegory (in the sense of the practice and use of allegorical devices and works) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of [[art]], largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers, readers, or listeners.\n\nWriters or speakers typically use allegories as [[literary device]]s or as [[rhetoric]]al devices that convey (semi-)hidden or complex meanings through [[symbol]]ic figures, actions, imagery, or events, which together create the moral, spiritual, or political meaning the author wishes to convey.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html |title=A |work=Literary Terms and Definitions |publisher=Carson-Newman University |last=Wheeler |first=L.

Anatomy of Criticism. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 1957. Print.]</ref> In this perspective, the characters in a \"naive\" allegory are not fully three-dimensional, for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction; the allegory has been selected first, and the details merely flesh it out.\n\nMany ancient religions are based on [[astrological allegory|astrological allegories]], that is, allegories of the movement of the sun and the moon as seen from the Earth.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Classical allegory==\n\nThe origins of Allegory can be traced at least back to Homer in his \"quasi-allegorical\" use of personifications of, e.g., Terror (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos) at Il. 115 f. <ref>[Small, S. G. P. (1949). \"On Allegory in Homer\". The Classical Journal 44 (7): 423.]</ref> The title of \"first allegorist,\" however, is usually awarded to whoever was the earliest to put forth allegorical interpretations of Homer.  This approach leads to two possible answers: Theagenes of Rhegium (whom Porphyry calls the \"first allegorist,\" Porph. Quaest. Hom. 1.240.14-241.12 Schrad.) or Pherecydes of Syros, both of whom are presumed to be active in the 6th century B.C.E., though Pherecydes is earlier and as he is often presumed to be the first writer of prose.  The debate is complex, since it demands we observe the distinction between two often conflated uses of the Greek verb \"all\u0113gore\u012bn,\" which can mean both \"to speak allegorically\" and \"to interpret allegorically.\" <ref> [Domaradzki, M. (2017). \"The Beginnings of Greek Allegoresis\". Classical World 110 (3):301] </ref> \n\nIn the case of \"interpreting allegorically,\" Theagenes appears to be our earliest example.  Presumably in response to proto-philosophical moral critiques of Homer (e.g. Xenophanes fr. 11 Diels-Kranz <ref>[H. Diels and W. Kranz. (1951). Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, vol. 1. 6th edn. Berlin: Weidmann, 126-138.]</ref>), Theagenes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the Gods of the Iliad actually stood for physical elements.  So, Hephestus represents Fire, for instance (for which see fr. A2 in Diels-Kranz <ref>[H. Diels and W. Kranz. (1951). Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, vol. 1. 6th edn. Berlin: Weidmann, 51-52.]</ref>).  Some scholars, however, argue that Pherecydes cosmogonic writings anticipated Theagenes allegorical work, illustrated especially by his early placement of Time (Chronos) in his genealogy of the gods, which is thought to be a reinterpretation of the titan Kronos, from more traditional genealogies.\n\nIn classical literature two of the best-known allegories are [[Allegory of the Cave|the Cave]] in Plato's ''[[Republic]]'' (Book VII) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa ([[Livy]] ii. 32). \n\nAmong the best-known examples of allegory, [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]], forms a part of his larger work ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]].'' In this allegory, Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall (514a\u2013b). The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows, using language to identify their world (514c\u2013515a). According to the allegory, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality, until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows. He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery, but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves (516e\u2013518a). This allegory is, on a basic level, about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding, seeks to share it as is his duty, and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough.<ref>\n[Elliott, R. K. (1967). \"Socrates and Plato's Cave\". Kant-Studien 58 (2): 138.]\n</ref>\n\nIn Late Antiquity [[Martianus Capella]] organized all the information a fifth-century upper-class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and ''Philologia,'' with the seven [[liberal arts]] the young man needed to know as guests.<ref>[Capella, Martianus, William Harris. Stahl, Richard Johnson, and E. L. Burge. The Marriage of Philology and Mercury. New York: Columbia UP, 1977. Print.]</ref>\n\n==Biblical allegory==\nOther early allegories are found in the [[Hebrew Bible]], such as the extended metaphor in [[Psalm 80]] of the [[Grapevine|Vine]] and its impressive spread and growth, representing Israel's conquest and peopling of the Promised Land.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kennedy | first=George A. |date=1999 |title=Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times |edition=2nd |publisher=UNC Press |page=142 |isbn=0-8078-4769-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LHHYx4idyPEC&pg=PA142 |access-date=7 August 2009}}</ref> Also allegorical is [[Ezekiel]] 16 and 17, wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty Eagle represents Israel's exile to Babylon.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Alexander |date=1968 |title=The Jerusalem Bible |edition=Reader's |publisher=Doubleday & Company |pages=1186, 1189 |isbn=0-385-01156-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Hermeneutics#Allegorical|Allegorical interpretation of the Bible]] was a common early Christian practice and continues.

(pXIX)\n\n==Medieval allegory==\n[[File:British School 17th century - Portrait of a Lady, Called Elizabeth, Lady Tanfield - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| [[English art|British School]] 17th century \u2013 Portrait of a Lady, Called Elizabeth, Lady Tanfield.

Mediaeval thinking accepted allegory as having a ''reality'' underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses. The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances. Thus, the Papal Bull ''[[Unam Sanctam]]'' (1302) presents themes of the unity of [[Christendom]] with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic: \"''Therefore'' of this one and only Church there is one body and one head\u2014not two heads as if it were a monster... If, then, the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors, they ''necessarily'' confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ.\" This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period, following the tradition and example of the Bible.\n\nIn the late 15th century, the enigmatic ''[[Hypnerotomachia]]'', with its elaborate woodcut illustrations, shows the influence of themed pageants and [[masque]]s on contemporary allegorical representation, as [[Renaissance humanism|humanist dialectic]] conveyed them.\n\nThe denial of medieval allegory as found in the 12th-century works of [[Hugh of St Victor]] and [[Edward Topsell]]'s ''Historie of Foure-footed Beastes'' (London, 1607, 1653) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist [[John Ray]] and the astronomer [[Galileo]] is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science.<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Peter Harrison (historian) |last=Harrison |first=Peter |title=The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-59196-1 |page=1\u201310 |chapter=Introduction |date=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Modern allegory==\n\nSince meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues, allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognised. This is allegoresis, or the act of reading a story as an allegory. Examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], and even some works of science fiction and fantasy, such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C.S. Lewis]] and ''[[Mark Helprin#Works|A Kingdom Far and Clear: The Complete Swan Lake Trilogy]]'' by [[Mark Helprin]].\n\nThe story of the apple falling onto [[Isaac Newton]]'s head is another famous allegory. It simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered. It also made the scientific revelation well known by condensing the theory into a short tale.\n==Poetry and fiction==\n\n[[File:Allegory of Arithmetic - detail.JPG|thumb|Detail of [[Laurent de La Hyre]]'s ''Allegory of Arithmetic'', c. 1650]]\nIt is important to note that while allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work, not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical, and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way. According to Henry Littlefield's 1964 article, [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'',  may be readily understood as a plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters, intended to discuss the politics of the time.<ref>[Littlefield, Henry (1964). \"The Wizard of Oz: Parable on Populism\". ''American Quarterly'', 16 (1): 47\u201358. {{doi|10.2307/2710826}}.]</ref> Yet, [[George MacDonald]] emphasised in 1893 that \"A fairy tale is not an allegory.\"<ref name=\"Baum2000\">{{cite book |first=L.

Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is another example of a well-known work mistakenly perceived as allegorical, as the author himself once stated, \"...I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history \u2013 true or feigned\u2013 with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.\"<ref name=\"BogstadKaveny2011\">{{cite book|author1-first=Janice M. |author1-last=Bogstad |author2-first=Philip E. |author2-last=Kaveny |title=Picturing Tolkien: Essays on Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' Film Trilogy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNjKrXRP0G8C&pg=PA189 |date=9 August 2011 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-8473-7 |page=189}}</ref> \n\nTolkien specifically resented the suggestion that the book's [[One Ring]], which gives overwhelming  power to those possessing it, was intended as an allegory of [[nuclear weapons]]. He noted that, had that been his intention, the book would  not have ended with the Ring being destroyed but rather with an [[arms race]] in which various powers would try to obtain such a Ring for themselves. Then Tolkien went on to outline an alternative plot for \"Lord of The Rings\", as it would have been written had such an allegory been intended, and which would have made the book into a [[dystopia]]. While all this does not mean Tolkien's works may not be treated as having allegorical themes, especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities, it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings. This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis, as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention.\n\nLike allegorical stories, allegorical poetry has two meanings \u2013 a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning.\n\nSome unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works:\n*[[Edmund Spenser]] &ndash; ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues.\n*[[William Shakespeare]] &ndash; ''[[The Tempest]]'': a fight between good and evil on a deserted island\n*[[John Bunyan]] &ndash; ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'': The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven.\n*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; ''[[Young Goodman Brown]]'': The Devil's Staff symbolises defiance of God. The characters' names, such as ''Goodman'' and ''Faith'', ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story.\n*[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] &ndash; ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'': The scarlet letter symbolises many things. The characters, while developed with interiority, are allegorical in that they represent ways of seeing the world. Symbolism is also prominent.\n*[[George Orwell]] &ndash; ''[[Animal Farm]]'': The pigs stand for political figures of the [[Russian Revolution]].\n*[[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai]] - ''[[The Melancholy of Resistance]]'' and the film ''[[Werckmeister Harmonies]]'': It uses a circus to describe an occupying dysfunctional government.\n*[[Edgar Allan Poe]] &ndash; ''[[The Masque of the Red Death]]'': The story can be read as an allegory for humans' inability to escape death.<ref>[Roppolo, Joseph Patrick. \"Meaning and 'The Masque of the Red Death'\", collected in Poe: A Collection of Critical Essays, edited by Robert Regan.

Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element;<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Allotrope|file=A00243|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref> the [[atom]]s of the element are [[chemical bond|bonded]] together in a different manner. For example, the [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[diamond]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in a [[tetrahedral]] lattice arrangement), [[graphite]] (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a [[hexagonal lattice]]), [[graphene]] (single sheets of graphite), and [[fullerene]]s (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term ''allotropy'' is used for elements only, not for [[chemical compound|compounds]]. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same [[state of matter|phase]] (i.e., different [[solid]], [[liquid]] or [[gas]] forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered to be examples of allotropy.\n\nFor some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae which can persist in different phases; for example, two [[allotropes of oxygen]] ([[oxygen|dioxygen]], O<sub>2</sub>, and [[ozone]], O<sub>3</sub>) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Conversely, some elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different phases; for example, [[phosphorus]] has [[allotropes of phosphorus|numerous solid allotropes]], which all revert to the same P<sub>4</sub> form when melted to the liquid state.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] (1779\u20131848).<ref name=Jensen>{{citation | last = Jensen | first = W.

E. The Allotropy of the Elements (Elsevier 1964) that many have repeated this advice.</ref>\n\n==Differences in properties of an element's allotropes==\nAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., [[pressure]], [[photochemistry|light]], and [[temperature]]. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, [[iron]]  changes from a [[body-centered cubic]] structure [[Allotropes of iron|(ferrite)]] to a [[face-centered cubic]] structure ([[austenite]]) above 906&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[tin]] undergoes a modification known as [[tin pest]] from a [[metal]]lic form to a [[semiconductor]] form below 13.2&nbsp;\u00b0C (55.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).\n\n==List of allotropes==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}\n\nTypically, elements capable of variable [[coordination number]] and/or [[oxidation states]] tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to [[catenation|catenate]].\n\nExamples of allotropes include:\n\n===Non-metals===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Element\n!

The son of a [[pottery|potter]] who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC, he learned his father's trade, but afterwards entered the army along with his brother [[Antander]]. In 333 BC he married the [[widow]] of his patron Damas, a distinguished and wealthy citizen. He was twice [[Exile|banished]] for attempting to overthrow the [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] party in Syracuse.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nIn 317 BC he returned with an army of [[mercenary|mercenaries]] under a solemn oath to observe the [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitution]] which was established after they took the city. Having banished or murdered some 10,000 citizens, and thus made himself master of Syracuse, he created a strong army and fleet and subdued the greater part of Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nWar with [[Carthage]] followed. In 311 BC Agathocles was defeated in the [[Battle of the Himera River (311 BC)|Battle of the Himera River]] and [[siege|besieged]] in Syracuse. In 310 BC he made a desperate effort to break through the [[blockade]] and attack the enemy in [[Africa]].\n\nIn 309/8 BC, Agathocles turned his attention towards [[Ophellas]] ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] as likely to prove a useful ally in his war against the Carthaginians. In order to gain him over he promised to cede to him whatever conquests their combined forces might make in Africa, reserving to himself only the possession of Sicily.<ref>Diodorus xx. 40.1-4</ref> Ophellas gathered a powerful army from the homeland of his wife Euthydike (a descendant of [[Miltiades]]) [[Athens]], where many citizens felt disgruntled after having lost their voting rights.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}} Notwithstanding all the natural obstacles which presented themselves on his route, succeeded in reaching the Carthaginian territories after a toilsome and perilous march of more than two months' duration.<ref>Diodorus xx. 41-42</ref> He was received by Agathocles with every demonstration of friendship, and the two armies encamped near each other: but not many days had elapsed when Agathocles betrayed his new ally, attacked the camp of the Cyrenaeans, and had Ophellas himself killed.<ref>Diodorus xx. 42.4-5; 43.3-4</ref> The Cyrenean troops, left without a leader, went over to Agathocles.{{sfn|Habicht|1998|p=95}}\n\nFollowing several victories he was at last completely defeated (307 BC) and fled secretly to Sicily.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} After concluding peace with Carthage in 306 BC, Agathocles styled himself king of Sicily in 304 BC, and established his rule over the [[Greece|Greek]] cities of the island more firmly than ever. A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the [[Halycus|Halycus River]]. Even in his old age he displayed the same restless energy, and is said to have been contemplating a fresh attack on Carthage at the time of his death.\n\nHis last years were plagued by ill-health and the turbulence of his grandson [[Archagathus (grandson of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]], at whose instigation he is said to have been [[poison]]ed; according to others, he died a natural death. He was a born leader of mercenaries, and, although he did not shrink from cruelty to gain his ends, he afterwards showed himself a mild and popular \"tyrant.\" Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king.\n\nAgathocles was married three times. His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons: [[Archagathus (son of Agathocles of Syracuse)|Archagathus]] and Agathocles, who were both murdered in 307 BC. His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], who married as the second wife of King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. His third wife was the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Greek Ptolemaic Princess]] [[Theoxena of Syracuse|Theoxena]], who was the second daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt|Berenice I]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]] and was a stepdaughter of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. Theoxena bore Agathocles two children: [[Archagathus of Libya|Archagathus]] and [[Theoxena of Egypt|Theoxena]]. Theoxena survived Agathocles. He had further descendants from his second and third marriage.\n\n==Legacy==\nAgathocles was cited as an example \"Of Those Who By Their Crimes Come to Be Princes\u201d in Chapter VIII of [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]\u2019s treatise on politics -  ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513). \nHe was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career. Machiavelli claimed: {{quote|It cannot be called prowess to kill fellow-citizens, to betray friends, to be treacherous, pitiless, irreligious. ... Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickednesses do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men.<ref>''The Prince'', Chapter VIII</ref>}}\n\nMachiavelli goes on to reason that Agathocles' success, in contrast to other criminal tyrants, was due to his ability to mitigate his crimes by limiting them to those that \n{{quote|are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage of the subjects.}}\nHowever, he came to \"glory\" as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Primary sources==\n* [[Diodorus Siculus]] ''Library of History'' Books 19-21.\n* [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'' Book 22.\n* [[Polyaenus]] 5.3\n* [[Polybius]] 9.23\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |first=Christian |last=Habicht |title=\u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1 |trans-title=Hellenistic Athens |language=Greek |publisher=Odysseas |location=Athens |year=1998|isbn=960-210-310-8}}\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Agathocles|volume=1|page=370}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Tillyard |first1=H.J.W. |title=The History of Agathocles |date=1908 |publisher=CUP |location=Cambridge |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215164619/http://www.third-millennium-library.com/readinghall/GalleryofHistory/AGATHOCLES/DOOR.html}}\n*{{cite web |last1=Bennett |first1=Chris |title=Family of Agathocles |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716100716/http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/affilates/aff_ptolemies.htm|accessdate=21 July 2018}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Schubert |first1=Rudolf |title=Geschichte des Agathokles |date=1887 |publisher=W.

Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&nbsp;\u2013 Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&nbsp;\u2013 Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&nbsp;\u2013 Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).\n\n[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.\n\nConventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).\n\nBecause of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see \"trends\" below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]).  Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas)  and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.\n\n{{Economy of Canada}}\n\n=== Economic regions and cities ===\nSince the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary.  This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the \"[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]\") were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s.  The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south.  Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt.  Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe.  Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities.  Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]].  [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.\n\n==== Calgary and Edmonton ====\nThe Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province\u2019s population.  They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg.  This has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.\n\nThe economic profile of the two regions is slightly different.  Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands.  However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies.  Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton\u2019s suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province\u2019s manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).<ref>http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/Lamphier+Edmonton+roll+lucky/7691047/story.html</ref>\n\n===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====\nThe [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada.

The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===== Calgary\u2013Edmonton rivalry =====\n{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}\nSeeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the \"Oil Capital of Canada\".\n\n==Trends==\n[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]\n{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}\n\nAlberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' \"[[Staples Thesis]]\", the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.\n\nThe development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].\n\nIn 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year.  By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions.  By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.\n\nThe spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.\n\nA comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).\n\n==Employment==\nAlberta's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare, government, or retail. Primary industries are also of great importance, however.\n\nBy March 2016 the unemployment rate in Alberta rose to 7.9%\u2014<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> its \"highest level since April 1995 and the first time the province\u2019s rate has surpassed the national average since December 1988.\"<ref name=\"finance_alberta_about_2016_mar_11\">{{cite web | url=http://www.finance.alberta.ca/aboutalberta/at-a-glance/current-economy-indicators-at-a-glance.pdf | title=Alberta Economy: Indicators at a Glance | publisher=Treasury Board and Finance Economics and Revenue Forecasting | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> There were 21,200 fewer jobs than February 2015.<ref name=\"finance_alberta_2016_mar_11\" /> The unemployment rate was expected to average 7.4% in 2016.<ref name=\"financealberta_2016_Feb\" />{{rp|13}} The [[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] (CAPP) claimed that Alberta lost 35,000 jobs in 2015\u201425,000 from the oil services sector and 10,000 from exploration and production.<ref name=\"huffington_2015\">{{citation |title=Alberta Oilpatch Layoffs Total 35,000, Says CAPP |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/02/alberta-oilpatch-layoffs_n_8078660.html |work=The Huffington Post|location=Alberta  |first=Michelle |last=Butterfield |date=September 2, 2015 |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> Full-time employment increased by 10,000 in February 2016 after falling 20,000 in both December 2015 and January 2016.

With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.\n\nAnother factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil.

Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,<ref>{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}</ref> and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].\n\n[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.\n\n==== Forestry ====\n{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}\n\nThe vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].\n\nIn 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.\n\n===Services===\nDespite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. By January 2016 that number had increased to 1,668.5 thousand and by February 2016 to 1,670.6 thousand.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\">{{cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/labr67j-eng.htm | title=Employment by major industry group, seasonally adjusted, by province (monthly)  (Alberta) | publisher=Statistics Canada | date=March 11, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.<ref name=\"statcan_2016_services\" />\n\n====Finance====\nThe [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market.

He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of [[calculus]], rejecting the heuristic principle of the [[generality of algebra]] of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded [[complex analysis]] and the study of [[permutation group]]s in [[abstract algebra]].\n\nA profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors;<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Cauchy, Augustin Louis|volume=5|pages=555\u2013556}}</ref> [[Hans Freudenthal]] stated: \"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\"{{sfn|Freudenthal|2008}} Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and [[mathematical physics]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Youth and education===\nCauchy was the son of [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy]] (1760\u20131848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792\u20131857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849, and Eugene Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy (1802\u20131877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.\n\nCauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818.  She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. They had two daughters, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823).\n\nCauchy's father ([[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy]]) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New R\u00e9gime, but lost this position due to the [[French Revolution]] (July 14, 1789), which broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.<ref>His father's dismissal is sometimes seen as the cause of the deep hatred of the French Revolution that Cauchy felt all through his life.</ref> The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following [[Reign of Terror]] (1793-4) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=65\u20136|oclc=41497065}}</ref> After the execution of [[Robespierre]] (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris.

When [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to power (1799), Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The famous mathematician [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] was also a friend of the Cauchy family.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the [[\u00c9cole Centrale du Panth\u00e9on]], the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]].\n\nIn 1805, he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the [[\u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es]] (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.\n\n===Engineering days===\nAfter finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and was assigned the [[Canal de l'Ourcq|Ourcq Canal]] project and the [[Pont de Saint-Cloud|Saint-Cloud Bridge]] project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the ''Premi\u00e8re Classe'' (First Class) of the [[Institut de France]].<ref>In the revolutionary years the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was known as the \"First Class\" of the Institut de France.</ref> Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on [[regular polyhedron|polyhedra]]) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of [[conic sections]]) was rejected.\n\nIn September 1812, now 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming ill from overwork.<ref name=\":0\" /> Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose to not return to Cherbourg.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of [[symmetric functions]], the [[symmetric group]] and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king [[Louis XVIII]] took the restoration in hand. The [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] was re-established in March 1816; [[Lazare Carnot]] and [[Gaspard Monge]] were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction of Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance of his membership in the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.\n\n===Professor at \u00c9cole Polytechnique===\nIn November 1815, [[Louis Poinsot]], who was an associate professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s [[polygonal number theorem]]. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor.\n\nWhen Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Alo\u00efse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works.<ref>Bradley & Sandifer page 9</ref> Alo\u00efse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Belhoste\n  | first = Bruno\n  | others = Frank Ragland (trans.)\n  | title = Augustin-Louis Cauchy: A Biography\n  | place = Ann Arbor, Michigan\n  | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]-Verlag New York Inc.\n  | year = 1991\n  | page = 134\n  | url = https://www.amazon.com/Augustin-Louis-Studies-Mathematics-Physical-Sciences/dp/354097220X/ref=sr_11_1?\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 3-540-97220-X\n}}</ref>  Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy, who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847, and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849; and Eug\u00e8ne Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy, a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.\n\nThe conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother [[Charles X]]. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross appointments at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], and the {{Interlanguage link multi|Facult\u00e9 des sciences de Paris|fr}}.\n\n===In exile===\nIn July 1830, the [[July Revolution]] occurred in France. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king [[Louis-Philippe]] (of the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]]). Riots, in which uniformed students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris.\n\nThese events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=67|oclc=41497065}}</ref> He spent a short time at [[Fribourg]] in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the [[King of Sardinia]] (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832\u20131833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for [[Prague]], to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux [[Henri d'Artois]] (1820\u20131883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497065|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|year=|isbn=0787638137|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=68|oclc=41497065}}</ref> As a professor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.\n\nDuring his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838.<ref name=\":1\" /> Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to [[baron]], a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.\n\n===Last years===\nCauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838.<ref name=\":1\" /> He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance. However, he desperately wanted to regain a formal position {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} in Parisian science.\n\n[[File:Augustin-Louis Cauchy.jpg|thumb|left|Cauchy prior to 1857]]\nIn August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the [[Bureau des Longitudes]]. This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could \"forget\" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea \u2013 mainly the [[longitude|longitudinal]] coordinate, since [[latitude]] is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.\n\nIn November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to [[celestial mechanics]]. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the [[signed-digit representation]] of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by [[John Colson]]. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the [[\u00c9cole Normale \u00c9ccl\u00e9siastique]], a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the [[Institut Catholique de Paris|Institut Catholique]]. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported [[the Enlightenment]] ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.\n\nThe year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Facult\u00e9 de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name [[Napoleon III]].\n\nNot unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67. He received the [[Last Rites]] and died of a bronchial condition at 4&nbsp;a.m. on May 23, 1857.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHis name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].\n\n==Work==\n\n===Early work===\nThe genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the [[problem of Apollonius]]\u2014describing a [[circle]] touching three given circles\u2014which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] on [[polyhedra]] in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on [[wave]] propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] and discovered many of the basic formulas for [[q-series]]. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Wave theory, mechanics, elasticity===\nIn the theory of light he worked on [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel's]] wave theory and on the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light. <!-- In [[optics]], he developed the wave theory, and his name is associated with the simple dispersion formula. Exactly which formula? --> He also contributed significant research in [[mechanics]], substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introduced<ref>Cauchy, ''De la pression ou tension dans un corps solide'', [On the pressure or tension in a solid body], Exercices de Math\u00e9matiques, vol. '''2''', p. 42 (1827)</ref> a 3 \u00d7 3 symmetric [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of numbers that is now known as the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. In [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], he originated the theory of [[stress (physics)|stress]], and his results are nearly as valuable as those of [[Sim\u00e9on Poisson]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Number theory===\nOther significant contributions include being the first to prove the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].\n\n===Complex functions===\nCauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of [[complex function theory]]. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as ''[[Cauchy's integral theorem]]'', was the following:\n\n:<math>\n \\oint_C f(z)dz = 0,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''f''(''z'') is a complex-valued function [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve ''C'' (contour) lying in the [[complex plane]]. The ''contour integral'' is taken along the contour ''C''. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (then still called \"First Class of the Institute\") on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825.<ref>Cauchy, ''M\u00e9moire sur les int\u00e9grales d\u00e9finies prises entre des limites imaginaires'' [Memorandum on definite integrals taken between imaginary limits], submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on February 28, 1825</ref> The 1825 paper is seen by many{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics.\n\nIn 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a [[residue (mathematics)|residue]] of a function.<ref>Cauchy, ''Sur un nouveau genre de calcul analogue au calcul infinit\u00e9simal'' [On a new type of calculus analogous to the infinitesimal calculus], Exercices de Math\u00e9matique, vol. '''1''', p. 11 (1826)</ref> This concept regards functions that have [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]]s\u2014isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function ''f''(''z'') can be expanded in the [[neighborhood]]  of a singularity ''a'' as\n\n:<math>\nf(z) = \\phi(z) + \\frac{B_1}{z-a} + \\frac{B_2}{(z-a)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{B_n}{(z-a)^n},\\quad\nB_i, z,a \\in \\mathbb{C},\n</math>\n\nwhere \u03c6(''z'') is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then ''f'' is said to have a pole of order ''n'' in the point ''a''. If ''n'' = 1, the pole is called simple.\nThe coefficient ''B''<sub>1</sub> is called by Cauchy the residue of function ''f'' at ''a''. If ''f'' is non-singular at ''a'' then the residue of ''f'' is zero at ''a''. Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to,\n:<math>\n\\underset{z=a}{\\mathrm{Res}} f(z) = \\lim_{z \\rightarrow a} (z-a) f(z),\n</math>\nwhere we replaced ''B''<sub>1</sub> by the modern notation of the residue.\n\nIn 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the first<ref>Cauchy, ''Sur la m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste et sur un nouveau calcul qui s'applique \u00e0 un grande nombre de questions diverses'' [On the celestial mechanics and on a new calculus that can be applied to a great number of diverse questions], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, October 11, 1831.</ref> he proposed the formula now known as [[Cauchy's integral formula]],\n:<math>\nf(a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C \\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz,\n</math>\nwhere ''f''(''z'') is analytic on ''C'' and within the region bounded by the contour ''C'' and the complex number ''a'' is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at ''z'' = ''a''. In the second paper<ref>Cauchy, ''M\u00e9moire sur les rapports qui existent entre le calcul des R\u00e9sidus et le calcul des Limites, et sur les avantages qu'offrent ces deux calculs dans la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations alg\u00e9briques ou transcendantes'' Memorandum on the connections that exist between the residue calculus and the limit calculus, and on the advantages that these two calculi offer in solving algebraic and transcendental equations], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, November 27, 1831.</ref> he presented the [[residue theorem]],\n:<math>\n \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint_C f(z) dz = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\underset{z=a_k}{\\mathrm{Res}} f(z),\n</math>\nwhere the sum is over all the ''n'' poles of ''f''(''z'') on and within the contour ''C''. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with [[Pierre Alphonse Laurent]] being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a substantial contribution (his [[Laurent series]] published in 1843).\n\n===Cours d'Analyse===\n{{Main|Cours d'Analyse}}\n[[Image:Cauchy.jpg|left|thumb|The title page of a textbook by Cauchy.]] In his book ''Cours d'Analyse'' Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. ''Rigor'' in this case meant the rejection of the principle of ''[[Generality of algebra]]'' (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and [[infinitesimal]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Borovik | first1 = Alexandre\n | author1-link = Alexandre Borovik\n | last2 = Katz | first2 = Mikhail G.\n | author2-link = Mikhail Katz\n | arxiv = 1108.2885\n | doi = 10.1007/s10699-011-9235-x \n | issue = 3\n | journal = [[Foundations of Science]]\n | pages = 245\u2013276\n | title = Who gave you the Cauchy--Weierstrass tale?

Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: ''The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.''\n\nM. Barany claims that the \u00c9cole mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement {{harv|Barany|2011}}.  Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to ''Analyse Alg\u00e9brique'' was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus {{harv|Gilain|1989}}. Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.\n\nCauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of \"infinitesimally small quantities\", arguing they lead from everything from the usual \"epsilontic\" definitions or to the notions of [[non-standard analysis]]. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used. {{harv|Barany|2013}}\n\n===Taylor's theorem===\nHe was the first to prove [[Taylor's theorem]] rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He wrote a textbook<ref name=\"Cauchy_1821\">{{cite book|title=Cours d'Analyse de l'Ecole royale polytechnique|title-link=Cours d'Analyse|author-last=Cauchy <!-- | author-link=Augustin-Louis Cauchy-->|author-first=Augustin-Louis|date=1821|publisher=L'Imprimerie Royale, Debure fr\u00e8res, Libraires du Roi et de la [[Biblioth\u00e8que du Roi]]|volume=1|language=French|chapter=Analyse Alg\u00e9brique}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=UrT0KsbDmDwC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11] (reissued by [[Cambridge University Press]], 2009; {{ISBN|978-1-108-00208-0}})</ref> (see the illustration) for his students at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a [[limit of a function|limit]] in the form that is still taught.<!-- which is epsilon delta? --> Also Cauchy's well-known test for [[absolute convergence]] stems from this book: [[Cauchy condensation test]]. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.<ref>Cauchy, Le\u00e7ons sur le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel, Paris (1829)</ref> In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods;<ref>Morris Kline, ''Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty'', {{ISBN|0-19-503085-0}}, p. 176</ref> thus one of his theorems was exposed to a \"counter-example\" by [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]], later fixed by the introduction of the notion of [[uniform continuity]].\n\n===Argument principle, stability===\nIn a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the \"[[Argument principle|Argument Principle]]\" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the [[Cauchy argument principle]] is quite frequently used to derive the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], which can be used to predict the stability of negative [[feedback amplifier]] and negative [[feedback]] control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.\n\n===Output===\n[[File:Cauchy - Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul diff\u00e9rentiel, 1829 - 576181 F.jpg|thumb|''Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul diff\u00e9rentiel'', 1829]]\n\nCauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to [[Leonhard Euler]].

This made his father flee with the family to [[Arcueil]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis Fran\u00e7ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in [[Rouen]] says:<ref>C. A. Valson.

His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for [[Charles Hermite]] during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the [[Great Irish Famine|Potato Famine]].\n\nHis royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed.

Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when [[Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja]] was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by [[Joseph Liouville]] rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned [[Jean Marie Constant Duhamel]] and a claim on inelastic shocks.

It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[autoignition temperature]], which is around 300&nbsp;\u00b0C (570&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>{{cite web|title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714174036/http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>[http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/fuels-ignition-temperatures-d_171.html Fuels and Chemicals&nbsp;\u2013 Auto Ignition Temperatures]</ref>\n\nWhen ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of \"busted\" (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors.

After the capture of Syracuse ''c.'' 212&nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms, constructed by Archimedes and used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:\n\n{{Text and translation|''Hanc sphaeram Gallus cum moveret, fiebat ut soli luna totidem conversionibus in aere illo quot diebus in ipso caelo succederet, ex quo et in caelo sphaera solis fieret eadem illa defectio, et incideret luna tum in eam metam quae esset umbra terrae, cum sol e regione.''|When Gallus moved the globe, it happened that the Moon followed the Sun by as many turns on that bronze contrivance as in the sky itself, from which also in the sky the Sun's globe became to have that same eclipse, and the Moon came then to that position which was its shadow on the Earth, when the Sun was in line.<ref>{{cite web|title = ''De re publica'' 1.xiv \u00a721|author= [[Cicero]]| publisher =thelatinlibrary.com|url = http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/repub1.shtml#21|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title =''De re publica'' Complete e-text in English from Gutenberg.org|author=[[Cicero]]|publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]]|url= http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>}}\n\nThis is a description of a [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]].

Through proof by contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the value of \u03c0. In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'' he did this by drawing a larger [[regular hexagon]] outside a [[circle]] and a smaller regular hexagon inside the circle, and progressively doubling the number of sides of each regular polygon, calculating the length of a side of each polygon at each step. As the number of sides increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. After four such steps, when the polygons had 96 sides each, he was able to determine that the value of \u03c0 lay between 3{{sfrac|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and 3{{sfrac|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416.<ref>{{cite web|title =Archimedes on measuring the circle|author= Heath, T.L.| publisher =math.ubc.ca| url =http://www.math.ubc.ca/~cass/archimedes/circle.html|accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref> He also proved that the [[area]] of a circle was equal to \u03c0 multiplied by the [[square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle (\u03c0r<sup>2</sup>).

This book mentions the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System|solar system]] proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]], as well as contemporary ideas about the size of the Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the [[myriad]], Archimedes concludes that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8{{e|63}} in modern notation. The introductory letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. ''The Sand Reckoner'' or ''Psammites'' is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.<ref>{{cite web|title =English translation of ''The Sand Reckoner'' |publisher = [[University of Waterloo]]| url = http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811235335/http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/reckoner.shtml| archivedate= 11 August 2007| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''\n:This treatise was thought lost until the discovery of the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]] in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses [[Archimedes' use of infinitesimals|infinitesimals]], and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the [[method of exhaustion]] to derive the results. As with ''The Cattle Problem'', ''The Method of Mechanical Theorems'' was written in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes in [[Alexandria]].\n\n===Apocryphal works===\nArchimedes' ''[[Book of Lemmas]]'' or ''Liber Assumptorum'' is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The scholars [[T. L.

In 1906, the Danish professor [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]] visited [[Constantinople]] and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered that it was a [[palimpsest]], a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as [[vellum]] was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes.<ref>{{cite web|title = Reading Between the Lines|author= Miller, Mary K.| publisher= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]|date=March 2007| url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/archimedes.html| accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s.

A connection between mind and body is conventional medical fact, and this classification does not include therapies with proven function such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].\n# \"Biology\"-based practices: Use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances. (Note that as used here, \"biology\" does ''not'' refer to the science of [[biology]], but is a usage newly coined by NCCIH in the primary source used for this article. \"Biology-based\" as coined by NCCIH may refer to chemicals from a nonbiological source, such as use of the poison [[lead]] in traditional Chinese medicine, and to other nonbiological substances.)\n# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in bodywork, chiropractic, and osteopathic manipulation.\n# Energy medicine: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:\n#* [[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that are purported to surround and penetrate the body.

Ludmerer]] noted in 2010: \"Flexner pointed out that the scientific method of thinking applied to medical practice. By scientific method, he meant testing ideas with well-planned experiments to establish accurate facts. The clinician's diagnosis was equivalent to the scientist's hypothesis: both [[medical diagnosis]] and hypothesis required the test of an experiment. Flexner argued that mastery of the scientific method of problem solving was the key for physicians to manage medical uncertainty and to practice in the most cost-effective way.\"<ref name=Ludmerer2010/>}} Typically, their teaching is based on current practice and scientific knowledge about: anatomy, physiology, histology, embryology, neuroanatomy, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology.<ref name=\"Bianco\" /> Medical schools' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication, ethics, the art of medicine,<ref name=\"Stanford_Curriculum\" /> and engaging in complex clinical reasoning (medical decision-making).<ref name=\"Yale_Curriculum\" /> Writing in 2002, Snyderman and Weil remarked that by the early twentieth century the Flexner model had helped to create the 20th-century academic health center, in which education, research, and practice were inseparable. While this had much improved medical practice by defining with increasing certainty the [[pathophysiological]] basis of disease, a single-minded focus on the pathophysiological had diverted much of mainstream American medicine from clinical conditions that were not well understood in mechanistic terms, and were not effectively treated by conventional therapies.<ref name=\"Snyderman2002\" />\n\nBy 2001 some form of CAM training was being offered by at least 75 out of 125 medical schools in the US.<ref name=\"Berman2001\" /> Exceptionally, the School of Medicine of the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore]] includes a research institute for integrative medicine (a member entity of the Cochrane Collaboration).<ref name=\"UM_CAM_Field\" /><ref name=\"UM_CIM\" /> Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees, but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensed [[physicians in the United States|physicians in the US]] who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine (MD).<ref name=\"Medline_MD\" /> All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination|United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)]].<ref name=\"Medline_MD\" />\n\n== Efficacy ==\nThere is a general scientific consensus that alternative therapies lack the requisite [[scientific validation]], and their [[efficacy|effectiveness]] is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].<ref name=\"NSF_2002\" /><ref name=\"ATRAMM\" /><ref name=\"Kent1997\" /><ref name=\"Goldrosen2004\" /> Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial, since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005}} [[Publication bias|Selective publication bias]], marked differences in product quality and standardisation, and some companies making unsubstantiated claims call into question the claims of efficacy of isolated examples where there is evidence for alternative therapies.<ref name=\"Sarris2012\" />\n\n''The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine'' points to confusions in the general population&nbsp;\u2013 a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy just because they are taking something (the placebo effect); the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]) gets misattributed to an alternative medicine being taken; a person not diagnosed with science-based medicine may never originally have had a true illness diagnosed as an alternative disease category.<ref name=\"Alcock1999\" />\n\n[[Edzard Ernst]] characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative<ref name=\"goodbadugly\" /> and in 2011 published his estimate that about 7.4% were based on \"sound evidence\", although he believes that may be an overestimate.<ref name=\"Ernst2011\" /> Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are \"statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments\", but he also believes there is something that conventional doctors can usefully learn from the chiropractors and homeopath: this is the therapeutic value of the placebo effect, one of the strangest phenomena in medicine.<ref name=\"Economist2011\" /><ref name=\"HHH2008\" />\n\nIn 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].<ref name=\"Katz2003\" /> According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically.\n\n{{as of|2005}}, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%), 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.7% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database.{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=135 135\u201336]}}\n\nIn the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.<ref name=\"Bodeker2002\" />\n\nCancer researcher [[Andrew J. Vickers]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many [[alternative cancer treatments]] have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label \"unproven\" is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been \"disproven\".<ref name=\"Vickers\" /></blockquote>\n\n== Mechanism of action ==\n\n=== Placebo effect ===\nA research methods expert and author of ''Snake Oil Science'', [[R.

There was, nevertheless, evidence that both real acupuncture and sham acupuncture were more effective than no treatment, and that acupuncture can be a useful supplement to other forms of conventional therapy for low back pain.<ref name=\"Berman2010\"/></blockquote>}} However, a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56% of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well. Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits.<ref name=\"Kerman2010\" />\n\n[[Integrative medicine]] has been criticized in that its practitioners, trained in science-based medicine, deliberately mislead patients by pretending [[placebo]]s are not. \"[[Quackery#Criticism of quackery in academia|quackademic medicine]]\" is a pejorative term used for ''[[integrative medicine]]'', which medical professionals consider an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]].<ref name=\"Gorski2010\" />\n\nAn analysis of trends in the criticism of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in five prestigious American medical journals during the period of reorganization within medicine (1965\u20131999) was reported as showing that the medical profession had responded to the growth of CAM in three phases, and that in each phase, changes in the medical marketplace had influenced the type of response in the journals.<ref name=\"Winnick2005_2009\" /> Changes included relaxed medical licensing, the development of managed care, rising consumerism, and the establishment of the USA Office of Alternative Medicine (later [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], currently [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]]).{{refn|group=n|According to the medical historian [[James Harvey Young]]:<blockquote>In 1991 the Senate Appropriations Committee responsible for funding the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared itself \"not satisfied that the conventional medical community as symbolized at the NIH has fully explored the potential that exists in unconventional medical practices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Young |first1= J.H. |title= The Development of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health, 1991\u20131996 |doi= 10.1353/bhm.1998.0110 |journal= Bulletin of the History of Medicine |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 279\u201398 |year= 1998 |pmid=  9628052 |pmc= |ref= harv }}</ref></blockquote>}} In the \"condemnation\" phase, from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, authors had ridiculed, exaggerated the risks, and petitioned the state to contain CAM; in the \"reassessment\" phase (mid-1970s through early 1990s), when increased consumer utilization of CAM was prompting concern, authors had pondered whether patient dissatisfaction and shortcomings in conventional care contributed to the trend; in the \"integration\" phase of the 1990s physicians began learning to work around or administer CAM, and the subjugation of CAM to scientific scrutiny had become the primary means of control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Use and regulation==\n\n===Appeal===\n[[File:\"Miracle Cure!\" Health Fraud Scams (8528312890).jpg|thumb|Alternative therapies often make bombastic claims, and frequently include anecdotes from healthy-looking individuals claiming successful treatment.]]\n\nPractitioners of complementary medicine usually discuss and advise patients as to available alternative therapies. Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions.<ref name=\"Sobel2000\"/>\n\nIn addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the placebo effect&nbsp;\u2013 a well-established observation in medicine.<ref name=\"van_Deventer2008\"/>  Related to it are similar psychological effects, such as the will to believe,<ref name=Beyerstein /> [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,<ref name=Beyerstein /> and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.<ref name=Beyerstein />\n\n====Marketing====\n[[File:Edzard ernst.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edzard Ernst]], a leading authority on scientific study of alternative treatments and diagnoses, and the first university professor of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. \"People are told lies.

They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. \"At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.<ref name=\"Con?\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[Paul Offit]] proposed that \"alternative medicine becomes quackery\" in four ways: by recommending against conventional therapies that are helpful, promoting potentially harmful therapies without adequate warning, draining patients' bank accounts, or by promoting \"magical thinking.\"<ref name=Offit2013/>\n\n[[File:Lemon-906141.jpg|thumb|Friendly and colorful images of herbal treatments may look less threatening or dangerous when compared to conventional medicine. This is an intentional marketing strategy.]]\n\n====Social factors====\n\nAuthors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among the minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine. There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /> Related to this are vigorous [[marketing]]<ref name=\"Weber\" /> of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /><ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" />\n\nThere is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.<ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" /> Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.<ref name=\"Barnes2004\" /> Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.<ref name=\"Weber\" />\n\nPatients can be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach. In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.<ref name=\"Beyerstein\" /><ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" />\n\n===Prevalence of use===\n\n'''Complementary and alternative medicine''' (CAM) has been described as a broad domain of healing resources that encompasses all health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and that of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.<ref name=\"Wieland2011\" />{{dubious|date=February 2013}}\n\nAccording to recent research, the increasing popularity of the CAM needs to be explained by moral convictions or lifestyle choices rather than by economic reasoning.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=H\u00e9l\u00e8ne|last2=Debons|first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me|title=CAM and conventional medicine in Switzerland : divided in theory, united in practice.

27 percent in 2005, and 25% in 2004.<ref name=\"Warner2006\" /><ref name=\"AHA2008\" /> More than 70% of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas.<ref name=\"AHA2008\" />\n\nA survey of Americans found that 88 percent thought that \"there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize\".<ref name=\"NSF_2002\" /> Use of magnets was the most common tool in [[energy medicine]] in America, and among users of it, 58 percent described it as at least \"sort of [[scientific method|scientific]]\", when it is not at all scientific.<ref name=\"NSF_2002\" /> In 2002, at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies.<ref name=\"NSF_2002\" /> \"[[Therapeutic touch]]\" was taught at more than 100

of specific therapies====\n\nThe most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45%), [[herbalism]] (19%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing

[[Meditation]], [[Reflexology]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Ayurvedic medicine]], Nutritional medicine, and [[Yoga]].{{sfn|Sir Walton: Science and Technology Committee|2000}} Ayurvedic medicine remedies are

facilities.<ref name=\"Valiathan2006\" /><ref name=\"Saper2008\" />\n\nAccording to the [[National Health Service (England)]], the most commonly used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) supported by the NHS in the UK are: acupuncture, aromatherapy, chiropractic, homeopathy, massage, osteopathy and clinical hypnotherapy.<ref name=\"NHS_Careers_CAM\" />\n\n====In palliative care====\n\nComplementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients. Integrative medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine. \"From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable.\"<ref name=\"Kellhear2003\" /> The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ [[mind-body intervention|mind-body]] interventions designed to \"reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life.\"<ref name=\"Menefee2005\" />\n\n=== Regulation ===\n{{Further|Regulation of alternative medicine | Regulation and prevalence of homeopathy}}{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}[[File:Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products (FDA October 16, 2008).djvu|thumb|Health campaign flyers, as in this example from the [[Food and Drug Administration]], warn the public about unsafe products.]]\n\nIn Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of doctors with [[Medical degree|MDs]],<ref name=ernstinterview/> and half or more of the American alternative practitioners are licensed MDs.<ref name=\"Cassileth1996\"/> In Germany herbs are tightly regulated: half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance.<ref name=\"JAMA_book_review\"/>\n\nSome professions of complementary/traditional/alternative medicine, such as [[chiropractic]], have achieved full regulation in North America and other parts of the world{{sfn|WHO|2005}} and are regulated in a manner similar to that governing science-based medicine. In contrast, other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all. Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country, and state to state.{{sfn|WHO|2005}}\n\nGovernment bodies in the US and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), has issued online warnings for consumers about medication health fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/default.htm|title=Medication Health Fraud|work=fda.gov}}</ref> This includes a section on Alternative Medicine Fraud,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/MedicationHealthFraud/ucm207747.htm|title=Alternative Medicine Fraud|work=fda.gov}}</ref> such as a warning that Ayurvedic products generally have not been approved by the FDA before marketing.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm050798.htm FDA, ''Use Caution With Ayurvedic Products'']</ref>\n\n==Risks and problems==\n\n=== Negative outcomes ===\n{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}\n\n====Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety====\n\nMany of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial. Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects, which can be fatal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Niggemann|first1=B.|last2=Gr\u00fcber|first2=C.|title=Side-effects of complementary and alternative medicine|journal=Allergy|date=22 February 2003|volume=58|issue=8|pages=707\u201316|doi=10.1034/j.1398-9995.2003.00219.x|pmid=12859546}}</ref>\n\nA commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is the way it's regulated. There have been significant developments in how CAMs should be assessed prior to re-sale in the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) in the last 2 years. Despite this, it has been suggested that current regulatory bodies have been ineffective in preventing deception of patients as many companies have re-labelled their drugs to avoid the new laws.<ref name=\"Colquhoun2012\"/>  There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection (from false claims, toxicity, and advertising) with freedom to choose remedies.\n\nAdvocates of CAM suggest that regulation of the industry will adversely affect patients looking for alternative ways to manage their symptoms, even if many of the benefits may represent the placebo affect.<ref name=\"Connelly2012\"/> Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose (such as paracetamol).<ref name=\"Malcolm2012\"/>\n\n====Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals====\n\nForms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, and insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.<ref name=CassilethDeng2004/> An example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor [[Alastair MacLennan (medicine)|Alastair MacLennan]] of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking \"natural\" potions to \"build up her strength\" before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.<ref name=\"Hills1999\"/>\n\nTo ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:\n\n<blockquote>And lastly there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.<ref name=\"SwanABC\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Side-effects====\n\nConventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment&nbsp;\u2013 whether conventional or alternative&nbsp;\u2013 that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., \"That which is natural cannot be harmful.\" Specific groups of patients such as patients with impaired hepatic or renal function are more susceptible to side effects of alternative remedies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Use of herbal remedies among patients undergoing hemodialysis|journal=Iran J Kidney Dis|pmid=24241097|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258636639_Use_of_herbal_remedies_among_patients_undergoing_hemodialysis|volume=7|issue=6|date=Nov 2013|pages=492\u201395|author1=Roozbeh|first1=J|last2=Hashempur|first2=M.

Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in \"several significantly different ways from other drugs.\"<ref name=Stehlin/> Homeopathic preparations, termed \"remedies\", are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but \"their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength\", and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.<ref name=Stehlin/>\n\n=====Treatment delay=====\n\nThose having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.<ref name=\"Navarro2006\"/> For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, \"unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments\" and refers to this as \"[[opportunity cost]]\". Individuals who spend large amounts of time and money on ineffective treatments may be left with precious little of either, and may forfeit the opportunity to obtain treatments that could be more helpful. In short, even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes.<ref name=Lilienfeld2002/> Between 2001 and 2003, four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic, homeopathic, or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies.<ref name=Hughes2010/>\n\n====Unconventional cancer \"cures\"====\n\nThere have always been \"many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as 'unproven,' suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown.\" However, \"many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective....The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'.\"<ref name=Vickers/>\n\n[[Edzard Ernst]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>...any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Why? Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative \"alternative cancer cures\" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.<ref name=Miller>{{Citation |last=Miller |first=Gabriel |date=2 September 2014 |title=Asking the Experts: Complementary and Alternative Medicine and Cancer |work=[[Medscape]] |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/830553_print |accessdate=7 September 2014 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Rejection of science===\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=There is no alternative medicine.

(This was supported by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).)<ref name=\"Cassileth1999\" />\n\nIn March 2009 a staff writer for ''[[the Washington Post]]'' reported that the impending national discussion about broadening access to health care, improving medical practice and saving money was giving a group of scientists an opening to propose shutting down the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. They quoted one of these scientists, [[Steven Salzberg]], a genome researcher and computational biologist at the University of Maryland, as saying \"One of our concerns is that NIH is funding pseudoscience.\"  They noted that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of [[physiology]] and [[disease]], and had shown little or no effect.<ref name=\"Brown2009\" />\n\nWriters such as [[Carl Sagan]], a noted astrophysicist, advocate of [[scientific skepticism]] and the author of ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark]]'' (1996), have lambasted the lack of empirical evidence to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.{{sfn|Sagan|1996}}\n\nSampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated [[fallacy|contradiction]] without thorough reason and experiment.<ref name=\"SampsonAtwood2005\" /> Barrett has pointed out that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.<ref name=\"$2.5 billion\" /> Barrett also expressed concern that, just because some \"alternatives\" have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless, since they are all classified under the one heading of alternative medicine.<ref name=\"Quackwatch_wary\" />\n\nSome critics of alternative medicine are focused upon health fraud, misinformation, and quackery as public health problems, notably [[Wallace Sampson]] and [[Paul Kurtz]] founders of [[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]] and [[Stephen Barrett]], co-founder of [[The National Council Against Health Fraud]] and webmaster of [[Quackwatch]].<ref name=\"NCAHF_mission\" /> Grounds for opposing alternative medicine include that:\n* It is usually based on [[religion]], tradition, [[superstition]], belief in [[supernatural]] energies, [[pseudoscience]], [[fallacy|errors in reasoning]], propaganda, or fraud.<ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" /><ref name=\"NSF_2002\" /><ref name=\"ATRAMM\" /><ref name=\"Other_sources\" />\n* Alternative therapies typically lack any [[scientific validation]], and their effectiveness is either [[Scientific method|unproved]] or [[Scientific evidence|disproved]].<ref name=\"ATRAMM\" /><ref name=\"Kent1997\" /><ref name=\"Goldrosen2004\" />{{dubious|date=January 2013}}\n* Treatments are not part of the conventional, science-based healthcare system.<ref name=\"WHO_Trad_Med_Defs\" /><ref name=\"NCCIH1\" />{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|pp=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=17 17\u201319]}}<ref name=\"Zollman1999\" />\n* Research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed.<ref name=\"NCCIH1\" />{{sfn|IOM Report|2005|p=[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11182&page=146 146]}}\n* Where alternative treatments have replaced conventional science-based medicine, even with the safest alternative medicines, failure to use or delay in using conventional science-based medicine has caused deaths.<ref name=\"Lilienfeld2002\" /><ref name=\"Hughes2010\" />\n* Methods may incorporate or base themselves on [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, ignorance or misunderstanding of scientific principles, errors in reasoning, or newly conceived approaches claiming to heal.<ref name=\"Beyerstein2001\" /><ref name=\"ATRAMM\" /><ref name=\"Acharya2008\" />\n\nMany alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy&nbsp;\u2013 also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.<ref name=\"Ernst2005\" />\n\nEnglish evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]], in his 2003 book ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', defined alternative medicine as a \"set of practices that cannot be tested, refuse to be tested, or consistently fail tests.\"<ref name=\"Dawkins2003\" /> Dawkins argued that if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials then it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine.<ref name=\"Holloway2003\" />\n\nCAM is also often less regulated than conventional medicine.<ref name=\"Ernst_Cohen\" /> There are ethical concerns about whether people who perform CAM have the proper knowledge to treat patients.<ref name=\"Ernst_Cohen\" /> CAM is often done by non-physicians who do not operate with the same medical licensing laws which govern conventional medicine,<ref name=\"Ernst_Cohen\" /> and it is often described as an issue of [[non-maleficence]].<ref name=\"Ernst2\" />\n\nAccording to two writers, Wallace Sampson and K.

They are the semi-regular [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]] composed of [[regular polygon]]s meeting in identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], excluding the 5 [[Platonic solid]]s (which are composed of only one type of polygon) and excluding the prisms and antiprisms. They differ from the [[Johnson solid]]s, whose regular polygonal faces do not meet in identical vertices.\n\n\"Identical vertices\" means that each two vertices are symmetric to each other: A global [[isometry]] of the entire solid takes one vertex to the other while laying the solid directly on its initial position. {{harvs|first=Branko|last=Gr\u00fcnbaum|authorlink=Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum|year=2009|txt}} pointed out a widespread error in the literature on Archimedean solids: some authors give a weaker definition of an Archimedean solid, in which \"identical vertices\" means merely that the faces surrounding each vertex are of the same types (each vertex looks the same from close up), so only a ''local'' isometry is required, but then they omit a 14th polyhedron that meets this weaker definition, [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (or pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron), but not the stronger definition and only list the 13 Archimedean solids. Because of this repeated mistake, Gr\u00fcnbaum suggested that the weaker definition should be used and that the elongated square gyrobicupola should be counted as an Archimedean solid, which would give 14 Archimedean solids. However, most authors, as well as Archimedes himself, do not include it in their lists of Archimedean solids, and to be consistent with this choice, they must use the stronger ''global'' isometry-based definition.\n\n[[Prism (geometry)|Prisms]] and [[antiprism]]s, whose [[symmetry group]]s are the [[dihedral group]]s, are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids, even though their faces are regular polygons and their symmetry groups act transitively on their vertices. Excluding these two infinite families, there are 13 Archimedean solids. All the Archimedean solids (but not the elongated square gyrobicupola) can be made via [[Wythoff construction]]s from the Platonic solids with [[Tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] and [[icosahedral symmetry]].\n\n==Origin of name==\nThe Archimedean solids take their name from [[Archimedes]], who discussed them in a now-lost work. [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] refers to it, stating that Archimedes listed 13 polyhedra.<ref name=\"g09\">{{harvtxt|Gr\u00fcnbaum|2009}}.</ref> During the [[Renaissance]], [[artist]]s and [[mathematician]]s valued ''pure forms'' with high symmetry, and by around 1620 [[Johannes Kepler]] had completed the rediscovery of the 13 polyhedra,<ref>Field J., Rediscovering the Archimedean Polyhedra: Piero della Francesca, Luca Pacioli, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, Daniele Barbaro, and Johannes Kepler, ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'', '''50''', 1997, 227</ref> as well as defining the [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], [[antiprisms]], and the non-convex solids known as [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].\n\nKepler may have also found the elongated square gyrobicupola (pseudorhombicuboctahedron): at least, he once stated that there were 14 Archimedean solids. However, his published enumeration only includes the 13 uniform polyhedra, and the first clear statement of the pseudorhombicuboctahedron's existence was made in 1905, by [[Duncan Sommerville]].<ref name=\"g09\"/>\n\n==Classification==\nThere are 13 Archimedean solids (not counting the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]]; 15 if the [[mirror image]]s of two [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]], the snub cube and snub dodecahedron, are counted separately).\n\nHere the ''vertex configuration'' refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex. For example, a [[vertex configuration]] of (4,6,8) means that a [[square]], [[hexagon]], and [[octagon]] meet at a vertex (with the order taken to be clockwise around the vertex).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Together with the [[bipyramid]]s and [[trapezohedron|trapezohedra]], these are the [[face-uniform]] solids with regular vertices.\n\n=== Chirality ===\n\nThe snub cube and snub dodecahedron are known as ''[[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'', as they come in a left-handed (Latin: levomorph or laevomorph) form and right-handed (Latin: dextromorph) form.{{elucidate|reason=Which is left-handed and which is right-handed?|date=February 2017}} When something comes in multiple forms which are each other's three-dimensional [[mirror image]], these forms may be called enantiomorphs.  (This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain [[chemical compound]]s).\n\n== Construction of Archimedean solids ==\n{{Further information|Uniform polyhedron|Conway polyhedron notation}}\n[[File:Polyhedron truncation example3.png|thumb|The Archimedean solids can be constructed as [[uniform polyhedron#Convex forms by Wythoff construction|generator positions in a kaleidoscope]].]]\nThe different Archimedean and Platonic solids can be related to each other using a handful of general constructions.  Starting with a Platonic solid, [[truncation (geometry)|truncation]] involves cutting away of corners.  To preserve symmetry, the cut is in a plane perpendicular to the line joining a corner to the center of the polyhedron and is the same for all corners.  Depending on how much is truncated (see table below), different Platonic and Archimedean (and other) solids can be created. [[expansion (geometry)|Expansion]] or [[cantellation]] involves moving each face away from the center (by the same distance so as to preserve the symmetry of the Platonic solid) and taking the convex hull.  Expansion with twisting also involves rotating the faces, thus breaking the rectangles corresponding to edges into triangles.  The last construction we use here is truncation of both corners and edges.  Ignoring scaling, expansion can also be viewed as truncation of corners and edges but with a particular ratio between corner and edge truncation.\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Construction of Archimedean Solids\n!colspan=2|Symmetry\n![[Tetrahedral symmetry|Tetrahedral]]<BR>[[File:Tetrahedral reflection domains.png|120px]]\n!colspan=2|[[Octahedral symmetry|Octahedral]]<BR>[[File:Octahedral reflection domains.png|120px]]\n!colspan=2|[[Icosahedral symmetry|Icosahedral]]<BR>[[File:Icosahedral reflection domains.png|120px]]\n|-\n!

Antiprisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s and are a (degenerate) type of [[snub polyhedra]]. \n\nAntiprisms are similar to [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.\n\nIn the case of a regular ''n''-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle {{sfrac|180\u00b0|''n''}}. Extra regularity is obtained when the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes, making it a '''right antiprism'''. As faces, it has the two [[n-gon|''n''-gonal]] bases and, connecting those bases, 2''n'' isosceles triangles.\n\n==Uniform antiprism==\nA '''[[Prismatic uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism''' has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}} we have as degenerate case the regular [[tetrahedron]] as a ''digonal antiprism'', and for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}} the non-degenerate regular [[octahedron]] as a ''triangular antiprism''.\n\nThe [[dual polyhedra]] of the antiprisms are the [[trapezohedra]]. Their existence was discussed and their name was coined by [[Johannes Kepler]], though it is possible that they were previously known to Archimedes as they satisfy the same conditions on vertices as the [[Archimedean solid]]s.\n\n{{UniformAntiprisms}}\n\n=== Schlegel diagrams===\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|[[File:3-cube t2.svg|100px]]<BR>A3\n|[[File:Square antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A4\n|[[File:Pentagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A5\n|[[File:Hexagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A6\n|[[File:Heptagonal antiprism graph.png|100px]]<BR>A7\n|[[File:Octagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A8\n|}\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\n[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a right antiprism with ''n''-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are\n:<math>\\left( \\cos\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, \\sin\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \\right)</math>\n\nwith ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1; if the triangles are equilateral,\n:<math>2h^2=\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}-\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{n}.</math>\n\n==Volume and surface area==\nLet ''a'' be the edge-length of a [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism.

Crossed forms have intersecting [[vertex figure]]s, and are denoted by inverted fractions, ''p''/(''p''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''q'') instead of ''p''/''q'', e.g. 5/3 instead of 5/2.\n\nIn the retrograde forms but not in the prograde forms, the triangles joining the star bases intersect the axis of rotational symmetry.\n\nSome retrograde star antiprisms with regular star polygon bases cannot be constructed with equal edge lengths, so are not uniform polyhedra. Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where ''p'' and ''q'' have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

In the countries bordering the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], there are groves of [[orange (fruit)|orange]] and [[olive]] trees, evergreen [[oak]]s, [[cork oak|cork]] trees and [[pine]]s, intermixed with [[cupressus|cypresses]], [[Myrtus|myrtles]], [[arbutus]] and fragrant [[Erica|tree-heaths]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Africa |volume=1 |page=323 |inline=1 |first1=Edward |last1=Heawood |first2=Frank Richardson |last2=Cana}}</ref>\n\nSouth of the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas]] Range the conditions alter.  The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora, consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness.  Characteristic of the [[Sahara]] is the [[date palm]], which flourishes where other vegetation can scarcely maintain existence, while in the semidesert regions the [[acacia]], from which gum arabic is obtained, is abundant.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe more humid regions have a richer vegetation; dense forest where the rainfall is greatest and variations of temperature least, conditions found chiefly on the tropical coasts, and in the west African equatorial basin with its extension towards the upper [[Nile]]; and [[savanna]] interspersed with trees on the greater part of the plateaus, passing as the desert regions are approached into a scrub vegetation consisting of thorny acacias, etc. Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation. In the coast regions the typical tree is the [[mangrove]], which flourishes wherever the soil is of a [[swamp]] character.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe dense [[forest]]s of West Africa contain, in addition to a great variety of [[hardwood]]s, two [[Arecaceae|palms]], ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'' (oil palm) and ''[[Raphia vinifera]]'' (bamboo palm), not found, generally speaking, in the savanna regions. ''[[Bombax]]'' or silk-cotton trees attain gigantic proportions in the forests, which are the home of the India rubber-producing plants and of many valuable kinds of timber trees, such as odum (''Chlorophora excelsa''), [[ebony]], [[mahogany]] (''Khaya senegalensis''), [[Oldfieldia]] (''Oldfieldia africana'') and [[camwood]] (''Baphia nitida''). The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or \"bush\" is extremely dense.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the savannas the most characteristic trees are the monkey bread tree or baobab (''[[Adansonia digitata]]''), [[Hyphaene thebaica|doum palm]] (''Hyphaene'') and [[euphorbia]]s. The [[coffee]] plant grows wild in such widely separated places as [[Liberia]] and southern [[Ethiopia]]. The higher mountains have a special flora showing close agreement over wide intervals of space, as well as affinities with the mountain flora of the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], the [[Himalaya]] and [[Indo-China]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the swamp regions of north-east Africa [[papyrus]] and associated plants, including the soft-wooded [[ambach]], flourished in immense quantities, and little else is found in the way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of [[kapsia]]s, [[mesembryanthemum]]s, [[aloe]]s and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the [[Podocarpus|Yellow-wood]] (''Podocarpus elongatus''), [[stinkwood]] (''Ocotea''), [[sneezewood]] or [[Cape ebony]] (''Pteroxylon utile'') and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Fauna==\n{{main|Fauna of Africa}}\n[[Image:P l Bleyenberghi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Southwest African lion (''Panthera leo bleyenberghi'').]]\nThe fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation.  The open savannas are the home of large [[ungulate]]s, especially [[antelope]]s, the [[giraffe]] (peculiar to Africa), [[zebra]], [[Cape buffalo|buffalo]], wild [[donkey]] and four species of [[rhinoceros]]; and of carnivores, such as the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[hyena]], etc. The [[okapi]] (a genus restricted to Africa) is found only in the dense forests of the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin. [[Bear]]s are confined to the Atlas region, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[fox]]es to North Africa. The [[elephant]] (though its range has become restricted through the attacks of hunters) is found both in the savannas and forest regions, the latter being otherwise poor in large game, though the special habitat of the [[chimpanzee]] and [[gorilla]]. [[Baboon]]s and [[mandrill]]s, with few exceptions, are peculiar to Africa. The single-humped [[camel]], as a domestic animal, is especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe rivers in the tropical zone abound with [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]] and [[crocodile]]s, the former entirely confined to Africa. The vast herds of game, formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa, have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior. [[Game reserve]]s have, however, been established in [[South Africa]], [[British Central Africa]], [[British East Africa]], [[Somaliland]], etc., while measures for the protection of wild animals were laid down in an international convention signed in May 1900.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[ornithology]] of northern Africa presents a close resemblance to that of southern Europe, scarcely a species being found which does not also occur in the other countries bordering the Mediterranean. Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the [[ostrich]] and the [[secretary-bird]]. The ostrich is widely dispersed, but is found chiefly in the [[desert]] and [[steppe]] regions. The secretary-bird is common in the south.  The [[weaver bird]]s and their allies, including the [[long-tailed whydah]]s, are abundant, as are, among game-birds, the [[francolin]] and [[guineafowl]]. Many of the smaller birds, such as the [[sunbird]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, the [[parrot]]s and [[kingfisher]]s, as well as the larger [[plantain-eater]]s, are noted for the brilliance of their plumage.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nOf [[reptile]]s the [[lizard]] and [[chameleon]] are common, and there are a number of venomous [[snake]]s, though these are not so numerous as in other tropical countries.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe [[scorpion]] is abundant. Of [[insect]]s Africa has many thousand different kinds; of these the [[locust]] is the proverbial scourge of the continent, and the ravages of the [[termite]]s are almost incredible. The spread of [[malaria]] by means of [[mosquito]]es is common. The [[tsetse fly]], whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals, is common in many districts of South and East Africa. It is found nowhere outside Africa.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Africa}}\n*[[Ecology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Africa topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Natural History Of Africa}}\n[[Category:Natural history of Africa| ]]", "sha1": "9mogh545k9g0euttg27i5h6dyx8983p"}}, {"title": "Geography of Africa", "ns": "0", "id": "1854", "revision": {"id": "859173007", "parentid": "858431650", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T06:51:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "John of Reading", "id": "11308236"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:AWB/GF|General]] fixes, removed a comma from the start of a reference", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:LocationAfrica.png|300px|right]]\n\n[[Africa]] is a [[continent]] comprising 63 political territories, representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of [[Earth]]'s surface.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Africa |volume=1 |pages=320\u2013322 |first1=Edward |last1=Heawood |first2=Frank Richardson |last2=Cana}}</ref> Within its regular outline, it comprises an area of {{convert|30368609|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, excluding adjacent islands. Its highest mountain is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], its largest lake is [[Lake Victoria]]\n<ref>kedcfjsuhk</ref>\n\nSeparated from [[Europe]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]<ref name=EB1911/> and from much of [[Asia]] by the [[Red Sea]], Africa is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez<ref name=EB1911/> (which in transected by the [[Suez Canal]]), {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. For [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] purposes, the [[Sinai Peninsula]] of [[Egypt]]&nbsp;\u2013 east on the Suez Canal&nbsp;\u2013 is often considered part of Africa. From the most northerly point, [[Ras ben Sakka]] in [[Tunisia]], at 37\u00b021\u2032 N, to the more southerly point, [[Cape Agulhas]] in [[South Africa]], 34\u00b051\u203215\u2033 S, is a distance approximately of {{convert|8000|km|mi|abbr=on}}; from [[Cap-Vert]], 17\u00b031\u203213\u2033W, the westernmost point, to [[Ras Hafun]] in [[Somalia]], 51\u00b027\u203252\u2033 E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of {{convert|7400|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. [[Africa]] is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, and the southern from north to south.\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Africa (satellite image).jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Africa]]\nThe average elevation of the continent approximates closely to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, roughly near to the mean elevation of both [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], but considerably less than that of [[Asia]], {{convert|950|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}}. In contrast with other continents, it is marked by the comparatively small area of either very high or very low ground, lands under {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} occupying an unusually small part of the surface; while not only are the highest elevations inferior to those of Asia or South America, but the area of land over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on|lk=off}} is also quite insignificant, being represented almost entirely by individual peaks and mountain ranges. Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent, though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges. (So prevalent are these isolated peaks and ridges that a specialised term [''Inselberg-Landschaft'', island mountain landscape] has been adopted in [[Germany]] to describe this kind of country, thought to be in great part the result of wind action.)\n\nAs a general rule, the higher tablelands lie to the east and south, while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable. Apart from the lowlands and the [[Atlas mountains|Atlas mountain]] range, the continent may be divided into two regions of higher and lower plateaus, the dividing line (somewhat concave to the north-west) running from the middle of the [[Red Sea]] to about 6 deg. S. on the west coast.\n\nAfrica can be divided into a number of geographic zones:\n\n*The coastal plains&nbsp;\u2014 often fringed seawards by mangrove swamps&nbsp;\u2014 never stretching far from the coast, apart from the lower courses of streams. Recent alluvial flats are found chiefly in the delta of the more important rivers. Elsewhere, the coastal lowlands merely form the lowest steps of the system of terraces that constitutes the ascent to the inner plateaus.\n*The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas range]]&nbsp;\u2014 orthographically distinct from the rest of the continent, being unconnected with and separated from the south by a depressed and desert area (the [[Sahara]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Plateau region==\n[[File:Topography of africa.png|thumb|Topography of Africa]]\nThe high southern and eastern plateaus, rarely falling below {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, have a mean elevation of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The [[South African Plateau]], as far as about 12\u00b0 S, is bounded east, west and south by bands of high ground which fall steeply to the coasts. On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer. Due south, the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them. The largest of these level areas, the [[Great Karoo]], is a dry, barren region, and a large tract of the plateau proper is of a still more arid character and is known as the [[Kalahari Desert]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe South African Plateau is connected towards [[East African plateau]], with probably a slightly greater average elevation, and marked by some distinct features. It is formed by a widening out of the eastern axis of high ground, which becomes subdivided into a number of zones running north and south and consisting in turn of ranges, tablelands and depressions. The most striking feature is the existence of two great lines of depression, due largely to the subsidence of whole segments of the Earth's crust, the lowest parts of which are occupied by vast lakes. Towards the south the two lines converge and give place to one great valley (occupied by [[Lake Nyasa]]), the southern part of which is less distinctly due to rifting and subsidence than the rest of the system.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFarther north the western hollow, known as the [[Albertine Rift]], is occupied for more than half its length by water, forming the [[Great Lakes (Africa)|Great Lakes]] of [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], [[Lake Kivu|Kivu]], [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]], the first-named over {{convert|400|mi|km}} long and the longest freshwater lake in the world. Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks, the greatest of which occur on a [[meridional line]] east of the eastern trough. The eastern branch of the [[East African Rift]], contains much smaller lakes, many of them [[brackish water|brackish]] and without outlet, the only one comparable to those of the western trough being [[Lake Turkana]] or Basso Norok.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nA short distance east of this rift-valley is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] \u2014 with its two peaks Kibo and Mawenzi, the latter being {{convert|5889|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the culminating point of the whole continent&nbsp;\u2014 and [[Mount Kenya]], which is {{convert|5184|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Hardly less important is the [[Ruwenzori Range]], over {{convert|5060|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which lies east of the western trough. Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys, some of the Kirunga (Mfumbiro) group, north of Lake Kivu, being still partially active.<ref name=EB1911/> This could cause most of the cities and states to be flooded with lava and ash.\n\nThe third division of the higher region of Africa is formed by the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], a rugged mass of mountains forming the largest continuous area of its altitude in the whole continent, little of its surface falling below {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while the summits reach heights of 4400 m to 4550 m. This block of country lies just west of the line of the great East African Trough, the northern continuation of which passes along its eastern escarpment as it runs up to join the Red Sea. There is, however, in the centre a circular basin occupied by [[Lake Tsana]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBoth in the east and west of the continent the bordering highlands are continued as strips of plateau parallel to the coast, the Ethiopian mountains being continued northwards along the Red Sea coast by a series of ridges reaching in places a height of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower. The most mountainous districts lie inland from the head of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Adamawa, etc.), where heights of {{convert|1800|to|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} are reached. Exactly at the head of the gulf the great peak of the Cameroon, on a line of volcanic action continued by the islands to the south-west, has a height of {{convert|4075|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while Clarence Peak, in [[Fernando Po (island)|Fernando Po]], the first of the line of islands, rises to over {{convert|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Towards the extreme west the Futa Jallon highlands form an important diverging point of rivers, but beyond this, as far as the Atlas chain, the elevated rim of the continent is almost wanting.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Plains==\nMuch of Africa is made up of plains of the [[pediplain]] and [[etchplain]] type often occurring as steps.<ref name=Guillocheauetal2017/><ref name=Coltortietal2007>{{cite journal |last1=Coltorti |first1=M. |last2=Dramis |first2=F.|last3=Ollier |first3=C.D.|author-link3=Cliff Ollier |date=2007 |title=Planation surfaces in Northern Ethiopia |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=89 |issue= |pages=287\u2013296 |doi= }}</ref> The etchplains are commonly associated with [[laterite]] soil and [[inselberg]]s.<ref name=Guillocheauetal2017>{{cite journal |last1=Guillocheau |first1=Fran\u00e7ois  |last2=Simon |first2=Brendan|last3=Baby |first3=Guillaume|last4=Bessin |first4=Paul|last5=Robin |first5=C\u00e9cile|last6=Dauteuil |first6=Olivier |date=2017 |title=Planation surfaces as a record of mantle dynamics: The case example of Africa |url= |journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}</ref> [[Inselberg#Geology|Inselberg]]-dotted plains are common in Africa including [[Tanzania]],<ref>[[\u00c5ke Sundborg|Sundborg, \u00c5.]], & [[Anders Rapp|Rapp, A.]] (1986).

The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west, or towards the basin of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nTo the main African rivers belong: Nile (the longest river of Africa), Congo (river with the highest water discharge on the continent) and the Niger, which flows half of its length through the arid areas. The largest lakes are the following: Lake Victoria (Lake Ukerewe), Lake Chad, in the centre of the continent, Lake Tanganyika, lying between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. There is also the considerably large Lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world -Malawi. There are also numerous water dams throughout the continent: Kariba on the river of Zambezi, Asuan in Egypt on the river of Nile and the biggest dam of the continent lying completely in The republic of Ghana is called Akosombo on the Volta river (Fobil 2003).\nThe high lake plateau of the [[African Great Lakes]] region contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the [[Congo River|Congo]].\n\nThe break-up of [[Gondwana]] in [[Late Cretaceous]] and [[Cenozoic]] times led to a major reorganization of the river courses of various large African rivers including the [[Congo River|Congo]], [[Niger River|Niger]], [[Nile]], [[Orange River|Orange]], [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Goudie |first1=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |date=2005 |title=The drainage of Africa since the Cretaceous |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=67 |issue= |pages=437\u2013456 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Flowing to the Mediterranean Sea===\nThe upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighborhood of the equator.<ref name=EB1911/> From there, streams pour eastward into [[Lake Victoria]], the largest lake in Africa (covering over 26,000 square m.), and to the west and north into [[Lake Edward]] and [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]].

From this lake issues the Congo, known in its upper course by various names. Flowing first south, it afterwards turns north through [[Lake Mweru]] and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa. Traversing this in a majestic northward curve, and receiving vast supplies of water from many great tributaries, it finally turns southwest and cuts a way to the Atlantic Ocean through the western highlands.<ref name=EB1911/> The area of the Congo basin is greater than that of any other river except the Amazon, while the African inland drainage area is greater than that of any continent but Asia, where the corresponding area is {{convert|1000000|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nWest of [[Lake Chad]] is the basin of the [[Niger River|Niger]], the third major river of Africa. With its principal source in the far west, it reverses the direction of flow exhibited by the Nile and Congo,<ref name=EB1911/> and ultimately flows into the Atlantic&nbsp;\u2014 a fact that eluded European geographers for many centuries. An important branch, however&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Benue River|Benue]]\u2014flows from the southeast.\n\nThese four river basins occupy the greater part of the lower plateaus of North and West Africa&nbsp;\u2014 the remainder consists of arid regions watered only by intermittent streams that do not reach the sea.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nOf the remaining rivers of the Atlantic basin, the [[Orange River|Orange]], in the extreme south, brings the drainage from the [[Drakensberg]] on the opposite side of the continent, while the Kunene, Kwanza, Ogowe and Sanaga drain the west coastal highlands of the southern limb; the [[Volta River|Volta]], Komoe, Bandama, [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Senegal River|Senegal]] the highlands of the western limb. North of the Senegal, for over {{convert|1500|km|abbr=on}} of coast, the arid region reaches to the Atlantic. Farther north are the streams, with comparatively short courses, reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Flowing to the Indian Ocean===\nOf the rivers flowing to the [[Indian Ocean]], the only one draining any large part of the interior plateaus is the [[Zambezi]], whose western branches rise in the western coastal highlands. The main stream has its rise in 11\u00b021\u20323\u2033 S 24\u00b022\u2032 E, at an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|abbr=on}}. It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward. All the largest tributaries, including the Shire, the outflow of [[Lake Nyasa]], flow down the southern slopes of the band of high ground stretching across the continent from 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 S. In the southwest, the Zambezi system interlaces with that of the [[Taukhe River|Taukhe]] (or Tioghe), from which it at times receives surplus water. The rest of the water of the Taukhe, known in its middle course as the [[Okavango River|Okavango]], is lost in a system of swamps and saltpans that was formerly centred in [[Lake Ngami]], now dried up.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFarther south, the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] drains a portion of the interior plateau, but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source. The [[Rovuma River|Rovuma]], [[Rufiji River|Rufiji]] and [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana]] principally drain the outer slopes of the African Great Lakes highlands.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region to the north, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and the [[Shebelle River|Shebelle]] rivers begin in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba emptying in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Shebelle River reaches a point to the southwest. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain near the Jubba River. Another large stream, the [[Hawash river|Hawash]], rising in the Ethiopian mountains, is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Inland basins===\nBetween the basins of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, there is an area of inland drainage along the centre of the Ethiopian plateau, directed chiefly into the lakes in the [[Great Rift Valley]].<ref name=EB1911/> The largest river is the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo]], which, fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands, carries down a large body of water into [[Lake Rudolf]]. The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths, or by cataracts at no great distance upstream. But when these obstacles have been overcome, the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nNorth of the Congo basin, and separated from it by a broad undulation of the surface, is the basin of [[Lake Chad]] \u2013 a flat-shored, shallow lake filled principally by the [[Chari River|Chari]] coming from the southeast.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Lakes==\nThe principal lakes of Africa are situated in the African Great Lakes plateau. As a rule, the lakes found within the Great Rift Valley have steep sides and are very deep. This is the case with the two largest of the type, Tanganyika and Nyasa, the latter with depths of {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nOthers, however, are shallow, and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season. Such are [[Lake Rukwa]], in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa, and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the Great Rift Valley. Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth, the deepest sounding in [[Lake Victoria]] being under {{convert|90|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nBesides the African Great Lakes, the principal lakes on the continent are: [[Lake Chad]], in the northern inland watershed; [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu]] and [[Lake Mweru|Mweru]], traversed by the head-stream of the Congo; and [[Lake Mai-Ndombe]] and Ntomba (Mantumba), within the great bend of that river. All, except possibly Mweru, are more or less shallow, and Lake Chad appears to be drying up.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nDivergent opinions have been held as to the mode of origin of the African Great Lakes, especially [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]], which some geologists have considered to represent an old arm of the sea, dating from a time when the whole central Congo basin was under water; others holding that the lake water has accumulated in a depression caused by subsidence. The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type. They include jellyfish, molluscs, prawns, crabs, etc.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

(The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point.)<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFarther south, the heat is to some extent modified by the moisture brought from the ocean, and by the greater elevation of a large part of the surface, especially in East Africa, where the range of temperature is wider than in the Congo basin or on the Guinea coast.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn the extreme north and south the climate is a warm temperate one, the northern countries being on the whole hotter and drier than those in the southern zone; the south of the continent being narrower than the north, the influence of the surrounding ocean is more felt.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall. The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding zone of the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation, the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.<ref name=EB1911/>\n[[File:Africa FebAug.gif|thumb|width=220|left|Vegetation in February and August]]\nThe rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of [[Mount Cameroon]], where there is a mean annual rainfall of about {{convert|10000|mm|0|abbr=on}} as compared with a mean of {{convert|11600|mm||0|abbr=on}} at [[Cherrapunji]], in [[Meghalaya]], [[India]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe two distinct rainy seasons of the equatorial zone, where the sun is vertical at half-yearly intervals, become gradually merged into one in the direction of the tropics, where the sun is overhead but once. Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges, and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind, full of fine particles of sand, blowing from the desert towards the sea. Known in [[Egypt]] as the [[khamsin]], on the Mediterranean as the [[sirocco]], it is called on the Guinea coast the [[harmattan]]. This wind is not invariably hot; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result. Similar dry winds blow from the [[Kalahari Desert]] in the south. On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt, and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Health==\nThe [[climate of Africa]] lends itself to certain environmental diseases, the most serious of which are: [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] and [[yellow fever]]. Malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in Africa. It is transmitted by a genus of mosquito ([[anopheles mosquito]]) native to Africa, and can be contracted over and over again. There is not yet a vaccine for malaria, which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa. Recently, the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria.\n\nYellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa. Unlike malaria, it cannot be contracted more than once. Like chicken pox, it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease.<ref name= \"Africa geography\"/>\n\nSleeping sickness, or African trypanosomiasis, is a disease that usually affects animals, but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well. It is transmitted by the [[tsetse fly]] and is found almost exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web| title= Human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)| work= World Health Organization| url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs259/en/| accessdate= May 4, 2012}}</ref> This disease has had a significant impact on African development not because of its deadly nature, like Malaria, but because it has prevented Africans from pursuing agriculture (as the sleeping sickness would kill their livestock).<ref name= \"Africa geography\"/>\n\n==Extreme points==\nThese are the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location on the continent.\n\n:'''Africa'''\n* Northernmost point \u2014 [[Iles des Chiens]], [[Tunisia]] (37\u00b032'N)\n* [[Great capes#Five southernmost capes|Southernmost point]] \u2014 [[Cape Agulhas]], [[South Africa]] (34\u00b051'15\"S)<ref>If the [[Prince Edward Islands]] are included in Africa, then [[Marion Island]] is the southernmost point at 46\u00b054'S.</ref>\n* Westernmost point \u2014 [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]], [[Cape Verde]] Islands (25\u00b025'W)\n* Easternmost point \u2014 [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], [[Mauritius]] (63\u00b030'E)\n* The African [[pole of inaccessibility]] is close to the border of [[Central African Republic]], [[South Sudan]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], near the town of [[Obo]].\n\n:'''Africa (mainland)'''\n[[File:Pointe des Almadies - Senegal.jpg|thumb|250px|Westernmost Point (mainland) \u2014 [[Pointe des Almadies]]]]\n*Northernmost point \u2014 [[Ras ben Sakka]] (Ra's al Abyad) (Cape Blanc), [[Tunisia]]\n*[[Great capes#Five southernmost capes|Southernmost point]] \u2014 [[Cape Agulhas]], [[South Africa]] <!--({{coor dms|34|51|15|S|17|33|22|E|}})-->\n*Westernmost point \u2014 [[Pointe des Almadies]], [[Cap Vert]] Peninsula, [[Ngor, Dakar]], [[Senegal]] (17\u00b033'22\"W)\n*Easternmost point \u2014 [[Ras Hafun]] (Raas Xaafuun), [[Somalia]] (51\u00b027'52\"E)\n\nThe highest point in Africa is [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], {{convert|5891.8|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2009/papers/ts08c/ts08c_fernandes_teamkili2008_3438.pdf|title=Precise Determination of the Orthometric Height of Mt.

Next to each name is a checkbox (or another similar way to mark \"Yes\" or \"No\" for that candidate).\n\nEach candidate may be treated as a separate question: \"Do you approve of this person for the job?\". Approval voting lets each voter indicate support for one, some, or all candidates. All votes count equally, and everyone gets the same number of votes: one vote per candidate, either for or against. Final tallies show how many voters support each candidate, and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support.\n\nBallots on which the voter marked every candidate the same (whether yes or no) usually have no effect on the outcome of the election. Each ballot separates candidates into two groups: those supported and those that are not. Each candidate approved is considered preferred to any candidate not approved, while the voter's preferences among approved candidates is unspecified, and likewise, the voter's preferences among unapproved candidates is also unspecified.\n\nApproval voting can be considered a form of [[range voting]], with the range restricted to two values, 0 and 1\u2014or a form of [[majority judgment]], with grades restricted to ''good'' and ''poor''.

Voters are encouraged to select all the candidates who they consider reasonable choices, with reasonability being determined by the voter. \n\nStrategic Approval voting differs from ranked choice voting methods where voters might ''reverse'' the preference order of two options, which if done on a larger scale causes an unpopular candidate to win. Strategic Approval voting, with more than two options, involves the voter changing their approval threshold. The voter decides which options to give the ''same'' rating, even if they were to have a preference order between them.\n\nApproval voting allows for [[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] and [[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]],  while it is immune to [[Tactical voting#Push-over|Push-Over]] and [[Tactical voting#Burying|Burying]].\n\n[[Tactical voting#Bullet voting|Bullet Voting]] occurs when a voter approves ''only'' candidate 'a' instead of ''both'' 'a' and 'b' for the reason that voting for 'b' can cause 'a' to lose. The voter would be satisfied with either 'a' or 'b' but has a moderate preference for 'a'. Were 'b' to win, this hypothetical voter would still be satisfied.\n\n[[Tactical voting#Compromising|Compromising]] occurs when a voter approves an ''additional'' candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter to prevent an even worse alternative from winning.\n\n\n=== Sincere voting ===\n\nApproval voting experts describe sincere votes as those \"... that directly reflect the true preferences of a voter, i.e., that do not report preferences 'falsely.'\"<ref name=\"sinceredef\">Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, p. 29</ref>  They also give a specific definition of a sincere approval vote in terms of the voter's [[preference|ordinal preferences]] as being any vote that, if it votes for one candidate, it also votes for any more preferred candidate.  This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same, ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote. The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently.  When there are two or more candidates, every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from.  Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates: vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates.  When there are three or more candidates, every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates.\n\n==== Examples ====\n\nBased on the definition above, if there are four candidates, A, B, C, and D, and a voter has a strict preference order, preferring A to B to C to D, then the following are the voter's possible sincere approval votes:\n*vote for A, B, C, and D\n*vote for A, B, and C\n*vote for A and B\n*vote for A\n*vote for no candidates\n\nIf the voter instead equally prefers B and C, while A is still the most preferred candidate and D is the least preferred candidate, then all of the above votes are sincere and the following combination is also a sincere vote:\n*vote for A and C\n\nThe decision between the above ballots is equivalent to deciding an arbitrary \"approval cutoff.\" All candidates preferred to the cutoff are approved, all candidates less preferred are not approved, and any candidates equal to the cutoff may be approved or not arbitrarily.\n\n=== Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences ===\n\nA sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use. [[tactical voting|Voting strategy]] is a way to make that choice, in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting, rather than being an alternative to it.<ref name=probstrat>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1955800 | last = Niemi |first=R.

For a voter with dichotomous preferences, approval voting is [[strategy-proof]] (also known as strategy-free).<ref>Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, p. 31</ref>  When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere, strategy-proof vote, approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner, if one exists.<ref>Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, p. 38</ref>  However, having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical.  It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nHaving dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates.  All of the candidates are divided into two groups such that the voter is indifferent between any two candidates in the same group and any candidate in the top-level group is preferred to any candidate in the bottom-level group.<ref>Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, pp. 16\u201317</ref>  A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates\u2014prefers A to B and B to C\u2014does not have dichotomous preferences.\n\nBeing strategy-proof for a voter means that there is a unique way for the voter to vote that is a strategically best way to vote, regardless of how others vote. In approval voting, the strategy-proof vote, if it exists, is a sincere vote.<ref name=\"sinceredef\"/>\n\n==== Approval threshold ====\n\nAnother way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold.  An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets, those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of.  A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate.  Acceptance thresholds are similar.  With such a threshold, a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold.<ref name=probstrat/>\n\nWith threshold voting, it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist.  However, according to Steven Brams, this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting.  Without providing specifics, he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the [[Condorcet criterion]] and other social choice criteria.<ref name=critstrats>{{Cite journal |last1=Brams |first1=S.

On the one hand, approval voting fails the [[later-no-harm criterion]], so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more preferred candidate.  On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the [[monotonicity criterion]], so not voting for a candidate can never help that candidate win, but can cause that candidate to lose to a less preferred candidate.  Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner.  A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility theorem]], and the probabilities of how others vote.\n\nA [[Tactical voting#Myerson-Weber strategy|rational voter model]] described by [[Roger Myerson|Myerson]] and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2938959 |first1=Myerson |last1=R.  |first2=Weber |last2=R. J. | year = 1993 | title = A theory of Voting Equilibria | jstor = 2938959| journal = American Political Science Review | volume = 87 | issue = 1| pages = 102\u2013114 |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/782.pdf }}</ref>  This strategy is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the voter's [[Utility#Expected utility|expected utility]], subject to the constraints of the model and provided the number of other voters is sufficiently large.\n\nAn optimal approval vote always votes for the most preferred candidate and not for the least preferred candidate.  However, an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more.<ref>Smith, Warren [http://scorevoting.net/WarrenSmithPages/homepage/newgibbsat.pdf Completion of Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorem; range voting and voter honesty]. Actually, there are no known examples of such situations for under 6 candidates, and definitely none for 3 candidates; the situation for 4 or 5 candidates is unknown.</ref>\n\nOther strategies are also available and coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations.  For example:\n* Vote for the candidates that have above average utility.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if the voter thinks that all pairwise ties are equally likely<ref>Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, p. 85</ref>\n* Vote for any candidate that is more preferred than the expected winner and also vote for the expected winner if the expected winner is more preferred than the expected runner-up.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy if there are three or fewer candidates or if the pivot probability for a tie between the expected winner and expected runner-up is sufficiently large compared to the other pivot probabilities.\n*Vote for the most preferred candidate only.  This strategy coincides with the optimal strategy when there is only one candidate with a positive prospective rating.\n\nAnother strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates, the candidates that have an above-median utility. When the voter thinks that others are balancing their votes randomly and evenly, the strategy maximizes the voter's power or efficacy, meaning that it maximizes the probability that the voter will make a difference in deciding which candidate wins.<ref>Brams, Steven and Fishburn, Peter (1983). ''Approval Voting'', Boston: Birkh\u00e4user, p. 74, 81</ref>\n\nOptimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a [[Condorcet loser criterion|Condorcet loser]].  Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances.  For example, if all voters are rational and cast a strategically optimal vote based on a common knowledge of how all the other voters vote except for small-probability, statistically independent errors in recording the votes, then the winner will be the Condorcet winner, if one exists.<ref>Laslier, J.-F. (2006) [http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/12/17/51/PDF/stratapproval4.pdf \"Strategic approval voting in a large electorate,\"] ''IDEP Working Papers'' No. 405 (Marseille, France: Institut D'Economie Publique)</ref>\n\n=== Strategy examples ===\n\nIn the example election described [[Condorcet method#An example|here]], assume that the voters in each faction share the following von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utilities, fitted to the interval between 0 and 100.  The utilities are consistent with the rankings given earlier and reflect a strong preference each faction has for choosing its city, compared to weaker preferences for other factors such as the distance to the other cities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Voter utilities for each candidate city\n! &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidates !! &nbsp;\n|-\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Fraction of Voters<br /><small>(living close to)</small>\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Memphis\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Nashville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Chattanooga\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Knoxville\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Average\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fdd; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Memphis (42%)\n| 100 || 15 || 10 || 0 || 31.25\n|- style=\"xbackground:#cfc; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nashville (26%)\n| 0 || 100 || 20 || 15 || 33.75\n|- style=\"xbackground:#ddf; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Chattanooga (15%)\n| 0 || 15 || 100 || 35 || 37.5\n|- style=\"xbackground:#fed; text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Knoxville (17%)\n| 0 || 15 || 40 || 100 || 38.75\n|}\n\nUsing these utilities, voters choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties.  In each of the scenarios summarized below, all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Approval voting results <br /> for scenarios using optimal strategic voting\n! colspan=\"3\" | &nbsp; !! colspan=\"4\" | Candidate vote totals\n|-\n! xwidth=25% | Strategy scenario\n! xwidth=15% | Winner\n! xwidth=15% | Runner-up\n! xwidth=15% | Memphis\n! xwidth=15% | Nashville\n! xwidth=15% | Chattanooga\n! xwidth=15% | Knoxville\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Zero-info\n| Memphis || Chattanooga || 42 || 26 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Memphis leading Chattanooga\n| colspan=\"2\" | Three-way tie || 42 || 58 || 58 || 58\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Knoxville\n| Chattanooga || Nashville || 42 || 68 || 83 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Chattanooga leading Nashville\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 68 || 32 || 17\n|- style=\"text-align: center\"\n| style=\"text-align: left\" | Nashville leading Memphis\n| Nashville || Memphis || 42 || 58 || 32 || 32\n|}\n\nIn the first scenario, voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely.  As a result, they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility.  Most voters vote for only their first choice.  Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice, Chattanooga.  As a result, the winner is Memphis, the Condorcet loser, with Chattanooga coming in second place.\n\nIn the second scenario, all of the voters expect that Memphis is the likely winner, that Chattanooga is the likely runner-up, and that the pivot probability for a Memphis-Chattanooga tie is much larger than the pivot probabilities of any other pair-wise ties.  As a result, each voter votes for any candidate they prefer more than the leading candidate, and also vote for the leading candidate if they prefer that candidate more than the expected runner-up. Each remaining scenario follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies.\n\nIn the second scenario, there is a three-way tie for first place.  This happens because the expected winner, Memphis, was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first.\n\nOnly in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up.  As a result, this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario. In the language of [[game theory]], this is an \"equilibrium.\"  In this scenario, the winner is also the Condorcet winner.\n\n===Dichotomous cutoff===\n\nAs this voting method is cardinal rather than ordinal, it is possible to model voters in a way that does not simplify to an ordinal method. Modelling voters with a 'dichotomous cutoff' assumes a voter has an immovable approval cutoff, while having meaningful cardinal preferences. This means that rather than voting for their top 3 candidates, or all candidates above the average approval (which may result in their vote changing if one candidate drops out, resulting in a system that does not satisfy IIA), they instead vote for all candidates above a certain approval 'cutoff' that they have decided. This cutoff does not change, regardless of which and how many candidates are running, so when all available alternatives are either above or below the cutoff, the voter votes for all or none of the candidates, despite preferring some over others.  While this extreme appears unrealistic, it actually reflects reality in the way that many voters become disenfranchised and apathetic if they see no candidates they approve of. In this way, there is evidence to suggest that many voters may have an internal cutoff, and would not simply vote for their top 3, or the above average candidates, although that is not to say that it is necessarily entirely immovable.\n\nFor example, - in this scenario, voters are voting for candidates with approval above 50% (bold signifies that the voters voted for the candidate):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|-\n!

On the other hand, if voters' threshold for receiving a vote is fixed (say 50%), this is a dichotomous cutoff, and satisfies IIA as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:600px;\"\n|+ A drops out, candidates voting for above average approval\n!

In this case, approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff (see examples above). Depending on how this decision is made, approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria.\n\nThere is no ultimate authority on which criteria should be considered, but the following are criteria that many voting theorists accept and consider desirable:\n* [[Unrestricted domain]]\u2014A voter may have any preference ordering among the alternatives.\n* [[Non-dictatorship]]\u2014There does not exist a single voter whose preference for the alternatives always determines the outcome regardless of other voters' preferences.\n* [[Pareto efficiency]]\u2014If every voter prefers candidate A to all other candidates, then A must be elected. (from [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]])\n* [[Majority criterion]]\u2014If there exists a majority that ranks (or rates) a single candidate higher than all other candidates, does that candidate always win?\n* [[Monotonicity criterion]]\u2014Is it impossible to cause a winning candidate to lose by ranking that candidate higher, or to cause a losing candidate to win by ranking that candidate lower?\n* [[Consistency criterion]]\u2014If the electorate is divided in two and a choice wins in both parts, does it always win overall?\n* [[Participation criterion]]\u2014Is voting honestly always better than not voting at all? (This is grouped with the distinct but similar Consistency Criterion in the table below.<ref>Consistency implies participation, but not vice versa. For example, Score Voting complies with participation and consistency, but median ratings satisfies participation and fails consistency.</ref>)\n* [[Condorcet criterion]]\u2014If a candidate beats every other candidate in [[Condorcet method|pairwise comparison]], does that candidate always win? (This implies the majority criterion, above)\n* [[Condorcet loser criterion]]\u2014If a candidate loses to every other candidate in pairwise comparison, does that candidate always lose?\n* [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]\u2014Is the outcome the same after adding or removing non-winning candidates?\n* [[Independence of clones criterion]]\u2014Is the outcome the same if candidates identical to existing candidates are added?\n* [[Reversal symmetry]]\u2014If individual preferences of each voter are inverted, does the original winner never win?\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | !!

Plurality voting can lead to voters abandoning their first choice in order to help a \"lesser of evils\" to win.\n* However, approval voting forces voters to face an initial voting tactical decision as to whether to vote for (or ''approve'') of their second-choice candidate or not. The voter may want to retain expression of preference of their favorite candidate over their second choice.  But that does not allow the same voter to express preference of their second choice over any other.\n* Approval ballots can be counted by existing machines designed for plurality elections, as ballots are cast, so that final tallies are immediately available after the election, without any upgrades to equipment. Approval counting can be completed at the local level and conveniently summed at the regional or national level.\n* If voters are sincere, approval voting would elect centrists at least as often as moderates of each extreme. If backers of relatively extreme candidates are insincere and \"bullet vote\" for that first choice, they can help that candidate defeat a compromise candidate who would have won if every voter had cast sincere preferences.\n* If voters are sincere, candidates trying to win an approval voting election might need as much as 100% approval to beat a strong competitor, and would have to find solutions that are fair to everyone to do so. However, a candidate may win a [[plurality voting system|plurality]] race by promising many perks to a simple majority or even a plurality of voters at the expense of the smaller voting groups.\n* Approval voting fails the majority criterion, because a candidate who is preferred by a majority of voters is not always elected. In some cases approval voting will elect a candidate that has greater overall utility than a candidate preferred by a mere majority, if the majority also approves a compromise candidate that includes representation of the minority. In other cases, with elections having three or more candidates, approval voting will fail to elect the candidate with greater overall utility also preferred by a majority, if a less moderate candidate within the majority view gains enough approvals from the majority to win, while core supporters of the less moderate candidate are more selective (i.e. vote only for the extreme candidate), leaving a third sizable minority unrepresented.\n* Suppose a candidate is eliminated (say, for medical reasons) between a primary election and the party convention. With plurality voting, voters who supported the eliminated candidate lose their franchise. Approval voting affords representation to voters by counting their approvals among remaining candidates.\n* Approval voting without write-ins is easily reversed as [[disapproval voting]] where a choice is disavowed, as is already required in other measures in politics (e.g., representative [[recall election|recall]]).\n* Unlike plurality voting, approval voting allows voters to block a candidate by voting for several alternatives instead of just one, increasing the probability an alternative wins.\n* In contentious elections with large groups of organized voters who prefer their favorite candidate vastly over all others, approval voting may revert to [[plurality voting]]. Some voters support only their single favored candidate when they perceive the other candidates more as competitors to their preferred candidate than as compromise choices. Score voting and [[Majority Judgment]] allow these voters to give intermediate approval ratings, but at the cost of added ballot complexity and longer ballot counts.\n\n== Multiple winners ==\n\nApproval voting can be extended to multiple winner elections.  A simple way to do so is as ''block approval voting,'' a simple variant on [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] where each voter can select an unlimited number of candidates and the candidates with the most approval votes win.  This does not provide [[proportional representation]] and is subject to the [[Burr dilemma]], among other problems{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.\n\nOther ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised. Among these are [[satisfaction approval voting]] and [[proportional approval voting]]<ref>{{cite web|citeseerx=10.1.1.74.3284|title=Technologies for political representation and accountability|first=Enric|last=Plaza|accessdate=2011-06-17|url=http://www.iiia.csic.es/~enric/papers/egov.pdf}}</ref> for determining a proportional assembly, and minimax approval<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/1329125.1329365|url=http://pages.cs.aueb.gr/~markakis/research/aamas07-minmax.pdf|first1=Rob|last1=LeGrand|first2=Evangelos|last2=Markakis|first3=Aranyak|last3=Mehta|accessdate=2011-06-17|title=Some Results on Approximating the Minimax Solution in Approval Voting}}</ref> for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most.\n\n== Ballot types ==\n\nApproval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms. The simplest form is a blank ballot on which voters hand-write the names of the candidates they support. A more structured ballot lists all candidates, and voters mark each candidate they support. A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and provide two choices by each. (Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well.)\n{| BORDER\n|-\n| [[File:Approvalballotname.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotword.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotmark.png|160px]]\n| [[File:Approvalballotchoice.png|160px]]\n|}\n\nAll four ballots are theoretically equivalent. The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices. The Yes/No format can help to detect an \"undervote\" when a candidate is left unmarked and allow the voter a second chance to confirm the ballot markings are correct. The \"single bubble\" format is incapable of producing invalid ballots (which might otherwise be rejected in counting).\n\nUnless the second or fourth format is used, fraudulently adding votes to an approval voting ballot does not invalidate the ballot (that is, it does not make it appear inconsistent). Thus, approval voting raises the importance of ensuring that the \"chain of custody\" of ballots is secure.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Politics}}\n* [[Borda count]]\n* [[Bucklin voting]]\n* [[Condorcet method]]\n* [[First Past the Post]] (also called Single-Member Plurality or Relative Majority)\n* [[Instant-runoff voting]]\n* [[Score Voting]]\n* [[Schulze method]]\n* [[Sequential proportional approval voting]]\n* [[Voting system]] - many other ways of voting\n\n== Notes ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as '''Tempe Normal School of Arizona''' (1889\u20131903), '''Tempe Normal School ''' (1903\u20131925), '''Tempe State Teachers College''' (1925\u20131929), '''Arizona State Teachers College''' (1929\u20131945), '''Arizona State College''' (1945\u20131958) and, by a 2\u20131 margin of the state's voters, '''Arizona State University''' in 1958.\n\nIn 1923, the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925, the school became the '''Tempe State Teachers College''' and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the [[9th Arizona State Legislature]] authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the '''Arizona State Teachers College'''.<ref name=TNS>{{cite web |url=http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/tnsrec.xml |title= Tempe Normal School Records, 1885\u20131930 MSS-149 |year=2014 |publisher=Arizona Archives Online |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Academicprograms\">{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/acpro.htm |title= The New ASU Story: Academic Programs |year=2001 |publisher= Arizona State University |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref> Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900\u20131930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an \"evergreen campus,\" with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of 110 Mexican Fan Palms on what is now known as [[Palm Walk]], a century-old landmark of the Tempe campus.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], [[Ralph Waldo Swetman]] was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to Arizona State Teachers College in 1930 from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. He served a three-year term, during which he focused on improving teacher-training programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm|title=Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University - ASU Library|website=Asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Landmarks |website=Asu.edu |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> Matthews also conceived of a self-supported summer session at the school at Arizona State Teachers College, a first for the school.\n\n===1930\u20131989===\n[[File:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]\n\nIn 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of [[Northern Arizona University|Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff]], became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years, second only to Swetman's 30 years at the college's helm. Like President Arthur John Matthews before him, Gammage oversaw the construction of several buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university's graduate programs; the first Master of Arts in Education was awarded in 1938, the first Doctor of Education degree in 1954 and 10 non-teaching master's degrees were approved by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] in 1956. During his presidency, the school's name was changed to '''Arizona State College''' in 1945, and finally to '''Arizona State University''' in 1958. At the time, two other names were considered: '''Tempe University''' and '''State University at Tempe'''.<ref name=\"ASU50th\">{{cite web|title=ASU's 50th Anniversary|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asus-50th-anniversary|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Among Gammage's greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed construction of what is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage. One of the university's hallmark buildings, [[ASU Gammage]] was completed in 1964, five years after the president's (and Wright's) death.\n\nGammage was succeeded by [[Harold D. Richardson]], who had served the school earlier in a variety of roles beginning in 1939, including director of graduate studies, college registrar, dean of instruction, dean of the College of Education and academic vice president. Although filling the role of acting president of the university for just nine months (Dec. 1959 to Sept. 1960), Richardson laid the groundwork for the future recruitment and appointment of well-credentialed research science faculty.\n\nBy the 1960s, under [[G. Homer Durham]], the university's 11th president, ASU began to expand its curriculum by establishing several new colleges and, in 1961, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized doctoral degree programs in six fields, including Doctor of Philosophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Leadership|website=Asu.edu |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.\n\nThe next three presidents \u2014 Harry K.

Increased commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500&nbsp;million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of [[Barrett, The Honors College]], and the [[Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts]]; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Leadership|website=Asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] on Tempe campus]]\n\nIn 2002, [[Michael M.

After watching a video of the speech, a plagiarism analyst said he could pretty much read along from a newspaper article as Whitaker spoke. To the intense consternation of ASU faculty members (the chairman of the tenure committee resigned in protest) an investigating committee concluded there was no pattern of deceit and the copying had been inadvertent. It all popped up again in 2014 with another Whitaker book, \"Peace Be Still: Modern Black America From World War II to Barack Obama.\" A blogger writing under an apparent pseudonym set out side-by-side excerpts from Whitaker's book and material available on the Web at sites like infoplease.com and the Archive of American Television. They are more than just similar in tone. Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department. Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide \"cultural-consciousness training\" to Phoenix police. The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far. He was placed on administrative leave on September 17, 2015, while the university investigated allegations that \"his behavior has fallen short of expectations as a faculty member and a scholar.\"<ref name=PlacedonLeave>{{cite news|last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=Controversial ASU professor Whitaker placed on leave |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2015/09/17/asu-professor-whitaker-placed-leave/32541923/|accessdate=September 30, 2015|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=September 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lawsuits by AZ Attorneys General===\nThe [[Arizona Attorney General]], [[Mark Brnovich]] filed a lawsuit in late 2017 against ABOR due to tuition practices and DACA.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona Attorney General lawsuit against ABOR persists|first1=Andrew|last1=Nicla|first2=Tina|last2=Giuliano |date=March 29, 2018|url= http://www.statepress.com/article/2018/03/sppolitics-attorney-generals-lawsuit-against-abor-continues |accessdate=July 10, 2018|publisher=The State Press}}</ref>.

''Alfred Jarry, a Pataphysical Life''. MIT Press (2013). {{ISBN|978 0 262 01619 3}}</ref> He was associated with the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. His play ''Ubu Roi'' is often cited as a forerunner of [[Dada]], and to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] and [[Futurism|Futurist]] movements of the 1920s and 1930. Jarry wrote in a variety of hybrid genres and styles, prefiguring the [[Post-modern literature|postmodern]]. He wrote plays, novels, poetry, essays and speculative journalism. His texts are considered examples of [[absurdist literature]] and [[Post-modern philosophy|postmodern philosophy]].\n\n==Biography and works==\n[[File:Alfred Jarry, Deux aspects de la marionnette originale d'Ubu Roi.jpg|thumb|Alfred Jarry, ''Deux aspects de la marionnette original d'Ubu Roi'', premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre on 10 December 1896]]\n\nAlfred Jarry's father Anselme Jarry (1837-1895) was a salesman who descended into alcoholism; his mother Caroline, n\u00e9e Quernest (1842-1893), was interested in music and literature, but her family had a streak of insanity, and her mother and brother were institutionalized. The couple had two surviving children, a daughter Caroline-Marie, called Charlotte (1865-1925), and Alfred. In 1879 Caroline left Anselme and took the children to Saint-Brieuc in Brittany.<ref>Lennon, Nigey. ''Alfred Jarry: The Man with the Axe''. San Francisco: Last Gasp, 1984, pp. 16-18. {{ISBN|0-86719-382-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888 they moved to [[Rennes]], where Jarry entered the lyc\u00e9e at 15. There he led a group of boys who enjoyed poking fun at their well-meaning, but obese and incompetent physics teacher, a man named H\u00e9bert. Jarry and his classmate, Henri Morin, wrote a play they called ''Les Polonais'' and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends. The main character, ''P\u00e8re Heb'', was a blunderer with a huge belly, three teeth (one of stone, one of iron and one of wood), a single, retractable ear and a misshapen body. In Jarry's later work ''Ubu Roi'', P\u00e8re Heb would develop into Ubu, one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature.\n\nAt 17 Jarry passed his [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] and moved to Paris to prepare for admission to the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. Though he was not admitted, he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems. A collection of his work, ''Les minutes de sable m\u00e9morial'', was published in 1893.\n\nThat same year, Jarry contracted influenza. His mother and sister tended him, but once he recovered his mother fell ill of the disease and died; two years later his father perished from influenza as well, leaving Jarry a small inheritance which he quickly spent.<ref>Lennon, Nigey. ''Alfred Jarry: The Man with the Axe'', pp. 34, 61.</ref>\n\nJarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol, which he called \"my sacred herb\" or, when referring to [[absinthe]], the \"green goddess.\" A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour (and possibly under its influence).\n\nWhen he was drafted into the army in 1894, his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline. The sight of the small man in a uniform much too large for his less than 5-foot frame\u2014the army did not issue uniforms small enough\u2014was so disruptively funny that he was excused from parades and marching drills. Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons. His military experience eventually inspired his novel ''Days and Nights''.\n\n[[File:V\u00e9ritable portrait de Monsieur Ubu.png|thumb|left|P\u00e8re Ubu (later: Ubu Roi), from a woodcut by Alfred Jarry]]\nJarry returned to Paris and applied himself to writing, drinking and the company of friends who appreciated his witty, sweet-tempered and unpredictable conversation. This period is marked by his intense involvement with [[Remy de Gourmont]] in the publication of ''[[L'Ymagier]] ,'' a luxuriously produced \"art\" magazine devoted to the symbolic analysis of medieval and popular prints. [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] as an art movement was in full swing at this time, and ''L'Ymagier'' provided a nexus for many of its key contributors. Jarry's play ''[[Caesar Antichrist]]'' (1895) drew on this movement for material. This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated. Using the biblical [[Book of Revelation]] as a point of departure, ''Caesar Antichrist'' presents a parallel world of extreme formal symbolism in which Christ is resurrected not as an agent of [[spirituality]] but as an agent of the [[Roman Empire]] that seeks to dominate spirituality. It is a unique narrative that effectively links the domination of the soul to contemporaneous advances in the field of [[Egyptology]] such as the 1894 excavation of the [[Narmer Palette]], an ancient artifact used for situating the [[rebus]] within [[hermeneutics]].

Vallette hosted a presentation of ''Ubu Roi'' in Vallette's home in 1894.]]\n\nThe spring of 1896 saw the publication, in Paul Fort's review ''Le Livre d'art'', of Jarry's 5-act play ''[[Ubu Roi]],'' the rewritten and expanded ''Les Polonais'' of his school days. ''Ubu Roi''{{'}}s savage humor and monstrous absurdity, unlike anything thus far performed in French theater, seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage. However, impetuous theater director Aur\u00e9lien-Marie Lugn\u00e9-Poe took the risk, producing the play at his Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre.\n\nOn opening night (10 December 1896), with traditionalists and the [[avant-garde]] in the audience, King Ubu (played by Firmin G\u00e9mier) stepped forward and intoned the opening word, \"Merdre!\" (often translated as \"Pshit\" or \"Shittr!\" in English). A quarter of an hour of pandemonium ensued: outraged cries, booing, and whistling by the offended parties, countered by cheers and applause by the more degenerate contingent. Such interruptions continued through the evening. At the time, only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held, and the play was not revived until after Jarry's death.\n\nThe play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry, and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created. G\u00e9mier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry's own staccato, nasal vocal delivery, which emphasized each syllable (even the silent ones). From then on, Jarry would always speak in this style. He adopted Ubu's ridiculous and pedantic figures of speech; for example, he referred to himself using the [[royal we|royal ''we'']], and called the wind \"that which blows\" and the bicycle he rode everywhere \"that which rolls.\"\n\nJarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition. The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place, but guests had to bend or crouch. Jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver. In response to a neighbor's complaint that his target shooting endangered her children, he replied, \"If that should ever happen, ma-da-me, we should ourselves be happy to get new ones with you.\"\n\n[[File:Jarry velo.jpg|thumb|250px|Jarry in [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]] in 1898 on his ''cycle Cl\u00e9ment''.]]\n\nWith [[Franc-Nohain]] and [[Claude Terrasse]] he co-founded the [[Th\u00e9atre des Pantins]], which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of ''Ubu Roi''.<ref>[https://www.schubertiademusic.com/details/multiple_catalogs:yes/desc:Bonnard,+Pierre.+(1867+-+1947)%3B+Terrasse,+Claude.+(1867+-+1923)%3B+Jarry,+Alfred.+(1873+-+1907) PADA, Schubertiade Music Online]</ref>\n\nLiving in worsening poverty, neglecting his health and drinking excessively, Jarry went on to write the novel ''Le Surm\u00e2le'' (''[[Supermale (novel)|The Supermale]]''), which is partly a satire on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] ideal of self-transcendence.\n\nUnpublished until after his death, his fiction ''[[Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician]]'' (''Gestes et opinions du docteur Faustroll, pataphysicien'') describes the exploits and teachings of a sort of antiphilosopher who, born at age 63, travels through a hallucinatory Paris in a sieve and subscribes to the tenets of ''[['pataphysics]]''. 'Pataphysics deals with \"the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.\"  In 'pataphysics, every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event.\n\nJarry once wrote, expressing some of the bizarre logic of 'pataphysics, \"If you let a coin fall and it falls, the next time it is just by an infinite coincidence that it will fall again the same way; hundreds of other coins on other hands will follow this pattern in an infinitely unimaginable fashion.\"\n\nIn his final years, he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris. [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Andr\u00e9 Salmon]] and [[Max Jacob]] sought him out in his truncated apartment. [[Pablo Picasso]] was fascinated with Jarry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/08/pablo-picasso-trivia_n_7018574.html|title=5 Things You Didn't Know About Pablo Picasso|date=2015-04-08|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> After Jarry's death Picasso acquired his revolver and wore it on his nocturnal expeditions in Paris.

When he could not afford alcohol, he drank ether.<ref>http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2012/05/10/alfred-jarry-king-charisma/</ref> It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick.

{{lang-fr|Amaury}}; 1136{{snd}}11 July 1174) was [[King of Jerusalem]] from 1163, and [[Count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] before his accession. He was the second son of [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]] and [[Fulk of Jerusalem]], and succeeded his older brother [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]]. During his reign, Jerusalem became more closely allied with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the two states launched an unsuccessful [[Crusader invasions of Egypt|invasion of Egypt]]. Meanwhile, the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] and later [[Saladin]]. He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem, [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], and [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]].\n\nOlder scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers, making Amalric to be '''Amalric I''' (1163\u201374) and King [[Aimery of Jerusalem|Aimery]] (1197\u20131205) to be \"Amalric II\". Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king. Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.<ref>[[George Francis Hill]], ''A History of Cyprus'', vol. 2 (Cambridge University Press, 2010 [1947]), p. 45 n. 1.</ref>\n\n==Youth==\nAmalric was born in 1136 to King Fulk, the former [[count of Anjou]] who had married the heiress of the kingdom, Melisende, daughter of King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]]. After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143, the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalric's older brother [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem|Baldwin III]], who was still only 13 years old. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later, and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining [[Jerusalem]] while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the [[County of Jaffa]] as an [[apanage]] when he reached the age of majority in 1151, remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the [[Tower of David]] with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In 1153 Baldwin captured the [[Egypt]]ian fortress of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see [[Battle of Ascalon (1153)|Battle of Ascalon]]).\n\nAmalric married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] in 1157. Agnes, daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader [[County of Edessa]] were lost in 1150. [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Patriarch Fulcher]] objected to the marriage on grounds of [[consanguinity]], as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, [[Guy I of Montlh\u00e9ry]], and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric three children: [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the future [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] (both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right), and Alix, who died in childhood.\n\n==Succession==\nBaldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the ''[[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]]'' refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=299}} The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler [[William of Tyre]], whom she prevented from becoming [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]] decades later, as well as from William's continuators like [[Ernoul]], who hints at a slight on her moral character: \"car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem\" (\"there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem\"). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married [[Hugh of Ibelin]], to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.\n\n==Conflicts with the Muslim states==\n[[File:Maria Comnena and Amalric I of Jerusalem.jpg|frame|The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in 1167, as depicted in a MS of the ''Histoire d'Outremer'', painted in Paris c. 1295\u20131300. (''Biblioth\u00e8que Municipale'', Epinal).]]\nDuring Baldwin III's reign, the County of Edessa, the first [[crusader state]] established during the [[First Crusade]], was conquered by [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], the Turkic emir of [[Aleppo]]. Zengi united Aleppo, [[Mosul]], and other cities of northern Syria, and intended to impose his control on [[Damascus]] in the south. The [[Second Crusade]] in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus, which soon fell to Zengi's son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]]. Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the [[Principality of Antioch]]. Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt, where the [[Fatimid dynasty]] was suffering from a series of young [[caliph]]s and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], who died during an expedition there. The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amalric|display=Amalric s.v. Amalric I.|volume=1|pages=778-779|first=Ernest|last=Barker|authorlink=Ernest Barker}}</ref>\n\n===Invasions of Egypt===\n{{main|Crusader invasion of Egypt}}\nAmalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163, claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III. The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier [[Shawar]], and marched out to meet Amalric at [[Pelusium]], but was defeated and forced to retreat to [[Bilbeis]]. The Egyptians then opened up the [[Nile]] dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general [[Shirkuh]] to settle the dispute in 1164. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus.\n\nAmalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken [[Bohemund III of Antioch]] and [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] prisoner at the [[Battle of Harim]] during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in 1165 (Raymond remained in captivity until 1173). The year 1166 was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the [[Byzantine Empire]] seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured [[Banias]].\n\nIn 1167, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near [[Cairo]]; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph [[al-Adid]] himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the [[Nile]]. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture [[Alexandria]]; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite book|title=Documenti sulle Relazioni delle Citta Toscane coll'Oriente Cristiano e coi Turchi|year=1879|publisher=M.

However, Amalric could not remain there indefinitely, and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute.\n\n===Byzantine alliance===\nAfter his return to Jerusalem in 1167, Amalric married [[Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem|Maria Comnena]], a great-grandniece of [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]]. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return [[Antioch]] to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] on August 29, 1167. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow [[Theodora Komnene, Queen of Jerusalem|Theodora]], eloped with her cousin [[Andronicus I Comnenus|Andronicus]] to [[Damascus]], and [[Akko|Acre]], which had been in her possession, reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that [[William of Tyre]] was promoted to [[archdeacon]] of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom.\n\nIn 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to [[Constantinople]] to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The [[Knights Hospitaller]] eagerly supported this invasion, while the [[Knights Templar]] refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated.\n\n===Rise of Saladin===\nIn January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew [[Saladin]]. Amalric became alarmed and sent [[Frederick de la Roche]], [[Archbishop of Tyre]], to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged [[Damietta]] by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.\n\nNow Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of [[Eilat]], severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again no help was received. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also by the [[Hashshashin]]; in one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Hashshashin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.\n\n==Death==\nNur ad-Din died in 1174, upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias. On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from [[dysentery]], which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem. William of Tyre explains that \"after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days, he ordered physicians of the Greek, Syrian, and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy.\" Neither they nor Latin doctors could help, and he died on July 11, 1174.\n\nMaria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters: [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Isabella]], who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen, was born in 1172; and a stillborn child some time later. On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed [[Nablus]] to Maria and Isabella, both of whom would retire there. The [[leprosy|leprous]] child [[Baldwin IV]] succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay (now married to her fourth husband) back to court.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nWilliam was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail. \"He had a slight impediment in his speech, not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence. He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech.\" Like his brother Baldwin III, he was more of an academic than a warrior, who studied law and languages in his leisure time: \"He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed \u2013 in fact, he was second to no one in this respect.\" He was probably responsible for [[assise sur la ligece|an assize]] making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour. Amalric had an enormous curiosity, and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning, during an illness, the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]] of the body.{{sfn|Barker|1911|p=779}} He especially enjoyed reading and being read to, spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history. He did not enjoy games or spectacles, although he liked to hunt. He was trusting of his officials, perhaps too trusting, and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him, although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly.\n\nHe was tall and fairly handsome; \"he had sparkling eyes of medium size; his nose, like that of his brother, was becomingly aquiline; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead. A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin. He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook.\" He did not overeat or drink to excess, but his corpulence grew in his later years, decreasing his interest in military operations; according to William, he \"was excessively fat, with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist.\"\nAmalric was pious and attended mass every day, although he also \"is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women...\" Despite his piety he taxed the clergy, which they naturally opposed.\n\nAs William says, \"he was a man of wisdom and discretion, fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom.\" He is considered the last of the \"early\" [[kings of Jerusalem]], after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse. Within a few years, Emperor Manuel died as well, and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He also reigned as [[King of Jerusalem]] from his marriage to [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella I]] in 1197 to his death. He was the younger son of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]], a nobleman in [[Poitou]]. After participating in a rebellion against [[Henry II of England]] in 1168, he went to the [[Holy Land]] and settled in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].\n\nHis marriage to [[Eschiva of Ibelin (died 1196)|Eschiva of Ibelin]] (whose father, [[Baldwin of Ibelin]] was an influential nobleman) strengthened his position in the kingdom. His younger brother, [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy]], married [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], the sister of and heir to [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]]. Baldwin made Aimery [[Constable of Jerusalem]] around 1180. He was one of the commanders of the Christian army in the [[Battle of Hattin]], which ended with decisive defeat at the hands of the army of [[Saladin]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan of Egypt and Syria, on 4 July 1187.\n\nAimery supported his brother, Guy, even after Guy had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem  according to most barons of the realm, because of the death of Sibylla and their two daughters. The new king of Jerusalem, [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry of Champagne]], arrested him for a short period. After his release, he retired to [[Jaffa]] which was the fief of his elder brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan, who had left the Holy Land.\n\nAfter Guy died in May 1194, his vassals in Cyprus elected Aimery as their lord. He accepted the suzerainty of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. With the emperor's authorization, Aimery was crowned King of Cyprus in September 1197. He soon married Henry of Champagne's widow, Isabella I of Jerusalem. He and his wife were crowned king and queen of Jerusalem in January 1198. He signed a truce with [[Al-Adil I]], the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, which secured the Christian possession of the coastline from [[Acre (city)|Acre]] to [[Antioch]]. His rule was a period of peace and stability in both of his realms.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nAimery was born before 1155.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=103}} He was the fifth son of [[Hugh VIII of Lusignan]] and his wife, [[Burgundia of Rancon]].{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=23}}{{sfn|Painter|1957|pp=39\u201340}} [[House of Lusignan|His family]] had been noted for generations of crusaders in their native [[Poitou]].{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=97}} His great-grandfather, [[Hugh VI of Lusignan]], died in the [[Battle of Ramla (1102)|Battle of Ramla]] in 1102; Aimery's grandfather, [[Hugh VII of Lusignan]], took part in the [[Second Crusade]].{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=97}} Aimery's father also came to the [[Holy Land]] and died in a Muslim prison in the 1160s.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=97}}{{sfn|Painter|1957|p=41}} Earlier scholarship erroneously referred to him as Amalric (or Amaury, its French form), but documentary evidence shows he was actually called ''Aimericus'', which is a distinct name (although it was sometimes confused with ''Amalricus'' already in the Middle Ages).{{sfn|Hill|2010|pp=32 (note 3), 45 (note 1)}}{{sfn|Hazard|1975|p=108 (note 125)}} Runciman{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=506}} and other modern historians erroneously refer to him as Amalric II of Jerusalem, because they confused his name with that of [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric \"I\" of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Hill|2010|pp=32 (note 3), 45 (note 1)}}{{sfn|Hazard|1975|p=108 (note 125)}}\n\nAimery joined a rebellion against [[Henry II of England]] (who also ruled Poitou) in 1168, according to [[Robert of Torigni]]'s chronicle, but Henry crushed the rebellion.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=23}} Aimery left for the Holy Land and settled in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=23}} He was captured in a battle and held in captivity in [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=23}}{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=97}} A popular tradition (which was first recorded by the 13th-century [[Philip of Novara]] and [[John of Ibelin (jurist)|John of Ibelin]]) held, the [[king of Jerusalem]], [[Amalric of Jerusalem|Amalric]], ransomed him personally.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=23}}{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=97}}\n\n[[Ernoul]] (whose reliability is questioned) claimed, Aimery was a lover of Amalric of Jerusalem's former wife, [[Agnes of Courtenay]].{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|pp=9, 97\u201398}} Aimery married [[Eschiva of Ibelin (died 1196)|Eschiva of Ibelin]], a daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], who was one of the most powerful noblemen in the Kingdom of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|pp=35, 98}} Amalric of Jerusalem, who died on 11 July 1174, was succeeded by his thirteen-year-old son by Agnes of Courtenay, [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]] who suffered from [[Lepromatous leprosy|leprosy]].{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=61}} Aimery became the member of the royal court with his father-in-law's support.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=99}}\n\nAimery's youngest brother, [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy]], married Baldwin IV's widowed sister, [[Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], in April 1180.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=66}} Ernoul wrote, it was Aimery who had spoken of his brother to her and her mother, Agnes of Courtenay, describing him as a handsome and charming young man.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=152}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=424}} Aimery, continued Ernoul, hurried back to Poitou and persuaded Guy to come to the kingdom, although Sibylla had promised herself to Aimery's father-in-law.{{sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=424}} Another source, [[William of Tyre]], did not mention that Aimery had played any role in the marriage of his brother and the king's sister.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=152}} Consequently, many elements of Ernoul's report (especially Aimery's alleged journey to Poitou) were most probably invented.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|pp=152, 157}}\n\n== Constable of Jerusalem ==\n\n[[File:Gui sybila.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young crowned man (surrounded by bishops and clerics) puts the hands of a young woman and man together|Marriage of Aimery's younger

three crusader states and the neighboring powers|The crusader states around 1165]]\n\nAimery was first mentioned as [[Constable of Jerusalem]] on 24 February 1182.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=167}} According to [[Steven Runciman]] and Malcolm Barber, he had already been granted the office shortly after his predecessor, [[Humphrey II of Toron]], died in April 1179.{{sfn|Runciman|1989a|pp=419, 424}}{{sfn|Barber|2012|p=274}} Historian Bernard Hamilton writes, Aimery's appointment was the consequence of the growing influence of his brother and he was appointed only around 1181.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=167}}\n\n[[Saladin]], the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] sultan of Egypt and Syria, launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Jerusalem on 29 September 1183.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=66}}{{sfn|Barber|2012|p=281}} Aimery defeated the sultan's troops in a minor skirmish with the support of his father-in-law and his brother, [[Balian of Ibelin]].{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=190}} After the victory, the crusaders' main army could advance as far as a spring near Saladin's camp, forcing him to retreat nine days later.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=190}} During the campaign, it turned out that most barons of the realm were unwilling to cooperate with Aimery's brother, Guy, who was the designated heir to Baldwin IV.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=191}} The ailing king dismissed Guy and made his five-year-old nephew (Guy's stepson), [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], his co-ruler on 20 November 1183.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=68}}\n\nIn early 1185, Baldwin IV decreed that the [[pope]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the kings of France and England were to be approached to choose between his sister, Sybilla, and their half-sister, [[Isabella I of Jerusalem|Isabella]], if Baldwin V died before reaching the age of majority.{{sfn|Runciman|1989a|p=443}} The leper king died in April or May 1185, his nephew in late summer of 1186.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=70}} Ignoring Baldwin IV's decree, Sybilla was proclaimed queen by her supporters and she crowned her husband, Guy, king.{{sfn|Runciman|1989a|pp=447\u2013448}} Aimery was not listed among those who were present at the ceremony, but he obviously supported his brother and sister-in-law, according to Hamilton.{{sfn|Hamilton|2000|p=218}}\n\nAs constable, Aimery organised the army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem into units before the [[Battle of Hattin]], which ended with the decisive victory of Saladin on 4 July 1187.{{sfn|Barber|2012|pp=303\u2013304, 365}} Along with most commanders of the Christian army, Aimery fell into captivity in the battlefield.{{sfn|Barber|2012|p=304}} During the siege of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], Saladin promised the defenders that he would set free ten persons whom they named if they surrendered.{{sfn|Barber|2012|p=309}} Aimery and Guy were among those whom the defenders named before surrendering on 4 September, but Saladin postponed their release until the spring of 1188.{{sfn|Painter|1969|p=55}}\n\nAimery remained a loyal supporter of his brother even after Guy had lost his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem with the death of Sybilla and their two daughters in the autumn of 1190, according to most barons of the realm.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=30}}{{sfn|Edbury|1994|pp=26\u201327}} Guy's opponents supported [[Conrad of Montferrat]] who married Sybilla's half-sister, Isabella in late November.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=31}} An assembly of the noblemen of the realm unanimously declared Conrad the lawful king on 16 April 1192.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=64}} Although Conrad was murdered twelve days later, his widow soon married [[Henry II, Count of Champagne|Henry of Champagne]], who was elected king of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Lock|2006|pp=77\u201378}} To compensate Guy for the loss of Jerusalem, [[Richard I of England]] authorized him to purchase the island of [[Cyprus]] (that Richard had conquered in May 1191) from the [[Knights Templar]].{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=66\u201367}} He was also to pay 40,000 [[bezant]]s to Richard who donated the right to collect the sum from Guy to Henry of Champagne.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=28}} Guy settled in Cyprus in early May.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=67}}\n\nAimery remained in the Kingdom of Jerusalem,{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=67}} which was reduced to a narrow strip of land along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea from [[Jaffa]] to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=78}} Henry of Champagne ordered the expulsion of the merchants from [[Pisa]] from [[Acre (city)|Acre]] in May, because he accused them of plotting with Guy of Lusignan.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=83}} After Aimery intervened on behalf of the merchants, the king had him arrested.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}} Aimery was only released at the demand of the [[Grand Master (order)|grand master]]s of the Templars and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]].{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}} He retired to Jaffa that Richard of England had granted to Aimery's eldest brother, Geoffrey of Lusignan.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Lord of Cyprus ===\n\nGuy of Lusignan died in May 1194, and bequeathed Cyprus to his elder brother, Geoffrey.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=29}} However, Geoffrey had already returned to Poitou, thus Guy's vassals elected Aimery their new lord.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=29}} Henry of Champagne demanded the right to be consulted about the succession in Cyprus, but the Cypriote noblemen ignored him.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}} Around the same time, Henry of Champagne replaced Aimery with [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut|John of Ibelin]] as constable of Jerusalem.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}}\n\nAimery realized that the treasury of Cyprus was almost empty, because his brother had granted most landed property in the island to his supporters, according to Ernoul.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} He summoned his vassals to an assembly.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} After emphasizing that each of them owned more land than he had, he persuaded them one by one \"either by force, or by friendship, or by agreement\" to surrender some their rents and lands.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}}\n\n[[File:Kaiser Heinrich VI. im Codex Manesse.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young bearded man sitting on a throne|The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], who authorized the coronation of Aimery in exchange after Aimery acknowledged his suzerainty]]\n\nAimery dispatched an embassy to [[Pope Celestine III]], asking him to set up Roman Catholic dioceses in Cyprus.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=29}} He also sent his representative, [[Rainier of Jebail]], to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], proposing that he would acknowledge the emperor's suzerainty, if the emperor sent a royal crown to him.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} Aimery primarily wanted to secure the emperor's assistance against a potential [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] invasion of Cyprus,{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=604}} but he also wanted to strengthen his own legitimacy as king.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}} Rainier of Jebail swore loyalty to Henry VI on behalf of Aimery in [[Gelnhausen]] in October 1196.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=80}} The emperor who had decided to lead a crusade to the Holy Land promised that he would personally crown Aimery king.{{sfn|Johnson|1969|p=119}} He dispatched the archbishops of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brindisi-Ostuni|Brindisi]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trani-Barletta-Bisceglie|Trani]] to take a golden [[sceptre]] to Aimery as a symbol of his right to rule Cyprus.{{sfn|Johnson|1969|p=119}}\n\n=== King of Cyprus ===\n\nHenry VI's two envoys landed in Cyprus in April or May 1196.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}} Aimery may have adopted the title of king around that time, because Pope Celestin styled him as king already in a letter in December 1196.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}}{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=528}} In the same month, the pope set up a [[Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Nicosia|Roman Catholic archdiocese in Nicosia]] with three [[suffragan bishop]]s in [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Famagusta|Famagusta]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nemosia|Limassol]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Paphos|Paphos]].{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}} The [[Church of Cyprus|Greek Orthodox bishops]] were not expelled, but their property and income was seized by the new Catholic prelates.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=86}}\n\nHenry VI's [[Archchancellor|chancellor]], [[Conrad of Querfurt|Conrad]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim]], crowned Aimery king in [[Nicosia]] in September 1197.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=31}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} Aimery did homage to the chancellor.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=85}} The noblemen who owned fiefs in both Cyprus and the Kingdom of Jerusalem wanted to bring about a reconciliation between Aimery and Henry of Champagne.{{sfn|Hardwicke|1969|p=525}} One of them, [[Baldwin of Beisan]], Constable of Cyprus, persuaded Henry of Champage to visit Cyprus in early 1197.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=84}}{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} The two kings made peace, agreeing that Aimery's three sons were to marry Henry's three daughters.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Henry also renounced the debt that Aimery still owed to him for Cyprus and allowed Aimery to garrison his troops at Jaffa.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Aimery sent [[Reynald Barlais]] to take possession of Jaffa.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}} Aimery again used the title of Constable of Jerusalem in November 1197, which suggests that he had also recovered that office as a consequence of his treaty with Henry of Champagne.{{sfn|Edbury|1994|p=32}}\n\n=== King of two realms ===\n\nHenry of Champagne fell from the window of his palace and died in Acre on 10 September 1197.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}} The aristocratic, but impoverished [[Raoul of Saint Omer]] was one of the possible candidates to succeed him, but the grand masters of the military orders opposed him vehemently.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}} A few days later, [[Al-Adil I]], the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, occupied Jaffa.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=93}}\n\n[[File:Omfroi isabela.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young man

Wittelsbach]], [[Archbishop of Mainz]], who arrived to Acre on 20 September, was the first to propose that the crown should be offered to Aimery.{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|p=94}} Since Aimery's first wife

1191.{{sfn|Furber|1969|p=608}}\n\nAimery kept the peace with the Muslims, even when [[Reynald II of Dampierre]], who arrived at the head of 300 French crusaders demanded him to launch a campaign

With [[Isidore of Miletus]], he designed the [[Hagia Sophia]] for [[Justinian&nbsp;I]].\n{{anchor|History|Biography}}\n\n==Life==\nAnthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician. His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted [[Roman law|lawyer]]; and Metrodorus worked as a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}}\n\nAnthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor Zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the [[joist]]s and flooring of Zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] and flashing intolerable light into Zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} In addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited Anthemius with a knowledge of [[gunpowder]] or other explosive compound.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}}\n\n==Mathematics==\nAnthemius was a capable [[Greek mathematics|mathematician]]. In the course of his treatise \"On [[Burning Glass]]es\", intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}} and assumed a property of ellipses not found in [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s ''Conics'': the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. His work also includes the first practical use of the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} This work was later known to [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] such as [[Book of Optics|Alhazen]].\n\nEutocius's commentary on Apollonius's ''Conics'' was dedicated to Anthemius.{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}}\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Mars 2013.jpg|thumb|120px|Exterior of the [[Hagia Sophia]], 2013]]\n\n==Architecture==\nAs an architect, Anthemius is best known for his work designing the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} He was commissioned with [[Isidore of Miletus]] by [[Justinian&nbsp;I]] shortly after the earlier church on the site burned down in 532 but died early on in the project.

He was a key figure in the Danish policies of territorial expansion in the [[Baltic Sea]], [[Europeanization]] in close relationship with the [[Holy See]], and reform in the relation between the Church and the public. He combined the ideals of [[Gregorian Reform]] with loyal support of a strong [[monarch]]ical power.\n\nAbsalon was born into the powerful ''[[Hvide]]'' clan, and owned great land possessions. He endowed several church institutions, most prominently his family's [[Sor\u00f8 Abbey]]. He was granted lands by the crown, and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day [[Copenhagen]]. His titles were passed on to his nephews [[Anders Sunesen]] and [[Peder Sunesen]].

On [[Good Friday]] 1158, bishop [[Asser of Roskilde]] died, and Absalon was eventually elected [[Roskilde (titular see)|bishop of Roskilde]] on Zealand with the help of Valdemar,<ref name=\"bricka\"/> as the king's reward for the ''Hvide'' family support.<ref name=\"pajung\">Stefan Pajung, [http://www.danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/absalon-ca-1128-1201/ Artikel: Absalon ca. 1128\u20131201], [[Aarhus University]], June 20, 2009</ref>\n\n==Bishop and advisor==\nAbsalon was a close counsellor of Valdemar, and chief promoter of the Danish [[crusade]]s against the [[Wends]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> During the Danish civil war, Denmark had been open to coastal raids by the Wends.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> It was Absalon's intention to clear the [[Baltic Sea]] of the Wendish pirates who inhabited its southern [[littoral zone]] which was later called [[Pomerania]]. The pirates had raided the Danish coasts during the civil war of Sweyn III, Canute V, and Valdemar, to the point where at the accession of Valdemar one-third of Denmark lay wasted and depopulated.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Absalon formed a guardian fleet, built coastal defenses, and led several campaigns against the Wends.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> He even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of Valdemar, which helped stabilize Denmark internally.<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\n===Wendish campaigns===\n[[File:Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona.PNG|266px|thumb|right|[[Laurits Tuxen]]: Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona in 1169.]]\nThe first expedition against the [[Wends]], that was conducted by Absalon in person, set out in 1160.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> These expeditions were successful, but brought no lasting victories.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> What started out as mere retribution, eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious motives.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> In 1164 began twenty years of crusades against the Wends, sometimes with the help of German duke [[Henry the Lion]], sometimes in opposition to him.<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\nIn 1168 the chief Wendish fortress at [[Cape Arkona|Arkona]] in [[R\u00fcgen]], containing the sanctuary of their god [[Svetovid|Svantevit]], was conquered. The Wends agreed to accept Danish suzerainty and the [[Christian religion]] at the same time. From Arkona, Absalon proceeded by sea to [[Charenza]], in the midst of R\u00fcgen, the political capital of the Wends and an all but impregnable stronghold. But the unexpected fall of Arkona had terrified the garrison, which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the Danish ships. Absalon, with only [[Sweyn of Aarhus|Bishop Sweyn of Aarhus]] and twelve \"[[housecarl]]s\", thereupon disembarked, passed between a double row of Wendish warriors, 6000 strong, along the narrow path winding among the morasses, to the gates of the fortress, and, proceeding to the temple of the seven-headed god [[Rugiewit|Rugievit]], caused the idol to be hewn down, dragged forth and burnt. The whole population of [[Garz/R\u00fcgen|Garz]] was then baptized, and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of R\u00fcgen.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> R\u00fcgen was then subjected to Absalon's Bishopric of Roskilde.<ref name=\"pajung\"/>\n\nThe destruction of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet. But he continued to keep a watchful eye over the Baltic, and in 1170 destroyed another pirate stronghold, farther eastward, at [[Dziwn\u00f3w]] on the isle of [[Wolin]]. Absalon's last military exploit came in 1184, off [[Stralsund]] at [[Whitsun]], when he soundly defeated a Pomeranian fleet that had attacked Denmark's vassal, [[Jaromar I, Prince of R\u00fcgen|Jaromar of R\u00fcgen]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\n===Policies===\nAbsalon's main political goal was to free Denmark from entanglements with the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Absalon reformed the Danish church organisation to closer match [[Holy See]] praxis, and worked to keep Denmark a close ally of the Holy See.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> However, during the [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between [[Pope Alexander III]] and [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|Antipope Victor IV]], Absalon stayed loyal to Valdemar even as he joined the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] in supporting Victor IV.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> This caused a split within the Danish church, as it possibly forced Eskil into exile around 1161,<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> despite Abaslon's attempts to keep the Danish church united.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> It was contrary to Absalon's advice and warnings that Valdemar I rendered [[fealty]] to the emperor Frederick Barbarossa at [[Dole, Jura|Dole]] in 1162.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> When Valdemar returned to Denmark, he was convinced into strengthening the [[Danevirke]] fortifications at the German border, with the support of Absalon.<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\nAbsalon built churches and monasteries, supporting international religious orders like the [[Cistercians]] and [[Augustinians]], founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> In 1162, Absalon transformed the [[Sor\u00f8 Abbey]] of his family from [[Benedictine]] to Cistercian, granting it lands from his personal holdings. In 1167, Absalon was granted the land around the city of \"Havn\" (English: Harbour), and built there a castle in the coastal defense against the Wends.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> Havn quickly expanded as one of [[Scandinavia]]'s most important centers of trade, and eventually evolved into modern-day [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/> It was also Absalon who held the first Danish [[Synod]] at [[Lund]] in 1167.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> He was also interested in history and culture, and commissioned [[Saxo Grammaticus]] to write ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the Danes.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> In 1171, Absalon issued the \"Zealand church law\" ({{lang-da|Sj\u00e6llandske Kirkelov}}), which reduced the number of [[Canonical Law]] offenses for which the church could fine the public, while instituting the [[tithe]] payment system. Violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund%2c_jura_og_politik/Jura/Retshistorie/kirkelove Kirkelove] at Gyldendals \u00c5bne Encyklop\u00e6di</ref>\n\n==Archbishop of Lund==\nArchbishop Eskil returned from exile in 1167. Eskil agreed on [[canonization|canonizing]] Valdemar's father [[Knud Lavard]] in 1170, with Absalon assisting him at the feast. When Eskil stepped down as Archbishop of Lund in 1177, he chose Absalon as his successor.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> Absalon initially resisted the new position, as he did not want to lose his power position on Zealand, but complied with Papal orders to do so in 1178.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> By a unique Papal dispensation, Absalon was allowed to simultaneously maintain his post as Bishop of Roskilde.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> As the Archbishop of Lund, Absalon utilized [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]] from Zealand, demanded [[unfree labour]] from the [[peasantry]], and instituted tithes.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> He was a harsh and effective ruler, who cleared all [[Orthodox Christian]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] remnants in favour of Papal standards.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> A rebellion in the [[Scania]]n peasantry forced him to flee to Zealand in 1180, from where he returned and subdued the Scanians with the help of Valdemar.<ref name=\"pajung\"/>\n\nWhen Valdemar died in 1182, his son succeeded him as [[Canute VI of Denmark|Canute VI]], and Absalon served as Canute VI's counsellor.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> Under Canute VI, Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics.<ref name=\"gad\"/> Absalon kept his hostile attitude to the Holy Roman Empire. On the accession of Canute VI in 1182, an imperial ambassador arrived at Roskilde to get the new king to swear fealty to Frederick Barbarossa, but Absalon resolutely withstood him.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Absalons ligsten.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Absalon's gravestone in Sor\u00f8 Abbey.]]\nWhen Absalon retired from military service in 1184 at the age of fifty-seven, he resigned the command of fleets and armies to younger men, like Duke Valdemar, the later king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]]. He instead confined himself to the administration of the Danish empire.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> In 1192, Absalon made his nephew [[Peder Sunesen]] his successor as Bishop of Roskilde, while his other nephew [[Anders Sunesen]] was named the [[chancellor]] of Canute VI.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> Absalon died at Sor\u00f8 Abbey on March 21, 1201, 73 years old, with his last will granting his personal holdings to the Abbey, apart from Fjenneslev which went to Esbern Snarre. He had already given Copenhagen to the Bishopric of Roskilde.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> Absalon was interred at Sor\u00f8 Abbey,<ref name=\"pajung\"/> and was succeeded as Archbishop of Lund by Anders Sunesen.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nSaxo Grammaticus' ''Gesta Danorum'' was not finished until after the death of Absalon,<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> but Absalon was one of the chief heroic figures of the chronicle, which was to be the main source of knowledge about early Danish history.<ref name=\"pajung\"/> Absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the 12th century.<ref name=\"gyldendal\">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_f%C3%B8r_Reformationen/Absalon Absalon] at Gyldendals \u00c5bne Encyklop\u00e6di</ref> Absalon was equally great as churchman, statesman, and warrior. His policy of expansion was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic for three generations. That he enjoyed warfare there can be no doubt; yet he was not like the ordinary fighting bishops of the [[Middle Ages]], whose sole indication of their religious role was to avoid the ''shedding of blood'' by using a mace in battle instead of a sword. Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nIn the 2000s, \"Absalon\" was adopted as the name for a class of [[Royal Danish Navy]] vessels, and the lead vessel of the class. [[HDMS Absalon (L16)]] and ''Esbern Snare'' (L17) were launched and commissioned by [[Denmark]] in 2004 and 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forsvaret.dk/2ESK/ENHEDER/FS/ABSL/Pages/default.aspx |title=Forsvaret.dk |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210080938/http://forsvaret.dk/2ESK/Enheder/FS/ABSL/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2009-02-10 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/absalon/absalon2.html Absalon Class Combat / Flexible Support Ship, Denmark] naval-technology.com  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915103734/http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/absalon/absalon2.html |date=September 15, 2008 }}</ref> In December 2008, ''HDMS Absalon'' was involved in the rescue of putative [[Somali pirates]] 90&nbsp;miles off [[Yemen]] in the [[Gulf of Aden]].

He was the chosen representative of [[Pope Urban II]] for the expedition to the Holy Land. Remembered for his martial prowess, he led knights and men into battle and fought beside them, particularly at [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Dorylaeum]] and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]]. Adhemar is said to have carried the [[Holy Lance]] in the Crusaders\u2019 desperate breakout at Antioch on 28 June 1098, in which superior Islamic forces under the atabeg Kerbogha were routed, securing the city for the Crusaders. He later died in 1098, due to illness.\n\n==Life==\nBorn around 1045 into the family of the [[County of Valentinois|Counts of Valentinois]] and elected Bishop of Le Puy around 1080, he was an advocate of the [[Gregorian Reform]], and among his supporters were the future [[Pope Urban II]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]], Count of Toulouse and the richest, most powerful nobleman in France. He was also said to have gone on pilgrimage to [[Jerusalem]] around 1086. He was the brother of William Hugh of Monteil, who was also a Crusader during the First Crusade.<ref name=\":1\" /> Adhemar most likely met Pope Urban II, when in August 1095 Pope Urban the Second visited Puy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the [[Council of Clermont]] in 1095, Adhemar showed great zeal for the crusade (there is evidence that Urban II had conferred with Adhemar before the council).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Adhemar was named [[apostolic legate]] and appointed to lead the crusade by Pope Urban II on 27 November 1095.{{sfn|Peters|1971|p=31}}  In part, Adhemar was selected to lead because he had already undertaken a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1086 and 1087.{{sfn|Peters|1971|p=31}} Following the announcement of the Crusade Adhemar spent the next year raising money and recruiting men.<ref name=\":0\" /> Departing on 15 August 1096,{{sfn|Peters|1971|p=31}} he accompanied [[Raymond IV of Toulouse|Raymond IV]], [[Count of Toulouse]], in his [[Army of Raymond of Saint-Gilles|army]] to the east.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}    Whilst Raymond and the other leaders often quarrelled with each other over the leadership of the crusade, Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader of the crusade and was widely respected by the majority of the Crusaders.\n\nDuring the leg of the trip from Durazzo to [[Constantinople]], in the Valley of Pelagonia, Adhemar was set upon by a group of Pecheneg Mercenaries, one day when he had wandered too far from the majority of the Crusader forces. The Pechenegs beat and robbed Adhemar. However, one of Adhemar's assailants wished to keep his belongings for himself and ended up in quarrel with the other assailants. It was at this time Adhemar was saved by Crusader forces who had noticed the disturbance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once the army had reached [[Thessaloniki|Thessalonica]], Adhemar decided to stay there for some time, due to sickness, whilst the Crusader forces moved onward. Following this delay Adhemar, eventually was able to regroup with the Crusaders.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAdhemar negotiated with [[Alexius I Comnenus]] at [[Constantinople]], reestablished some discipline among the crusaders at [[\u0130znik|Nicaea]], fought a crucial role at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]] and was largely responsible for sustaining morale during the [[siege of Antioch]] through various religious rites including fasting and special observances of holy days. One such time he did this, was after an earthquake during the siege of Antioch, he had the Crusaders fast for three days and had the priests and clergy perform mass and prayers.<ref name=\":1\" />  Adhemar during the [[Siege of Antioch]], also had ordered the Crusaders to shave and wear a cross in an attempt to stop Crusaders from attacking one another by accident. After the capture of [[Antioch|the city]] in June 1098 and the subsequent siege led by [[Kerbogha]], Adhemar organized a procession through the streets and had the gates locked so that the Crusaders, many of whom had begun to panic, would be unable to leave the city. He was extremely skeptical of [[Peter Bartholomew]]'s discovery in Antioch of the [[Holy Lance]], especially because he knew such a relic already existed in Constantinople; however, he was willing to let the Crusader army believe it was real if it raised their morale.  Adhemar was protected by a band of Crusaders led by [[Henry of Esch]] to preserve the (albeit suspect) relic. In June 1098 Adhemar fell prey to sickness and in the following months his condition would continue to deteriorate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen Kerbogha was defeated, Adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 August 1098,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} probably of [[typhus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Following his death, Adhemar was buried in Antioch within the Basilica of St Peter.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Brundage|first=James A.|date=1959|title=Adhemar of Puy: The Bishop and His Critics|jstor=2853164|journal=Speculum|volume=34|issue=2|pages=201\u2013212|doi=10.2307/2853164}}</ref> The disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved and the march to [[Jerusalem]] was delayed for months. However, the lower-class soldiers continued to think of Adhemar as a leader. Following his death, Adhemar reportedly appeared in several visions seen by various different Crusaders. One of the first visions was reported by [[Peter Bartholomew]] who stated that Adhemar appeared to him stating the due to his skeptism of the Holy Lance he had spent a few days in hell and was only rescued because a candle had been burned in his memory, he had given a gift to the Shrine where the Holy Lance was kept, and due to the prayers of Bohemond.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the [[siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of Jerusalem]] Peter Desiderius claimed that to have received a vision from Adhemar, himself.

Later on, Stephen of Valence also claimed to have had visions featuring Adhemar in which Adhemar spoke to Stephen of several relics. Adhemar told Stepehen great reverence should be given to the cross Adhemar had taken with him on the crusade. He also told Stephen how the holy lance should be treated and told Stephen to give Stephen's ring to Count Raymond.

As count of Toulouse, he also governed the [[Marquisate of Provence]].\n\n==Life==\n===Birth and early life===\nBorn at [[Poissy]], Alphonse was a son of [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[King of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]]. He was a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]] and an older brother of [[Charles I of Sicily]]. In 1229, his mother, who was [[regent]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]], forced the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] on [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]] after his rebellion.<ref>Jackson. p. 64.</ref> It stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry [[Joan of Toulouse]], daughter of Raymond VII of Toulouse, and so in 1237 Alphonse married her.<ref>Fawtier. p. 123.</ref> Since she was Raymond's only child, they became rulers of [[Toulouse]] at Raymond's death in 1249.\n\nBy the terms of his father's will he received an ''[[appanage]]'' of [[Poitou]] and [[Rulers of Auvergne|Auvergne]]. To enforce this Louis IX won the [[battle of Taillebourg]] in the [[Saintonge War]] together with Alphonse against a revolt allied with king Henry III of England, who also participated in the battle.\n\n=== Crusades ===\nAlphonse took part in two crusades with his brother, St Louis, in 1248 (the [[Seventh Crusade]]) and in 1270 (the [[Eighth Crusade]]). For the first of these, he raised a large sum and a substantial force, arriving in [[Damietta]] on 24 October 1249, after the town had already been captured.<ref>Strayer. pp. 496-7.</ref> He sailed for home on 10 August 1250.<ref>Strayer. p. 505.</ref> His father-in-law had died while he was away, and he went directly to Toulouse to take possession.<ref>Hallam. p. 218.</ref> There was some resistance to his accession as count, which was suppressed with the help of his mother Blanche of Castile who was acting as regent in the absence of Louis IX.<ref name=\"wptmus\">Hallam. p. 258.</ref> The county of Toulouse, since then, was joined to Alphonse's ''appanage''.\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn 1252, on the death of his mother, Blanche of Castile, Alphonse was joint regent with [[Charles of Anjou]] until the return of Louis IX.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} During that time he took a great part in the campaigns and negotiations which led to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1259, under which King [[Henry III of England]] recognized his loss of continental territory to [[France]] (including [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Poitou]]) in exchange for France withdrawing support from English rebels.\n\n[[File:Arms of Alphonse de Poitiers.svg|thumb|upright|Alphonse's [[coat of arms]] was formed of those of France (left) and Castile (right), representing his father and mother respectively: ''Per pale azure sem\u00e9-de-lis or dimidiating gules sem\u00e9 of castles or'']]\n\nAside from the crusades, Alphonse stayed primarily in Paris, governing his estates by officials, inspectors who reviewed the officials' work, and a constant stream of messages.<ref>Petit-Dutaillis. pp. 299-300.</ref> His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian war]] and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. He is remembered for founding the [[bastide]] town of [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot]] which straddles the [[River Lot]] and still contains many of its original structures, including one of the first bridges across the river.<ref>[http://www.ville-villeneuve-sur-lot.fr/l-histoire-de-villeneuve-sur-lot-37.html]</ref> The charter known as \"Alphonsine,\" granted to the town of [[Riom]], became the code of public law for [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]]. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of [[Jew]]s, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.\n\nWhen Louis IX again engaged in a crusade (the [[Eighth Crusade]]), Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother.<ref>Strayer. p. 511.</ref> This time, however, he did not return to France, dying while on his way back, probably at [[Savona]] in Italy, on 21 August 1271.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAlphonse's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands. One possibility was that they should revert to the crown, another that they should be redistributed to his family. The latter was claimed by Charles of Anjou, but in 1283 [[Parlement]] decided that the County of Toulouse should revert to the crown, if there were no male heirs.<ref name=\"wptmus\"/> Alphonse's wife Joan (who died four days after Alphonse) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will. Joan was the only surviving child and heiress of [[Raymond VII]], Count of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne, and Marquis of Provence, so under Proven\u00e7al and French law, the lands should have gone to her nearest male relative. But, her will was invalidated by Parlement in 1274.<ref name=\"wptmus\"/> One specific bequest in Alphonse's will, giving his wife's lands in the [[Comtat Venaissin]] to the [[Holy See]], was allowed, and it became a [[Papal States|Papal territory]], a status that it retained until 1791.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|Biography|France}}\n* [[Abraham of Aragon]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{commons category|Alphonse de Poitiers}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n===English-language===\n*{{cite book | title=The Capetian Kings of France | first=Robert | last=Fawtier | year=1960 | isbn=0-312-11900-3}} (translated by Lionel Butler and R.

Upon Bertrand's death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence. \n\nIn 1114, Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]], who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count [[William IV of Toulouse|William IV]], invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123.

Ambroise followed Richard I as a [[noncombatant]], and not improbably as a court-[[minstrel]].

He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position; but relates what he had seen and heard with a na\u00efve vivacity which compels attention. He is by no means an impartial source: he is prejudiced against the [[Saracens]], against the French, and against all the rivals or enemies of his master, including the ''Polein'' party which supported [[Conrad of Montferrat]] against [[Guy of Lusignan]].

During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress.\n\nArt Deco was a pastiche of many different styles, sometimes contradictory, united by a desire to be modern. From its outset, Art Deco was influenced by the bold geometric forms of [[Cubism]]; the bright colors of [[Fauvism]] and of the [[Ballets Russes]]; the updated craftsmanship of the furniture of the eras of [[Louis Philippe I]] and [[Louis XVI]]; and the exotic styles of [[Chinese art|China]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]], [[Indian art|India]], [[Persian art|Persia]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egypt]] and [[ancient Maya art|Maya art]].  It featured rare and expensive materials, such as ebony and ivory, and exquisite craftsmanship. The [[Chrysler Building]] and other skyscrapers of New York built during the 1920s and 1930s are monuments of the Art Deco style.\n\nIn the 1930s, during the [[Great Depression]], the Art Deco style became more subdued.

The term \"arts d\u00e9coratifs\" had been invented in 1875, giving the designers of furniture, textiles, and other decoration official status. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des artistes d\u00e9corateurs (Society of decorative artists), or SAD, was founded in 1901, and decorative artists were given the same rights of authorship as painters and sculptors. A similar movement developed in Italy. The first international exhibition devoted entirely to the decorative arts, the ''Esposizione international d'Arte decorative moderna'', was held in [[Turin]] in 1902. Several new magazines devoted to decorative arts were founded in Paris, including ''Arts et d\u00e9coration'' and ''L'Art d\u00e9coratif moderne''. Decorative arts sections were introduced into the annual salons of the Soci\u00e9te des artistes fran\u00e7ais, and later in the'' [[Salon d'automne]]''. French nationalism also played a part in the resurgence of decorative arts; French designers felt challenged by the increasing exports of less expensive German furnishings. In 1911, the SAD proposed the holding of a major new international exposition of decorative arts in 1912. No copies of old styles were to be permitted; only modern works. The exhibit was postponed until 1914, then, because of the war, postponed until 1925, when it gave its name to the whole family of styles known as D\u00e9co.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=165-170}}\n\nParisian department stores and fashion designers also played an important part in the rise of Art D\u00e9co. Established firms including the luggage maker [[Louis Vuitton]], silverware firm [[Christofle]], glass designer [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], and the jewelers [[Louis Cartier]] and [[Boucheron]], who all began designing products in more modern styles. Beginning in 1900, department stores had recruited decorative artists to work in their design studios. The decoration of the 1912 [[Salon d'Automne]] had been entrusted to the department store [[Printemps]].<ref name=\"Salon d'Automne 2012\">[http://www.salon-automne.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/catalogue-SA-2012.pdf Salon d'Automne 2012, exhibition catalogue]</ref> During the same year Printemps created its own workshop called \"Primavera\". By 1920 Primavera employed more than three hundred artists. The styles ranged from the updated versions of Louis XIV, Louis XVI and especially Louis Philippe furniture made by [[Louis S\u00fce]] and the Primavera workshop to more modern forms from the workshop of the Au Louvre department store. Other designers, including [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]] and Paul Foliot refused to use mass production, and insisted that each piece be made individually by hand. The early art deco style featured luxurious and exotic materials such as ebony, and ivory and silk, very bright colors and stylized [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], particularly baskets and bouquets of flowers of all colors, giving a modernist look.<ref>Laurent, Stephane, \"L'artiste d\u00e9corateur\", in ''Art Deco, 1910\u20131939'' by Charlotte Benton, Tim Benton and Ghislain Wood (2002), Renaissance du Livre, pages 165\u2013171</ref>\n\n===Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es (1910\u20131913)===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\n\"La Danse\", bas-relief dAntoine Bourdelle (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs Elys\u00e9es, Paris) (3713880263).jpg|[[Antoine Bourdelle]], ''La Danse'', facade of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], Paris (1912)\nFile:Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es DSC09330.jpg|[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], by [[Auguste Perret]], 15 avenue Montaigne, Paris, (1910\u201313).

Previously [[reinforced concrete]] had been used only for industrial and apartment buildings, Perret had built the first modern reinforced concrete apartment building in Paris on rue Benjamin Franklin in 1903-04. [[Henri Sauvage]], another important future Art Deco architect, built another in 1904 at 7 rue Tr\u00e9taigne (1904). From 1908 to 1910, the 21-year old Le Corbusier worked as a draftsman in Perret's office, learning the techniques of concrete construction. Perret's building had clean rectangular form, geometric decoration and straight lines, the future trademarks of Art Deco. The decor of the theater was also revolutionary; the facade was decorated with [[Relief#High_relief|high reliefs]] by [[Antoine Bourdelle]], a dome by [[Maurice Denis]], paintings by [[\u00c9douard Vuillard]], and an Art Deco curtain [[Ker-Xavier Roussel]]. The theater became famous as the venue for many of the first performances of the [[Ballets Russes]].

Some of the colors were inspired by the earlier [[Fauvism]] movement led by [[Henri Matisse]]; others by the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] of painters such as [[Sonia Delaunay]]; others by the movement known as the Nabis, and in the work of symbolist painter Odilon Redon, who designed fireplace screens and other decorative objects.

In architecture, Art Deco was the successor to and reaction against Art Nouveau, a style which flourished in Europe between 1895 and 1900, and also gradually replaced the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] that were predominant in European and American architecture.

Grasset stressed the principle that various simple geometric shapes like triangles and squares are the basis of all compositional arrangements. The reinforced concrete buildings of Auguste Perret and Henri Sauvage, and particularly the [[Theatre des Champs-Elysees]], offered a new form of construction and decoration which was copied worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/mthodedecomposit01gras |title=Eug\u00e8ne Grasset, '&#39;M\u00e9thode de composition ornementale'&#39;, 1905, Full Text (in French) |publisher=Archive.org |date=10 March 2001 |accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn decoration, many different styles were borrowed and used by Art Deco.  They included pre-modern art from around the world and observable at the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme]] and the [[Mus\u00e9e national des Arts d'Afrique et d'Oc\u00e9anie]].  There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at [[Pompeii]], [[Troy]], and the tomb of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].

It was influenced by discoveries in [[Egyptology]], and growing interest in the Orient and in African art. From 1925 onwards, it was often inspired by a passion for new machines, such as airships, automobiles and ocean liners, and by 1930 this influence resulted in the style called [[streamline moderne]].{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=7-8}}\n\n==Style of luxury and modernity==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Appartement Jeanne Lanvin by Armand-Albert Rateau - boudoir 01.jpg|The boudoir of fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]] (1922\u201325) now in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris\nFile:Jeanne Lanvin bath -Museum of Decorative Arts.jpg|Bath of Jeanne Lanvin, of Sienna marble, with decoration of carved stucco and bronze (1922\u201325)\nFile:Alavoine, Weil-Worgelt Study, ca. 1928-1930..jpg|An Art Deco study by the Paris design firm of Alavoine, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]] (1928\u201330)\nFile:Le salon de verre, designed by Paul Ruaud, furniture by Eileen Gray, for Madame Mathieu-Levy (boutique J.

Nothing was cheap about Art Deco: pieces of furniture included ivory and silver inlays, and pieces of Art Deco jewelry combined diamonds with platinum, jade, and other precious materials. The style was used to decorate the first-class salons of ocean liners, deluxe trains, and skyscrapers. It was used around the world to decorate the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and 1930s.  Later, after the [[Great Depression]], the style changed and became more sober.\n\nA good example of the luxury style of Art Deco is the boudoir of the fashion designer [[Jeanne Lanvin]], designed by [[Armand-Albert Rateau]] (1882-1938) made between 1922-25.  It was located in her house at 16 rue Barbet de Jouy, in Paris, which was demolished in 1965.  The room was reconstructed in the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.  The walls are covered with molded ''lambris'' below sculpted bas-reliefs in stucco. The alcove is framed with columns of marble on with bases and a plinth of sculpted wood.  The floor is of white and black marble, and in the cabinets decorative objects are displayed against a background of blue silk.  Her bathroom had a tub and washstand made of sienna marble, with a wall of carved stucco and bronze fittings.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=82}}\n\nBy 1928 the style had become more comfortable, with deep leather club chairs.  The study designed by the Paris firm of Alavoine for an American businessman in 1928-30, now in the [[Brooklyn Museum]], had a unique American feature.  Since it was constructed during [[Prohibition]], when serving alcohol was prohibited, it included a secret bar hidden behind the panels.<ref>Home Page of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]</ref>\n\nBy the 1930s, the style had been somewhat simplified, but it was still extravagant. In 1932 the decorator Paul Ruoud made the Glass Salon for Suzanne Talbot.  It featured a serpentine armchair and two tubular armchairs by Eileen Gray, a floor of mat silvered glass slabs, a panel of abstract patterns in silver and black lacquer, and an assortment of animal skins.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=77}}\n\n==International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts (1925)==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Postcard of Exposition des Art Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes.jpg|Postcard of the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris (1925)\nFile:Paris 1925 59878912.jpg|Polish pavilion in Paris (1925)\nFile:Paris-FR-75-Expo 1925 Arts d\u00e9coratifs-pavillon des Galeries Lafayette.jpg|Pavilion of the [[Galeries Lafayette]] Department Store at the 1925 Exposition\nFile:Hotel du Collectionneur , Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes (1925).jpg|The Hotel du Riche Collectionneur, pavilion of the furniture manufacturer [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]]\nSalon of the Hotel du Collectionneur (1925).jpg|Salon of the H\u00f4tel du Riche Collectionneur from the 1925 International Exposition of Decorative Arts, furnished by [[\u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann]], painting by [[Jean Dupas]]\n</gallery>\n{{main article|International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts}}\nThe event that marked the zenith of the style and gave it its name was the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] which took place in Paris from April to October in 1925.  This was officially sponsored by the French government, and covered a site in Paris of 55 acres, running from the [[Grand Palais]] on the right bank to [[Les Invalides]] on the left bank, and along the banks of the Seine.  The Grand Palais, the largest hall in the city, was filled with exhibits of decorative arts from the participating countries. There were 15,000 exhibitors from twenty different countries, including England, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Japan, and the new [[Soviet Union]], though Germany was not invited because of tensions after the war and the United States, misunderstanding the purpose of the exhibit, declined to participate.  It was visited by sixteen million people during its seven-month run. The rules of the exhibition required that all work be modern; no historical styles were allowed.  The main purpose of the Exhibit was to promote the French manufacturers of luxury furniture, porcelain, glass, metal work, textiles and other decorative products. To further promote the products, all the major Paris department stores and major designers had their own pavilions. The Exposition had a secondary purpose in promoting products from French colonies in Africa and Asia, including ivory and exotic woods.\n\nThe H\u00f4tel du Riche Collectionneur was a popular attraction at the Exposition; it displayed the new furniture designs of Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, as well as Art Deco fabrics, carpets, and a painting by [[Jean Dupas]].  The interior design followed the same principles of symmetry and geometric forms which set it apart from Art Nouveau, and bright colors, fine craftsmanship rare and expensive materials which set it apart from the strict functionality of the Modernist style.  While most of the pavilions were lavishly decorated and filled with hand-made luxury furniture, two pavilions, those of the Soviet Union and Pavilion du Nouveau Esprit, built by the magazine of that name run by Le Corbusier, were built in an austere style with plain white walls and no decoration; they were among the earliest examples of [[modernist architecture]].{{Sfn|Charles|2013|pages=35-104}}\n\n==Skyscrapers==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Bryant Park Hotel in NYC IMG 1242.JPG|The [[American Radiator Building]] in New York City by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924)\nFile:Chrysler Building spire, Manhattan, by Carol Highsmith (LOC highsm.04444).jpg|[[Chrysler Building]] in [[New York City]], by [[William Van Alen]] (1928\u201330)\nFile:USS Akron (ZRS-4) in flight over Manhattan, circa 1931-1933.jpg|New York City skyline (1931-1933)\nFile:570 Lexington Avenue2.JPG|Crown of the [[General Electric Building]] (also known as 570 Lexington Avenue) by [[Cross & Cross]] (1933)\nFile:30RockConstruction1933.jpg|30 Rockefeller Center, now the [[Comcast Building]], by [[Raymond Hood]] (1933)\n</gallery>\n\nAmerican skyscrapers marked the summit of the Art Deco style; they became the tallest and most recognizable modern buildings in the world. They were designed to show the prestige of their builders through their height, their shape, their color, and their dramatic illumination at night.<ref>John Burchard and Albert Bush Brown, ''The Architecture of America'' (1966), Atlantic, Little and Brown, page 277</ref>  The first New York skyscraper, the [[Woolworth Building]], in a neoclassical style, was completed in 1913, and the American Telephone and Telegraph Building (1924) had ionic and doric columns and a classical Doric [[hypostyle]] with a frieze. The [[American Radiator Building]] by [[Raymond Hood]] (1924) combined Gothic and Deco modern elements in the design of the building. Black brick on the frontage of the building (symbolizing coal) was selected to give an idea of solidity and to give the building a solid mass. Other parts of the facade were covered in gold bricks (symbolizing fire), and the entry was decorated with marble and black mirrors. Another early Art Deco skyscraper was Detroit's [[Guardian Building]], which opened in 1929. Designed by modernist [[Wirt C. Rowland]], the building was the first to employ stainless steel as a decorative element, and the extensive use of colored designs in place of traditional ornaments.\n\nThe New York skyline was radically changed by the [[Chrysler Building]] in Manhattan (completed in 1930), designed by [[William Van Alen]]. It was a giant seventy-seven floor tall advertisement for Chrysler automobiles.  The top was crowned by a stainless steel spire, and was ornamented by deco \"gargoyles\" in the form of stainless steel radiator cap decorations.  The base of the tower, thirty-three stories above the street, was decorated with colorful art deco friezes, and the lobby was decorated with art deco symbols and images expressing modernity.{{Sfn|Benton|202|pages=249-258}}\n\nThe Chrysler Building was followed by the [[Empire State Building]] by [[William F. Lamb]] (1931) and the RCA Building (now the [[Comcast Building]]) in [[Rockefeller Center]], by Raymond Hood (1933) which together completely changed the skyline of New York.  The tops of the buildings were decorated with Art Deco crowns and spires covered with stainless steel, and, in the case of the Chrysler building, with Art Deco gargoyles modeled after radiator ornaments, while the entrances and lobbies were lavishly decorated with Art Deco sculpture, ceramics, and design.  Similar buildings, though not quite as tall, soon appeared in Chicago and other large American cities. The Chrysler Building was soon surpassed in height by the Empire State Building, in a slightly less lavish Deco style.  Rockefeller Center added a new design element: several tall building grouped around an open plaza, with a fountain in the center.{{Sfn|Morel|2012|pages=125-30}}\n\n==Late Art Deco==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Miami Beach FL Lincoln Mall Lincoln Theatre01.jpg|[[Lincoln Theatre (Miami Beach, Florida)|Lincoln Theater]] in [[Miami Beach]], Florida by [[Thomas W.

On the other side were the modernists, who increasingly rejected the past and wanted a style based upon advances in new technologies, simplicity, a lack of decoration, inexpensive materials, and mass production.  The modernists founded their own organization, [[The French Union of Modern Artists]], in 1929.  Its members included architects [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Francis Jourdain]], [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], Corbusier, and, in the Soviet Union, [[Konstantin Melnikov]]; the Irish designer Eileen Gray, and French designer Sonia Delaunay, the jewelers [[Jean Fouquet]] and [[Jean Puiforcat]]. They fiercely attacked the traditional art deco style, which they said was created only for the wealthy, and insisted that well-constructed buildings should be available to everyone, and that form should follow function.  The beauty of an object or building resided in whether it was perfectly fit to fulfill its function.  Modern industrial methods meant that furniture and buildings could be mass-produced, not made by hand.<ref>Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture'', Flammarion, republished in 1995, page xix</ref><ref>Larousse Encyclopedia on-line edition (in French)</ref>\n\nThe Art Deco interior designer Paul Follot defended Art Deco in this way: \"We know that man is never content with the indispensable and that the superfluous is always needed...If not, we would have to get rid of music, flowers, and perfumes..!\"{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=8}}  However, Le Corbusier was a brilliant publicist for modernist architecture; he stated that a house was simply \"a machine to live in\", and tirelessly promoted the idea that Art Deco was the past and modernism was the future. Le Corbusier's ideas were gradually adopted by architecture schools, and the aesthetics of Art Deco were abandoned.  The same features that made Art Deco popular in the beginning, its craftsmanship, rich materials and ornament, led to its decline. The Great Depression that began in the United States in 1929, and reached Europe shortly afterwards, greatly reduced the number of wealthy clients who could pay for the furnishings and art objects.  In the Depression economic climate, few companies were ready to build new skyscrapers.<ref name=\"Goss\" />  Even the Ruhlmann firm resorted to producing pieces of furniture in series, rather than individual hand-made items.  The last buildings built in Paris in the new style were the Museum of Public Works by Auguste Perret (now the [[French Economic, Social and Environmental Council]]) and the [[Palais de Chaillot]] by [[Louis-Hippolyte Boileau]], [[Jacques Carlu]] and [[L\u00e9on Az\u00e9ma]], and the [[Palais de Tokyo]] of the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Paris International Exposition]]; they looked out at the grandiose pavilion of Nazi Germany, designed by [[Albert Speer]], which faced the equally grandiose socialist-realist pavilion of Stalin's Soviet Union.\n\nAfter World War II the dominant architectural style became the International Style pioneered by Le Corbusier, and [[Mies Van der Rohe]].  A handful of Art Deco hotels were built in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] after World War II, but elsewhere the style largely vanished, except in industrial design, where it continued to be used in automobile styling and products such as juke boxes.  In the 1960s, it experienced a modest academic revival, thanks in part to the writings of architectural historians such as Bevis Hillier.  In the 1970s efforts were made in the United States and Europe to preserve the best examples of Art Deco architecture, and many buildings were restored and repurposed. [[Postmodern architecture]], which first appeared in the 1980s, like Art Deco, often includes purely decorative features.<ref name=\"Goss\" /><ref name=\"Art Deco Style\" /><ref name=\"Design Handbook\">{{cite book |last=Fell | first=Charlotte |first2=Peter |last2=Fell |title=Design Handbook: Concepts, Materials and Styles |publisher=Taschen |year=2006 |edition=1 }}</ref><ref name=\"Art Deco (1920s to 1930s)\">{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |title=Art Deco (1920s to 1930s) |last=Heindorf |first=Anne |date=24 July 2006 |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080207022236/http://arthistory.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Style21-ArtDeco.htm |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> Deco continues to inspire designers, and is often used in contemporary fashion, jewelry, and toiletries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |title=The Decorative in Twentieth Century Art: A Story of Decline and Resurgence |first=Pamela |last=Gaunt |date=August 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013725/http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-NUN/uploads/approved/adt-NUN20060515.093519/public/02whole.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Painting==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Lempicka musician.jpg|[[Tamara de Lempicka]], 1929, ''La Musicienne'', oil on canvas, 161 \u00d7 96&nbsp;cm -->\nFile:Entrance of Rockefeller Center.JPG|Detail of ''Time'', 1941, ceiling mural in lobby of [[Rockefeller Center]] by the Spanish painter [[Josep Maria Sert]]\nFile:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Marsh-1.jpg|[[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], 1936, ''Workers sorting the mail'', a mural in the U.S. Customs House in New York\nFile:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Rockwell-Kent-1.jpg|[[Rockwell Kent]], 1938, ''Art in the Tropics'', mural in the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building]]\n</gallery>\nThere was no section set aside for painting at the 1925 Exposition. Art deco painting was by definition decorative, designed to decorate a room or work of architecture, so few painters worked exclusively in the style, but two painters are closely associated with Art Deco.  Jean Dupas painted Art Deco murals for the Bordeaux Pavilion at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition in Paris, and also painted the picture over the fireplace in the Maison de la Collectioneur exhibit at the 1925 Exposition, which featured furniture by Ruhlmann and other prominent Art Deco designers.  His murals were also prominent in the decor of the French ocean liner [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']].  His work was purely decorative, designed as a background or accompaniment to other elements of the decor.<ref>Louis Ren\u00e9 Vian, ''Les Arts d\u00e9coratifs \u00e0 bord des paquebots fran\u00e7ais'', \u00c9ditions Fonmare, 1992</ref>  The other painter closely associated with the style is [[Tamara de Lempicka]]. Born in Poland in an aristocratic family, she emigrated to Paris after the [[Russian Revolution]].  There she became a student of the artist Maurice Denis of the movement called ''[[Les Nabis]]'' and the Cubist [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]] and borrowed many elements from their styles.  She painted almost exclusively portraits in a realistic, dynamic and colorful Art Deco style.<ref>Blondel, Alain (1999). ''Tamara de Lempicka: a Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 1921\u20131980''. Lausanne: Editions Acatos.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s a dramatic new form of Art Deco painting appeared in the United States. During the Great Depression, the [[Federal Art Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] was created to give work to unemployed artists. Many were given the task of decorating government buildings, hospitals and schools.  There was no specific art deco style used in the murals; artists engaged to paint murals in government buildings came from many different schools, from American regionalism to [[social realism]]; they included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and the Mexican painter [[Diego Rivera]].  The murals were Art Deco because they were all decorative and related to the activities in the building or city where they were painted: Reginald Marsh and Rockwell Kent both decorated U.S. postal buildings, and showed postal employees at work while Diego Rivera depicted automobile factory workers for the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. Diego Rivera's mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' (1933) for Rockefeller Center featured an unauthorized portrait of [[Lenin]].<ref>Balfour, Alan (1978). Rockefeller Center: Architecture as Theater.

It was almost always representational, usually of heroic or allegorical figures related to the purpose of the building; the themes were usually chosen by the patron, and abstract sculpture for decoration was extremely rare. It was frequently attached to facade of buildings, particularly over the entrances and lobbies.<ref>[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0671808044 Eva Weber, ''Art deco in America''], Exeter Books, 1985, p. 32, {{ISBN|0671808044}}</ref>\n\nAllegorical sculptures of the dance and music by Antoine Bourdelle were the essential decorative feature of the earliest Art Deco landmark in Paris, the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris, in 1912. The sculptor [[Aristide Maillol]] reinvented the classical ideal for his statue of the River (1939), now at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. In the 1930s, a whole team of sculptors made sculpture for the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at Chaillot. The buildings of the Exposition were covered with low-relief sculpture, statues. [[Alfred Janniot]] made the relief sculptures on the facade of the Palais de Tokyo. The [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], and the esplanade in front of the Palais de Chaillot, facing the Eiffel Tower, was crowded with new statuary by [[Charles Malfray]], Henry Arnold, and many others.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=165-66}}\n\nIn the United States, many European sculptors trained at the \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts in Paris, came to work; they included [[Gutzon Borglum]], sculptor of Mount Rushmore [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other American sculptors, including [[Harriet Whitney Frishmuth]], had studied with [[Auguste Rodin]] in Paris. The 1929 stock market crash largely destroyed the market for monumental sculpture, but one grand project remained; the new Rockefeller Center. The American sculptors [[Lee Lawrie]] and [[Paul Manship]] designed heroic allegorical figures for facade and plaza. In San Francisco, [[Ralph Stackpole]] provided sculpture for the facade of the new [[San Francisco Stock Exchange]] building.\n\nOne of the best known and certainly the largest Art Deco sculpture is the ''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' by the French sculptor [[Paul Landowski]], completed between 1922 and 1931, located on a mountain top overlooking [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. [[Fran\u00e7ois Pompon]] was a pioneer of modern stylized [[animalier]] sculpture. He was not fully recognized for his artistic accomplishments until the age of 67 at the Salon d'Automne of 1922 with the work ''Ours blanc'', also known as ''The White Bear'', now in the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] in Paris.<ref name=Kjellberg>{{cite book|last1=Kjellberg|first1=Pierre|title=Bronzes of the 19th Century|date=1994|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd.|location=Atglen, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-88740-629-7|page=551|edition=First}}<!--|accessdate=20 July 2015--></ref>\n\nMany early Art Deco sculptures were small, designed to decorate salons. One genre of this sculpture was called the [[Chryselephantine]] statuette, named for a style of ancient Greek temple statues made of gold and ivory. One of the best-known Art Deco salon sculptors was the Romanian-born [[Dem\u00e9tre Chiparus]], who produced colorful small sculptures of dancers. Other notable salon sculptors included [[Ferdinand Preiss]], [[Josef Lorenzl]], Alexander Kelety, Dorothea Charol and Gustav Schmidtcassel.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=141-163}}\n\nParallel with these more neoclassical sculptors, more avant-garde and abstract sculptors were at work in Paris and New York. The most prominent were [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Gustave Miklos]], [[Jean Lambert-Rucki]], [[Jan et Jo\u00ebl Martel]], [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Pablo Gargallo]].<ref name=\"Edith Balas, 1998\">[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society</ref>\n\n==Graphic arts==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Richard Strauss-Woche, festival poster, 1910 by Ludwig Hohlwein.jpg|Festival poster by [[Ludwig Hohlwein]] (1910)\nFile:Bakst Nizhinsky.jpg|Program for the [[Ballets Russes]] by [[Leon Bakst]] (1912)\nFile:Deutsche Werkbund-Ausstellung Kunst in Handwerk, Industrie und Handel Architektur K\u00f6ln 1914 Oct.

It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of Leon Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/robesdePaulPoir00Irib Paul Iribe, ''Les robes de Paul Poiret'', 1908]</ref> The illustrations of [[Georges Barbier]], and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine ''La Gazette du bon ton'' perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style.  In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States.  It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In Germany, the most famous poster artist of the period was [[Ludwig Hohlwein]], who created colorful and dramatic posters for music festivals, beers, and, late in his career, for the Nazi Party.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}\n\nDuring the Art Nouveau period, posters usually advertised theatrical products or cabarets.  In the 1920s, travel posters, made for steamship lines and airlines, became extremely popular. The style changed notably in the 1920s, to focus attention on the product being advertised.  The images became simpler, precise, more linear, more dynamic, and were often placed against a single color background. In France popular Art Deco designers included, Charles Loupot and [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]], who became famous for his posters of American singer and dancer [[Josephine Baker]].  Jean Carlu designed posters for Charlie Chaplin movies, soaps, and theaters; in the late 1930s he emigrated to the United States, where, during the World War, he designed posters to encourage war production. The designer Charles Gesmar became famous making posters for the singer [[Mistinguett]] and for [[Air France]].  Among the best known French Art Deco poster designers was [[Cassandre (artist)|Cassandre]], who made the celebrated poster of the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'' in 1935.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=148-150}}\n\nIn the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression.

The two young architects used reinforced concrete for the first time in Paris residential buildings; the new buildings had clean lines, rectangular forms, and no decoration on the facades; they marked a clean break with the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] style.{{Sfn|Poisson|2009|pages 299 and 318}}  Between 1910 and 1913, Perret used his experience in concrete apartment buildings to construct the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, 15 [[avenue Montaigne]].  Between 1925 and 1928 he constructed the new art deco facade of the [[La Samaritaine]] department store in Paris.{{Sfn|Plum|2014|page=134}}\n\nAfter the First World War, art deco buildings of steel and reinforced concrete began to appear in large cities across Europe and the United States.  In the United States the style was most commonly used for office buildings, government buildings, movie theaters, and railroad stations. It sometimes was combined with other styles; [[Los Angeles City Hall]] combined Art Deco with a roof based on the ancient Greek [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]], while the [[Los Angeles railroad station]] combined Deco with Spanish mission architecture.  Art Deco elements also appeared in engineering projects, including the towers of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and the intake towers of [[Hoover Dam]].  In the 1920s and 1930s it became a truly international style, with examples including the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] (Palace of Fine Arts) in [[Mexico City]] by {{ill|Federico Mariscal|es}}, the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya Metro Station]] in [[Moscow]] and the [[National Diet Building]] in Tokyo by Watanabe Fukuzo.\n\nThe Art Deco style was not limited to buildings on land; the ocean liner SS ''Normandie'', whose first voyage was in 1935, featured Art Deco design, including a dining room whose ceiling and decoration were made of glass by [[Lalique]].\n\n=== \"Cathedrals of Commerce\" ===\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Interior of Fisher Building, Detroit.JPG|The [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]] (1928)\nFile:Detroit December 2015 30 (Guardian Building).jpg|Lower lobby of the [[Guardian Building]] in Detroit by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929)\nFile:450 Sutter St. lobby 2.JPG|Lobby of [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]]  (1929)\nFile:Chrysler Building Lobby.jpg|Lobby of the [[Chrysler Building]] by [[William Van Alen]] in New York City (1930)\nFile:Chrysler Building 01.JPG|Elevator of the [[Chrysler Building]]  (1930)\n</gallery>\n\nThe grand showcases of Art deco interior design were the lobbies of government buildings, theaters, and particularly office buildings.  Interiors were extremely colorful and dynamic, combining sculpture, murals, and ornate geometric design in marble, glass, ceramics and stainless steel.  An early example was the [[Fisher Building]] in Detroit, by [[Joseph Nathaniel French]]; the lobby was highly decorated with sculpture and ceramics.  ]The [[Guardian Building]] (originally the Union Trust Building) in Detroit, by [[Wirt Rowland]] (1929), decorated with red and black marble and brightly colored ceramics, highlighted by highly polished steel elevator doors and counters.  The sculptural decoration installed in the walls illustrated the virtues of industry and saving; the building was immediately termed the \"Cathedral of Commerce\".  The Medical and Dental Building called [[450 Sutter Street]] in San Francisco by [[Timothy Pflueger]] was inspired by [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] architecture, in a highly stylized form; it used pyramid shapes, and the interior walls were covered highly stylized rows of hieroglyphs.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}\n\nIn France, the best example of an Art Deco interior during period was the [[Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e]] (1931) by [[Albert Laprade]], [[L\u00e9on Jaussely]] and [[L\u00e9on Bazin]].  The building (now the National Museum of Immigration, with an aquarium in the basement) was built for the [[Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931]], to celebrate the people and products of French colonies.  The exterior facade was entirely covered with sculpture, and the lobby created an Art Deco harmony with a wood parquet floor in a geometric pattern, a mural depicting the people of French colonies; and a harmonious composition of vertical doors and horizontal balconies.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=198-200}}\n\n===Movie palaces===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Graumanegyptian-opening1922.jpg|[[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in Hollywood (1922)\nFile:20ans.jpg|[[Grand Rex]] movie theater in Paris (1932)\nFile:Paramount Fountain of Light in Lobby.jpg|Four-story high grand lobby of the Paramount Theater, Oakland (1932)\nFile:Radio City Music Hall 3051638324 4a385c5623.jpg|Auditorium and stage of [[Radio City Music Hall]], New York City (1932)\nFile:Gaumont State Cinema Entrance.jpg|[[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937)\nFile:The Paramount, Shanghai.JPG|The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] in [[Shanghai]], China (1933)\n</gallery>\nMany of the best surviving examples of Art Deco are movie theaters built in the 1920s and 1930s.  The Art Deco period coincided with the conversion of silent films to sound, and movie companies built enormous theaters in major cities to capture the huge audience that came to see movies.  Movie palaces in the 1920s often combined exotic themes with art deco style; [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in Hollywood (1922) was inspired by ancient Egyptian [[tomb]]s and [[pyramid]]s, while the [[Fox Theater (Bakersfield, California)|Fox Theater]] in Bakersfield, California attached a tower in California Mission style to an Art Deco hall.  The largest of all is [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City, which opened in 1932.  Originally designed as a stage theater, it quickly transformed into a movie theater, which could seat 6,015 persons The interior design by [[Donald Deskey]] used glass, aluminum, chrome, and leather to create a colorful escape from reality The [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theater]] in Oakland, California, by Timothy Pflueger, had a colorful ceramic facade a lobby four stories high, and separate Art Deco smoking rooms for gentlemen and ladies. Similar grand palaces appeared in Europe.  The [[Grand Rex]] in Paris (1932), with its imposing tower, was the largest movie theater in Europe.  The [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in London (1937) had a tower modeled after the Empire State building, covered with cream-colored ceramic tiles and an interior in an Art Deco-Italian Renaissance style. The [[Paramount (Shanghai)|Paramount]] Theater in [[Shanghai]], China (1933) was originally built as a dance hall called ''The gate of 100 pleasures''; it was converted to a movie theater after the Communist Revolution in 1949, and now is a ballroom and disco. In the 1930s Italian architects built a small movie palace, the Cinema Impero, in [[Asmara]] in what is now [[Eritrea]]. Today, many of the movie theaters have been subdivided into multiplexes, but others have been restored and are used as cultural centers in their communities.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=197-199}}\n\n=== Streamline Moderne ===\n{{See also|Streamline Moderne}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Immeuble de Pierre Patout Bd Victor Paris XV.jpg|Paris Building in the ''Paquebot'' or ocean liner style, 3 boulevard Victor  (1935)\nFile:Pan-Pacific Auditorium entrance.jpg|[[Pan-Pacific Auditorium]] in Los Angeles (1936)\nFile:LaGuardia MarineAirTerminal 1974.jpg|The [[Marine Air Terminal]] at [[La Guardia Airport]]  (1937) was the New York terminal for the flights of Pan Am Clipper flying boats to Europe\nFile:Hoover Building No 1.jpg|The [[Hoover Building]] canteen in [[Perivale]] in the London suburbs, by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners (1938)\nFile:World Fair 1939 LOC gsc.5a03061.jpg|The Ford Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]\nFile:Broadcasting_House_by_Stephen_Craven.jpg|The nautical-style rounded corner of [[BBC Broadcasting House]] (1931)\n</gallery>\n\nIn the late 1930s, a new variety of Art Deco architecture became common; it was called [[Streamline Moderne]] or simply Streamline, or, in France, the Style Paqueboat, or Ocean Liner style.  Buildings in the style were had rounded corners, long horizontal lines; they were built of reinforced concrete, and were almost always white; and sometimes had nautical features, such as railings that resembled those on a ship. The rounded corner was not entirely new; it had appeared in Berlin in 1923 in the [[Mossehaus]] by [[Erich Mendelsohn]], and later in the [[Hoover Building]], an industrial complex in the London suburb of [[Perivale]]. In the United States, it became most closely associated with transport; Streamline moderne was rare in office buildings, but was often used for bus stations and airport terminals, such as terminal at La Guardia airport in New York City that handled the first transatlantic flights, via the PanAm clipper flying boats; and in roadside architecture, such as gas stations and diners. In the late 1930s a series of diners, modeled after streamlined railroad cars, were produced and installed in towns in New England; at least two examples still remain and are now registered historic buildings.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=197}}\n\n==Decoration and motifs==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Fire screen made by Rose Iron Works of Cleveland, 1930.JPG|Iron fireplace screen, Rose Iron Works, [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] (1930)\nFile:Elevator doors of Chrysler Building (1927-30).jpg|Elevator doors of the [[Chrysler Building]],  by [[William Van Alen]] (1927\u201330)\nFile:MilwaukeeGasLightBuilding architecturaldetails.jpg|Sunrise motif from the [[Wisconsin Gas Building]] (1930)\nFile:Oakland Paramount facade mosaic detail 2.jpg|Detail of mosaic facade of [[Paramount Theater (Oakland, California)]] (1931)\n</gallery>\nDecoration in the Art Deco period went through several distinct phases.  Between 1910 and 1920, as Art Nouveau was exhausted, design styles saw a return to tradition, particularly in the work of Paul Iribe. In 1912 Andr\u00e9 Vera published an essay in the magazine ''L'Art D\u00e9coratif'' calling for a return to the craftsmanship and materials of earlier centuries, and using a new repertoire of forms taken from nature, particularly baskets and garlands of fruit and flowers.  A second tendency of Art Deco, also from 1910 to 1920, was inspired by the bright colors of the artistic movement known as the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] and by the colorful costumes and sets of the Ballets Russes. This style was often expressed with exotic materials such as sharkskin, mother of pearl, ivory, tinted leather, lacquered and painted wood, and decorative inlays on furniture that emphasized its geometry.  This period of the style reached its high point in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative Arts.  In the late 1920s and the 1930s, the decorative style changed, inspired by new materials and technologies.  It became sleeker and less ornamental.  Furniture, like architecture, began to have rounded edges and to take on a polished, streamlined look, taken from the streamline moderne style.  New materials, such as chrome-plated steel, aluminum and [[bakelite]], an early form of plastic, began to appear in furniture and decoration.<ref>Explanatory text on Art Deco in the Museum of Decorative Arts, Paris</ref>\n\nThroughout the Art Deco period, and particularly in the 1930s, the motifs of the decor expressed the function of the building.  Theaters were decorated with sculpture which illustrated music, dance, and excitement; power companies showed sunrises, the Chrysler building showed stylized hood ornaments; The friezes of Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e at the 1931 Paris Colonial Exposition showed the faces of the different nationalities of French colonies.  The Streamline style made it appear that the building itself was in motion.  The WPA murals of the 1930s featured ordinary people; factory workers, postal workers, families and farmers, in place of classical heroes.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=250}}\n\n==Furniture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Paul follot, sedia, parigi 1914-16 ca.JPG|Chair by [[Paul Follot]] (1912\u201314)\nFile:Art Deco chair and screen (1912 and 1920).jpg|Armchair by [[Louis S\u00fce]] (1912) and painted screen by [[Andr\u00e9 Mare]] (1920)\nFile:Art Deco dressing table (1919-20).jpg|Dressing table and chair of marble and encrusted, lacquered, and glided wood by [[Paul Follot]] (1919-1920\nFile:Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann (French, 1879-1933).

French furniture manufacturers felt threatened by the growing popularity of German manufacturers and styles, particularly the [[Biedermeier]] style, which was simple and clean-lined. The French designer Frantz Jourdain, the President of the Paris Salon d'Automne, invited designers from Munich to participate in the 1910 Salon. French designers saw the new German style, and decided to meet the German challenge. The French designers decided to present new French styles in the Salon of 1912. The rules of the Salon indicated that only modern styles would be permitted. All of the major French furniture designers took part in Salon: Paul Follot, Paul Iribe, Maurice Dufrene, Andr\u00e9 Groult, Andr\u00e9 Mare and Louis Su\u00eb took part, presenting new works that updated the traditional French styles of Louis XVI and [[Louis Philippe]] with more angular corners inspired by Cubism and brighter colors inspired by Fauvism and the Nabis.{{Sfn|Benton|2002|pages=91-93}}\n\nThe painter Andr\u00e9 Mare and furniture designer [[Louis Su\u00eb]] both participated the 1912 Salon. After the war the two men joined together to form their own company, formally called the ''Compagnie des Arts Fran\u00e7aise'', but usually known simply as Su\u00eb and Mare. Unlike the prominent art nouveau designers like Louis Majorelle, who personally designed every piece, they assembled a team of skilled craftsmen and produced complete interior designs, including furniture, glassware, carpets, ceramics, wallpaper and lighting. Their work featured bright colors and furniture and fine woods, such ebony encrusted with mother of pearl, abalone and silvered metal to create bouquets of flowers. They designed everything from the interiors of ocean liners to perfume bottles for the label of [[Jean Patou]].The firm prospered in the early 1920s, but the two men were better craftsmen than businessmen. The firm was sold in 1928, and both men left.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=51}}\n\nThe most prominent furniture designer at the 1925 Decorative Arts Exposition was \u00c9mile-Jacques Ruhlmann, from Alsace. He first exhibited his works at the 1913 Autumn Salon, then had his own pavilion, the \"House of the Rich Collector\", at the 1925 Exposition. He used only most rare and expensive materials, including [[ebony]], [[mahogany]], [[rosewood]], [[Ambon Island|ambon]] and other exotic woods, decorated with inlays of ivory, tortoise shell, mother of pearl, Little pompoms of silk decorated the handles of drawers of the cabinets.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=15}} His furniture was based upon 18th-century models, but simplified and reshaped. In all of his work, the interior structure of the furniture was completely concealed. The framework usually of oak, was completely covered with an overlay of thin strips of wood, then covered by a second layer of strips of rare and expensive woods. This was then covered with a veneer and polished, so that the piece looked as if it had been cut out of a single block of wood. Contrast to the dark wood was provided by inlays of ivory, and ivory key plates and handles. According to Ruhlmann, armchairs had to be designed differently according to the functions of the rooms where they appeared; living room armchairs were designed to be welcoming, office chairs comfortable, and salon chairs voluptuous. Only a small number of pieces of each design of furniture was made, and the average price of one of his beds or cabinets was greater than the price of an average house.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|page=56}}\n\n[[Jules Leleu]] was a traditional furniture designer who moved smoothly into Art Deco in the 1920s; he designed the furniture for the dining room of the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]], and for the first-class cabins of the steamship ''Normandie''.  his style was characterized by the use of ebony, Macassar wood, walnut, with decoration of plaques of ivory and mother of pearl. He introduced the style of lacquered art deco furniture at the end of in the late 1920s, and in the late 1930s introduced furniture made of metal with panels of smoked glass.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|pages=18-19}} In Italy, the designer [[Gio Ponti]] was famous for his streamlined designs.\n\nThe costly and exotic furniture of Ruhlmann and other traditionalists infuriated modernists, including the architect Le Corbusier, causing him to write a famous series of articles denouncing the ''arts d\u00e9coratif'' style. He attacked furniture made only for the rich, and called upon designers to create furniture made with inexpensive materials and modern style, which ordinary people could afford. He designed his own chairs, created to be inexpensive and mass-produced.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dsgn2/hd_dsgn2.htm Alexandra Griffith Winton, ''Design, 1925\u201350''.

The masters of the late style included Donald Deskey was one of the most influential designers; he created the interior of the Radio City Music Hall. He used a mixture of traditional and very modern materials, including aluminum, chrome, and bakelite, an early form of plastic.{{Sfn|Duncan|1988|page=36}} The [[Waterfall style]] was popular the 1930s and 1940s, the most prevalent Art Deco form of furniture at the time.

It was influenced by modern [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] principles developed for aviation and [[ballistics]] to reduce air friction at high velocities. The bullet shapes were applied by designers to cars, trains, ships, and even objects not intended to move, such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[Fuel dispenser|gas pumps]], and buildings.<ref name=\"Design: A Concise History\" />  One of the first production vehicles in this style was the [[Chrysler Airflow]] of 1933. It was unsuccessful commercially, but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent;  meant modernity. It continued to be used in car design well after World War II.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gartman |first=David |title=Auto Opium |publisher=Routledge |year=1994 |pages=122\u2013124 | isbn=978-0-415-10572-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.phxart.org/exhibition/exhibitioncurves.aspx |title=Curves of Steel: Streamlined Automobile Design |publisher=Phoenix Art Museum |year=2007 | accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Armi |first=C.

These included [[aluminum]], [[chrome plating|chrome]], and bakelite, an early form of plastic. Bakelite could be easily molded into different forms, and soon was used in telephones, radios and other appliances.\n\nOcean liners also adopted a style of Art Deco, known in French as the ''Style Paquebot'', or \"Ocean Liner Style\".  The most famous example was the SS ''Normandie'', which made its first transatlantic trip in 1935.  It was designed particularly to bring wealthy Americans to Paris to shop.  The cabins and salons featured the latest Art Deco furnishings and decoration.  The Grand Salon of the ship, which was the restaurant for first-class passengers, was bigger than the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]].  It was illuminated by electric lights within twelve pillars of Lalique crystal; thirty-six matching pillars lined the walls. This was one of the earliest examples of illumination being directly integrated into architecture. The style of ships was soon adapted to buildings.  A notable example is found on the San Francisco waterfront, where the Maritime Museum building, built as a public bath in 1937, resembles a ferryboat, with ship railings and rounded corners.  The Star Ferry Terminal in Hong Kong also used a variation of the style.<ref name=\"Goss\" />\n\n==Jewelry==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Art Deco bracelet (1925) Museum of Decorative Arts.jpg|Art Deco bracelet of gold, coral and jade (1925) ([[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris]])\nFile:Art Deco glass pendants Rene Lalique.jpg|[[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]] (1925\u201330), molded glass pendants on silk cords\nFile:Art Deco buckle (1925).jpg|[[Boucheron]] (1925), a gold buckle set with diamonds and carved onyx, lapis lazuli, jade, and coral\nCartier 3526707735 f4583fda9a.jpg|[[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]], (1930), ''Mackay Emerald Necklace'', emerald, diamond and platinum, [[Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, USA]]\n</gallery>\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, designers including Ren\u00e9 Lalique and Cartier tried reduce the traditional dominance of [[diamonds]] by introducing more colorful gemstones, such as small emeralds, rubies and sapphires.  They also placed greater emphasis on very elaborate and elegant settings, featuring less-expensive materials such as enamel, glass, horn and ivory.  Diamonds themselves were cut in less traditional forms; the 1925 Exposition saw a large number of diamonds cut in the form of tiny rods or matchsticks.  The settings for diamonds also changed; More and more often jewelers used [[platinum]] instead of gold, since it was strong and flexible, and could set clusters of stones.  Jewelers also began to use more dark materials, such as enamels and black [[onyx]], which provided a higher contrast with diamonds.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}\n\nJewelry became much more colorful and varied in style. Cartier and the firm of Boucheron combined diamonds with colorful other gemstones cut into the form of leaves, fruit or flowers, to make brooches, rings, earrings, clips and pendants. Far Eastern themes also became popular; plaques of jade and coral were combined with platinum and diamonds, and vanity cases, cigarette cases and powder boxes were decorated with Japanese and Chinese landscapes made with mother of pearl, enamel and lacquer.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=121-123}}\n\nRapidly changing fashions in clothing brought new styles of jewelry.  Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were intended for the upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts of women in the twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs.  As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders.  The invention of the wrist-watch before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver.  Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}\n\nThe established jewelry houses of Paris in the period, Cartier, [[Chaumet]], Georges Fouquet, [[Mauboussin]], and [[Van Cleef & Arpels]] all created jewelry and objects in the new fashion. The firm of Chaumet made highly geometric cigarette boxes, cigarette lighters, pillboxes and notebooks, made of hard stones decorated with [[jade]], [[lapis lazuli]], diamonds and sapphires. They were joined by many young new designers, each with his own idea of deco.  [[Raymond Templier]] designed pieces with highly intricate geometric patterns, including silver earrings that looked like skyscrapers. [[Gerard Sandoz]] was only 18 when he started to design jewelry in 1921; he designed many celebrated pieces based on the smooth and polished look of modern machinery. The glass designer Ren\u00e9 Lalique also entered the field, creating pendants of fruit, flowers, frogs, fairies or mermaids made of sculpted glass in bright colors, hanging on cords of silk with tassels.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}  The jeweler [[Paul Brandt]] contrasted rectangular and triangular patterns, and embedded pearls in lines on onyx plaques. [[Jean Despres]] made necklaces of contrasting colors by bringing together silver and black lacquer, or gold with lapis lazuli. Many of his designs looked like highly polished pieces of machines. [[Jean Dunand]] was also inspired by modern machinery, combined with bright reds and blacks contrasting with polished metal.{{sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=125}}\n\n== Glass art ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:'Oiseau de Feu' made by Ren\u00e9 Lalique, Dayton Art Institute.JPG|''The Firebird'' by Ren\u00e9 Lalique (1922)\nFile:Vase (Perruches) by Ren\u00e9 Jules Lalique, 1922, blown four mold glass - Cincinnati Art Museum - DSC04355.JPG|''Parrot'' vase by Ren\u00e9 Lalique (1922)\nFile:Vase aux raisins.jpg|A [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] vase with sculpted grapes (1925)\nFile:Vitraux Louis Majorelle, Grands Bureaux des Aci\u00e9ries de Longwy 03.jpg|Window for a steel mill office by Louis Majorelle  (1928)\nFile:Vase des ann\u00e9es 30 (mus\u00e9e des arts d\u00e9coratifs) (4782889920).jpg|[[Daum (studio)|Daum]] vase (1930\u201335)\n</gallery>\nLike the Art Nouveau period before it, Art Deco was an exceptional period for fine glass and other decorative objects, designed to fit their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was Ren\u00e9 Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period.  He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of [[Fran\u00e7ois Coty]], but he did not begin serious production of art glass until after World War I.  In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects.  He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments.  He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous.  He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash.  Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners [[SS Ile de France|SS ''Ile de France'']] in 1927 and the SS ''Normandie'' in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads.  At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the S\u00e8vres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des M\u00e9tier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}\n\nOther notable Art Deco glass manufacturers included Marius-Ernest Sabino, who specialized in figurines, vases, bowls, and glass sculptures of fish, nudes, and animals.  For these he often used an opalescent glass which could change from white to blue to amber, depending upon the light.  His vases and bowls featured molded friezes of animals, nudes or busts of women with fruit or flowers.  His work was less subtle but more colorful than that of Lalique.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}\n\nOther notable Deco glass designers included Edmond Etling, who also used bright opalescent colors, often with geometric patterns and sculpted nudes; Albert Simonet, and Aristide Colotte and [[Maurice Marinot]], who was known for his deeply etched sculptural bottles and vases.  The firm of [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] from the city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], which had been famous for its Art Nouveau glass, produced a line of Deco vases and glass sculpture, solid, geometric and chunky in form.  More delicate multicolored works were made by [[Gabriel Argy-Rousseau]], who produced delicately colored vases with sculpted butterflies and nymphs, and Francois Decorchemont, whose vases were streaked and marbled.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}}\n\nThe Great Depression ruined a large part of the decorative glass industry, which depended upon wealthy clients.  Some artists turned to designing stained glass windows for churches.  In 1937, the [[Steuben Glass Works|Steuben]] glass company began the practice of commissioning famous artists to produce glassware.{{Sfn|Arwas|1992|pages=245-250}} [[Louis Majorelle]], famous for his Art Nouveau furniture, designed a remarkable Art Deco stained glass window portraying steel workers for the offices of the [[Aci\u00e9ries de Longwy]], a steel mill in [[Longwy]], France.\n\n==Metal art==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Art Deco fireplace grill.jpg|A grill with two wings called \"The Pheasants\", made by Paul Kiss and displayed at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative and Industrial Arts\nFile:Art Deco screen \"Oasis\" 1925.jpg|Iron and copper grill called \"Oasis\" by Edgar Brandt, displayed at the 1925 Paris Exposition\nFile:Grilles de l'entresol, Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e, Paris 2013.jpg|Metal grilles in the lobby of the [[Palais de la Porte Dor\u00e9e]] in Paris by Raymond Subes (1931)\nFile:Norman Bel Geddes.

The exhibits displayed the \u2018ideal\u2019, or better described as the most \u2018modern\u2019 arrangements for various parts of the house, paying close detail to avoid architectural blunders and present the most efficient and well-thought-out models.

In many U.S. cities, historic art deco movie theaters have been preserved and turned into cultural centers.  Even more modest art deco buildings have been preserved as part of America's architectural heritage; an art deco cafe and gas station along Route 66 in Shamrock, Texas is an historic monument.  The Miami Beach Architectural District protects several hundred old buildings, and requires that new buildings comply with the style.  In [[Havana]], Cuba, a large number of Art Deco buildings have badly deteriorated.  Efforts are underway to bring the buildings back to their original color and appearance.\n\nIn the 21st century, modern variants of Art Deco, called Neo Art Deco, have appeared in some American cities, inspired by the classic Art Deco buildings of the 1920s and 1930s.  Examples include the [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], which includes art deco features from Hoover Dam, fifty miles away, and from the [[Will Rogers Memorial Center]] in [[Fort Worth]], Texas, an art deco landmark built in 1936.\n\n==Gallery==\n<!--Please DO ''not'' ADD images directly to this Gallery.

Along with ASCII's use in communication, however, it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period. An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images. In place of images in a regular comic, ASCII art is used, with the text or dialog usually placed underneath.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, graphical browsing and [[variable-width font|variable-width]] [[Computer font|fonts]] became increasingly popular, leading to a decline in ASCII art.

On the other hand, block ASCII artists argue that if their art uses only characters of the computers character set, then it is to be called ASCII, regardless if the character set is proprietary or not.<!--original sentence was entirely ungrammatical; I hope this one gets the proper meaning across-->\n\nMicrosoft Windows does not support the [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI Standard]] x3.16. One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font \"[[Terminal (font)|Terminal]]\", but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist. With a special ASCII/ANSI viewer, such as ACiDView for Windows (see ASCII and ANSI art viewers), one can see block ASCII and ANSI files properly. An example that [[#\"Block\" ASCII art|illustrates the difference]] in appearance is part of this article. Alternatively, one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt.\n\n====\"Amiga\"/\"Oldskool\" style ASCII art====\n[[File:Paso-IceCream-AmigaVsPC.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Oldschool/Amiga ASCII look on Commodore Amiga Computer versus look on the IBM PC (notice the tight spacing)]]\nIn the art scene one popular ASCII style that used the 7-bit standard ASCII character set was the so-called \"Oldskool\" Style. It is also called \"Amiga style\", due to its origin and widespread use on the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] Computers. The style uses primarily the characters: <tt>_/\\-+=.()<>:</tt>. The \"oldskool\" art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures.\nThis is an example of \"[[Amiga]] style\" (also referred to as \"old school\" or \"oldskool\" style) [[computer art scene|scene]] ASCII art.<ref name=\"asciistyles\" />\n\nThe Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992, seven years after the introduction of the Commodore [[Amiga 1000]]. The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did. Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART, Epsilon Design, Upper Class, Unreal (later known as \"DeZign\"). This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC. The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style \"Oldskool\". That term was introduced on the PC. When and by whom is unknown and lost in history.\n\nThe Amiga style ASCII artwork was most often released in the form of a single text file, which included all the artwork (usually requested), with some design parts in between, as opposed to the PC art scene where the art work was released as a [[ZIP archive]] with separate text files for each piece. Furthermore, the releases were usually called \"ASCII collections\" and not \"art packs\" like on the IBM PC.\n\n=====In text editors=====\n<pre style=\"float:right;\">\n _____ ___ ____ _      _   \n|  ___|_ _/ ___| | ___| |_ \n| |_   | | |  _| |/ _ \\ __|\n|  _|  | | |_| | |  __/ |_ \n|_|   |___\\____|_|\\___|\\__|\n\n</pre>\nThis kind of ASCII art is handmade in a text editor. Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include [[CygnusEd]]itor a.k.a. CED ([[Amiga]]) and [[EditPlus]]2 ([[Wintel|PC]]).\n\n[[Oldskool font]] example from the PC, which was taken from the ASCII Editor [[FIGlet]].\n\n====Newskool style ASCII art====\n[[File:Roy-csnewskool.png|right|200px|thumbnail|Newskool ASCII Screenshot]]\n\"Newskool\" is a popular form of ASCII art which capitalizes on character strings like  \"$#Xxo\".  In spite of its name, the style is not \"new\"; on the contrary, it was very old but fell out of favor and was replaced by \"Oldskool\" and \"Block\" style ASCII art. It was dubbed \"Newskool\" upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s.<ref name=\"asciistyles\" />\n\nNewskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of [[Character encoding|extended proprietary characters]]. The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant, but the extended characters are often used for \"fine tuning\" and \"tweaking\". The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of [[Unicode]].\n\n==Methods for generating ASCII art==\n{{Main article|List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art}}\n\nWhile some prefer to use a simple [[text editor]] to produce ASCII art, specialized programs, such as [[JavE]] have been developed that often simulate the features and tools in bitmap image editors. For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor, because to generate the required characters on a standard keyboard, one needs to know the [[alt code]] for each character. for example alt+178 will produce \u2593, alt+177 will produce \u2592 and, alt+8 will produce \u25d8.\n\nThe special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard. Popular MS DOS based editors, such as [[TheDraw]] and ACiDDraw had multiple sets of different special characters mapped to the F-Keys to make the use of those characters easier for the artist who can switch between individual sets of characters via basic keyboard shortcuts. PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP.\n\n===Image to text conversion===\nOther programs allow one to automatically convert an image to text characters, which is a special case of [[vector quantization]]. A method is to sample the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[integer (computer science)|8-bit]] precision, and then assign a character for each value.

During the 1970s it was popular in US [[shopping mall|malls]] to get a [[t-shirt]] with a photograph printed in ASCII art on it from an automated kiosk manned by a computer, and London's [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] had a similar service to produce printed portraits. With the advent of the web and [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full [[RGB color model|RGB]] colorspace, enabling colorized ASCII images.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|| [[File:Redwingblackbird1.jpg|200px]] || [[File:Red-winged blackbird ASCII art.png|200px]] || [[File:bird converted to ASCII characters.png|200px]]\n|}\n</center>\n\nStill images or movies can also be converted to ASCII on various UNIX and UNIX-Like systems using the [http://aa-project.sourceforge.net/aalib aalib (black and white)] or [http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca libcaca (colour)] graphics device driver, or the [[VLC media player]] or [[mpv (media player)|mpv]] under [[Windows]], Linux or [[macOS]]; all of which render the screen using ASCII symbols instead of pixels.  See also [http://oreilly.com/pub/h/4441 O'Reilly article \"Watch Videos in ASCII art\"].\n\nThere are also a number of [[smartphone]] '''applications''', such as ASCII cam for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], that generate ASCII art in real-time using input from the phone's camera. These applications typically allow the ASCII art to be saved as either a text file or as an image made up of ASCII text.\n\n==Non fixed-width ASCII==\nMost ASCII art is created using a [[monospaced font]], where all characters are identical in width ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] is a popular monospaced font). Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospaced fonts for screen and printer displays. Today most of the more commonly used fonts in word processors, web browsers and other programs are proportional fonts, such as [[Helvetica]] or [[Times Roman]], where different widths are used for different characters. ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted, or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font.\n\nSome ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts. These ASCIIs, rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence, use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading. These ASCIIs generally offer greater precision and attention to detail than fixed-width ASCIIs for a lower character count, although they are not as universally accessible since they are usually relatively font-specific.\n\n==Animated ASCII art==\nAnimated ASCII art started in 1970  from so-called VT100 animations produced on [[VT100]] terminals. These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions, deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated. Usually, they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story.\n\nContemporary [[web browser]] revitalized animated ASCII art again. It became possible to display animated ASCII art via [[JavaScript]] or [[Java (Sun)|Java applets]]. Static ASCII art pictures are loaded and displayed one after another, creating the animation, very similar to how movie projectors  unreel film reel and project the individual pictures on the big screen at movie theaters. A new term was born: ''ASCIImation'' \u2013 another name of Animated ASCII Art. A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation.<ref>{{cite web\n   |first=Simon\n   |last=Jansen\n   |date=18 April 2006\n   |url=http://www.asciimation.co.nz/\n   |title=Star \"ASCIImation\" Wars\n   |publisher=Asciimation.co.nz\n   |accessdate=18 November 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081209033917/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/| archivedate= 9 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> More complicated routines in JavaScript generate more elaborate ASCIImations showing effects like [[Morphing]] effects, star field emulations, fading effects and calculated images, such as [[Mandelbrot set|mandelbrot fractal]] animations.<ref name=\"asciimation1\">[http://www.roysac.com/skylined-Morph-ASCIIanimationFrame.html ASCII Animation \"Morph\" by SkyLined (using JavaScript)] includes morph effects and mandelbrot fractal animation</ref><ref name=\"asciimation2\">[http://www.roysac.com/skylined-Starfield-ASCIIanimationFrame.html ASCII Animation Starfield by SkyLined (using JavaScript)] includes fading effect and horizontal scrolling star field emulation</ref>\n\nThere are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols; some of these tools can operate on streaming video. For example, the music video for American singer [[Beck]]'s song \"[[Black Tambourine]]\"<ref name=beckbt>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEXaEYpifhg|title=Beck - Black Tambourine|first=|last=BeckVEVO|date=7 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage. [[VLC media player|VLC]], a media player software, can render any video in colored ASCII through the [[libcaca]] module.\n\n==Other text-based visual art==\nThere are a variety of other types of art using text symbols from character sets other than ASCII and/or some form of color coding. Despite not being pure ASCII, these are still often referred to as \"ASCII art\". The character set portion designed specifically for drawing is known as the line drawing characters or [[pseudo-graphics]].\n\n===ANSI art===\n{{Main article|ANSI art}}\nThe IBM PC graphics hardware in text mode uses 16 bits per character. It supports a variety of configurations, but in its default mode under DOS they are used to give 256 glyphs from one of the IBM PC code pages ([[Code page 437]] by default), 16 foreground colors, eight background colors, and a flash option. Such art can be loaded into screen memory directly. ANSI.SYS, if loaded, also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes. If this method is used then the art becomes known as [[ANSI art]]. The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets. Plain text files are also seen with these characters, though they have become far less common since Windows GUI text editors (using the [[Windows ANSI code page]]) have largely replaced DOS based ones.\n\n===Shift_JIS and Japan===\n{{anchor|Mon\u0101}}\n[[File:Mona01.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Mon\u0101'''|\u30e2\u30ca\u30fc|Mon\u0101}} Posted on {{nihongo|'''[[2ch]]'''|\uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b|Nichanneru}} in 2000]]\n[[File:Gikoneko01.svg|thumb|{{nihongo|'''Gikoneko'''|\u30ae\u30b3\u732b|Giko cat}} Posted on {{nihongo|'''[[2ch]]'''|\uff12\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306d\u308b|Nichanneru}} in 2000]]\n{{Main article|Shift_JIS art}}\nIn Japan, ASCII-art (AA) is mainly known as '''Shift-JIS Art'''. [[Shift JIS]] offers a larger selection of characters than plain ASCII (including [[Japanese language and computers|characters from Japanese scripts]] and [[Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms|fullwidth forms of ASCII characters]]), and may be used for text-based art on Japanese websites.\n\nOften, such artwork is designed to be viewed with the default Japanese font on a platform, such as the proportional MS P Gothic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monafont.sourceforge.net/index-e.html|title=Mona Font|website=monafont.sourceforge.net|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Kaomoji====\n{{Further information|Emoticon#Japanese_style|List of common emoticons#Eastern}}\nUsers on ASCII-NET, in which the word ''ASCII'' refers to the [[ASCII (company)|ASCII Corporation]] rather than the [[American Standard Code for Information Interchange]], popularised a style of {{Nihongo|emoticon|[[wikt:\u9854\u6587\u5b57|\u9854\u6587\u5b57]]|kaomoji|emoticon}} in which the face appears upright rather than rotated.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, finding a suitable fixed-width font is likely to be difficult if a significant subset of Unicode is desired. (Modern UNIX-style operating systems do provide complete fixed-width Unicode fonts, e.g. for [[xterm]]. Windows has the [[Courier New]] font which includes characters like \u250c\u2565\u2500\u2568\u2510\u2665\u263a\u01b8\u0335\u0321\u04dc\u0335\u0328\u0304\u01b7) Also, the common practice of rendering Unicode with a mixture of variable width fonts is likely to make predictable display hard if more than a tiny subset of Unicode is used. \u227d<sup>\u028c</sup>\u2c77\u0485<sub>\u1d25</sub>\u2c77<sup>\u028c</sup>\u227c is an adequate representation of a cat's face in a font with varying character widths.\n\n====Control and combining characters====\n{{or-section|date=May 2015}}\nThe [[combining character]]s mechanism of [[Unicode]] provides considerable ways of customizing the style, even [[obfuscation|obfuscating]] the text (e.g. via an online generator like [http://obfuscator.uo1.net/ Obfuscator], which focuses on the [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3470669/should-unicode-be-allowed-in-usernames filters]). '''Glitcher''' is one example of '''Unicode art''', initiated in 2012: \u00ab ''These symbols, intruding up and down, are made by combining lots of diacritical marks. It\u2019s a kind of art. There\u2019s quite a lot of artists who use the Internet or specific social networks as their canvas.'' \u00bb<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zakas|first1=Laimonas|title=Facebook Page Performance Art Glitchr|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/11/facebook-page-performance-art-glitchr-purposefully-tries-to-activate-code-glitches/|website=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=Glitchr}}</ref> The corresponding creations are favored in web browsers (thanks to their always better [http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/~richard/unicode-sample-3-2.html support]), as [[geek]]ily stylized usernames for social networks.

Besides, the creations can be hand-crafted (by programming), or pasted from mobile applications (e.g. the category of [https://play.google.com/store/search?q=fancy%20text&c=apps 'fancy text'] tools on Android). The underlying technique dates back to the old systems that incorporated [[control character]]s, though. E.g. the German composite <code>\u00f6</code> would be imitated on [[ZX Spectrum]] by [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap16.html overwriting] <code>\"</code> after [[backspace]] and <code>o</code>. (Cf. [[ASCII art#Overprinting (surprint)|below]].)\n\n===Overprinting (surprint)===\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s it was popular to produce a kind of text art that relied on overprinting. This could be produced either on a screen or on a printer by typing a character, backing up, and then typing another character, just as on a typewriter. This developed into sophisticated graphics in some cases, such as the [[PLATO (computer system)|PLATO]] system (c. 1973), where superscript and subscript allowed a wide variety of graphic effects. A common use were for [[emoticon]]s, with WOBTAX and VICTORY both producing convincing smiley faces.<ref>[http://www.platohistory.org/blog/2012/09/plato-emoticons-revisited.html PLATO Emoticons, revisited], Brian Dear, ''[http://www.platohistory.org/ PLATO History: Remembering the future],'' September 19, 2012</ref> Overprinting had previously been used on typewriters, but the low-resolution pixelation of characters on video terminals meant that overprinting here produced seamless pixel graphics, rather than visibly overstruck combinations of letters on paper.\n\nBeyond pixel graphics, this was also used for printing photographs, as the overall darkness of a particular character space dependent on how many characters, as well as the choice of character, were printed in a particular place. Thanks to the increased granularity of tone, photographs were often converted to this type of printout. Even manual typewriters or [[daisy wheel printer]]s could be used. The technique has fallen from popularity since all cheap printers can easily print photographs, and a normal text file (or an e-mail message or Usenet posting) cannot represent overprinted text. However, something similar has emerged to replace it: shaded or colored ASCII art, using ANSI video terminal markup or color codes (such as those found in [[HTML]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and many internet [[message board]]s) to add a bit more tone variation. In this way, it is possible to create ASCII art where the characters only differ in color.\n\n==Creation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\n[[List of text editors#ASCII and ANSI art|ASCII art text editors]] are used to create ASCII art from scratch, or to edit existing ASCII art files.\n\nASCII art may be created from an existing digital image using an '''ASCII art converter''', an online tool or a [[Computer program|software application]] that automatically converts an image into ASCII art, using [[vector quantization]]. Typically, this is done by sampling the image down to [[grayscale]] with less than [[8-bit]] precision, so that each value corresponds to different [[ASCII|ASCII character]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Concrete poetry]]\n* [[Typewriter mystery game]]\n* [[Fax art]]\n* Types and styles: [[ASCII stereogram]], [[Emoticon]], [[FILE ID.DIZ]], [[.nfo]] (release info file)\n* [[Box-drawing characters]]\n* Related art: [[Text semigraphics]], [[ANSI art]], [[ASCII porn]], [[Shift JIS art]]\n* Related (context): [[Text Mode Demo Contest]], [[Bulletin board system]] (BBS), [[Computer art scene]], [[:Category:Artscene groups]]\n* Pre-ASCII history: [[Typewriter]], [[Teleprinter]], [[Radioteletype]], [[ATASCII]], [[PETSCII]]\n* [[Alt code]]\n* Software: [[AAlib]], [[cowsay]]\n* Unicode [[Homoglyph]], [[Duplicate characters in Unicode]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Please replace any deadlinks with archive.org links, instead of removing them -->\n<!-- alphabetical order -->\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Beal\n|first=Vangie\n|url=http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations.asp#smiley\n|year=2008\n|title=Webopedia: Text Messaging, Chat Abbreviations &amp; Smiley Faces\n|publisher=www.Webopedia.com\n|accessdate=5 March 2008\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306032531/http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/textmessageabbreviations.asp| archivedate= 6 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}\n*{{Citation\n|last1=Carlsson\n|first1=Anders\n|last2=Miller\n|first2=A.

The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of \"both convergence and divergence\": some accents are homogenizing and [[accent levelling|levelling]], while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.<ref>Labov, William. 2012.

Pre-publication draft. p. 53-4.</ref>\n\nSome regional American English has undergone \"vigorous new sound changes\" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] (centered on [[Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore]]), [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]] (centered on [[Pittsburgh]]), [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] (centered on [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], and the [[Great Lakes region]]), [[Midland American English|Midland]] (centered on [[Indianapolis]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]) and [[Western American English|Western regional accents]], all of which \"are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago\". Meanwhile, distinguishing features of the [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]] (centered on [[Boston]]) and [[New York City English|New York City accents]] appear to be stable. \"On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns\";<ref name=\"Labov 2010\"/> for example, the traditional accents of [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] and of [[Cincinnati, OH|Cincinnati]] have given way to the Midland regional accent, and of [[St. Louis, MO|St. Louis]] now approaches the sounds of an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the [[Southern American English|Southern regional accent]], despite the huge population it covers,<ref name=\"PBS\"/> \"is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the [[markedness|marked]] features of Southern speech\". Finally, the [[High Tider|\"Hoi Toider\" dialect]] shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in the islands of North Carolina's [[Outer Banks]], yet strengthening in the islands of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center; background:#bfd7ff; width:75%\">'''Major regional dialects of American English'''</div>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-2}}{{Map of American English}} The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps]. Any region may also contain speakers of a \"[[General American]]\" accent that resists the marked features of their region. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic or cultural varieties (such as [[African-American English]], [[Chicano English]], [[Cajun English]], etc.). All regional American English, unless specifically stated otherwise, can be assumed to be [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]], with the [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]], [[Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry merger|''Mary\u2013marry\u2013merry'' merger]], and [[/\u00e6/ tensing|pre-nasal \"short ''a''\" tensing]].<ref group=note>Dialects are considered \"[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]\" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever \"dropping\" this sound. The [[father\u2013bother merger|''father\u2013bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPAc-en|\u0252}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[\u0251~\u00e4]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the \"short ''a''\" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]];

Boston shows a [[cot\u2013caught merger]], while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.\n\n===New York City===\n{{main|New York City English}}\n[[New York City English]] prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around [[New York City]], including [[Long Island]] and northeastern [[New Jersey]]. The [[New York accent]] includes some notable degree of [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] and a locally unique [[\u00e6 tensing|short-''a'' vowel pronunciation split]]. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the {{IPAc-en|a\u028a}} vowel is fronted. The [[cot\u2013caught merger]] is markedly resisted in the New York metropolitan area, as depicted in popular stereotypes like ''tawwk'' and ''cawwfee'', with this {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.\n\n===South===\n{{main|Southern American English}}\nMost [[Older Southern American English|older Southern speech]] along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts was non-rhotic, though, today, almost all Southern dialects are rhotic, and even \"hyper-rhotic\",<ref>Hayes, Dean (2013). \"[http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/ling_etds/15 The Southern Accent and 'Bad English': A Comparative Perceptual Study of the Conceptual Network between Southern Linguistic Features and Identity]\". UNM Digital Repository: Electronic Theses and Dissertations. p. 63.</ref> with a very strongly enunciated, \"bunched-tongue\" ''r'' sound. The modern accent is defined most recognizably by the {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]] to approach {{IPA|[a\u02d0~\u00e4\u02d0]}}, the initiation event for the Southern Vowel Shift. This vowel shift involves the \"[[Southern drawl]]\" that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.<ref name=\"Labov 2006 125\"/> The most advanced sub-varieties exist in the southern Appalachian cities and certain areas of Texas. Non-Southern Americans tend to stereotype Southern accents negatively, associating them with slowness, lack of education, bigotry, and religious or political conservatism,<ref>Hayes, 2013, p. vi.</ref> with labels for the accent such as \"hick\" or \"hillbilly\".<ref>Hayes, 2013, p. 51.</ref> Meanwhile, Southerners themselves tend to have mixed judgments of their own accents, some negative but some positively associated with a laid-back, plain, or humble attitude.<ref>Hayes, 2013, p. 39.</ref>\n===North===\n{{main|Northern American English}}\nSince the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the \"[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]\", as defined by its [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] ({{IPAc-en|\u00e6}} raising, {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}} fronting, and other vowel changes), occurring in the same region whose \"standard Midwestern\" speech was the basis for [[General American]] in the mid-twentieth century, though prior to the full Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The Inland Northern accent was lampooned on the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s \"[[Bill Swerski's Superfans]]\" segments, though the accent's shift may be reversing in certain communities.<ref name=\"lansing\">{{cite journal | url = http://msusociolinguistics.weebly.com/uploads/9/3/1/9/9319621/reversalandreorganization_nwav44.pdf | format = PDF | first1 = S.

The vocabulary of its older speakers was divided into two discrete subdivisions, the \"North Midland\" that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the \"South Midland\" speech, which to the average American ear has a slight trace of the \"[[Southern American English|Southern accent]]\" (especially due to some degree of {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}} glide weakening). Modern Midland speech is transitional between a presence and absence of the [[cot\u2013caught merger]]. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect; however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh dialect]]s documented since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\n===West===\n{{main|Western American English}}\nA generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse [[Western American English]] that unites the entire western half of the country, mostly unified by a firm [[cot\u2013caught merger]] and a [[conservative (linguistics)|conservatively]] backed pronunciation of the long ''oh'' sound in ''goat, toe, show'', etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long ''oo'' sound in ''goose, lose, tune,'' etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as [[Pacific Northwest English]] and [[California English]], with the native-speaker [[Chicano English|English of Mexican Americans]] also being a sub-type primarily of the Western dialect. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.\n\n===Other varieties===\nAlthough no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. Trudgill, p.42.</ref> [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and \"[[Yinglish]]\" are spoken by some [[American Jews]], [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{See also|General American|North American English regional phonology}}\n\nCompared with [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]], North American English<ref>''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in both the United States and [[Canada]].</ref> is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as \"[[General American]]\". This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.\n\nStudies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary [[British English]] has since lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm |title=What Is the Difference between Theater and Theatre? |publisher=Wisegeek.org |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref> One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of [[Hiberno-English]], [[West Country English]] and [[Scottish English]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=25484343 |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25484343?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21102054774863 |title=Early Mainland Residues in Southern Hiberno-English |accessdate=29 May 2013 |doi=10.2307/25484343 |volume=20}}</ref> In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter {{Angbr|r}} is a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279\u0320]}} or [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[\u027b]}} rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique \"bunched tongue\" variant of the approximant ''r'' sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.<ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W.

Non-rhotic speech may be heard from [[African-American English|black speakers]] throughout the whole country.<ref>Labov, p. 48.</ref>]]\n\nTraditionally, the \"East Coast\" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [[New England]], the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the [[Southern United States]]. The only traditionally [[rhoticity in English|''r''-dropping]] (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Gulf Coast (particularly still in Louisiana), because these areas were in close historical contact with [[England]] and imitated prestigious varieties of ''r''-dropping London (a feature now widespread throughout most of England) at a time when they were undergoing changes.<ref>Trudgill, pp. 46\u201347.</ref> Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of [[New England English|eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York City]], older speakers of the [[older Southern American English|former plantation South]], and [[African-American Vernacular English]] (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in \"bird\", \"work\", \"hurt\", \"learn\", etc. usually retains its ''r'' pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these few varieties, American accents are [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]], pronouncing every instance of the {{angbr|r}} sound.\n\nMany British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]], for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a [[trap\u2013bath split]], fronting of {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}}, and [[H-dropping]], none of which typical American accents show. The innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottaling]], which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] [[nasal consonant]], like in the words ''button'' or ''satin'') and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father\u2013bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/\u0251/}} and {{IPA|/\u0252/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme.

Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], [[New York accent]], and [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic States accents]], and many [[Southern American English|Southern accents]], prominently including [[Yat dialect|New Orleans accents]].{{clarify|reason=Verification needed for \"many\" Southern dialects.

The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as it is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283\u025a]}}.\n* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is much more extensive than in most of England. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonants (i.e. everywhere except after /p/, /b/, /f/, /h/, /k/, and /m/) so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, presume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[\u02c8tuzde\u026a]}}, {{IPA|[p\u0279\u026a\u02c8zum]}}.\n* [[/\u00e6/ tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of \"continuum\" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[m\u00e6s]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[me\u0259\u032fn]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} and {{IPA|[e\u0259\u032f]}} are entirely separate (or \"split\") phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[p\u026b\u00e6n\u026a\u0308t\u031a]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[p\u026be\u0259n\u026a\u0308t\u031a]}}. This is often called the Mid-Atlantic [[/\u00e6/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] system. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed British \"[[broad A]]\"; this phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} changes to {{IPA|/\u0251/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /\u03b8/, /\u00f0/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.\n\n{{/\u00e6/ tensing in North American English|hidden=yes}}\n* [[Flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} before unstressed vowels (as in \"bu''tt''er\" {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028c\u027e\u0259\u0279]}}, \"par''t''y\" {{IPA|[\u02c8p\u0251\u0279\u027ei]}}) and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (\"bo''tt''le\" {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0251\u027e\u0259\u026b]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (\"wha''t'' else\" {{IPA|[w\u028c\u02c8\u027e\u025b\u026bs]}}, \"wha''t''ever\" {{IPA|[w\u028c\u02c8\u027e\u025bv\u0259\u0279]}}). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same, except with the stressed {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} (see below).\n* [[Canadian raising]] of {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}: many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant, so that in ''writer'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} but in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is voiced). This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/a\u028a/}}. In many areas and idiolects, a distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u028c\u026a\u027e\u025a]}} for \"writer\" as opposed to {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u00e4\u026a\u027e\u025a]}} for \"rider\".\n** Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] dialect areas raise {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''cyber-'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} rather than {{IPA|[a\u026a]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[\u028c\u026a]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}</ref>\n* L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a \"clear L\" (i.e. [[l (IPA)|{{IPA|[l]}}]]) and a \"dark L\" (i.e. [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[\u026b]}}]] or sometimes even [[Velar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[\u029f]}}]]) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English; it is often altogether absent.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editors=Grzegorz Dogil, Susanne Maria Reiterer, and Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&pg=PA299&dq=\"general+american\"+\"velarized\"}}</ref> Instead, most U.S. speakers pronounce all \"L\" sounds with a tendency to be \"dark\", meaning with some degree of [[velarization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}}</ref> The only notable exceptions to this are in some Spanish-influenced U.S. English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear \"L\" in [[syllable onset]]s); in [[New York City English]], where the {{IPA|/l/}} is clear in prevocalic positions;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wells|first1=John C.|title=Accents of English: Vowel 3: Beyond the British Isles|date=April 8, 1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=515|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Accents_of_English_Volume_3.html?id=484eVQ7t8TMC}}</ref> and in [[Older Southern American English|older, moribund Southern speech]] of the U.S., where \"L\" is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s.<ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W.

Among syntactical constructions that arose are ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,'' etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in \"finished\"), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''.\n\nA number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]].

Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology\".<ref>Algeo, John. \"The Effects of the Revolution on Language\", in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).<ref>Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.</ref> AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called \"comma splices\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web\n  |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html\n |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks\n |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association\n |year=2011\n |format=blog\n |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nAmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either [sk] or [\u0283].<ref>{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Language}}\n* [[Dictionary of American Regional English]]\n* [[List of English words from indigenous languages of the Americas]]\n* [[IPA chart for English]]\n* [[Regional accents of English speakers]]\n* [[Canadian English]]\n* [[North American English]]\n* [[International English]]\n* [[Received Pronunciation]]\n* [[Mid-Atlantic accent|Transatlantic accent]]\n* [[American and British English spelling differences]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|last=Labov|first=William|authorlink=William Labov|last2=Ash|first2=Sharon|last3=Boberg|first3=Charles|author3link=Charles Boberg|ref=harv|year=2006|title=The Atlas of North American English|location=Berlin|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|isbn=3-11-016746-8}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Richard W.

Spalding]] sporting goods company. He was born and raised in [[Byron, Illinois]].  He played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878. Spalding set a trend when he started wearing a [[baseball glove]], and eventually opened his sporting goods store.\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Spalding remained active with the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] as president and part-owner. In the 1880s, he took players on the first world tour of baseball. With [[William Hulbert]], Spalding organized the [[National League]]. He later called for the commission that investigated the origins of baseball and credited [[Abner Doubleday]] with creating the game. He also wrote the first set of official baseball rules.\n\n==Baseball career==\n\n===Player===\nHaving played baseball throughout his youth, Spalding first played competitively with the [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]] Pioneers, a youth team, which he joined in 1865. After pitching his team to a 26\u20132 victory over a local men's amateur team (the Mercantiles), he was approached at the age of 15 by another squad, the Forest Citys, for whom he played for two years.<ref name=\"Starr\">{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Raymond|date=Winter 1986|title=Book review: A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=32|issue=1|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/86winter/spalding.htm}}</ref> In the autumn of 1867 he accepted a $40 per week contract (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|40|1867}}}} in today's dollars), nominally as a clerk, but really to play professionally for the Chicago Excelsiors, not an uncommon arrangement used to circumvent the rules of the time, which forbade the hiring of professional players. Following the formation of baseball's first professional organization, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (which became known as the National Association, the Association, or NA) in 1871, Spalding joined the [[History of the Boston Braves#Boston years|Boston Red Stockings]] (precursor club to the modern [[Atlanta Braves]]) and was highly successful; [[win (baseball)|winning]] 206 games (and losing only 53) as a pitcher and [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] .323 as a hitter.\n\n[[William Hulbert]], principal owner of the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]], did not like the loose organization of the National Association and the gambling element that influenced it, so he decided to create a new organization, which he dubbed the [[National League]] of Baseball Clubs. To aid him in this venture, Hulbert enlisted the help of Spalding. Playing to the pitcher's desire to return to his Midwestern roots and challenging Spalding's integrity, Hulbert convinced Spalding to sign a contract to play for the White Stockings (now known as the [[Chicago Cubs]]) in 1876. Spalding then coaxed teammates [[Deacon White]], [[Ross Barnes]] and [[Cal McVey]], as well as [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860\u201376)|Philadelphia Athletics]] players [[Cap Anson]] and [[Bob Addy]], to sign with Chicago. This was all done under complete secrecy during the playing season because players were all free agents in those days and they did not want their current club and especially the fans to know they were leaving to play elsewhere the next year. News of the signings by the Boston and Philadelphia players leaked to the press before the season ended and all of them faced verbal abuse and physical threats from the fans of those cities.\n\nHe was \"the premier pitcher of the 1870s\", leading the league in victories for each of his six full seasons as a professional.<ref name = \"fame\" /> During each of those years he was his team's only pitcher.<ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/theymadeamerica/whomade/spalding_hi.html|title=Albert G. Spalding|work=Who Made America?|publisher=PBS|accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> In 1876, Spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the White Stockings and led them to win the first-ever National League [[Pennant (sports)#Pennants as trophies|pennant]] by a wide margin.<ref name = \"fame\" />\n\nIn 1877, Spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand. People had used gloves previously, but they were not popular, and Spalding himself was skeptical of wearing one at first. However, once he began donning gloves, he influenced other players to do so.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOcPDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Old Time Baseball: America's Pastime in the Gilded Age|last=Frommer|first=Harvey|publisher=[[Rowman and Littlefield]]|year=2016|isbn=9781630760076|location=[[Guilford, Connecticut]]|pages=79\u201380|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nSpalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 at the age of 27, although he continued as president and part owner of the White Stockings and a major influence on the National League. Spalding's .796 career winning percentage (from an era when teams played about once or twice a week) is the highest ever by a baseball pitcher, far exceeding the second-best .690.\n\n===Organizer and executive===\nIn the months after signing for Chicago, Hulbert and Spalding organized the National League by enlisting the two major teams in the East and the four other top teams in what was then considered to be the West, also known as the jungle. Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from [[Cincinnati]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[St. Louis]]. The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York City, [[Philadelphia]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Boston]]. Each signed the league's constitution, and the National League was officially born. \"Spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport.\"<ref name = \"Starr\" /> Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons, it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball. Gradually, it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country.\n\nIn 1886, with Spalding as President of the franchise, the Chicago White Stockings (today's [[Chicago Cubs]]), began holding [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotsprings.org/pages/history-buffs/|title=arlington hotel, oaklawn, gangster museum, hot springs baseball trail, historical landmarks - Hot Springs, Arkansas |website=www.hotsprings.org}}</ref><ref name=\"encyclopediaofarkansas.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6221|title=Major League Spring Training in Hot Springs - Encyclopedia of Arkansas |website=www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}</ref> which subsequently has been called the \"birthplace\" of spring training baseball. The location and the training concept was the brainchild of Spalding and his player/manager [[Cap Anson]], who saw that the city and the natural springs created positives for their players. They first played in an area called the '''Hot Springs Baseball Grounds'''. Many other teams followed the concept and began training in Hot Springs  and other locations.<ref name=\"encyclopediaofarkansas.net\"/>\n\nIn 1905, after [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the British sports of [[cricket]] and [[rounders]], Spalding called for a [[Abraham G. Mills#The Mills Commission|commission]] to find out the real source of baseball. The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters. After three years of searching, on December 30, 1907, Spalding received a letter that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of [[Abner Doubleday]]. The commission, though, was biased, as Spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the English sport of rounders. Just before the commission, in a letter to sportswriter [[Tim Murnane]], Spalding noted, \"Our good old American game of baseball must have an [[American Dad]].\" The project, later called the Mills Commission, concluded that \"Base Ball had its origins in the United States\" and \"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence available to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown, N.Y.]], in 1839.\"\n\nReceiving the archives of Henry Chadwick in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write \"[[America's National Game]]\" (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the [[history of baseball]].<ref name = \"PBS\" />\n\n===Businessman===\nIn 1874 while Spalding was playing and organizing the league, Spalding and his brother Walter began a sporting goods store in Chicago, which grew rapidly (14 stores by 1901) and expanded into a manufacturer and distributor of all kinds of sporting equipment. The company became \"synonymous with sporting goods\"<ref name = \"Starr\" /> and is still a going concern.\n\nSpalding published the first official rules guide for baseball. In it he stated that only Spalding balls could be used (previously, the quality of the balls used had been subpar). Spalding also founded the \"Baseball Guide\", which at the time was the most widely read baseball publication.\n\nIn 1888\u20131889, Spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding sporting goods]]. This was the first-ever world baseball tour.<ref name = \"fame\" /> Playing across the western U.S., the tour made stops in Hawaii (although no game was played), New Zealand, Australia, [[Ceylon]], Egypt, Italy, France, and England. The tour returned to grand receptions in New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. The tour included future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]rs Cap Anson and [[John Montgomery Ward]]. While the players were on the tour, the National League instituted new rules regarding player pay that led to a revolt of players, led by Ward, who started the [[Players' League]] the following season (1890). The league lasted one year, partially due to the anti-competitive tactics of Spalding to limit its success.  The tour and formation of the Player's League is depicted in the 2015 movie \"Deadball.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4531902/|title=Deadball|date=15 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1900 Spalding was appointed by [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] as the USA's Commissioner at that year's [[1900 Olympic Games|Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name = \"PBS\" />\n\n==Other activities==\nSpalding had been a prominent member of the Theosophical Society under [[William Quan Judge]].  In 1900, Spalding moved to [[San Diego]] with his newly acquired second wife, Elizabeth<ref name = \"Starr\" /> and became a prominent member and supporter of the [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophical]] community [[Lomaland]], which was being developed on [[Point Loma, California|Point Loma]] by [[Katherine Tingley]]. He built an estate in the [[Sunset Cliffs, San Diego|Sunset Cliffs]] area of Point Loma where he lived with Elizabeth for the rest of his life. The Spaldings raised race horses and collected Chinese fine furniture and art.\n\nThe Spaldings had an extensive library which included many volumes on Theosophy, art, and literature. In 1907\u201309 he was the driving force behind the development of a paved road, known as the \"Point Loma boulevard\", from downtown San Diego to Point Loma and [[Ocean Beach, San Diego|Ocean Beach]]; the road also provided good access to Lomaland. It later provided the basis for [[California State Route 209]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Street Work Pay is Puzzle | work=The San Diego Union and Daily Bee | date=April 23, 1909 | author=Staff | page=8}}</ref> He proposed the project, supervised it on behalf of the city, and paid a portion of the cost out of his own pocket.

It was one of the most popular games in the 1960s [[3M bookshelf game series]], and the only one still published in the United States.\n\n==Components==\nThe following components are included in all versions:\n\n* a compact game board with a hundred spaces (or a few more) in a rectangular array\n* sequenced tiles corresponding to the spaces on the board\n* a number of different colored markers, representing different hotel chains\n* shares of stock for each of the hotel chains\n* A supply of play money, in various denominations from $100 up\n* a set of charts listing the market prices of shares of the chains\n* an instruction manual\n\n==History==\nAcquire started life as the [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] gambling-themed board game [[Lotto (game)|Lotto]] played in childhood by [[Sid Sackson]], who went on to become a game designer.  He reworked the game into a wargame he called \"Lotto War\".  Sackson (along with [[Alex Randolph]]) was commissioned by 3M to start a new games division in 1962.  When he submitted the game to 3M in 1963, he called the game \"Vacation\".  3M suggested the name change to Acquire, and Sackson agreed.  The game was test marketed in several U.S. cities in 1963, and production began in 1964 as a part of the [[3M bookshelf game series|bookshelf games series]].<ref name=\"HG\">{{Cite book | contribution=Acquire | title=Hobby Games: The 100 Best | last=Shelley | first=Bruce C. | authorlink=Bruce Shelley | editor-last=Lowder | editor-first=James | editor-link=James Lowder | publisher=[[Green Ronin Publishing]] | year=2007 | pages=1\u20134 | isbn=978-1-932442-96-0}}</ref>  The 3M game division was sold to [[Avalon Hill]] in 1976 and became part of their bookcase game series.

Hasbro slightly reworked and reissued the game in 2000, but thereafter discontinued it.  In the mid-2000s, the game was transferred to a Hasbro subsidiary [[Wizards of the Coast]]. In 2008, Wizards issued a ''50th Anniversary'' edition (though the game wasn't 50 years old).  In 2016, the game was transferred back to the Hasbro games division and republished in Nov. 2016 under the Avalon label.\n\nIn most versions, the theme of the game is investing in [[hotel]] chains. In the 1990s [[Hasbro]] edition, the hotel chains were replaced by fictitious corporations, though the actual gameplay was unchanged. In the current Avalon edition, the companies are once again hotel chains.\n\nThe components of the game have varied over the years. In particular, the tiles have been made from wood, plastic, and cardboard in various editions of the game. In the 2008 version, the tiles were cardboard.  In the 2016 version, the tiles are plastic, but the board size was reduced, from 9x12 to 10x10.\n\n==Gameplay==\nA short setup precedes play, wherein each player receives play cash and a small random set of playing tiles and becomes\nthe founder of a nascent hotel chain by drawing and placing a tile representing a hotel on the board.  Tiles are\nordered, and correspond to spaces on the board.  Position of the starting tiles determines order of play.\n\nPlay consists of placing a tile on the board and optionally buying stock.  The placed tile may found a new hotel\nchain, grow an existing one or merge two or more chains.  Chains are sets of edge-wise adjacent tiles. Founders\nreceive a share of stock in new chains. A chain can become \"safe\", immune to acquisition, by attaining a specified\nsize.  Following placement of a tile, the player may then buy a limited number of shares of stock in existing chains.\nShares have a market value determined by the size and stature of the hotel chain.  At the end of his\nturn, the player receives a new tile to replace the one played.\n\nWhen mergers occur, the smaller chain becomes defunct, and its tiles are then part of the acquiring chain. The two\nlargest shareholders in the acquired chain receive cash bonuses; players may sell their shares in the defunct chain,\ntrade them in for shares of the acquiring chain, or keep them.  Mergers between 3 or more chains are handled in order \nfrom larger to smaller.\n\nA player during his turn may declare the game at an end if the largest chain exceeds a specified size (about 40%\nof the board), or all chains on the board are too large to be acquired.  When the game ends, shareholder bonuses\nare paid to the two largest shareholders of each chain, and players cash out their shares at market price (shares\nin any defunct chains are worthless).  The player with the most money wins.\n\nAn interesting and optional aspect of gameplay is whether numbers of players' shares is public or private information.\nThis is negotiated before the game starts.  Keeping this information private can greatly extend the game: when players\nare less certain of their status, they are less willing to end the game.\n\nAcquire is for 3\u20136 players, and takes about an hour and a half to play.\n\n==Awards==\nThe game was short-listed for the first [[Spiel des Jahres]] board game awards in 1979.<ref name=\"sjd\">Spiel des Jahres page for Acquire in German</ref>\n\n''[[GAMES Magazine|GAMES]]'' magazine has inducted ''Acquire'' into their buyers' guide [[GAMES 100#Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"hof\">[http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/gameslinks/hallofame.html GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417062722/http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/gameslinks/hallofame.html |date=2010-04-17 }}.

This first generation of native-born children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation. The Australian-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the British Isles, in particular from [[Ireland]] and [[South East England]].<ref name=\"Moore 2008 69\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Bruce|title=Speaking our Language: the Story of Australian English|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-19-556577-0|page=69}}</ref>\n\nThe native-born children in the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them, and with it expressed [[Peer pressure|peer solidarity]]. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech.\n\nA quarter of the convicts were Irish. Many had been arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most, of the Irish spoke [[Irish language|Irish]] and either no English at all, or spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking parts of Britain, such as the [[Scottish Highlands]], [[Wales]] and parts of [[Cornwall]].\n\nRecords from the early 19th century show this distinct dialect in the colonies after the [[First Fleet|first settlement]] in 1788.<ref name=\"clas.mq.edu.au\"/> [[Peter Miller Cunningham]]'s 1827 book ''Two Years in New South Wales'', described the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native-born colonists, that differed from that of their parents and with a strong London influence.<ref name=\"Moore 2008 69\"/> [[Anthony Burgess]] writes that \"Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|title=A Mouthful of Air: Language and Languages, especially English|year=1992|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=0091774152<!--page?-->}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Doudiet Swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Australian gold rushes]] saw many external influences on the language.]]\nThe first of the [[Australian gold rushes]], in the 1850s, began a large wave of [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]], during which about two per cent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=The Rush that Never Ended: a History of Australian Mining|year=1993|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=0-522-84557-6|edition=4}}</ref> According to linguist Bruce Moore, \"the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England\".<ref name=\"Moore 2008 69\"/>\n\nSome elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|adopted by Australian English]]\u2014mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]]) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as ''kangaroo'', ''boomerang'', ''budgerigar'', ''wallaby'' and so on have become international. Other examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''hard yakka''. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced {{IPA|/k\u0289\u02d0i\u02d0/}}){{fix|text=stress?|date=March 2018}} which travels long distances. ''Cooee'' is also a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Turrubal language|Jagera]]/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.\n\nAlso of Aboriginal origin is the word ''bung'', from the Sydney [[pidgin]] English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning \"dead\", with some extension to \"broken\" or \"useless\". Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The best-known example is the capital, Canberra, named after a local language word meaning \"meeting place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Canberra Facts and figures|url=http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Visitor-Info/Facts-and-figures.aspx|accessdate=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cxr1nR7h?url=http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Visitor-Info/Facts-and-figures.aspx|archive-date=16 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAmong the changes starting in the 19th century were the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from [[North American English]].

The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels.

As with North American English, [[Intervocalic alveolar flapping]] is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} surface as the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} after [[sonorant]]s other than {{IPA|/m, \u014b/}} as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. For many speakers, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in the combinations {{IPA|/tr/}} and {{IPA|/dr/}}-are also palatalised, thus {{IPA|/t\u0283r/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292r/}}, as Australian {{IPA|/r/}} is only very slightly retroflex, the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}<!--Such an articulation could hardly be identified as an /r/ or considered even slightly retroflex.--> in the same position as for {{IPA|/w/}}; it is also somewhat rounded (\"to say 'r' the way Australians do you need to say 'w' at the same time\"), where older English {{IPA|/wr/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} have fallen together as {{IPA|[r\u02b7]}}. The [[wine\u2013whine merger]] is complete in Australian English.\n\n[[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] occurs after {{IPA|/s/}},  {{IPA|/z/}} and, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. Other cases of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}}, along with {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}, have [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-coalescence|coalesced]] to {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/\u0292/}}, {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} respectively for many speakers. {{IPA|/j/}} is generally retained in other [[consonant cluster]]s.\n\nIn common with most varieties of [[Scottish English]] and [[American English]], the phoneme {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced as a \"dark\" (velarised) L ({{IPA|[\u026b]}}) in all positions, unlike other dialects such as [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[Hiberno-English|Hiberno (Irish) English]], where a light L (i.e., a non-velarised L) is used in many positions.\n\n===Pronunciation===\nDifferences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between Australian English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility.\n\nThe affixes ''-ary'', ''-ery'', ''-ory'', ''-bury'', ''-berry'' and ''-mony'' (seen in words such as ''necessary, mulberry'' and ''matrimony'') can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa. Although some words like ''necessary'' are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of Australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel.\n\nWords ending in unstressed ''-ile'' derived from Latin adjectives ending in ''-ilis'' are pronounced with a full vowel ({{IPA|/\u0251el/}}), so that ''fertile'' rhymes with ''fur tile'' rather than ''turtle''.\n\nIn addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to seemingly random words. For example, as with American English, the vowel in ''yoghurt'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/\u0259\u0289/}} (\"long 'O'\") rather than {{IPA|/\u0254/}} (\"short o\"); ''vitamin'', ''migraine'' and ''privacy'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0251e/}} (as in ''mine'') rather than {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u026a/}} respectively; ''paedophile'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}; and ''urinal'' is pronounced with [[schwa]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u0251e/}} (\"long i\"). As with British English, ''advertisement'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/\u026a/}}; ''tomato'' and ''vase'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (as in ''father'') instead of {{IPA|/\u00e6\u026a/}}; ''zebra'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}; and ''buoy'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/bo\u026a/}} (as in ''boy'') rather than {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0289\u02d0i\u02d0/}}. Two examples of miscellaneous pronunciations which contrast with both standard American and British usages are ''data'', which may be pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}} (\"dah\") instead of {{IPA|/\u00e6\u026a/}} (\"day\"); and ''maroon'', pronounced with {{IPA|/\u0259\u0289/}} (\"own\") as opposed to {{IPA|/\u0289\u02d0/}} (\"oon\").\n\n==Variation==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+ Variation in Australian closing diphthongs<ref>{{citation\n|last=Wells\n|first=John C.\n|authorlink=John C.

There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use.\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=australian english &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=australian english defined &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].\n\n===Regional variation===\nAlthough Australian English is relatively homogeneous, there are some regional variations. The dialects of English spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]], [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Torres Strait English|Torres Strait Islands]] differ slightly in vocabulary and phonology.\n\nMost regional differences are in word usage. Swimming clothes are known as ''cossies'' or ''swimmers'' in New South Wales, ''togs'' in Queensland, and ''bathers'' in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-05/what-do-you-call-battered-deep-fried-potato-snack-linguistic/7069684|title=Divide over potato cake and scallop, bathers and togs mapped in 2015 Linguistics Roadshow|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Kellie Scott|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=5 January 2016}}</ref> What most of Australia calls a ''stroller'' is usually called a ''pram'' in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.<ref name=\"Pauline Bryant 1985\">Pauline Bryant (1985): Regional variation in the Australian English lexicon, Australian Journal of Linguistics, 5:1, 55-66</ref> Preference for some synonymous words also differ between states. ''Garbage'' (i.e., garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over ''rubbish'' in New South Wales and Queensland, while ''rubbish'' is more popular in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia.<ref name=\"Pauline Bryant 1985\"/> The word ''footy'' generally refers to the most popular [[Football in Australia|football code]] in an area; that is, [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]] depending on the local area, in most of New South Wales and Queensland, and [[Australian rules football]] elsewhere. Beer glasses are also [[Australian English vocabulary#Alcohol|named differently]] in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh'' (also spelled ''ay'' or ''aye''), which is particularly associated with Queensland.\n\nThere are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words. The [[Trap\u2013bath split|trap\u2011bath split]] is more complete in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country. This resulted in a British English influence that lasted longer that of the other colonies. Words such as ''dance'', ''advance'', ''plant'', ''graph'', ''example'' and ''answer'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} (as in ''father'') far more frequently in South Australia while elsewhere in Australia the older {{IPA|/\u00e6/}} (as in ''mad'') is more common.<ref name=\"Pauline Bryant 1985\"/> [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]] is also more common in South Australia than other states.  In Western Australian and Queensland English, the vowels in ''near'' and ''square'' are typically realised as centring diphthongs (\"nee-ya\"), whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/regional-accents |title=regional accents &#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> A feature common in Victorian English is [[English-language vowel changes before historic l#Salary\u2013celery merger|salary\u2013celery merger]], whereby a Victorian pronunciation of ''Ellen'' may sound like ''Alan'' to speakers from other states. There is also regional variation in {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} (as in ''school'' and ''pool'').\n\n==Vocabulary==\n===Intrinsic traits===\n{{Main|Australian English vocabulary}}\n[[File:Banjo Patterson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bush poets such as [[Banjo Paterson]] captured the Australian vocabulary of the 19th century in their [[bush ballad]]s.]]\n\nAustralian English has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively, with the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'', widely regarded as the national standard, incorporating numerous Australian terms.<ref>\"The Macquarie Dictionary\", Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.</ref>\n\nInternationally well-known examples of Australian terminology include ''[[outback]]'', meaning a remote, sparsely populated area, ''[[the bush]]'', meaning either a native forest or a country area in general, and ''g'day'', a greeting. ''Dinkum'', or ''fair dinkum'' means \"true\" or \"is that true?\", among other things, depending on context and inflection.<ref>[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html Frederick Ludowyk, 1998, \"Aussie Words: The Dinkum Oil On Dinkum; Where Does It Come From?\" (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)]. Access date: 5 November 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316062047/http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html |date=16 March 2011 }}</ref> The derivative ''dinky-di'' means \"true\" or devoted: a \"dinky-di Aussie\" is a \"true Australian\".\n\n[[Australian performance poetry|Australian poetry]], such as \"[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]\", as well as [[Australian folk music|folk songs]] such as \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", contain many historical Australian words and phrases that are understood by Australians even though some are not in common usage today.\n\nAustralian English, in common with several British English dialects (for example, [[Cockney]], [[Scouse]], [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Geordie]]), uses the word ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]''. Many words used by Australians were at one time used in the United Kingdom but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there.\n\nFor example, ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea; ''paddock'' in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; ''bush'' or ''scrub'' in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]).\n\n[[Litotes]], such as \"not bad\", \"not much\" and \"you're not wrong\", are also used, as are [[diminutive]]s, which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''[[smoko]]'' (cigarette break), ''Aussie'' (Australian) and ''pressie'' (present/gift). This may also be done with people's names to create [[nickname]]s (other English speaking countries create [[English diminutive|similar diminutives]]). For example, \"Gazza\" from Gary, or \"Smitty\" from John Smith. The use of the suffix ''-o'' originates in Irish Gaelic{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} (Irish ''\u00f3''), which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in Australian English.\n\nIn informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as \"sweet as\" (as in \"That car is sweet as.\"). \"Full\", \"fully\" or \"heaps\" may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in \"The waves at the beach were heaps good.\"). This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia{{When|date=September 2014}} but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades. The suffix \"-ly\" is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English. For instance, \"really good\" can become \"real good\".\n\nAustralia's switch to the [[metric system]] in the 1970s changed most of the country's vocabulary of measurement from [[imperial units|imperial]] to metric measures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.gov.au/measurementsystem/Pages/HistoryofMeasurementinAustralia.aspx |title=History of Measurement in Australia |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |work=web page |publisher=Australian Government National Measurement Institute |accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref> Since the switch to metric, heights of individuals are listed in centimetres on official documents such as a driver's licence but older people understand and may speak of feet and inches.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilks|first1=Kevin|title=Metrication in Australia: A review of the effectiveness of policies and procedures in Australia's conversion to the metric system|date=1992|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|location=Canberra|isbn=0 644 24860 2|page=114|url=http://themetricmaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Metrication-in-Australia-built-2013-06-24.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2017|quote=Measurements used by people in their private lives, in conversation or in estimation of sizes had not noticeably changed nor was such a change even attempted or thought necessary.}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison with other varieties===\nWhere [[American and British English differences|British and American vocabulary differs]], Australians sometimes favour a usage different from both varieties, as with footpath (for US sidewalk, UK pavement), capsicum (for US bell pepper, UK green/red pepper), or doona  (for US [[comforter]], UK [[duvet]]) from a trademarked brand. In other instances, it either shares a term with American English, as with [[truck]] (UK: lorry) or [[eggplant]] (UK: aubergine), or with British English, as with [[mobile phone]] (US: cell phone) or [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (US: hood).\n\nA non-exhaustive selection of common British English terms not commonly used in Australian English include (Australian usage in brackets): artic/articulated lorry ([[semi-trailer]]); aubergine ([[eggplant]]); bank holiday ([[public holiday]]); bedsit (one-bedroom [[apartment]]); bin lorry ([[garbage truck]]); cagoule ([[raincoat]]); candy floss ([[cotton candy|fairy floss]]); cash machine (automatic teller machine/[[Automated teller machine|ATM]]); child-minder ([[babysitter]]); chivvy (nag); clingfilm (glad wrap/[[plastic wrap|cling wrap]]); cooker ([[stove]]); courgette ([[zucchini]]); skive ([[truancy|wag]]); dungarees ([[overalls]]); dustbin ([[waste container|garbage/rubbish bin]]); dustcart ([[garbage truck|garbage/rubbish truck]]); duvet ([[duvet|doona]]); elastoplast/plaster ([[adhesive bandage|band-aid]]); estate car ([[station wagon]]); fairy cake ([[cupcake]]/patty cake); free phone ([[toll-free telephone number|toll-free]]); football ([[soccer]]); full fat milk (full-cream milk); [[goose bumps]] (goose pimples); high street ([[main street]]); hoover (''v'' - to [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]]); horsebox (horse float); ice lolly ([[ice block]]/icy pole); kitchen roll ([[paper towel]]); lorry ([[truck]]); marrow ([[cucurbita|squash]]); nettled (irritated); off-licence ([[liquor store|bottle shop]]); pavement ([[sidewalk|footpath]]); potato crisps ([[potato chips]]); red/green pepper ([[capsicum]]); pilchard ([[sardine]]); pillar box ([[post box]]); plimsoll ([[plimsoll shoe|sandshoe]]); pushchair (pram/[[stroller]]); saloon car (sedan); snog (''v'' - [[kiss]]); swan (''v'' - to go somewhere in an ostentatious way); sweets ([[candy|lollies]]); tangerine ([[mandarin orange|mandarin]]); utility room ([[laundry room|laundry]]); Wellington boots ([[wellington boot|gumboots]]).\n\nA non-exhaustive list of American English terms not commonly found in Australian English include: acclimate (acclimatise); aluminum ([[aluminium]]); bangs (fringe); bell pepper ([[capsicum]]); bellhop (hotel porter); broil ([[Grilling|grill]]); burglarize (burgle); busboy (included under the broader term of [[waiter]]); [[candy]] (lollies); cell phone ([[mobile phone]]); cilantro ([[coriander]]); comforter ([[duvet|doona]]); counter-clockwise (anticlockwise); diaper (nappy); downtown ([[central business district|CBD]]); drywall (plasterboard); emergency brake (handbrake); faucet (tap); [[flashlight]] (torch); frosting (icing); gasoline ([[petroleum|petrol]]); golden raisin ([[sultana (grape)|sultana]]); hood (bonnet); jell-o (jelly); jelly (jam); math (maths); nightstand (bedside table); pacifier (dummy); period (full stop); [[parking lot]] (car park); popsicle ([[ice block]]/icy pole); railway ties (sleepers); rear view mirror (rear vision mirror); row house ([[terraced house|terrace house]]); [[scallion]] (spring onion); silverware/flatware ([[cutlery]]); stickshift (manual transmission); streetcar ([[tram]]); takeout (takeaway); trash can ([[waste container|garbage/rubbish bin]]); trunk (boot); turn signal (indicator/blinker); vacation (holiday); upscale/downscale (upmarket/downmarket); [[windshield]] (windscreen).\n\nTerms shared by British and American English but not so commonly found in Australian English include: abroad (overseas); [[cooler]]/ice box ([[Esky]]); [[flip-flops]] (thongs); [[pickup truck]] ([[Ute (vehicle)|ute]]); [[wildfire]] (bushfire).\n\nAustralian English is particularly divergent from other varieties with respect to geographical terminology, due to the country's unique geography. This is particularly true when comparing with British English, due to that country's dramatically different geography. British geographical terms not in common use in Australia include: coppice (cleared bushland); dell (valley); fen (swamp); heath (shrubland); meadow (grassy plain); moor (swampland); spinney (shrubland); stream (creek); woods (bush) and village (even the smallest settlements in Australia are called ''towns'' or ''stations'').\n\nIn addition, a number of words in Australian English have different meanings from those ascribed in other varieties of English. Clothing-related examples are notable. ''Pants'' in Australian English follows American usage in refer to British English ''trousers'' but in British English refer to Australian English ''underpants''; ''vest'' in Australian English pass also in American refers to British English ''waistcoat'' but in British English refers to Australian English ''singlet''; ''thong'' in both American and British English refers to underwear (otherwise known as a [[G-string]]), while in Australian English it refers to British and American English ''flip-flop'' (footwear). There are numerous other examples, including ''[[biscuit]]'' which refers in Australian and British English to what in American English is ''cookie'' or ''cracker'' but to a savoury cake in American English; ''Asian'', which in Australian and American English commonly refers to people of [[East Asia]]n heritage, as opposed to British English, in which it commonly refers to people of [[South Asia]]n descent; and ''(potato) chips'' which refers both to British English ''crisps'' (which is not commonly used in Australian English) and to American English ''French fries'' (which is used alongside ''hot chips'').\n\nIn addition to the large number of uniquely Australian idioms in common use, there are instances of idioms taking differing forms in the various Anglophone nations, for example ''home away from home'', ''take with a grain of salt'' and ''wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole'' (which in British English take the respective forms ''home from home'', ''take with a pinch of salt'' and ''wouldn't touch with a barge pole''), or ''a drop in the ocean'' and ''touch wood'' (which in American English take the forms ''a drop in the bucket'' and ''knock on wood'').\n\n==Grammar==\nAs with American English, but unlike British English, collective nouns are almost always singular in construction, e.g., ''the government was unable to decide'' as opposed to ''the government were unable to decide''. ''Shan't'', the use of ''should'' as in ''I should be happy if ...'', the use of ''haven't any'' instead of ''haven't got any'' and the use of ''don't let's'' in place of ''let's not'', common in upper-register British English, are almost never encountered in Australian (or North American) English. ''River'' generally follows the name of the river in question as in North America, i.e., ''Darling River'', rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., ''River Thames''. In South Australia however, the British convention applies\u2014for example, the ''River Murray'' or the ''River Torrens''. As with American English, ''on the weekend'' and ''studied medicine'' are used rather than the British ''at the weekend'' and ''read medicine''. Similarly, ''around'' is more commonly used in constructions such as ''running around'', ''stomping around'' or ''messing around'' in contrast with the British convention of using ''about''.\n\nIn common with British English, the past tense and past participles of the verbs ''learn'', ''spell'' and ''smell'' are often irregular (''learnt'', ''spelt'', ''smelt''). Similarly, in Australian usage, the ''to'' in ''I'll write to you'' is retained, as opposed to US usage where it may be dropped. While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, i.e., ''She resigned Thursday'', they are retained in Australian English, as in British English: ''She resigned on Thursday''. Ranges of dates use ''to'', i.e., ''Monday to Friday'', as with British English, rather than ''Monday through Friday'' in American English. When saying or writing out numbers, ''and'' is inserted before the tens and units, i.e., ''one hundred and sixty-two'', as with British practice. However Australians, like Americans, are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1,200 as ''twelve hundred'', rather than ''one thousand two hundred''.\n\n==Spelling and style==<!-- [[Australian spelling]] redirects here-->\nAs in most English-speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' is used by some [[University|universities]] and some other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling. The ''Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers'', the ''Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage'' and the ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' are prominent style guides.\n\nAustralian spelling is closer to [[American and British English spelling differences|British]] than [[American and British English spelling differences|American spelling]]. As with British spelling, the ''u'' is retained in words such as ''colour'', ''honour'', ''labour'' and ''favour''.  While the Macquarie Dictionary lists the ''-our'' ending and follows it with the ''-or'' ending as an acceptable variant, the latter is rarely found in actual use today. Australian print media, including digital media, today strongly favour ''-our'' endings. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Australian Labor Party]], which adopted the American spelling in 1912 as a result of ''-or'' spellings' comparative popularity at that time. Consistent with British spellings, ''-re'', rather than ''-er'', is the only listed variant in Australian dictionaries in words such as ''theatre'', ''centre'' and ''manoeuvre''. Unlike British English, which is split between ''-ise'' and ''-ize'' in words such as ''organise'' and ''realise'', with ''-ize'' favoured by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and ''-ise'' listed as a variant, ''-ize'' is rare in Australian English and designated as a variant by the Macquarie Dictionary. ''Ae'' and ''oe'' are often maintained in words such as ''manoeuvre'', ''paedophilia'' and ''foetus'' (excepting those listed below); however, the Macquarie dictionary lists forms with ''e'' (e.g., pedophilia, fetus) as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within Australian English towards using only ''e''. Individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as being different from the British spellings include \"program\" (in all contexts) as opposed to \"programme\", \"inquire\" and derivatives \"inquired\", \"inquiry\", etc. as opposed to \"enquire\" and derivatives, \"analog\" (as opposed to digital) as opposed to \"analogue\", \"livable\" as opposed to \"liveable\", \"guerilla\" as opposed to \"guerrilla\", \"yoghurt\" as opposed to \"yogurt\", \"verandah\" as opposed to \"veranda\", \"burqa\" as opposed to \"burka\", \"pastie\" (food) as opposed to \"pasty\".<ref name=\"Fourth Edition 2005\">\"The Macquarie Dictionary\", Fourth Edition.

A pamphlet entitled ''The So-Called \"American Spelling\"'', published in Sydney some time in the 19th century, argued that \"there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the ''u'' in such words as ''honor'', ''labor'', etc.\"<ref name = \"ljnijo\">''The So Called \"American Spelling.\" Its Consistency Examined.'' pre-1901 pamphlet, Sydney, E. J. Forbes. Quoted by Annie Potts in [http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage19/Webster's-Dictionary.html this article]</ref> The pamphlet also claimed that \"the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form.\" What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the [[Australian Labor Party]] and also in some place names such as [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]]. The ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2008/01/webster-in-australia/ |title=Endangered Languages and Cultures \u00bb Blog Archive \u00bb Webster in Australia |publisher=Paradisec.org.au |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2017-09-20}}</ref> For a short time during the late 20th century, [[Harry Lindgren]]'s 1969 spelling reform proposal ([[SR1|''Spelling Reform 1'' or ''SR1'']]) gained some support in Australia: in 1975, the [[Australian Teachers' Federation]] adopted SR1 as a policy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|title=Spelling Reform 1 - And Nothing Else!|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730222013/http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|archivedate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> SR1 calls for the short {{IPA|/e/}} sound (as in ''bet'') to be spelt with E (for example ''friend\u2192frend, head\u2192hed'').\n\nBoth [[Quotation mark|single and double quotation marks]] are in use (with double quotation marks being far more common in print media), with [[Logical punctuation|logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation]].

The [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]] aircraft serving the flight was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five men affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]] on September 11, 2001, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. They deliberately crashed the plane into [[the Pentagon]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], near [[Washington, D.C.]], killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.\n\nLess than 35&nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit. They forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.\n\nThe hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT. Many people witnessed the crash, and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. A portion of the building collapsed; firefighters spent days working to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas that August. The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the crash site.

marine infantry deploy beneath the [[Nui \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai]] cliffs in 1884]]\n[[File:Polish ambush during the January Uprising.png|thumb|Ambush of Polish [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] during the [[January Uprising]]]]\nAn '''ambush''' is a long-established [[military tactics|military tactic]] in which [[combatant]]s take advantage of concealment and the [[element of surprise]] to attack unsuspecting enemy combatants from concealed positions, such as among dense [[underbrush]] or behind hilltops. Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history, from [[ancient warfare|ancient]] to [[modern warfare]]. In the 20th century, an ambush  might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale, such as over a choke point such as a [[mountain pass]], or a small [[Irregular military|irregular]] band or [[insurgent]] group attacking a [[Regular army|regular]] armed force patrol. Theoretically, a single well-armed and concealed soldier could ambush other troops in a surprise attack.\n\n==History==\nThe use by early humans of the ambush may date as far back as two million years when anthropologists have recently suggested that ambush techniques were used to hunt large game.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Henry T.|author2=Alia N. Gurtov|title=Prey Mortality Profiles Indicate That Early Pleistocene Homo at Olduvai Was an Ambush Predator.|journal=Quaternary International|date=February 16, 2014|volume=322\u2013323|pages=44\u201353|doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2013.11.002 }}<!--|accessdate=26 March 2014--></ref>\n\nOne example from ancient times is the [[Battle of the Trebia]] river. [[Hannibal]] encamped within striking distance of the Romans with the Trebia River between them, and placed a strong force of cavalry and infantry in concealment, near the battle zone. He had noticed, says Polybius, a \"place between the two camps, flat indeed and treeless, but well adapted for an ambuscade, as it was traversed by a water-course with steep banks, densely overgrown with brambles and other thorny plants, and here he proposed to lay a stratagem to surprise the enemy\". When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army, the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear. The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans. Nevertheless, the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force. Although most of the legions were lost, about 10,000 Romans cut their way through to safety, maintaining [[unit cohesion]]. This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a [[kill zone]] is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation. (See Ranger reference below).\n\nAnother famous ambush was that sprung by Germanic warchief [[Arminius]] against the Romans at [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]. This particular ambush was to affect the course of Western history. The Germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush. They took cover in difficult forested terrain, allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection. They had the element of surprise, and this was also aided by the defection of Arminius from Roman ranks prior to the battle. They sprang the attack when the Romans were most vulnerable; when they had left their fortified camp, and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm.\n\nThe Germans did not dawdle at the hour of decision but attacked quickly, using a massive series of short, rapid, vicious charges against the length of the whole Roman line, with charging units sometimes withdrawing to the forest to regroup while others took their place. The Germans also used blocking obstacles, erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder Roman movement along the route of the killing zone. The result was mass slaughter of the Romans, and the destruction of three legions. The Germanic victory caused a limit on Roman expansion in the West. Ultimately, it established the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Roman influence in the West. The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine.\n\n===Arabia during Muhammad's era===\n{{Main|List of battles of Muhammad}}\nAccording to Muslim tradition, Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] used ambush tactics in his military campaigns. His first such use was during the [[Caravan raids]], in the Kharrar caravan raid Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas was ordered to lead a raid against the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]]. His group consisted of about twenty Muhajirs. This raid was done about a month after the previous. Sa'd, with his soldiers, set up an ambush in the valley of [[Kharrar]] on the road to Mecca and waited to raid a returning Meccan caravan from Syria. But the caravan had already passed and the Muslims returned to Medina without any loot.<ref name=\"Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 127\">Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar (Free Version), p. 127.</ref><ref name=\"Haykal 1976\">{{citation|title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&printsec=frontcover |first=Husayn |last=Haykal|year=1976|publisher=Islamic Book Trust |isbn=978-983-9154-17-7|pages=217\u2013218}}</ref>\n\nArab tribes during Muhammad's era also used ambush tactics.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  One example retold in Muslim tradition is said to have taken place during the [[First Raid on Banu Thalabah]].

However, in some situations, especially when deep behind enemy lines, the actual attack will be carried out by a platoon, a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized unit will be deployed to support the attack group, setting up and maintaining a forward patrol harbour from which the attacking force will deploy, and to which they will retire after the attack.\n\n===Planning===\n[[File:Ambush.gif|thumb|US Army idealised linear ambush plan]]\n[[File:Ambush_L_shaped.png|thumb|US Army idealised L-shaped ambush plan]]\nAmbushes are complex, multi-phase operations, and are, therefore, usually planned in some detail. First, a suitable killing zone is identified.  This is the place where the ambush will be laid. It is generally a place where enemy units are expected to pass, and which gives reasonable cover for the deployment, execution, and extraction phases of the ambush patrol. A path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example.\n\nAmbush can be described geometrically as:\n* '''Linear''', when a number of firing units are equally distant from the linear [[kill zone]].\n* '''L-shaped''', when a short leg of firing units are placed to [[enfilade]] (fire the length of) the sides of the linear kill zone.\n* '''V-shaped''', when the firing units are distant from the kill zone at the end where the enemy enters, so the firing units lay down bands of intersecting and interlocking fire. This ambush is normally triggered only when the enemy is well into the kill zone. The intersecting bands of fire prevent any attempt of moving out of the kill zone.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/7-85/ch6.htm FM 7-85 Chapter 6 Special Light Infantry Operations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Viet Cong ambush techniques===\n[[File:vchelicopterfight2.jpg|thumb|right|The VC/NVA prepared the battlefield carefully. Siting automatic weapons at treetop level for example helped shoot down several US helicopters during the Battle of Dak To, 1967 <ref>Terrence Maitland, A CONTAGION OF WAR: THE VIETNAM EXPERIENCE SERIES, (Boston Publishing Company), 1983, p. 180</ref>]]\n\n'''Ambush criteria:''' The terrain for the ambush had to meet strict criteria:\n* provide concealment to prevent detection from the ground or air\n* enable ambush force to deploy, encircle and divide the enemy\n* allow for heavy weapons emplacements to provide sustained fire\n* enable the ambush force to set up observation posts for early detection of the enemy\n* permit the secret movement of troops to the ambush position and the dispersal of troops during withdrawal\n\nOne important feature of the ambush was that the target units should 'pile up' after being attacked, thus preventing them any easy means of withdrawal from the [[kill zone]] and hindering their use of heavy weapons and supporting fire. Terrain was usually selected which would facilitate this and slow down the enemy. The terrain around the ambush site which was not favorable to the ambushing force, or which offered some protection to the target, was heavily mined and booby trapped or pre-registered for mortars.\n\n'''Ambush units:''' The NVA/VC ambush formations consisted of:\n* lead-blocking element\n* main-assault element\n* rear-blocking element\n* observation posts\n* command post\n\nOther elements might also be included if the situation demanded, such as a sniper screen along a nearby avenue of approach to delay enemy reinforcements.\n\n'''Command posts:''' When deploying into an ambush site, the NVA first occupied several observation posts, placed to detect the enemy as early as possible and to report on the formation it was using, its strength and firepower, as well as to provide early warning to the unit commander. Usually one main OP and several secondary OP's were established. Runners and occasionally radios were used to communicate between the OP's and the main command post. The OP's were located so that they could observe enemy movement into the ambush and often they would remain in position throughout the ambush in order to report routes of reinforcement and withdrawal by the enemy as well as his maneuver options. Frequently the OP's were reinforced to squad size and served as flank security. The command post was situated in a central location, often on terrain which afforded it a vantage point overlooking the ambush site.\n\n'''Recon methods:''' Reconnaissance elements observing a potential ambush target on the move generally stayed 300\u2013500 meters away. Sometimes a \"leapfrogging\" recon technique was used. Surveillance units were echeloned one behind the other. As the enemy drew close to the first, it fell back behind the last recon team, leaving an advance group in its place. This one in turn fell back as the enemy again closed the gap, and the cycle rotated. This method helped keep the enemy under continuous observation from a variety of vantage points, and allowed the recon groups to cover one another.<ref name=\"RAND Corp\">RAND Corp, \"Insurgent Organization and Operations: A Case Study of the Viet Cong in the Delta, 1964\u20131966\", (Santa Monica: August 1967)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ambush predator]]\n* [[Viet Cong and PAVN battle tactics#Offensive tactics|Viet Cong and PAVN battle tactics]]\n* [[Flanking maneuver]]\n* [[Flypaper theory (strategy)]]\n* [[List of military tactics]]\n* [[Sniper]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.angelfire.com/art/enchanter/herbert.html Extract from Lt Col Anthony B.

Studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms, enzyme structure and function, catalysis, and the immune system itself.\n\nEnzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state of a chemical reaction, thereby enabling the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between the reactant(s) and the product(s).   If an antibody is developed to bind to a molecule that's structurally and electronically similar to the transition state of a given chemical reaction, the developed antibody will bind to, and stabilize, the transition state, just like a natural enzyme, lowering the activation energy of the reaction, and thus catalyzing the reaction. By raising an antibody to bind to a stable transition-state analog, a new and unique type of enzyme is produced.\n\nSo far, all catalytic antibodies produced have displayed only modest, weak catalytic activity. The reasons for low catalytic activity for these molecules have been widely discussed.

This is the one part of the [[HIV]] [[virus]] outer coating that does not change, because it is the attachment point to [[T lymphocytes]], the key cell in cell-mediated immunity. Once infected by HIV, patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat.  The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus' ability to change their coats rapidly. Because this protein gp120 is necessary for HIV to attach, it does not change across different strains and is a point of vulnerability across the entire range of the HIV variant population.\n\nThe abzyme does more than bind to the site, it catalytically destroys the site, rendering the virus inert, and then can attack other HIV viruses.

The prototypical example of adaptive radiation is finch speciation on the Galapagos (\"[[Darwin's finches]]\"), but examples are known from around the world.\n\n== Characteristics ==\nFour features can be used to identify an adaptive radiation:<ref name=\"Schluter20002\" />\n\n#A common ancestry of component species: specifically a ''recent'' ancestry. Note that this is not the same as a [[monophyly]] in which ''all'' descendants of a common ancestor are included.\n#A phenotype-environment correlation: a ''significant'' association between environments and the morphological and physiological traits used to exploit those environments.\n#Trait utility: the performance or fitness advantages of trait values in their corresponding environments.\n#Rapid speciation: presence of one or more ''bursts'' in the emergence of new species around the time that ecological and phenotypic divergence is underway.\n\n== Conditions ==\nAdaptive radiation tends to take place under the following conditions:<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Stroud and Losos|first=|date=2016|title=Ecological Opportunity and Adaptive Radiation|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032254|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=47|pages=507\u2013532|via=|doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032254}}</ref>\n\n#A new habitat has opened up: a volcano, for example, can create new ground in the middle of the ocean. This is the case in places like Hawaii and the Galapagos. For aquatic species, the formation of a large new lake habitat could serve the same purpose; the tectonic movement that formed the East African Rift, ultimately leading to the creation of the Rift Valley Lakes, is an example of this. An extinction event could effectively achieve this same result, opening up niches that were previously occupied by species that no longer exist.\n#This new habitat is relatively isolated. When a volcano erupts on the mainland and destroys an adjacent forest, it is likely that the terrestrial plant and animal species that used to live in the destroyed region will recolonize without evolving greatly. However, if a newly formed habitat is isolated, the species that colonize it will likely be somewhat random and uncommon arrivals.\n#The new habitat needs a wide availability of niche space. The rare colonist can only adaptively radiate into as many forms as there are niches.\n\n==Examples==\n===Darwin's finches===\nDarwin's finches are an often-used textbook example of adaptive radiation. Today represented by approximately 15 species, Darwin's finches are Galapagos endemics famously adapted for a specialized feeding behavior (although one species, the Cocos finch (''[[Cocos finch|Pinaroloxias inornata]]''), is not found in the Galapagos but on the island of Cocos south of Costa Rica).<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time|last=Weiner|first=Jonathan|publisher=Alfred A.

For the ground finches, this niche is a diet of seeds, and they have thick bills to facilitate the consumption of these hard materials.<ref name=\":7\" /> The ground finches are further specialized to eat seeds of a particular size: the large ground finch (''[[Large ground finch|Geospiza magnirostri]]s'') is the largest species of Darwin's finch and has the thickest beak for breaking open the toughest seeds, the small ground finch (''[[Small ground finch|Geospiza fuliginosa]]'') has a smaller beak for eating smaller seeds, and the medium ground finch (''[[Medium ground finch|Geospiza fortis]]'') has a beak of intermediate size for optimal consumption of intermediately sized seeds (relative to ''G. magnirostris'' and ''G. fuliginosa'').<ref name=\":7\" /> There is some overlap: for example, the most robust medium ground finches could have beaks larger than those of the smallest large ground finches.<ref name=\":7\" /> Because of this overlap, it can be difficult to tell the species apart by eye, though their songs differ.<ref name=\":7\" /> These three species often occur sympatrically, and during the rainy season in the Galapagos when food is plentiful, they specialize little and eat the same, easily accessible foods.<ref name=\":7\" /> It was not well-understood why their beaks were so adapted until [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] studied their feeding behavior in the long dry season, and discovered that when food is scarce, the ground finches use their specialized beaks to eat the seeds that they are best suited to eat and thus avoid starvation.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe other finches in the Galapagos are similarly uniquely adapted for their particular niche. The cactus finches (''[[Geospiza]]'' sp.) have somewhat longer beaks than the ground finches that serve the dual purpose of allowing them to feed on [[Opuntia]] cactus nectar and pollen while these plants are flowering, but on seeds during the rest of the year.<ref name=\":7\" /> The warbler-finches (''[[Warbler-finch|Certhidea]]'' sp.) have short, pointed beaks for eating insects.<ref name=\":7\" /> The woodpecker finch (''[[Woodpecker finch|Camarhynchus pallidus]]'') has a slender beak which it uses to pick at wood in search of insects; it also uses small sticks to reach insect prey inside the wood, making it one of the few animals that use tools.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe mechanism by which the finches initially diversified is still an area of active research. One proposition is that the finches were able to have a non-adaptive, allopatric speciation event on separate islands in the archipelago, such that when they reconverged on some islands they were able to maintain reproductive isolation.<ref name=\"Petren, K. 20052\" /> Once they occurred in sympatry, niche specialization was favored so that the different species competed less directly for resources.<ref name=\"Petren, K. 20052\" /> This second, sympatric event was adaptive radiation.<ref name=\"Petren, K. 20052\" />\n\n=== Cichlids of the African Great Lakes ===\nThe [[haplochromine]] [[cichlid]] fishes in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] of the [[East African Rift]] (particularly in [[Lake Tanganyika]], [[Lake Malawi]], and [[Lake Victoria]]) form the most speciose modern example of adaptive radiation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Lake Victoria Rock Cichlids: taxonomy, ecology, and distribution|last=Seehausen|first=Ole|publisher=Verduyn Cichlids|year=1996|isbn=90-800181-6-3|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Tanganyika Cichlids in their natural habitat, 3rd Edition|last=Konings|first=Ad|publisher=Cichlid Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-932892-18-5|location=El Paso, TX|pages=8, 325\u2013328}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Malawi Cichlids in their natural habitat, 5th edition|last=Konings|first=Ad|publisher=Cichlid Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-932892-23-9|location=El Paso, TX|pages=}}</ref> These lakes are believed to be home to about 2,000 different species of cichlid, spanning a wide range of ecological roles and morphological characteristics.<ref name=\"Losos, Jonathan B 20102\">{{cite journal|last1=Losos|first1=Jonathan B|year=2010|title=Adaptive Radiation, Ecological Opportunity, and Evolutionary Determinism|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:9464287|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=175|issue=6|pages=623\u201339|doi=10.1086/652433|pmid=20412015}}</ref> Cichlids in these lakes fill nearly all of the roles typically filled by a large number of fish families, including those of predators, scavengers, and herbivores, with varying dentitions and head shapes to match their dietary habits.<ref name=\":0\" /> In each case, the radiation events are only a few million years old, making the very high level of speciation particularly remarkable.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Several factors could be responsible for this diversity: the availability of a multitude of niches probably favored specialization, as few other fish taxa are present in the lakes (meaning that sympatric speciation was the most probable mechanism for initial specialization).<ref name=\":2\" /> Also, continual changes in the water level of the lakes during the Pleistocene (which often turned the largest lakes into several smaller ones) could have created the conditions for secondary allopatric speciation.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Tanganyika cichlids ====\nLake Tanganyika is the site from which nearly all the cichlid lineages of East Africa (including both riverine and lake species) originated.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Salzburger, Mack, Verheyen, and Meyer|first=|date=2005|title=Out of Tanganyika: Genesis, explosive speciation, key-innovations and phylogeography of the haplochromine cichlid fishes|url=https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-5-17|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=5:17|pages=17|via=|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-17}}</ref> Thus, the species in the lake constitute a single adaptive radiation event but do not form a single monophyletic clade.<ref name=\":3\" /> Lake Tanganyika is also the least speciose of the three largest African Great Lakes, with only around 200 species of cichlid;<ref name=\":1\" /> however, these cichlids are more morphologically divergent and ecologically distinct than their counterparts in lakes Malawi and Victoria, an artifact of Lake Tanganyika's older cichlid fauna.

The giant or emperor cichlid (''[[Giant cichlid|Boulengerochromis microlepis]]''[[Giant cichlid|)]] is a piscivore often ranked the largest of all cichlids (though it competes for this title with South America's ''[[Cichla temensis]]'', the speckled peacock bass).<ref name=\":1\" /> It is thought that giant cichlids spawn only a single time, breeding in their third year and defending their young until they reach a large size, before dying of starvation some time thereafter.<ref name=\":1\" /> The three species of ''[[Altolamprologus]]'' are also piscivores, but with laterally compressed bodies and thick scales enabling them to chase prey into thin cracks in rocks without damaging their skin.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''[[Plecodus straeleni]]'' has evolved large, strangely curved teeth that are designed to scrape scales off of the sides of other fish, scales being its main source of food.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''[[Gnathochromis permaxillaris]]'' possesses a large mouth with a protruding upper lip, and feeds by opening this mouth downward onto the sandy lake bottom, sucking in small invertebrates.<ref name=\":1\" /> A number of Tanganyika's cichlids are shell-brooders, meaning that mating pairs lay and fertilize their eggs inside of empty shells on the lake bottom.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''[[Lamprologus callipterus]]'' is the most unique egg-brooding species, with 15&nbsp;cm-long males amassing collections of shells and guarding them in the hopes of attracting females (about 6&nbsp;cm in length) to lay eggs in these shells.<ref name=\":1\" /> These dominant males must defend their territories from three types of rival: (1) other dominant males looking to steal shells; (2) younger, \"sneaker\" males looking to fertilize eggs in a dominant male's territory; and (3) tiny, 2\u20134&nbsp;cm \"parasitic dwarf\" males that also attempt to rush in and fertilize eggs in the dominant male's territory.<ref name=\":1\" /> These parasitic dwarf males never grow to the size of dominant males, and the male offspring of dominant and parasitic dwarf males grow with 100% fidelity into the form of their fathers.<ref name=\":1\" /> A number of other highly specialized Tanganyika cichlids exist aside from these examples, including those adapted for life in open lake water up to 200m deep.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Malawi cichlids ====\n\nThe cichlids of Lake Malawi constitute a \"species flock\" of up to 1000 endemic species.<ref name=\":0\" /> Only seven cichlid species in Lake Malawi are not a part of the species flock: the Eastern happy (''[[Astatotilapia calliptera]]''), the sungwa (''[[Serranochromis robustus]]''), and five tilapia species (genera ''[[Oreochromis]]'' and ''[[Coptodon]]'').<ref name=\":0\" /> All of the other cichlid species in the lake are descendants of a single original colonist species, which itself was descended from Tanganyikan ancestors.<ref name=\":3\" /> The common ancestor of Malawi's species flock is believed to have reached the lake 3.4 million years ago at the earliest, making Malawi cichlids' diversification into their present numbers particularly rapid.<ref name=\":0\" /> Malawi's cichlids span a similarly range of feeding behaviors to those of Tanganyika, but also show signs of a much more recent origin. For example, all members of the Malawi species flock are mouth-brooders, meaning the female keeps her eggs in her mouth until they hatch; in almost all species, the eggs are also fertilized in the female's mouth, and in a few species, the females continue to guard their fry in their mouth after they hatch.<ref name=\":0\" /> Males of most species display predominantly blue coloration when mating. However, a number of particularly divergent species are known from Malawi, including the piscivorous ''[[Nimbochromis livingstonii|Nimbochromis livingtonii]]'', which lies on its side in the substrate until small cichlids, perhaps drawn to its broken white patterning, come to inspect the predator - at which point they are swiftly eaten.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Victoria cichlids ====\nLake Victoria's cichlids are also a species flock, once composed of some 500 or more species.<ref name=\":2\" /> The deliberate introduction of the Nile Perch (''[[Nile perch|Lates niloticus]]'') in the 1950s proved disastrous for Victoria cichlids, and the collective biomass of the Victoria cichlid species flock has decreased substantially and an unknown number of species have become extinct.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=Darwin's Dreampond: Drama in Lake Victoria|last=Goldschmidt|first=Tijs|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0262071789|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> However, the original range of morphological and behavioral diversity seen in the lake's cichlid fauna is still mostly present today, if endangered.<ref name=\":2\" /> These again include cichlids specialized for niches across the trophic spectrum, as in Tanganyika and Malawi, but again, there are standouts. Victoria is famously home to a large number of piscivorous cichlid species, some of which feed by sucking the contents out of mouthbrooding females' mouths.<ref name=\":6\" /> Victoria's cichlids constitute a far younger radiation than even that of Lake Malawi, with estimates of the age of the flock ranging from 200,000 years to as little as 14,000.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Adaptive radiation in Hawaii ===\n[[File:Iiwi_on_native_mint_-_Hakalau_Forest_NWR.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iiwi_on_native_mint_-_Hakalau_Forest_NWR.jpg|thumb|260x260px|An \u02bbi\u02bbiwi (''Drepanis coccinea'').

While today only 17 species are known to persist in Hawaii (3 more may or may not be extinct), there were more than 50 species prior to Polynesian colonization of the archipelago (between 18 and 21 species have gone extinct since the discovery of the islands by westerners). The Hawaiian honeycreepers are known for their beaks, which are specialized to satisfy a wide range of dietary needs: for example, the beak of the \u02bbakiap\u014dl\u0101\u02bbau (''[[\u02bbAkiapola\u02bbau|Hemignathus wilsoni]]'') is characterized by a short, sharp lower mandible for scraping bark off of trees, and the much longer, curved upper mandible is used to probe the wood underneath for insects.<ref name=\":7\" /> Meanwhile, the \u02bbi\u02bbiwi (''[[\u02bbI\u02bbiwi|Drepanis coccinea]]'') has a very long curved beak for reaching nectar deep in ''[[Lobelia]]'' flowers.<ref name=\":10\" /> An entire clade of Hawaiian honeycreepers, the tribe [[Psittirostrini]], is composed of thick-billed, mostly seed-eating birds, like the Laysan finch (''[[Laysan finch|Telespiza cantans]]'').<ref name=\":10\" /> In at least some cases, similar morphologies and behaviors appear to have evolved convergently among the Hawaiian honeycreepers; for example, the short, pointed beaks of ''[[Loxops]]'' and ''[[\u02bbAkikiki|Oreomystis]]'' evolved separately despite once forming the justification for lumping the two genera together.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reding|first1=DM|last2=Foster|first2=JT|last3=James|first3=HF|last4=Pratt|first4=HD|last5=Fleisher|first5=RC|date=2009|title=Convergent evolution of 'creepers' in the Hawaiian honeycreeper radiation|journal=[[Biology Letters]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=221\u2013224|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0589|pmc=2665804|pmid=19087923}}</ref> The Hawaiian honeycreepers are believed to have descended from a single common ancestor some 15 to 20 million years ago, though estimates range as low as 3.5 million years.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Bruce G.|last2=Sanderson|first2=Michael J.|year=1998|title=Age and rate of diversification of the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Compositae)|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=95|issue=16|pages=9402\u20139406|bibcode=1998PNAS...95.9402B|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.16.9402|pmc=21350}}</ref>\n\n====Hawaiian silverswords====\n[[File:Young_silverswords,_Haleakala.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Young_silverswords,_Haleakala.jpg|thumb|295x295px|A mixture of blooming and non-blooming Haleakal\u0101 silverswords (''Argyroxiphium sandwicense macrocephalum'').]]\n\nAdaptive radiation is not a strictly vertebrate phenomenon, and examples are also known from among plants. The most famous example of adaptive radiation in plants is quite possibly the Hawaiian [[Argyroxiphium|silverswords]], named for alpine desert-dwelling ''[[Argyroxiphium]]'' species with long, silvery leaves that live for up to 20 years before growing a single flowering stalk and then dying.<ref name=\":10\" /> The Hawaiian [[silversword alliance]] consists of twenty-eight species of Hawaiian plants which, aside from the namesake silverswords, includes trees, shrubs, vines, cushion plants, and more.<ref name=\":4\" /> The silversword alliance is believed to have originated in Hawaii no more than 6 million years ago, making this one of Hawaii's youngest adaptive radiation events.<ref name=\":4\" /> This means that the silverswords evolved on Hawaii's modern high islands, and descended from a single common ancestor that arrived on [[Kauai]] from western North America.<ref name=\":4\" /> The closest modern relatives of the silverswords today are California tarweeds of the family [[Asteraceae]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Hawaiian lobelioids ====\n\nHawaii is also the site of a separate major floral adaptive radiation event: the [[Hawaiian lobelioids]]. The Hawaiian lobelioids are significantly more speciose than the silverswords, perhaps because they have been present in Hawaii for so much longer: they descended from a single common ancestor who arrived in the archipelago up to 15 million years ago.<ref name=\":4\" /> Today the Hawaiian lobelioids form a clade of over 125 species, including succulents, trees, shrubs, epiphytes, etc. A large number of species have been lost to extinction and many of the surviving species endangered.\n\n=== Caribbean anoles ===\n\n[[Anole]] lizards are distributed broadly in the New World, from the Southeastern US to South America. With over 400 species currently recognized, often placed in a single genus (''[[Anolis]]''), they constitute one of the largest radiation events among all lizards.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Lizards in an Evolutionary Tree: Ecology and Adaptive Radiation of Anoles|last=Losos|first=Jonathan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0520255913|location=Oakland, CA|pages=}}</ref> Anole radiation on the mainland has largely been a process of speciation, and is not adaptive to any great degree, but anoles on each of the [[Greater Antilles]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Jamaica]]) have adaptively radiated in separate, convergent ways.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=Irschick|first1=Duncan J.|last2=et al|display-authors=1|year=1997|title=A comparison of evolutionary radiations in mainland and Caribbean Anolis lizards|url=|journal=Ecology|volume=78|issue=7|pages=2191\u20132203|doi=10.2307/2265955}}</ref> On each of these islands, anoles have evolved with such a consistent set of morphological adaptations that each species can be assigned to one of six \"[[Anolis ecomorphs|ecomorphs]]\": trunk\u2013ground, trunk\u2013crown, grass\u2013bush, crown\u2013giant, twig, and trunk.<ref name=\":5\" /> Take, for example, crown\u2013giants from each of these islands: the Cuban ''[[Anolis luteogularis]]'', Hispaniola's ''[[Anolis ricordii]]'', Puerto Rico's ''[[Anolis cuvieri]]'', and Jamaica's ''[[Jamaican giant anole|Anolis garmani]]'' (Cuba and Hispaniola are both home to more than one species of crown\u2013giant).<ref name=\":8\" /> These anoles are all large, canopy-dwelling species with large heads and large lamellae (scales on the undersides of the fingers and toes that are important for traction in climbing), and yet none of these species are particularly closely related and appear to have evolved these similar traits independently.<ref name=\":8\" /> The same can be said of the other five ecomorphs across the Caribbean's four largest islands. Much like in the case of the cichlids of the three largest African Great Lakes, each of these islands is home to its own convergent ''Anolis'' adaptive radiation event.\n\n=== Other examples ===\nPresented above are the most well-documented examples of modern adaptive radiation, but other examples are known.

A widely accepted one is the Ogston model which treats the polymer matrix as a sieve. A globular protein or a [[random coil]] DNA moves through the interconnected pores, and the movement of larger molecules is more likely to be impeded and slowed down by collisions with the gel matrix, and the molecules of different sizes can therefore be separated in this sieving process.<ref name=\"zimm\" />\n\nThe Ogston model however breaks down for large molecules whereby the pores are significantly smaller than size of the molecule. For DNA molecules of size greater than 1 kb, a [[reptation]] model (or its variants) is most commonly used. This model assumes that the DNA can crawl in a \"snake-like\" fashion (hence \"reptation\") through the pores as an elongated molecule.

Xylene cyanol (light blue color) comigrates large DNA fragments, while Bromophenol blue (dark blue) comigrates with the smaller fragments. Less commonly used dyes include [[Cresol Red]] and [[Orange G]] which migrate ahead of bromophenol blue. A [[Molecular weight size marker|DNA marker]] is also run together for the estimation of the molecular weight of the DNA fragments. Note however that the size of a circular DNA like plasmids cannot be accurately gauged using standard markers unless it has been linearized by [[restriction digest]], alternatively a supercoiled DNA marker may be used.\n\n===Staining and visualization===\n[[Image:AgarosegelUV.jpg|thumb| The gel with UV illumination: DNA stained with [[ethidium bromide]] appears as glowing orange bands.]]\n\nDNA as well as RNA are normally visualized by staining with [[ethidium bromide]], which intercalates into the major grooves of the DNA and fluoresces under UV light. The intercalation depends on the concentration of DNA and thus, a band with high intensity will indicate a higher amount of DNA compared to a band of less intensity.<ref name=\":0\" /> The ethidium bromide may be added to the agarose solution before it gels, or the DNA gel may be stained later after electrophoresis.

SYBR Green requires the use of a blue-light transilluminator. DNA stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a UV transilluminator which is an advantage, however it may not produce a strong band.\n\nWhen stained with ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an [[ultraviolet]] (UV) transilluminator. The UV light excites the electrons within the aromatic ring of ethidium bromide, and once they return to the ground state, light is released, making the DNA and ethidium bromide complex fluoresce.<ref name=\":0\" /> Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation for as little as 45 seconds can produce damage to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of [[Transformation efficiency|transformation]], ''in vitro'' [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], and [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gr\u00fcndemann D, Sch\u00f6mig E | title = Protection of DNA during preparative agarose gel electrophoresis against damage induced by ultraviolet light | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 898\u2013903 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8922632 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00009/96215rr02_9961a.pdf }}</ref>  Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365&nbsp;nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.\n\nThe transilluminator apparatus may also contain image capture devices, such as a digital or polaroid camera, that allow an image of the gel to be taken or printed.\n\nFor gel electrophoresis of protein, the bands may be visualised with [[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie]] or [[Silver stain|silver stains]].\n[[File:Cutting of the agarose gel.jpg|thumb|Cutting out agarose gel slices. Protective equipment must be worn when using UV transilluminator.]]\n\n===Downstream procedures===\nThe separated DNA bands are often used for further procedures, and a DNA band may be cut out of the gel as a slice, dissolved and purified. Contaminants however may affect some downstream procedures such as PCR, and low melting point agarose may be preferred in some cases as it contains fewer of the sulphates that can affect some enzymatic reactions. The gels may also be used for blotting techniques.\n\n==Buffers==\nIn general, the ideal buffer should have good conductivity, produce less heat and have a long life.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gel electrophoresis \u2013 Principles and Basics |editor=Sameh Magdeldin |year=2012 |publisher=InTech |isbn=978-953-51-0458-2 }}</ref> There are a number of buffers used for agarose electrophoresis; common ones for nucleic acids include [[TAE buffer|Tris/Acetate/EDTA]] (TAE) and [[TBE buffer|Tris/Borate/EDTA]] (TBE).   The buffers used contain EDTA to inactivate many nucleases which require divalent cation for their function. The borate in TBE buffer can be problematic as borate can polymerize, and/or interact with cis diols such as those found in RNA. TAE has the lowest buffering capacity, but it provides the best resolution for larger DNA. This means a lower voltage and more time, but a better product.\n\nMany other buffers have been proposed, e.g. [[LB buffer|lithium borate]] (LB), iso electric histidine, pK matched goods buffers, etc.; in most cases the purported rationale is lower current (less heat) and or matched ion mobilities, which leads to longer buffer life. Tris-phosphate buffer has high buffering capacity but cannot be used if DNA extracted is to be used in phosphate sensitive reaction. LB is relatively new and is ineffective in resolving fragments larger than 5 kbp; However, with its low conductivity, a much higher voltage could be used (up to 35 V/cm), which means a shorter analysis time for routine electrophoresis. As low as one base pair size difference could be resolved in 3% agarose gel with an extremely low conductivity medium (1 mM lithium borate).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brody JR, Kern SE | title = History and principles of conductive media for standard DNA electrophoresis | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 333 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201313 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15351274 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2004.05.054 | url = http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121224121719/http://www.cc.ahs.chula.ac.th/Molmed/DNA%20electro%27s%20conductive%20media.pdf | deadurl = yes | archivedate = 24 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOther buffering system may be used in specific applications, for example, barbituric acid-sodium barbiturate or Tris-[[Barbital|barbiturate]] buffers may be used for in agarose gel electrophoresis of proteins, for example in the detection of abnormal distribution of proteins.<ref name=\"jeppson\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeppsson JO, Laurell CB, Franz\u00e9n B | title = Agarose gel electrophoresis | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 629\u201338 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 313856 | url = http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/25/4/629.long }}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n*Estimation of the size of DNA molecules following digestion with [[restriction enzyme]]s, e.g. in [[Restriction map|restriction mapping]] of cloned DNA.\n*Analysis of products of a [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), e.g. in molecular [[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|genetic diagnosis]] or [[genetic fingerprinting]]\n*Separation of DNA fragments for extraction and purification.\n*Separation of restricted genomic DNA prior to [[Southern blot|Southern transfer]], or of RNA prior to [[Northern Blot|Northern transfer]].\n*Separation of proteins, for example, screening of protein abnormalities in [[clinical chemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dmbj.org.rs/jmb/pdf/2010-1/2.pdf |title=Agarose gel electrophoresis: Application in Clinial Chemistry |work=Journal of Medical Biochemistry |doi=10.2478/v10011-009-0033-8 |volume=29|pages= 9\u201314|date= 2010}}</ref>\n\nAgarose gels are easily cast and handled compared to other matrices and nucleic acids are not chemically altered during electrophoresis.

If the alleles are different, they and the organism are [[heterozygous]] with respect to that gene.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"allele\" is a short form of '''allelomorph''' (\"other form\", a word coined by British geneticists [[William Bateson]] and [[Edith Rebecca Saunders]]),<ref>{{cite web | last = Craft | first = Jude | title = Genes and genetics: the language of scientific discovery | work = Genes and genetics | publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | date = 2013 | url = http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/shapers-of-english/genes-and-genetics-the-language-of-scientific-discovery/ | accessdate = 2016-01-14 }}</ref><ref>Bateson, W. and Saunders, E. R. (1902) \"The facts of heredity in the light of Mendel\u2019s discovery.\" Reports to the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society, '''I.''' pp 125-160</ref> which was used in the early days of [[genetics]] to describe variant forms of a [[gene]] detected as different [[phenotypes]]. It derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix \u1f00\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bb, ''allel'', meaning \"reciprocal\", or \"each other\", which itself is related to the Greek adjective \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, ''allos'' (cognate with [[Latin]] ''alius''), meaning \"other\".\n\n==Alleles that lead to dominant or recessive phenotypes==\n{{main|Dominance (genetics)}}\nIn many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as leading to [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[recessive]], according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the [[heterozygote]] most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele expressed is the one that leads to the dominant phenotype.<ref name=\"Essential genetics: A genomics perspective\"/> The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci. This type of interaction was first formally described by [[Gregor Mendel]]. However, many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by [[co-dominance]] and [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenic inheritance]].\n\nThe term \"[[wild type]]\" allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in \"wild\" populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Such a \"wild type\" allele was historically regarded as leading to a dominant (overpowering - always expressed), common, and normal phenotype, in contrast to \"[[mutant]]\" alleles that lead to recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious phenotypes. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the \"wild type\" allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative \"mutant\" allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of \"affected\" individuals, often as [[genetic diseases]], and more frequently in heterozygous form in \"[[Genetic carrier|carriers]]\" for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.\n\n==Multiple alleles==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Eye color]] is an inherited trait influenced by [[Polygene|more than one gene]], including ''[[OCA2]]'' and ''[[HERC2]]''. The interaction of multiple genes\u2014and the variation in these genes (\"alleles\") between individuals\u2014help to determine a person's eye color [[phenotype]]. Eye color is influenced by [[pigment]]ation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and the frequency-dependence of the light [[scattering]] by the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium within the [[Stroma of iris|stroma]] of the iris.\n| width     = 140\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Deep Blue eye.jpg\n| image2   = Beautiful green eye.jpg\n| image3    = Hazel eye1.png\n| image4    = Lens5.jpg\n}}\n[[File:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|right|300px|In the [[ABO blood group system]], a person with Type A blood displays A-antigens and may have a genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> or I<sup>A</sup>i. A person with Type B blood displays B-antigens and may have the genotype I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> or I<sup>B</sup>i. A person with Type AB blood displays both A- and B-antigens and has the genotype I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> and a person with Type O blood, displaying neither antigen, has the genotype ii.]]\n\nA population or [[species]] of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each locus among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population. A [[null allele]] is a gene variant that lacks the gene's normal function because it either is not expressed, or the expressed protein is inactive.\n\nFor example, at the gene locus for the [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s in humans,<ref name=\"OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan\"/> classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>, and i, that determine compatibility of [[blood transfusion]]s. Any individual has one of six possible [[genotype]]s (I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup>, I<sup>A</sup>i, I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup>, I<sup>B</sup>i, I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup>, and ii) that produce one of four possible [[phenotype]]s: \"Type A\" (produced by I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup> homozygous and I<sup>A</sup>i heterozygous genotypes), \"Type B\" (produced by I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup> homozygous and I<sup>B</sup>i heterozygous genotypes), \"Type AB\" produced by I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup> heterozygous genotype, and \"Type O\" produced by ii homozygous genotype. (It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus.<ref name=\"Sequence variation at the human ABO locus\"/> Hence an individual with \"Type A\" blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different \"A\" alleles.)\n\n==Genotype frequencies==\n{{main|Allele frequency}}\nThe frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]). For a simple model, with two alleles;\n\n: <math>p + q=1 \\, </math>\n\n: <math>p^2 + 2pq + q^2=1 \\,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the frequency of one allele and ''q'' is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, ''p''<sup>2</sup> is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2''pq'' is the fraction of heterozygotes, and ''q''<sup>2</sup> is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is ''p''<sup>2</sup> + 2''pq'', and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is ''q''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nWith three alleles:\n\n: <math>p + q + r = 1 \\, </math> and\n\n: <math>p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr = 1. \\,</math>\n\nIn the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:\n\n: <math>G= \\frac{a(a+1)}{2}. </math>\n\n==Allelic dominance in genetic disorders==\nA number of [[genetic disorders]] are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include [[albinism]], [[cystic fibrosis]], [[galactosemia]], [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), and [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]]. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are [[hemizygosity|hemizygous]]), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green [[color blindness]] and [[fragile X syndrome]].\n\nOther disorders, such as [[Huntington disease]], occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele.\n\n==Epialleles==\nWhile [[heredity|heritable traits]] are typically studied in terms of genetic alleles, [[epigenetic]] marks such as [[DNA methylation]] can be inherited at specific genomic regions in certain species, a process termed [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]]. The term ''epiallele'' is used to distinguish these heritable marks from traditional alleles, which are defined by [[nucleotide sequence]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Daxinger|first1=Lucia|last2=Whitelaw|first2=Emma|title=Understanding transgenerational epigenetic inheritance via the gametes in mammals|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=31 January 2012|volume=13|issue=3|page=155|doi=10.1038/nrg3188|pmid=22290458}}</ref> A specific class of epiallele, the [[metastable epiallele]]s, has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by stochastic (probabilistic) establishment of epigenetic state that can be mitotically inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rakyan|first1=Vardhman K|last2=Blewitt|first2=Marnie E|last3=Druker|first3=Riki|last4=Preis|first4=Jost I|last5=Whitelaw|first5=Emma|title=Metastable epialleles in mammals|journal=Trends in Genetics|date=July 2002|volume=18|issue=7|pages=348\u2013351|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02709-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Waterland|first1=RA|last2=Dolinoy|first2=DC|last3=Lin|first3=JR|last4=Smith|first4=CA|last5=Shi|first5=X|last6=Tahiliani|first6=KG|title=Maternal methyl supplements increase offspring DNA methylation at Axin Fused.|journal=Genesis|date=September 2006|volume=44|issue=9|pages=401\u20136|pmid=16868943|doi=10.1002/dvg.20230}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Allozyme]]\n* [[Evolution]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Haplo-sufficiency]]\n* [[Meiosis]]\n* [[Mendelian error]]\n* [[Mendelian inheritance]]\n* [[Mitosis]]\n* [[Penetrance]]\n* [[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]]\n* [[Punnett square]]\n* [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]]\n}}\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|refs=<ref name=\"OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=110300 |title=ABO Glycosyltransferase; ABO |author1=Victor A.

[[Mutation]]s that confer increased survival are selected for in [[natural selection]], which can happen quickly in bacteria because lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours. A new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an [[heredity|inherited]] mutation of widespread prevalence. Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Very often this is done via [[plasmid]]s, however, through means of [[Transduction (genetics)]], [[Transformation (genetics)]] and chromosomal [[Conjugation (genetics)]], resistance genes residing on bacterial chromosomes can also be transferred. If the new DNA is maintained in the receiving bacterium, this transfer is followed by inheritance of the new resistance from parents to offspring.\n\nRecent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of ''E. coli'' in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of ''E. coli'' produced by the gradient of antibiotic.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen TB, Scheffer L, Jensen VK, Bohlin J, Feruglio SL | title = Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis from a Norwegian perspective | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8538 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29867163 | pmc = 5986768 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-26906-3 }}</ref>\n\nAntibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in Staphylococcus extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964\u201377 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]] (NDM-1)<ref name=Kumarasamy>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumarasamy KK, Toleman MA, Walsh TR, Bagaria J, Butt F, Balakrishnan R, Chaudhary U, Doumith M, Giske CG, Irfan S, Krishnan P, Kumar AV, Maharjan S, Mushtaq S, Noorie T, Paterson DL, Pearson A, Perry C, Pike R, Rao B, Ray U, Sarma JB, Sharma M, Sheridan E, Thirunarayan MA, Turton J, Upadhyay S, Warner M, Welfare W, Livermore DM, Woodford N | display-authors = 6 | title = Emergence of a new antibiotic resistance mechanism in India, Pakistan, and the UK: a molecular, biological, and epidemiological study | journal = The Lancet.

The antibody is said to \"match\" the antigen in the sense that it can bind to it due to an [[Somatic hypermutation|adaptation]] in a [[Complementarity determining region| region of the antibody]]; because of this, many different antibodies are produced, each able to bind a different antigen while sharing the same basic structure. In most cases, an adapted antibody can only react to and bind one specific antigen; in some instances, however, antibodies may [[Cross-reactivity|cross-react]] and bind more than one antigen.\n\nAlso, an antigen is a [[molecule]] that binds to Ag-specific receptors, but cannot necessarily induce an immune response in the body by itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Gavin|first1=AL|last2=Hoebe|first2=K|last3=Duong|first3=B|last4=Ota|first4=T|last5=Martin|first5=C|last6=Beutler|first6=B|last7=Nemazee|first7=D|title=Adjuvant-enhanced antibody responses in the absence of toll-like receptor signaling.|journal=Science|date=22 December 2006|volume=314|issue=5807|pages=1936\u20138|pmid=17185603|doi=10.1126/science.1135299|pmc=1868398}}</ref> Antigens are usually [[protein]]s, [[peptide]]s (amino acid chains) and [[polysaccharide]]s (chains of monosaccharides/simple sugars) but [[lipid]]s and nucleic acids become antigens only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-ap/chapter/antigens/|title=Antigens - Boundless Anatomy and Physiology|author=|date=|website=courses.lumenlearning.com}}</ref> In general, saccharides and lipids (as opposed to peptides) qualify as antigens but not as [[immunogen]]s since they cannot elicit an immune response on their own.

He originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies, just as [[zymogen]] is a precursor of an enzyme. But, by 1903, he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word ''antigen'' is a contraction of antisomatogen  (''Immunk\u00f6rperbildner'').

Antigenic molecules, normally \"large\" biological polymers, usually present surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies. Any such feature constitutes an epitope. Most antigens have the potential to be bound by multiple antibodies, each of which is specific to one of the antigen's epitopes. Using the \"lock and key\" metaphor, the antigen can be seen as a string of keys (epitopes) each of which matches a different lock (antibody). Different antibody '''[[idiotypes]]''', each have distinctly formed [[complementarity determining region]]s.\n* [[Allergen]] \u2013 A substance capable of causing an [[allergic reaction]]. The (detrimental) reaction may result after exposure via ingestion, inhalation, injection, or contact with skin.\n* [[Superantigen]] \u2013 A class of antigens that cause non-specific activation of T-cells, resulting in polyclonal T-cell activation and massive [[cytokine]] release.\n* [[Tolerogen]] \u2013 A substance that invokes a specific immune non-responsiveness due to its [[molecular form]]. If its molecular form is changed, a tolerogen can become an immunogen.\n* [[Immunoglobulin]]-binding protein \u2013 Proteins such as [[protein A]], [[protein G]], and [[protein L]] that are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen-binding site. While antigens are the \"target\" of antibodies, immunoglobulin-binding proteins \"attack\" antibodies. \n* T-dependent antigen \u2013 Antigens that require the assistance of T cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies.\n* T-independent antigen \u2013 Antigens that stimulate B cells directly.\n* Immunodominant antigens \u2013 Antigens that dominate (over all others from a [[pathogen]]) in their ability to produce an immune response. T cell responses typically are directed against a relatively few immunodominant epitopes, although in some cases (e.g., infection with the [[malaria]] pathogen ''[[Plasmodium|Plasmodium spp.]]'') it is dispersed over a relatively large number of parasite antigens.<ref name=\"pmid12886016\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doolan DL, Southwood S, Freilich DA, Sidney J, Graber NL, Shatney L, Bebris L, Florens L, Dobano C, Witney AA, Appella E, Hoffman SL, Yates JR, Carucci DJ, Sette A | title = Identification of Plasmodium falciparum antigens by antigenic analysis of genomic and proteomic data | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 17 | pages = 9952\u20137 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12886016 | pmc = 187898 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1633254100 }}</ref>\n\n[[Antigen presenting cell]]s present antigens in the form of peptides on [[histocompatibility molecule]]s.

Different antibodies have the potential to discriminate among specific epitopes present on the antigen surface. A [[hapten]] is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope. In order to induce an immune response, it needs to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as a [[protein]] (a complex of peptides). Antigens are usually carried by [[protein]]s and polysaccharides, and less frequently, [[lipid]]s. This includes parts (coats, capsules, cell walls, flagella, fimbriae, and toxins) of [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and other [[microorganism]]s. Lipids and [[nucleic acid]]s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Non-microbial non-self antigens can include pollen, egg white and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells.\n\n==Sources==\nAntigens can be classified according to their source.\n\n===Exogenous antigens===\nExogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example, by [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]] or [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The immune system's response to exogenous [[antigens]] is often subclinical. By [[endocytosis]] or [[phagocytosis]], exogenous antigens are taken into the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to [[T helper cells]] ([[CD4]]<sup>+</sup>) by the use of [[MHC class II|class II histocompatibility]] molecules on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete cytokines, substances that activate [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL), antibody-secreting [[B cell]]s, [[macrophages]] and other particles.\n\nSome antigens start out as exogenous, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can be returned to circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell.\n\n===Endogenous antigens===\nEndogenous antigens are generated within normal cells as a result of normal cell [[metabolism]], or because of viral or intracellular bacterial [[infection]]. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with [[MHC class I]] molecules. If activated [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells]] recognize them, the T cells secrete various [[toxin]]s that cause the [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]] of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, the cytotoxic cells (self-reactive T cells) are deleted as a result of [[Central tolerance|tolerance]] (negative selection). Endogenous antigens include [[xenogenic]] (heterologous), [[autologous]] and [[idiotype|idiotypic]] or [[immunoglobulin allotype|allogenic]] (homologous) antigens.\n\n===Autoantigens===\nAn [[autoantigen]] is usually a normal protein or protein complex (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific [[autoimmune disease]]. Under normal conditions, these antigens should not be the target of the immune system, but in autoimmune diseases, their associated T cells are not deleted and instead attack.\n\n=== Neoantigens ===\nNeoantigens are those that are entirely absent from the normal human genome. As compared with nonmutated self-antigens, neoantigens are of relevance to tumor control, as the quality of the T cell pool that is available for these antigens is not affected by central T cell tolerance. Technology to systematically analyze T cell reactivity against neoantigens became available only recently.<ref name=\"ss15\">{{cite journal| journal=Science |date= April 3, 2015 |volume= 348 |issue= 6230 |pages= 69\u201374 |doi= 10.1126/science.aaa4971 |title=Neoantigens in cancer immunotherapy |first=Ton N. |last1=Schumacher |first2=Robert D. |last2=Schreiber |pmid=25838375}}</ref>\n\n==== Viral antigens ====\nFor virus-associated tumors, such as [[cervical cancer]] and a subset of [[head and neck cancers]], [[epitopes]] derived from viral open reading frames contribute to the pool of neoantigens.<ref name=ss15/>\n\n====Tumor antigens====<!-- This section is linked from [[Immune system]] -->\n''[[Tumor antigen]]s'' are those antigens that are presented by [[MHC class I]] or [[MHC class II]] molecules on the surface of [[tumor cell]]s. Antigens found only on such cells are called [[tumor-specific antigen]]s (TSAs) and generally result from a tumor-specific [[mutation]]. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, called [[tumor-associated antigen]]s (TAAs). [[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy tumor cells.<ref name=ss15/>\n\nTumor antigens can appear on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they are recognized by [[B cells]].<ref name=ss15/>\n\nFor human tumors without a viral etiology, novel [[peptides]] (neo-epitopes) are created by tumor-specific DNA alterations.<ref name=ss15/>\n\n===== Process=====\nA large fraction of human tumor mutations are effectively patient-specific. Therefore, neoantigens may also be based on individual tumor genomes. Deep-sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part of the [[genome]] (the [[exome]]) and predict potential neoantigens. In mice models, for all novel protein sequences, potential MHC-binding peptides were predicted. The resulting set of potential neoantigens was used to assess T cell reactivity. Exome\u2013based analyses were exploited in a clinical setting, to assess reactivity in patients treated by either [[tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte]] (TIL) cell therapy or checkpoint blockade. Neoantigen identification was successful for multiple experimental model systems and human malignancies.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nThe false-negative rate of cancer exome sequencing is low\u2014i.e.: the majority of neoantigens occur within exonic sequence with sufficient coverage. However, the vast majority of mutations within expressed genes do not produce neoantigens that are recognized by autologous T cells.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nAs of 2015 mass spectroscopy resolution is insufficient to exclude many false positives from the pool of peptides that may be presented by MHC molecules. Instead, algorithms are used to identify the most likely candidates. These algorithms consider factors such as the likelihood of [[proteasome|proteasomal]] processing, transport into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], affinity for the relevant MHC class I [[allele]]s and gene expression or protein translation levels.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\nThe majority of human neoantigens identified in unbiased screens display a high predicted MHC binding affinity. Minor histocompatibility antigens, a conceptually similar antigen class are also correctly identified by MHC binding algorithms. Another potential filter examines whether the mutation is expected to improve MHC binding. The nature of the central TCR-exposed residues of MHC-bound peptides is associated with peptide immunogenicity.<ref name=\"ss15\" />\n\n===Nativity===\nA native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts. [[T cell]]s cannot bind native antigens, but require that they be processed by APCs, whereas [[B cell]]s can be activated by native ones.\n\n==Antigenic specificity==\nAntigenic specificity is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen.

Autosomal recessive diseases, however, require two copies of the deleterious allele for the disease to manifest. Because it is possible to possess one copy of a deleterious allele without presenting a disease phenotype, two phenotypically normal parents can have a child with the disease if both parents are carriers (also known as [[heterozygote]]s) for the condition.\n\nAutosomal [[aneuploidy]] can also result in disease conditions. Aneuploidy of autosomes is not well tolerated and usually results in miscarriage of the developing fetus.

The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.\n\nIn the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered.

During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.\n\nA key turning point for bin Laden, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]].

aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|responded]], and began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).\n\nThe [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President [[George W. Bush]] responded by saying: \"We know he's guilty. Turn him over\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20011015-NEWS-310159983|title=US Jets Pound Targets Around Kabul|work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]|date=October 15, 2001|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}</ref> and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] warned the Taliban regime: \"Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/10/02/blair_war011002.html|title=Blair to Taliban: Surrender bin Laden or surrender power|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=October 3, 2001|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] removed the Taliban government as part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]]. As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.\n\n[[File:Khalid Shaikh Mohammed after capture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] after his arrest in [[Rawalpindi]], Pakistan, in March 2003.]]\n\nBy early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success.

In 1794, Volta married an aristocratic lady also from Como, Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons: Zanino, Flaminio, and Luigi. His father, Filippo Volta, was of noble lineage. His mother, Donna Maddalena, came from the family of the Inzaghis.<ref name=\"Alessandrovolta.info_February_18_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alessandrovolta.info/life_and_works_8.html |title=Life and works |newspaper=Alessandrovolta.info |publisher=Editoriale srl |location=Como, Italy |accessdate= February 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1774, he became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced [[static electricity]]. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter [[Johan Wilcke]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pancaldi|first=Giuliano|year= 2003|title=Volta, Science and Culture in the Age of Enlightenment|publisher=Princeton Univ.

Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an [[electrolyte]]) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.\n\nIn this way he discovered the [[electrochemical series]], and the law that the [[electromotive force]] (emf) of a [[galvanic cell]], consisting of a pair of metal [[electrode]]s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf). This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series.\n\nIn 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the [[voltaic pile]], an early [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]], which produced a steady electric current.<ref name=Routledge>{{cite book|title=A popular history of science|author=Robert Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VO1HAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA553|page=553 |edition=2nd|year=1881|publisher=G. Routledge and Sons|isbn=0-415-38381-1}}</ref> Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with [[brine]] into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.\n\n== Early battery ==\n[[File:Voltaic pile.svg|thumb|300px|A [[voltaic pile]]]]\nIn announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Tiberius Cavallo]], and [[Abraham Bennet]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Elliott, P. |title=Abraham Bennet F.R.S. (1749-1799): a provincial electrician in eighteenth-century England |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=59\u201378 |year=1999 |url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/klgdd0umcmvjqnpr/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1999.0063 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe battery made by Volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells. It consists of two electrodes: one made of [[zinc]], the other of [[copper]]. The [[electrolyte]] is either [[sulfuric acid]] mixed with water or a form of saltwater [[brine]]. The electrolyte exists in the form 2H<sup>+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>. The zinc, which is higher in the [[standard electrode potential (data page)|electrochemical series]] than both copper and hydrogen, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>). The positively charged hydrogen ions ([[proton]]s) capture [[electron]]s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub>. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode.\n\nThus, there are two terminals, and an [[electric current]] will flow if they are connected. The [[chemical reaction]]s in this voltaic cell are as follows:\n\n:Zinc:\n::Zn <big><big>\u2192</big></big> Zn<sup>2+</sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n:Sulfuric acid:\n::2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> <big><big>\u2192</big></big> H<sub>2</sub>\n\nThe copper does not react, but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current.\n\nHowever, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released. Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.\n\n== Last years and retirement ==\n[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|300px|Volta explains the principle of the ''\"electric column\"'' to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801]]\n\nIn 1809 Volta became associated member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003610 |title=Alessandro G.A.A.

I have, indeed, and only too often, failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian, and I have been guilty of many sins: but through the special mercy of God I have never, as far as I know, wavered in my faith... In this faith I recognise a pure gift of God, a supernatural grace; but I have not neglected those human means which confirm belief, and overthrow the doubts which at times arise. I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion, the works of apologists and assailants, the reasons for and against, and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability, even for the merely natural reason, that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion, every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it.

The genitive was \"Argus Navis\", abbreviated \"Arg\".

For example, [[Plutarch]] identified Argo with the Egyptian constellation called the \"Boat of [[Osiris]].\"  Although some academics theorized a [[Sumer]]ian origin related to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], this hypothesis has been rejected as there is no evidence that the Sumerians or other Mesopotamian culture considered these stars, or any portion of them, to form a vessel.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barentine|first1=John|title=A History of Obsolete, Extinct, or Forgotten Star Lore|date=23 October 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=3319227955|pages=72\u201373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_7NCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=3 January 2018|ref=Barentine}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the constellation became identified specifically with ancient Greek myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]].  In his [[Almagest]], [[Ptolemy]] described Argo Navis as occupying the portion of the Milky Way between [[Canis Major]] and [[Centaurus]], and identified stars comprising such details as the \"little shield,\" the \"steering-oar,\" the \"mast-holder,\" and the \"stern-ornament\",<ref>{{cite book|last1=Toomer|first1=G.J.|title=Ptolemy's Almagest|date=1984|publisher=Duckworth & Co.

Another interesting feature of the constellation is that it appeared to be moving backwards against the backdrop of the night sky.

Lacaille replaced Bayer's [[Bayer designation|designations]] with new ones that followed stellar magnitudes more closely, but used only a single Greek-letter sequence and described the constellation for those stars as \"Arg\u00fbs\". Similarly, faint non-lettered stars were listed only as in \"Arg\u00fbs\".\n\nThe final breakup and abolition of Argo Navis was proposed by [[Sir John Herschel]] in 1841 and again in 1844.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Herschel |first1=J.

To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}\n\n[[Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]], [[Medusa]]. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing [[Cap of invisibility#Origins|Hades's helm]]), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1.</ref>\n\nAndromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Dana\u00eb]], and then to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]]. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]].

According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].\n\nAt the port city of [[Jaffa]] (today part of [[Tel Aviv]]) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the geographer [[Strabo]] and the historian of the Jews [[Josephus]].<ref>Pausanias iv.35.9; Strabo xvi.2.28; Josephus, ''Jewish War'' iii.9.3</ref>\n\nAfter Andromeda's death, as [[Euripides]] had promised [[Athena]] at the end of his ''[[Andromeda (play)|Andromeda]]'', produced in 412 BCE,<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959:53; Euripides' drama is lost, save some fragments.</ref> the goddess placed her among the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]; the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], so known since antiquity, is named after her.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\n===Constellations===\n[[Image:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|thumb|200px|''Andromeda'' (1869) [[Edward Poynter]]]]\nAndromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].\n\nThe advancement of science and technology allowed the emergence of astrophotography which allowed more concrete observation of the Andromeda constellation and led to the discovery that the galaxy lies within the Andromeda constellation.<ref>Schultz, David A.

Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:\n* A huge man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]])\n* A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]])\n* A maiden, chained up, facing or turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]\n* A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]])\n\nOther constellations related to the story are:\n* [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]\n* The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her\n* The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Dana\u00eb]] were stranded\n\n===In art===\n[[File:1596 dArpino Perseus and Andromeda anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|Cesari: ''Perseus saving Andromeda'', 1596, [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin]]]]\n[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} including Greek vases. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera, ''[[Pers\u00e9e]]'', also dramatizes the myth.\n\nAndromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre|Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Perseus and Andromeda (Rubens)|many versions by Rubens]], [[Ingres]], and [[Gustave Moreau]]. From the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest.  [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote =<poem>\nIf by dull rhymes our English must be chain\u2019d,\n And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet\n Fetter\u2019d, in spite of pained loveliness;\n Let us find out, if we must be constrain\u2019d,\n Sandals more interwoven and complete\n To fit the naked foot of poesy;\n Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress\n Of every chord, and see what may be gain\u2019d\n By ear industrious, and attention meet:\n Misers of sound and syllable, no less\n Than Midas of his coinage, let us be\n Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;\n So, if we may not let the Muse be free,\n She will be bound with garlands of her own.\n</poem> |source =\"If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd\" <br> [[John Keats]] (1795\u20131821)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173739|title=If by Dull Rhymes Our English Must Be Chain'd|publisher=Poetry Foundation |accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Italian composer [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] composed an hour-long operatic drama called ''Perseo e Andromeda'' in 2000.\n\n===In films===\n* In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and M\u0443ths of Ancient Greece''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&fid=2626|title=\u0442\u041f\u0423\u0423\u0419\u041a\u0423\u041b\u0411\u0421 \u0411\u041e\u0419\u041d\u0411\u0413\u0419\u0421 \u0427 \u0412\u0425\u041b\u0427\u0411\u0418 \u0419 \u0416\u0419\u0417\u0425\u0422\u0411\u0418 - \u0436\u0419\u041c\u0428\u041d\u0429 - \"\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0435\u043a\"|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=\u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a.ru - \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n* The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.\n* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.\n* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.\n* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of \"Prometheus Academy\" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.\n\n===In novels===\n* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda. The most obvious is that the series' lead villains have a [[cruise ship]] which serves as their headquarters and is called ''The Princess Andromeda''.\n* Andromeda is the main character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story \"Miss Manners' Guide to Greek Missology\", published in [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''Chicks in Chainmail'' series of humorous feminist fantasy collections, and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards. It is a satire filled with role reversals, puns, and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture.\n* Andromeda is Anna's full name in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''[[My Sister's Keeper (novel)|My Sister's Keeper]]'', which was turned into a movie in 2010. In the novel there are several references to mythology, as Anna's dad Brian is an astronomer in his free time.\n{{clear right}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"188\" caption=\"Andromeda in art\">\nFile:Perseo y Andr\u00f3meda, por Tiziano.jpg|[[Perseus and Andromeda (Titian)|Titian]], [[Wallace Collection]]\nFile:Vasari, perseo e andromeda, studiolo.jpg|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''Perseus and Andromeda'', 1570\nFile:D'arpino-Androm\u00e8de.jpg|[[Giuseppe Cesari]] (1568\u20131640)\nFile:Persus and Andromeda by Joachim Wtewael.jpg|[[Joachim Wtewael]], Louvre\nFile:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 011.jpg|''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks (Rembrandt)|Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'', Rembrandt (1630)\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens - Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|Andromeda by Rubens\nFile:Mignard-Andromeda and Perseus.jpg|Andromeda's parents thank [[Perseus (mythology)|Perseus]] for freeing her; ''La D\u00e9livrance d'Androm\u00e8de'' (1679) [[Pierre Mignard]]\nFile:Delacroix Andromeda.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]\nFile:1840 Chasseriau Theodore - Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids.jpg|''Andromeda Chained to the Rock by the Nereids'', 1840, [[Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau]]\nFile:Gustave Dor\u00e9 Andromeda.jpg|''Andromeda'' 1869, [[Gustave Dor\u00e9|Paul Gustave Dor\u00e9]]\nFile:Andromedasculpt metmuseum.jpg|[[Domenico Guidi]]\nFile:[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andromeda,-C.1927-28.jpg  \"Andromeda\" by Tamara de Lempicka<nowiki>]</nowiki>]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atalanta]]\n* [[Dana\u00eb]]\n* [[Ethiopia (Greek mythology)]]\n* [[Iphigenia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' II, iv, 3\u20135.\n* [[Edith Hamilton]], ''[[Mythology (book)|Mythology]]'', Part Three, 204\u2013207.\n* [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' IV, 668\u2013764.\n\n'''Attribution'''\n* {{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Andromeda |volume=1 |page=975}}.\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Andromeda}}\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Andromeda |volume=2  |ref={{harvid|EB|1878}} |short=x }}.\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Africa in Greek mythology]]\n[[Category:Iconography]]\n[[Category:Princesses in Greek mythology]]\n[[Category:Love stories]]\n[[Category:Descendants of Io]]\n[[Category:Mythological Greek characters]]", "sha1": "ic5hlhiek8ikor2y3yh5xihdcsvul4x"}}, {"title": "Antlia", "ns": "0", "id": "1926", "revision": {"id": "866387944", "parentid": "866274220", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T01:17:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "Casliber", "id": "1381068"}, "comment": "/* Stars */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{featured article}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox Constellation\n| name = Antlia\n| abbreviation = Ant\n| genitive = Antliae\n| pronounce = {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|t|l|i|\u0259}}, genitive {{IPAc-en|-|l|i|i}}\n| symbolism = the Air Pump<ref name=\"bakich\">{{cite book |last=Bakich |first= Michael E. |date = 1995 |title = The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations |publisher = Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn = 978-0-521-44921-2}}</ref>\n| RA = {{RA|09|27|05.1837}}\u2013{{RA|11|05|55.0471}}<ref name=boundary>{{Cite journal | title=Antlia, constellation boundary | journal=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union |url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#ant | accessdate=14 February 2014 }}</ref>\n| dec= {{dec|-24.5425186}}\u2013{{dec|-40.4246216}}<ref name=boundary/>\n| family = [[La Caille Family|La Caille]]\n| areatotal = 239\n| arearank = 62nd\n| numbermainstars = 3\n| numberbfstars = 9\n| numberstarsplanets = 2\n| numberbrightstars = 0\n| numbernearbystars = 2\n| brighteststarname = [[Alpha Antliae|\u03b1 Ant]]\n| starmagnitude = 4.25\n| neareststarname = [[DEN 1048-3956]]<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.recons.org/TOP100.posted.htm |title = The 100 Nearest Star Systems |date = 1 January 2012 |accessdate =2 May 2016 |publisher = Research Consortium on Nearby Stars}}</ref>\n| stardistancely = 13.17\n| stardistancepc = 4.04\n| numbermessierobjects = 0\n| meteorshowers = None\n| bordering = [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]]<br />[[Pyxis]]<br />[[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]<br />[[Centaurus]]\n| latmax = [[45th parallel north|45]]\n| latmin = [[South Pole|90]]\n| month = April\n| notes=}}\n'''Antlia''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|n|t|l|i|\u0259}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03bb\u03af\u03b1'') is a [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere]].

[[Hyginus]] also depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense, though his Ara featured devils on either side of the flames. However, [[Willem Blaeu]], a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering.

The [[Caddo]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], and [[Quapaw]] peoples encountered European explorers. The first of these Europeans was Spanish explorer [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] in 1541, who crossed the Mississippi and marched across central Arkansas and the Ozark Mountains. After finding nothing he considered of value and encountering native resistance the entire way, he and his men returned to the Mississippi River where de Soto fell ill. From his deathbed he ordered his men to massacre all of the men of the nearby village of Anilco, who he feared had been plotting with a powerful polity down the Mississippi River, ''[[Quigualtam]]''. His men obeyed and did not stop with the men, but were said to have massacred women and children as well. He died the following day in what is believed to be the vicinity of modern-day [[McArthur, Arkansas]] in May 1542. His body was weighted down with sand and he was consigned to a watery grave in the Mississippi River under cover of darkness by his men. De Soto had attempted to deceive the native population into thinking he was an immortal deity, sun of the sun, in order to forestall attack by outraged Native Americans on his by then weakened and bedraggled army. In order to keep the ruse up, his men informed the locals that de Soto had ascended into the sky. His will at the time of his death listed: \"four Indian slaves, three horses and 700 hogs.\" which were auctioned off to his men. His starving men, who had been living off maize stolen from Native Americans and who had not been allowed to eat the enormous herd of hogs but had had to care for them, immediately started to butcher them. Later on his remaining men, now commanded by his aide de camp Moscoso, attempted an overland return to Mexico. They made it as far as Texas before running into territory too dry for maize farming and too thinly populated to sustain themselves by stealing food from the locals. The expedition promptly backtracked to Arkansas. After building a small fleet of boats they then headed down the Mississippi River and eventually on to Mexico by water.<ref name=HUDSONKNIGHTS>{{cite book| authorlink =Charles M.

The region was organized as the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] on July 4, 1819, with the territory admitted to the United States as the state of Arkansas on June 15, 1836. The name was historically {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251r|k|\u0259n|s|\u0254\u02d0}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s}}, and several other variants. Historically and modernly, the people of Arkansas call themselves either \"Arkansans\" or \"Arkansawyers\". In 1881, the [[Arkansas General Assembly]] passed Arkansas Code 1-4-105 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110924223556/http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/ArkansasCode/0/1-4-105.htm official text]):\n<blockquote>Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final \"s\" silent, the \"a\" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of \"a\" in \"man\" and the sounding of the terminal \"s\" is an innovation to be discouraged.</blockquote>\nCitizens of the [[state of Kansas]] often pronounce the [[Arkansas River]] as {{IPAc-en|\u0251r|\u02c8|k|\u00e6|n|z|\u0259|s|_|\u02c8|r|\u026a|v|\u0259r}}, in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.\n\nSettlers, such as fur trappers, moved to Arkansas in the early 18th century.

When the Gulf states seceded in early 1861, Arkansas voted to remain in the Union.<ref name=\"bol\" /> Arkansas did not secede until [[Abraham Lincoln]] demanded Arkansas troops be sent to [[Fort Sumter]] to quell [[Battle of Fort Sumter|the rebellion there]]. On May 6, a state convention voted to terminate Arkansas's membership in the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name=\"bol\" />\n\nArkansas held a very important position for the Rebels, maintaining control of the [[Mississippi River]] and surrounding Southern states. The bloody [[Battle of Wilson's Creek]] just across the border in Missouri shocked many Arkansans who thought the war would be a quick and decisive Southern victory. Battles early in the war took place in northwest Arkansas, including the [[Battle of Cane Hill]], [[Battle of Pea Ridge]], and [[Battle of Prairie Grove]]. Union General [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] swept across the state to [[Helena-West Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] in the Delta in 1862. Little Rock was captured the following year. The government shifted the state Confederate capital to [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]], and then again to [[Washington, Arkansas|Washington]] from 1863\u20131865, for the remainder of the war. Throughout the state, [[guerrilla]] warfare ravaged the countryside and destroyed cities.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 200.</ref> Passion for the Confederate cause waned after implementation of programs such as the draft, high taxes, and martial law.\n\nUnder the [[Reconstruction era of the United States#Military reconstruction|Military Reconstruction Act]], Congress declared Arkansas restored to the Union in June 1868, after the Legislature accepted the 14th Amendment. The Republican-controlled reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage (though temporarily disfranchising former Confederate Army officers, who were all Democrats), a public education system for blacks and whites, and passed general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. The State soon came under control of the [[Radical Republicans]] and Unionists, and led by Governor [[Powell Clayton]], they presided over a time of great upheaval as Confederate sympathizers and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] fought the new developments, particularly voting rights for African Americans.\n\n=== End of the Reconstruction ===\nIn 1874, the [[Brooks-Baxter War]], a political struggle between factions of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] shook Little Rock and the state governorship.

(See Law and Government below.)\n\nAfter Reconstruction, the state began to receive more [[immigrants]] and [[migrant worker|migrants]]. Chinese, [[Italians|Italian]], and [[Syrian]] men were recruited for farm labor in the developing Delta region. None of these nationalities stayed long at farm labor; the Chinese especially quickly became small merchants in towns around the Delta.

In the same years, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property.\n[[File:Wife and children of a sharecropper in Washington County, Arkansas - NARA - 195845.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wife and children of a [[sharecropper]] in Washington County, Arkansas, c. 1935]]\nConstruction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks, where some areas were developed as resorts. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance, [[Eureka Springs]] in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] grew to 10,000 people, rapidly becoming a tourist destination and the fourth-largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its natural springs, considered to have healthful properties. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]].\n\n=== Rise of the Jim Crow Laws ===\nIn the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a [[literacy test]], knowing that it would exclude many blacks and whites. At the time, more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892, they amended the state constitution to require a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and more complex residency requirements, both of which adversely affected poor people and sharecroppers, forcing most blacks and many poor whites from voter rolls.\n\nBy 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the [[white primary]] in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process. Only in the primary was there any competition among candidates, as Democrats held all the power. The state was a Democratic one-party state for decades, until after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to enforce constitutional rights.<ref>[http://www.oldstatehouse.com/educational_programs/classroom/arkansas_news/detail.asp?id=800&issue_id=36&page=3 \"White Primary\" System Bars Blacks from Politics \u2013 1900\", ''The Arkansas News'', Old State House, Spring 1987, p.3.

Governor [[Orval Faubus]] had ordered the [[Arkansas National Guard]] to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year.

The state's culture also includes distinct cuisine, dialect, and traditional festivals. Sports are also very important to the culture of Arkansas, ranging from football, baseball, and basketball to hunting and fishing. Perhaps the best-known piece of Arkansas's culture is the stereotype of its citizens as shiftless hillbillies.<ref>Arnold et al. 2002, p. 115.</ref> The reputation began when the state was characterized by early explorers as a savage wilderness full of outlaws and thieves.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 15.</ref> The most enduring icon of Arkansas's hillbilly reputation is ''[[Edward Washburn|The Arkansas Traveller]]'', a painted depiction of a folk tale from the 1840s.<ref>Blevins 2009, p. 30.</ref> Although intended to represent the divide between rich southeastern plantation Arkansas planters and the poor northwestern hill country, the meaning was twisted to represent a Northerner lost in the Ozarks on a white horse asking a backwoods Arkansan for directions.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 20.</ref> The state also suffers from the racial stigma common to former Confederate states, with historical events such as the [[Little Rock Nine]] adding to Arkansas's enduring image.<ref>Sutherlin 1996, p. 17.</ref>\n\nArt and history museums display pieces of cultural value for Arkansans and tourists to enjoy. [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]] was visited by 604,000 people in 2012, its first year.<ref>{{cite web|title=600K visitors later, Crystal Bridges turns 1 |last=Bartels |first=Chuck |url=http://www.newsok.com/article/feed/461683 |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=June 18, 2017 |publisher=News Ok  }}</ref> The museum includes walking trails and educational opportunities in addition to displaying over 450 works covering five centuries of American art.<ref>{{cite web |title= Crystal Bridges art museum is reshaping Wal-Mart's hometown |last= Reynolds |first= Chris |publisher= Chicago Tribune |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/travel/la-tr-arkansas-20121014,0,3925043.story?page=2 |date= October 14, 2012 |accessdate= November 18, 2012 }}</ref> Several historic town sites have been restored as Arkansas [[List of Arkansas state parks|state parks]], including [[Historic Washington State Park]], [[Powhatan Historic State Park]], and [[Davidsonville Historic State Park]].\n\nArkansas features a variety of native music across the state, ranging from the [[blues]] heritage of [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]], [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Helena\u2013West Helena, Arkansas|Helena\u2013West Helena]] to [[rockabilly]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and folk music from the Ozarks. Festivals such as the [[King Biscuit Blues Festival]] and [[Bikes, Blues, and BBQ]] pay homage to the history of blues in the state. The Ozark Folk Festival in [[Mountain View, Arkansas|Mountain View]] is a celebration of Ozark culture and often features folk and bluegrass musicians. Literature set in Arkansas such as ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]'' by [[Maya Angelou]] and ''[[A Painted House]]'' by [[John Grisham]] describe the culture at various time periods.\n\n===Sports and recreation===\n[[File:Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge Crittenden County AR 052.jpg|left|thumb|The flooded forested [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)#Lowland|bottomlands]] of east Arkansas attract wintering waterfowl ([[Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge]]).]]\nSports have become an integral part of the culture of Arkansas, and her residents enjoy participating in and spectating various events throughout the year.\n\nTeam sports and especially collegiate football have been important to Arkansans. College football in Arkansas began from humble beginnings. The [[University of Arkansas]] first fielded a team in [[1894 Arkansas Cardinals football team|1894]] when football was a very dangerous game. Recent studies of the damage to team members from the concussions common in football make it clear that the danger persists.\n\n\"[[Calling the Hogs]]\" is a cheer that shows support for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks|Razorbacks]], one of the two [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) teams in the state. High school football also began to grow in Arkansas in the early 20th century. Over the years, many Arkansans have looked to the Razorbacks football team as the public image of the state. Following the [[Little Rock Nine]] integration crisis at [[Little Rock Central High School]], Arkansans looked to the successful Razorback teams in the following years to repair the state's reputation. Although the University of Arkansas is based in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], the Razorbacks have always played at least one game per season at [[War Memorial Stadium (Arkansas)|War Memorial Stadium]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] in an effort to keep fan support in central and south Arkansas.\n\n[[Arkansas State University]] joined the University of Arkansas in FBS (then known as Division I-A) in 1992 after playing in lower divisions for nearly two decades. The two schools have never played each other, due to the University of Arkansas's policy of not playing intrastate games.<ref>{{cite news |title= Arkansas matchup is not likely soon |publisher= [[Sun Herald]] |date= July 20, 2003 |page= 9B }}</ref> Two other campuses of the [[University of Arkansas System]] are Division I members. The [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]] is a member of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]], a league whose members all play football in the second-level [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS). The [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]] is a member of the FBS [[Sun Belt Conference]], but is one of two conference schools that has [[List of NCAA Division I non-football programs|no football program]]. The state's other Division I member is the [[University of Central Arkansas]], which is a full member (including football) of the FCS [[Southland Conference]].\n\nSeven of Arkansas's smaller colleges play in [[NCAA Division II]], with six in the [[Great American Conference]] and one in the [[Heartland Conference]]. Two other small Arkansas colleges compete in [[NCAA Division III]], in which [[athletic scholarship]]s are prohibited.\n\nBaseball runs deep in Arkansas and has been popular before the state hosted [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[spring training]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas|Hot Springs]] from 1886 to the 1920s. Two [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] teams are based in the state. The [[Arkansas Travelers]] play at [[Dickey\u2013Stephens Park]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas|North Little Rock]], and the [[Northwest Arkansas Naturals]] play in [[Arvest Ballpark]] in [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]]. Both teams compete in the [[Texas League]].\n\nRelated to the state's frontier past, hunting continues in the state. The state created the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission in 1915 to regulate hunting and enforce those regulations.<ref>{{cite web |last= Griffee |first= Carol |title= Odyssey Of Survival, A History of the Arkansas Conservation Sales Tax |page= 10 |url= http://www.teaming.com/sites/default/files/REPORT%20Odyssey%20of%20Survival-%20A%20History%20of%20the%20AR%20Conservation%20Sales%20Tax.pdf |format =  PDF |accessdate= September 16, 2012 }}</ref> Today a significant portion of Arkansas's population participates in hunting [[duck]] in the [[Mississippi flyway]] and [[deer]] across the state.<ref name=\"Sutherlin 1996, p. 164\">Sutherlin 1996, p. 164.</ref> Millions of acres of public land are available for both bow and modern gun hunters.<ref name=\"Sutherlin 1996, p. 164\"/>\n\nFishing has always been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state have benefited from the creation of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of [[Norfork Dam]], the [[Norfork Tailwater]] and the [[White River (Arkansas)|White River]] have become a destination for [[trout]] fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as [[Bull Shoals, Arkansas|Bull Shoals]], [[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas|Hot Springs Village]], and [[Fairfield Bay, Arkansas|Fairfield Bay]] have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake.

State district courts exercise district-wide jurisdiction over the districts created by the General Assembly, and local district courts are presided over by part-time judges who may privately practice law. 25 state district court judges preside over 15 districts, with more districts created in 2013 and 2017. There are 28 judicial circuits of Circuit Court, with each contains five subdivisions: criminal, civil, probate, domestic relations, and juvenile court. The jurisdiction of the Arkansas Court of Appeals is determined by the Arkansas Supreme Court, and there is no [[appeal|right of appeal]] from the Court of Appeals to the high court. The Arkansas Supreme Court can review Court of Appeals cases upon application by either a party to the litigation, upon request by the Court of Appeals, or if the Arkansas Supreme Court feels the case should have been initially assigned to it. The twelve judges of the Arkansas Court of Appeals are elected from judicial districts to renewable six-year terms.\n\nThe Arkansas Supreme Court is the court of last resort in the state, composed of seven justices elected to eight-year terms. Established by the Arkansas Constitution in 1836, the court's decisions can be appealed to only the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].\n\n===Federal===\nBoth of Arkansas's U.S. Senators, [[John Boozman]] and [[Tom Cotton]], are Republicans.

Presenting himself as a \"New Democrat\" and using incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]]'s [[Read my lips: no new taxes|broken promise]] against him, Clinton won the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]] (43.0% of the vote) against Republican Bush (37.4% of the vote) and billionaire [[populism|populist]] [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent (18.9% of the vote).\n\nMost Republican strength traditionally lay mainly in the northwestern part of the state, particularly [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]] and [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], as well as North Central Arkansas around the [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]] area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.\n\nArkansas has only elected three Republicans to the U.S. Senate since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]: [[Tim Hutchinson]], who was defeated after one term by [[Mark Pryor]]; [[John Boozman]], who defeated incumbent [[Blanche Lincoln]]; and [[Tom Cotton]], who defeated Mark Pryor in the 2014 elections. Before 2013, the General Assembly had not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction, with the GOP holding a 51-seat majority in the state House and a 21-seat (of 35) in the state Senate following victories in 2012. Arkansas was one of just three states among the states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that sent two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the others being Florida and [[Virginia]]) for any period during the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nIn 2010, Republicans captured three of the state's four seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 2012, Republicans won election for all four House seats. Arkansas held the distinction of having a U.S. House delegation composed entirely of military veterans ([[Rick Crawford (politician)|Rick Crawford]] \u2013 [[Army]]; [[Tim Griffin]] \u2013 [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]]; [[Steve Womack]] \u2013 Army [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], [[Tom Cotton]]- Army). In 2014, the last Democrat in Arkansas's Congressional Delegation, Mark Pryor, was defeated in his campaign to win a third term in the U.S. Senate, leaving the entire congressional delegation in GOP hands for the first time since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].\n\nReflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent.

It represents a [[bird-of-paradise]], and its name means \"without feet\" in [[Greek language|Greek]] because the bird-of-paradise was once wrongly believed to lack feet. First depicted on a celestial globe by [[Petrus Plancius]] in 1598, it was charted on a star atlas by [[Johann Bayer]] in his 1603 ''[[Uranometria]]''. The French explorer and astronomer [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] charted and gave the brighter stars their [[Bayer designation]]s in 1756.\n\nThe five brightest stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at [[apparent magnitude]] 3.8 is [[Alpha Apodis]], an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the [[luminosity]] of the Sun. Marginally fainter is [[Gamma Apodis]], another ageing giant star. [[Delta Apodis]] is a [[double star]], the two components of which are 103 [[Minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have been found to have [[exoplanet|planets]].\n\n==History==\nApus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]] who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the ''[[First Dutch Expedition to Indonesia|Eerste Schipvaart]]'', to the [[East Indies]]. It first appeared on a 35-cm (14&nbsp;in) diameter celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].<ref name=ridpathbayer>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer%20southern.htm | title=Johann Bayer's Southern Star Chart|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|author-link=Ian Ridpath|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref><!-- cites previous 2 sentences --> De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue in 1603 under the Dutch name ''De Paradijs Voghel'', \"The Bird of Paradise\",<ref name=\"ley196312\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Ley\n |first=Willy\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1963\n |title=The Names of the Constellations\n |department=For Your Information\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v22n02_1963-12#page/n46/mode/1up\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=90\u201399\n |type=\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/startales1c.htm#houtman | title=Frederick de Houtman's Catalogue|last1=Ridpath|first1=Ian|publisher=self-published |work=Star Tales | accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref> and Plancius called the constellation ''Paradysvogel Apis Indica''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"bird of paradise\".

He was already well-known from his earlier work, and had developed a reputation as a brilliant researcher, but his laboratory was often untidy. On 3 September 1928, Fleming returned to his laboratory having spent August on holiday with his family. Before leaving, he had stacked all his cultures of staphylococci on a bench in a corner of his laboratory. On returning, Fleming noticed that one culture was contaminated with a fungus, and that the colonies of staphylococci immediately surrounding the fungus had been destroyed, whereas other staphylococci colonies farther away were normal, famously remarking \"That's funny\".<ref name=Brown>Brown, K.

''The Birth of Penicillin'', Allen & Unwin, London, 1970</ref> Fleming grew the mould in a pure culture and found that it produced a substance that killed a number of disease-causing bacteria. He identified the mould as being from the genus ''[[Penicillium]]'', and, after some months of calling it \"mould juice\", named the substance it released ''[[penicillin]]'' on 7 March 1929.<ref>Diggins, F.

(Originally published in the Imperial College School of Medicine Gazette)</ref> The laboratory in which Fleming discovered and tested penicillin is preserved as the [[Alexander Fleming Laboratory Museum]] in St. Mary's Hospital, [[Paddington]].\n\nHe investigated its positive anti-bacterial effect on many organisms, and noticed that it affected bacteria such as staphylococci and many other [[Gram-positive]] pathogens that cause [[scarlet fever]], [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and [[diphtheria]], but not [[typhoid fever]] or [[paratyphoid fever]], which are caused by [[Gram-negative]] bacteria, for which he was seeking a cure at the time.

Fleming continued his investigations, but found that cultivating ''Penicillium'' was quite difficult, and that after having grown the mould, it was even more difficult to isolate the antibiotic agent. Fleming's impression was that because of the problem of producing it in quantity, and because its action appeared to be rather slow, penicillin would not be important in treating infection. Fleming also became convinced that penicillin would not last long enough in the human body (''in vivo'') to kill bacteria effectively. Many clinical tests were inconclusive, probably because it had been used as a surface antiseptic. In the 1930s, Fleming's trials occasionally showed more promise,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=Peter|title=Keith Bernard Rogers|journal=BMJ|date=10 September 2010|quote=Keith was probably the first patient to be treated clinically with the mould juice.|pmc=1200632|page=579|volume=331|issue=7516|doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7516.579-c }}</ref> but Fleming largely abandoned penicillin work, leaving [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]] at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in Oxford to take up research to mass-produce it, with funds from the U.S. and British governments.<ref>Bickel, L.

This structure was not immediately published due to the restrictions of wartime secrecy, and was initially strongly disputed, by Sir Robert Robinson among others, but it was finally confirmed in 1945 by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin using X-ray analysis.\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; \"Abraham, Sir Edward Penley\"</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-edward-abraham-1093226.html|location=London|work=The Independent |first=Gordon|last=Lowe|title=Obituary: Sir Edward Abraham|date=13 May 1999}}</ref> Shortly after the team published its first results in 1940, Fleming telephoned [[Howard Florey]], Chain's head of department, to say that he would be visiting within the next few days. When Chain heard that Fleming was coming, he remarked \"Good God! I thought he was dead.\"\n\n[[Norman Heatley]] suggested transferring the active ingredient of penicillin back into water by changing its acidity. This produced enough of the drug to begin testing on animals. There were many more people involved in the Oxford team, and at one point the entire Dunn School was involved in its production.\n\nAfter the team had developed a method of purifying penicillin to an effective first stable form in 1940, several clinical trials ensued, and their amazing success inspired the team to develop methods for mass production and mass distribution in 1945.\n\nFleming was modest about his part in the development of penicillin, describing his fame as the \"Fleming Myth\" and he praised Florey and Chain for transforming the laboratory curiosity into a practical drug. Fleming was the first to discover the properties of the active substance, giving him the privilege of naming it: penicillin. He also kept, grew, and distributed the original mould for twelve years, and continued until 1940 to try to get help from any chemist who had enough skill to make penicillin. But Sir [[Henry Harris (scientist)|Henry Harris]] said in 1998: \"Without Fleming, no Chain; without Chain, no Florey; without Florey, no Heatley; without Heatley, no penicillin.\"<ref>Henry Harris, ''Howard Florey and the development of penicillin'', a lecture given on 29 September 1998, at the Florey Centenary, 1898\u20131998, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford University (sound recording) [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1610017]</ref>\n\n===Antibiotics===\n[[File:Staphylococcus aureus (AB Test).jpg|right|thumb|Modern antibiotics are tested using a method similar to Fleming's discovery.]]\nFleming's accidental discovery and isolation of penicillin in September 1928 marks the start of modern [[antibiotics]]. Before that, several scientists had published or pointed out that mould or ''Penicillium sp.'' were able to inhibit bacterial growth, and even to cure bacterial infections in animals. [[Ernest Duchesne]] in 1897 in his thesis \"Contribution to the study of vital competition in micro-organisms: antagonism between moulds and microbes\",<ref name=\"Duchesne 1897\">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZVXPIK Duchesne 1897], Antagonism between molds and bacteria.

Fleming was the first to push these studies further by isolating the penicillin, and by being motivated enough to promote his discovery at a larger scale.<ref name=\"shea\">Infection Control And Hospital Epidemiology.

[[Almroth Wright]] had predicted antibiotic resistance even before it was noticed during experiments. Fleming cautioned about the use of penicillin in his many speeches around the world. On 26 June 1945, he made the following cautionary statements: \"the microbes are educated to resist penicillin and a host of penicillin-fast organisms is bred out&nbsp;... In such cases the thoughtless person playing with penicillin is morally responsible for the death of the man who finally succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism. I hope this evil can be averted.\"<ref name=\"shea\"/> He cautioned not to use penicillin unless there was a properly diagnosed reason for it to be used, and that if it were used, never to use too little, or for too short a period, since these are the circumstances under which bacterial resistance to antibiotics develops.\n\n==Myths==\nThe popular story<ref>e.g., ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 17 July 1945: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 43 to Chapter 2</ref> of [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Winston Churchill's father]] paying for Fleming's education after Fleming's father saved young [[Winston Churchill|Winston]] from death is false. According to the biography, ''Penicillin Man: Alexander Fleming and the Antibiotic Revolution'' by [[Kevin Brown (historian of medicine)|Kevin Brown]], Alexander Fleming, in a letter<ref>14 November 1945; British Library Additional Manuscripts 56115: Brown, ''Penicillin Man'', note 44 to Chapter 2</ref> to his friend and colleague Andre Gratia,<ref>see Wikipedia [[Discovery of penicillin]] article entry for 1920</ref> described this as \"A wondrous fable.\" Nor did he save Winston Churchill himself during [[World War II]]. Churchill was saved by [[Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran|Lord Moran]], using [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], since he had no experience with penicillin, when Churchill fell ill in [[Carthage]] in Tunisia in 1943. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Morning Post]]'' on 21 December 1943 wrote that he had been saved by penicillin. He was saved by the new sulphonamide drug [[sulfapyridine|Sulphapyridine]], known at the time under the research code M&B 693, discovered and produced by [[May & Baker]] Ltd, [[Dagenham]], Essex \u2013 a subsidiary of the French group [[Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc]]. In a subsequent radio broadcast, Churchill referred to the new drug as \"This admirable M&B\".<ref>A History of May & Baker 1834\u20131984, Alden Press 1984.</ref> It is highly probable that the correct information about the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamide]] did not reach the newspapers because, since the original sulphonamide antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], had been a discovery by the German laboratory [[Bayer]], and as Britain was at war with [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] at the time, it was thought better to raise British morale by associating Churchill's cure with a British discovery, penicillin.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n[[File:Flemingawardsnationalmuseumofscotland.jpg|thumb|right|Display of Fleming's awards, including his Nobel Prize.

With the fortune he made from business, he built [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York, NY, and the [[Peace Palace]] and founded the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]], [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], [[Carnegie Institution for Science]], [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland]], [[Carnegie Hero Fund]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], and the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], among others.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, Dunfermline.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of Andrew Carnegie in [[Dunfermline]], Scotland]]\nAndrew Carnegie was born to Margaret Morrison Carnegie and William Carnegie in Dunfermline, Scotland in 1835, in a typical weaver's cottage with only one main room, consisting of half the ground floor which was shared with the neighboring weaver's family.<ref name=\"MacKay pp23-24\">[[#MacKay|MacKay]], pp. 23\u201324.</ref> The main room served as a living room, dining room and bedroom.<ref name=\"MacKay pp23-24\" /> He was named after his legal grandfather.<ref name=\"MacKay pp23-24\" /> In 1836, the family moved to a larger house in Edgar Street (opposite Reid's Park), following the demand for more heavy [[damask]] from which his father benefited.<ref name=\"MacKay pp23-24\" /> He was educated at the Free School in Dunfermline, which had been a gift to the town by the philanthropist [[Adam Rolland]] of Gask.<ref>The Edinburgh Magazine and Literary Review, Sept 1819</ref>\n\nHis uncle, George Lauder Sr., a Scottish political leader, deeply influenced him as a boy by introducing him to the writings of [[Robert Burns]] and historical Scottish heroes such as [[Robert the Bruce]], [[William Wallace]], and [[Robert Roy MacGregor|Rob Roy]]. Lauder's son, also named [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]], grew up with Carnegie and would become his business partner. When Carnegie was thirteen, his father had fallen on very hard times as a handloom weaver; making matters worse, the country was in starvation. His mother helped support the family by assisting her brother (a cobbler), and by selling potted meats at her \"sweetie shop\", leaving her as the primary breadwinner.<ref name=Nasaw /> Struggling to make ends meet, the Carnegies then decided to move to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]], in the United States in 1848 for the prospect of a better life.<ref name=\"MacKay pp37-38\">[[#MacKay|MacKay]], pp. 37\u201338.</ref> Carnegie's migration to America would be his second journey outside Dunfermline\u2013the first being an outing to [[Edinburgh]] to see [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nasaw|first1=David|title=Andrew Carnegie|date=2006|publisher=Penguin Group|location=375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, U.S.A.|isbn=1-59420-104-8|page=24}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1848, Carnegie arrived with his family at their new prosperous home.

Carnegie's first job in 1848 was as a [[bobbin boy]], changing spools of thread in a cotton mill 12 hours a day, 6 days a week in a Pittsburgh cotton factory.

It was too much for me.

He was a very hard worker and would memorize all of the locations of Pittsburgh's businesses and the faces of important men. He made many connections this way. He also paid close attention to his work, and quickly learned to distinguish the differing sounds the incoming telegraph signals produced. He developed the ability to translate signals by ear, without using the paper slip,<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', pp. 56, 59</ref> and within a year was promoted to operator. Carnegie's education and passion for reading was given a great boost by Colonel James Anderson, who opened his personal library of 400 volumes to working boys each Saturday night.<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 45</ref> Carnegie was a consistent borrower and a \"self-made man\" in both his economic development and his intellectual and cultural development. He was so grateful to Colonel Anderson for the use of his library that he \"resolved, if ever wealth came to me, [to see to it] that other poor boys might receive opportunities similar to those for which we were indebted to the noble man\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=[[Skyhorse Pub.]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064}}</ref> His capacity, his willingness for hard work, his perseverance and his alertness soon brought forth opportunities.\n\nStarting in 1853, [[Thomas A. Scott]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad Company]] employed Carnegie as a secretary/telegraph operator at a salary of $4.00 per week (${{Inflation|US|4.00|1853|r=0}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation). Carnegie accepted this job with the railroad as he saw more prospects for career growth and experience with the railroad than with the telegraph company.<ref name=\"Nasaw\"/> At age 24, Scott asked Carnegie if he could handle being superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\">Edge (2004) pg. 35</ref> On December 1, 1859, Carnegie officially became superintendent of the Western Division. Carnegie then hired his sixteen-year-old brother, Tom, to be his personal secretary and telegraph operator. Not only did Carnegie hire his brother, but he also hired his cousin, Maria Hogan, who became the first female telegraph operator in the country.<ref>Edge (2004) pg. 37</ref> As superintendent Carnegie made a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year (${{Inflation|US|1500|1859|r=-3|fmt=c}} by {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} inflation).<ref name=\"Edge 2004 pg. 35\"/> His employment by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company would be vital to his later success. The railroads were the first big businesses in America, and the Pennsylvania was one of the largest of them all. Carnegie learned much about management and cost control during these years, and from Scott in particular.<ref name=\"Nasaw\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 54\u201359, 64\u201365.</ref>\n\nScott also helped him with his first investments. Many of these were part of the corruption indulged in by Scott and the Pennsylvania's president, [[John Edgar Thomson]], which consisted of inside trading in companies that the railroad did business with, or payoffs made by contracting parties \"as part of a [[quid pro quo]]\".<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\">[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 59\u201360</ref> In 1855, Scott made it possible for Carnegie to invest $500 in the [[Adams Express Company|Adams Express]], which contracted with the Pennsylvania to carry its messengers. The money was secured by his mother's placing of a $600 mortgage on the family's $700 home, but the opportunity was available only because of Carnegie's close relationship with Scott.<ref name=\"Nasaw_pg59_60\"/><ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 79</ref> A few years later, he received a few shares in [[Theodore Tuttle Woodruff]]'s sleeping car company, as a reward for holding shares that Woodruff had given to Scott and Thomson, as a payoff. Reinvesting his returns in such inside investments in railroad-related industries: (iron, bridges, and [[Track (rail transport)|rails]]), Carnegie slowly accumulated capital, the basis for his later success. Throughout his later career, he made use of his close connections to Thomson and Scott, as he established businesses that supplied rails and bridges to the railroad, offering the two men a stake in his enterprises.\n\n===1860\u20131865: The Civil War===\nBefore the Civil War, Carnegie arranged a merger between Woodruff's company and that of [[George Pullman]], the inventor of a [[sleeping car]] for [[first class travel]] which facilitated business travel at distances over {{convert|500|mi|km}}. The investment proved a great success and a source of profit for Woodruff and Carnegie. The young Carnegie continued to work for the Pennsylvania's Tom Scott, and introduced several improvements in the service.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Carnegie, Andrew|volume=5|pages=364-365}}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1861, Carnegie was appointed by Scott, who was now Assistant Secretary of War in charge of military transportation, as Superintendent of the Military Railways and the Union Government's telegraph lines in the East. Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut; he rode the locomotive pulling the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. Following the defeat of Union forces at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]], he personally supervised the transportation of the defeated forces. Under his organization, the telegraph service rendered efficient service to the Union cause and significantly assisted in the eventual victory. Carnegie later joked that he was \"the first casualty of the war\" when he gained a scar on his cheek from freeing a trapped telegraph wire.\n\nDefeat of the Confederacy required vast supplies of [[munition]]s, as well as railroads (and telegraph lines) to deliver the goods. The war demonstrated how integral the industries were to American success.\n\n===Keystone Bridge Company===\nIn 1864, Carnegie invested $40,000 in Story Farm on Oil Creek in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania]]. In one year, the farm yielded over $1,000,000 in cash dividends, and petroleum from oil wells on the property sold profitably. The demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, as well as a hundred other industrial products, made Pittsburgh a center of wartime production. Carnegie worked with others in establishing a steel [[rolling mill]], and steel production and control of industry became the source of his fortune. Carnegie had some investments in the iron industry before the war.\n\nAfter the war, Carnegie left the railroads to devote all his energies to the ironworks trade. Carnegie worked to develop several iron works, eventually forming the Keystone Bridge Works and the Union Ironworks, in Pittsburgh. Although he had left the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, he remained closely connected to its management, namely Thomas A. Scott and J. Edgar Thomson. He used his connection to the two men to acquire contracts for his [[Keystone Bridge Company]] and the rails produced by his [[ironworks]]. He also gave stock to Scott and Thomson in his businesses, and the Pennsylvania was his best customer. When he built his first steel plant, he made a point of naming it after Thomson. As well as having good business sense, Carnegie possessed charm and literary knowledge. He was invited to many important social functions\u2014functions that Carnegie exploited to his own advantage.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]], pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie circa 1878 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, c. 1878]]\nCarnegie believed in using his fortune for others and doing more than making money. He wrote:\n\n{{quote|I propose to take an income no greater than $50,000 per annum! Beyond this I need ever earn, make no effort to increase my fortune, but spend the surplus each year for benevolent purposes! Let us cast aside business forever, except for others. Let us settle in Oxford and I shall get a thorough education, making the acquaintance of literary men. I figure that this will take three years active work. I shall pay especial attention to speaking in public. We can settle in London and I can purchase a controlling interest in some newspaper or live review and give the general management of it attention, taking part in public matters, especially those connected with education and improvement of the poorer classes. Man must have no idol and the amassing of wealth is one of the worst species of [[idolatry]]! No idol is more debasing than the worship of money! Whatever I engage in I must push inordinately; therefore should I be careful to choose that life which will be the most elevating in its character. To continue much longer overwhelmed by business cares and with most of my thoughts wholly upon the way to make more money in the shortest time, must degrade me beyond hope of permanent recovery. I will resign business at thirty-five, but during these ensuing two years I wish to spend the afternoons in receiving instruction and in reading systematically!}}\n\n===Industrialist===\n\n====1885\u20131900: Steel empire====\n[[File:Bessemer converter.jpg|thumb|left|Bessemer converter]]\n\nCarnegie did not want to marry during his mother's lifetime, instead choosing to take care of her in her illness towards the end of her life.{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=78}} After she died in 1886, the 51-year-old Carnegie married [[Louise Whitfield Carnegie|Louise Whitfield]],{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=78}} who was 21 years his junior.<ref>{{cite book|author=Meachen Rau, Dana |title=Andrew Carnegie: Captain of Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyvHd3LxnIkC&pg=PA72|date=2005|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7565-1853-0|pages=72\u2013}}</ref> In 1897,{{sfnp|Edge|2004|p=93}} the couple had their only child, a daughter, whom they named after Carnegie's mother, Margaret.<ref>{{cite book|author=Parker, Lewis K. |title=Andrew Carnegie and the Steel Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82w0rAyuhUkC&pg=PA40|date= 2003|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8239-6896-1|pages=40\u2013}}</ref>\n\nCarnegie made his fortune in the [[steel industry]], controlling the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the [[Bessemer process]], which allowed the high carbon content of [[pig iron]] to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way during [[steel production]]. Steel prices dropped as a result, and Bessemer steel was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last=Rosenberg |first=Nathan |year=1982 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, New York |isbn=0-521-27367-6 |page=90}} Bessemer steel suffered from nitrogen embrittlement with age</ref>\n\nThe second was in his [[vertical integration]] of all suppliers of raw materials. In the late 1880s, Carnegie Steel was the largest manufacturer of [[pig iron]], steel rails, and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in the world, with a capacity to produce approximately 2,000 tons of [[pig iron|pig metal]] per day. In 1883, Carnegie bought the rival [[Homestead Steel Works]], which included an extensive plant served by tributary coal and iron fields, a {{convert|425|mi|km|adj=on}} long railway, and a line of [[Great Lakes freighter|lake steamships]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> Carnegie combined his assets and those of his associates in 1892 with the launching of the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Carnegie|title=Andrew Carnegie {{!}} Biography & Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBy 1889, the U.S. output of steel exceeded that of the UK, and Carnegie owned a large part of it. Carnegie's empire grew to include the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works|J. Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[Braddock, Pennsylvania|Braddock]], (named for [[John Edgar Thomson]], Carnegie's former boss and president of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works, the Lucy Furnaces, the Union Iron Mills, the Union Mill (Wilson, Walker & County), the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines. Carnegie, through Keystone, supplied the steel for and owned shares in the landmark [[Eads Bridge]] project across the [[Mississippi River]] at [[St. Louis, Missouri]] (completed 1874). This project was an important proof-of-concept for steel technology, which marked the opening of a new steel market.\n\n====1901: U.S. Steel====\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie, Vanity Fair, 1903-10-29.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Carnegie caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1903]]\nIn 1901, Carnegie was 66 years of age and considering retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional [[joint stock corporation]]s as preparation to this end. [[John Pierpont Morgan]] was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had observed how efficiently Carnegie produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the [[United States Steel Corporation]]. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.\n\nThe buyout, secretly negotiated by [[Charles M. Schwab]] (no relation to [[Charles R. Schwab]]), was the largest such industrial takeover in United States history to date. The holdings were incorporated in the United States Steel Corporation, a trust organized by Morgan, and Carnegie retired from business.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> His steel enterprises were bought out for $303,450,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hawke|first=David Freeman|title=John D. The Founding Father of the Rockefellers|publisher=Harper & Row|date=1980|p=210|isbn=978-0060118136}}</ref>\n\nCarnegie's share of this amounted to $225.64 million (in {{Inflation-year|US}}, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|225639000|1901}}}}), which was paid to Carnegie in the form of 5%, 50-year gold bonds. The letter agreeing to sell his share was signed on February 26, 1901. On March 2, the circular formally filing the organization and capitalization (at $1.4 billion \u2013 4% of U.S. national wealth at the time) of the United States Steel Corporation actually completed the contract. The bonds were to be delivered within two weeks to the Hudson Trust Company of [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], in trust to Robert A. Franks, Carnegie's business secretary. There, a special vault was built to house the physical bulk of nearly $230 million worth of bonds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Scholar and activist===\n\n====1880\u20131900====\nCarnegie continued his business career; some of his literary intentions were fulfilled. He befriended English poet [[Matthew Arnold]], English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]], and American humorist [[Mark Twain]], as well as being in correspondence and acquaintance with most of the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]],{{sfnp|Winkler|2006|p=172}} statesmen, and notable writers.{{sfnp|Winkler|2006|p=13}}\n\nCarnegie constructed commodious swimming-baths for the people of his hometown in [[Dunfermline]] in 1879. In the following year, Carnegie gave \u00a38,000 for the establishment of a [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] in Scotland. In 1884, he gave $50,000 to [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] (now part of [[New York University Medical Center]]) to found a [[histology|histological]] laboratory, now called the Carnegie Laboratory.\n\nIn 1881, Carnegie took his family, including his 70-year-old mother, on a trip to the United Kingdom. They toured Scotland by coach, and enjoyed several receptions en route. The highlight was a return to Dunfermline, where Carnegie's mother laid the foundation stone of a [[Carnegie library]] which he funded. Carnegie's criticism of British society did not mean dislike; on the contrary, one of Carnegie's ambitions was to act as a [[catalyst]] for a close association between English-speaking peoples. To this end, in the early 1880s in partnership with [[Samuel Storey]], he purchased numerous newspapers in England, all of which were to advocate the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of \"the British Republic\". Carnegie's charm, aided by his wealth, afforded him many British friends, including Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie's younger brother Thomas died at age 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had purchased at low cost the most valuable of the iron ore fields around [[Lake Superior]]. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled ''An American Four-in-hand in Britain''.\n\n[[File:James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce & Andrew Carnegie - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie, right, with [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in 1886]]\nAlthough actively involved in running his many businesses, Carnegie had become a regular contributor to numerous magazines, most notably ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', under the editorship of [[James Knowles (architect)|James Knowles]], and the influential ''North American Review'', led by editor [[Lloyd Bryce]].\n\nIn 1886, Carnegie wrote his most radical work to date, entitled ''[[Triumphant Democracy]]''. Liberal in its use of statistics to make its arguments, the book argued his view that the American republican system of government was superior to the British [[monarchy|monarchical]] system. It gave a highly favorable and idealized view of American progress and criticized the British royal family. The cover depicted an upended royal [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] and a broken scepter. The book created considerable controversy in the UK. The book made many Americans appreciate their country's economic progress and sold over 40,000 copies, mostly in the US.\n\nIn 1889, Carnegie published \"Wealth\" in the June issue of the ''North American Review''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/SocSci/rbannis1/AIH19th/Carnegie.html|journal=North American Review|title=Wealth|author=Carnegie, Andrew|date=June 1889 }}</ref> After reading it, Gladstone requested its publication in England, where it appeared as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''. Carnegie argued that the life of a wealthy industrialist should comprise two parts. The first part was the gathering and the accumulation of wealth. The second part was for the subsequent distribution of this wealth to benevolent causes. Philanthropy was key to making life worthwhile.\n\nCarnegie was a well-regarded writer. He published three books on travel.<ref>Swetnam, George (1980) ''Andrew Carnegie''. Twayne Publishers.</ref>\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\nWhile Carnegie did not comment on British imperialism, he very strongly opposed the idea of American colonies. He strongly opposed the annexation of the Philippines, almost to the point of supporting [[William Jennings Bryan]] against McKinley in 1900. In 1898, Carnegie tried to arrange for independence for the Philippines. As the end of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] neared, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain for $20 million. To counter what he perceived as imperialism on the part of the United States, Carnegie personally offered $20 million to the Philippines so that the [[Filipino people]] could buy their independence from the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/carnegie/timeline/timeline2.html Andrew Carnegie timeline of events] PBS.</ref> However, nothing came of the offer. In 1898 Carnegie joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League]], in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines. Its membership included former presidents of the United States [[Grover Cleveland]] and [[Benjamin Harrison]] and literary figures like [[Mark Twain]].<ref>Hirschfeld, Katherine ''Health, Politics and Revolution in Cuba'', p. 117, Transaction Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-4128-0863-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Porter, Robert Percival |title=Industrial Cuba: Being a Study of Present Commercial and Industrial Conditions, with Suggestions as to the Opportunities Presented in the Island for American Capital, Enterprise, and Labour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2goAAAAYAAJ|year=1899|publisher=G.

From 1901 forward, public attention was turned from the shrewd business acumen which had enabled Carnegie to accumulate such a fortune, to the public-spirited way in which he devoted himself to utilizing it on philanthropic projects. He had written about his views on social subjects and the responsibilities of great wealth in ''Triumphant Democracy'' (1886) and ''[[Gospel of Wealth]]'' (1889). Carnegie bought [[Skibo Castle]] in Scotland, and made his home partly there and partly in his [[Andrew Carnegie Mansion|New York mansion]] located at 2 East [[91st Street (Manhattan)|91st Street]] at [[Fifth Avenue]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The building was completed in late 1902, and he lived there until his death in 1919.

The sixty-odd club members were the leading business tycoons of Western Pennsylvania and included among their number Frick's best friend, [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]], his attorneys [[Philander Knox]] and James Hay Reed, as well as Frick's business partner, Carnegie. High above the city, near the small town of South Fork, the [[South Fork Dam]] was originally built between 1838 and 1853 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as part of a canal system to be used as a reservoir for a canal basin in Johnstown. With the coming-of-age of railroads superseding canal barge transport, the lake was abandoned by the Commonwealth, sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad, and sold again to private interests and eventually came to be owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club in 1881. Prior to the flood, speculators had purchased the abandoned reservoir, made less than well-engineered repairs to the old dam, raised the lake level, built cottages and a clubhouse, and created the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. Less than {{convert|20|mi}} downstream from the dam sat the city of Johnstown.\n\nThe dam was {{convert|72|ft|m}} high and {{convert|931|ft|m}} long. Between 1881 when the club was opened, and 1889, the dam frequently sprang leaks and was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner removed and sold for scrap the 3 [[cast iron]] discharge pipes that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There had been some speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised by the head of the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown. Such repair work, a reduction in height, and unusually high snowmelt and heavy spring rains combined to cause the dam to give way on May 31, 1889 resulting in twenty million tons of water sweeping down the valley causing the Johnstown Flood.<ref>McCullough, David (1987) ''The Johnstown Flood''. Simon & Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0671207148}}</ref> When word of the dam's failure was telegraphed to Pittsburgh, Frick and other members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club gathered to form the Pittsburgh Relief Committee for assistance to the flood victims as well as determining never to speak publicly about the club or the flood. This strategy was a success, and Knox and Reed were able to fend off all lawsuits that would have placed blame upon the club's members.\n\nAlthough Cambria Iron and Steel's facilities were heavily damaged by the flood, they returned to full production within a year. After the flood, Carnegie built Johnstown a new library to replace the one built by Cambria's chief legal counsel Cyrus Elder, which was destroyed in the flood. The Carnegie-donated library is now owned by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association, and houses the Flood Museum.\n\n===1892: Homestead Strike===\n[[File:Homesteadstrike.jpg|thumb|The Homestead Strike]]\n\nThe [[Homestead Strike]] was a bloody labor confrontation lasting 143 days in 1892, one of the most serious in U.S. history. The conflict was centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]], and grew out of a dispute between the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers of the United States and the [[Carnegie Steel Company]].\n\nCarnegie left on a trip to Scotland before the unrest peaked.<ref name=\"Carnegie, Andrew 1920\">''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', Ch. 17</ref> In doing so, Carnegie left mediation of the dispute in the hands of his associate and partner [[Henry Clay Frick]]. Frick was well known in industrial circles for maintaining staunch anti-union sensibilities.\n\n[[File:Frick to Carnegie letter about the arming of the Pinkertons.jpg|thumb|left|Frick's letter to Carnegie describing the plans and munitions that will be on the barges when the Pinkertons arrive to confront the strikers in Homestead.]]\nAfter a recent increase in profits by 60%, the company refused to raise workers' pay by more than 30%. When some of the workers demanded the full 60%, management locked the union out. Workers considered the stoppage a \"[[lockout (industry)|lockout]]\" by management and not a \"strike\" by workers. As such, the workers would have been well within their rights to protest, and subsequent government action would have been a set of criminal procedures designed to crush what was seen as a pivotal demonstration of the growing [[Labor history of the United States|labor rights movement]], strongly opposed by management. Frick brought in thousands of strikebreakers to work the steel mills and [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agents to safeguard them.\n\nOn July 6, the arrival of a force of 300 Pinkerton agents from New York City and Chicago resulted in a fight in which 10 men\u2014seven strikers and three Pinkertons\u2014were killed and hundreds were injured. Pennsylvania Governor [[Robert E. Pattison|Robert Pattison]] ordered two brigades of state militia to the strike site. Then, allegedly in response to the fight between the striking workers and the Pinkertons, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Alexander Berkman]] shot at Frick in an attempted assassination, wounding Frick. While not directly connected to the strike, Berkman was tied in for the assassination attempt. According to Berkman, \"...with the elimination of Frick, responsibility for Homestead conditions would rest with Carnegie.\"<ref>Berkman, Alexander (1912) [https://archive.org/details/prisonmemoirsan01berkgoog ''Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist'']. Mother Earth Publishing Association. p. 67</ref> Afterwards, the company successfully resumed operations with non-union immigrant employees in place of the Homestead plant workers, and Carnegie returned to the United States.<ref name=\"Carnegie, Andrew 1920\"/> However, Carnegie's reputation was permanently damaged by the Homestead events.\n\n==Philosophy==\n\n===Andrew Carnegie Dictum===\nIn his final days, Carnegie suffered from pneumonia. Before his death on August 11, 1919, Carnegie had donated $350,695,654 for various causes. The \"Andrew Carnegie Dictum\" was:\n*To spend the first third of one's life getting all the education one can.\n*To spend the next third making all the money one can.\n*To spend the last third giving it all away for worthwhile causes.\nCarnegie was involved in philanthropic causes, but he kept himself away from religious circles. He wanted to be identified by the world as a \"[[positivist]]\". He was highly influenced in public life by [[John Bright]].\n\n===On wealth===\n[[File:Andrew Carnegie at Skibo 1914 - Project Gutenberg eText 17976.jpg|thumb|upright|Carnegie at Skibo Castle, 1914]]\n[[File:Stain Glass Andrew Mellon.JPG|thumb|upright|Window dedicated to Carnegie in the [[National Cathedral]]]]\nAs early as 1868, at age 33, he drafted a memo to himself.

Furthermore, Spencer argued that individuals with superior resources who deliberately used investment schemes to put competitors out of business were committing acts of \"commercial murder\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> Carnegie built his wealth in the steel industry by maintaining an extensively integrated operating system. Carnegie also bought out some regional competitors, and merged with others, usually maintaining the majority shares in the companies. Over the course of twenty years, Carnegie's steel properties grew to include the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, the Lucy Furnace Works, the Union Iron Mills, the Homestead Works, the Keystone Bridge Works, the Hartman Steel Works, the Frick Coke Company, and the Scotia ore mines among many other industry related assets.<ref>Morris, Charles R.

In his 1854 essay \"Manners and Fashion\", Spencer referred to public education as \"Old schemes\". He went on to declare that public schools and colleges fill the heads of students with inept, useless knowledge and exclude useful knowledge. Spencer stated that he trusted no organization of any kind, \"political, religious, literary, philanthropic\", and believed that as they expanded in influence so too did their regulations expand. In addition, Spencer thought that as all institutions grow they become evermore corrupted by the influence of power and money. The institution eventually loses its \"original spirit, and sinks into a lifeless mechanism\".<ref>Spencer, Herbert. 1854 (''Manners and Fashion'') ''The Collected Works of 6 Books'' (With Active Table of Contents) (Kindle Locations 74639\u201374656).

Carnegie believed that the sons of prosperous businesspersons were rarely as talented as their fathers.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> By leaving large sums of money to their children, wealthy business leaders were wasting resources that could be used to benefit society. Most notably, Carnegie believed that the future leaders of society would rise from the ranks of the poor.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">''[[#Wealth|Wealth]]'', pp. 682\u2013689.</ref> Carnegie strongly believed in this because he had risen from the bottom. He believed the poor possessed an advantage over the wealthy because they receive greater attention from their parents and are taught better work ethics.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\" />\n\n===Religion and worldview===\nCarnegie and his family belonged to the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]], also known informally as the Northern Presbyterian Church. In his early life Carnegie was skeptical of [[Calvinism]], and religion as a whole, but reconciled with it later in his life. In his autobiography, Carnegie describes his family as moderate [[Presbyterian]] believers, writing that \"there was not one orthodox Presbyterian\" in his family; various members of his family having somewhat distanced themselves from Calvinism, some of them leaning more towards [[Swedenborgianism]]. Although, being a child, his family led vigorous theological and political disputes. His mother avoided the topic of religion. His father left the Presbyterian church after a sermon on infant damnation, while, according to Carnegie, still remaining very religious on his own.\n\nWitnessing sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy, Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism.<ref>[[#Nasaw|Nasaw]]</ref> Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, \"Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.\"<ref>''[[#Autobiography|Autobiography]]'', p. 339</ref>\n\nLater in life, Carnegie's firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member of [[Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church]], pastored from 1905 to 1926 by [[Social Gospel]] exponent [[Henry Sloane Coffin]], while his wife and daughter belonged to the [[Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)|Brick Presbyterian Church]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1919/04/23/archives/bagpipe-tunes-at-carnegie-wedding-charm-of-bonnie-scotland-lent-to.html \"Bagpipe Tunes at Carnegie Wedding\"].

These dilemmas are often regarded as conflicts between his view on international relations and his other loyalties. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, for example, Carnegie allowed his steel works to fill large orders of armor plate for the building of an enlarged and modernized United States Navy, but he opposed American oversea expansion.<ref>Carnegie, ''An American Four-in-Hand in Britain'' (New York, 1883), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nDespite that, Carnegie served as a major donor for than newly-established [[International Court of Arbitration]]'s [[Peace Palace]] - brainchild of Russian Tsar [[Nicolas II]].<ref name=\"MoscowTimes\">{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=Mark H|title=The Hague Peace Palace Keeps Tsar's Vision Alive|url=http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html|website=The Moscow Times|accessdate=August 8, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808232924/http://old.themoscowtimes.com/guides/eng/russia--holland-2013/488749/the-hague-peace-palace-keeps-tsars-vision-alive/508994.html|archivedate=August 8, 2016 |date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis largest and in the long run most influential peace organization was the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], formed in 1910 with a $10 million endowment.<ref>David S.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/985802 online]</ref> In 1913, at the dedication of the Peace Palace in The Hague, Carnegie predicted that the end of war was ''as certain to come, and come soon, as day follows night.''<ref>Cited in Bruno Tertrais \"The Demise of Ares: The End of War as We Know It?\" ''The Washington Quarterly'', 35/3, (2012): p. 17.\n</ref>\n\nIn 1914, on the eve of the First World War, Carnegie founded the Church Peace Union (CPU), a group of leaders in religion, academia, and politics. Through the CPU, Carnegie hoped to mobilize the world's churches, religious organizations, and other spiritual and moral resources to join in promoting moral leadership to put an end to war forever. For its inaugural international event, the CPU sponsored a conference to be held on August 1, 1914, on the shores of Lake Constance in southern Germany. As the delegates made their way to the conference by train, Germany was invading Belgium.\n\nDespite its inauspicious beginning, the CPU thrived. Today its focus is on ethics and it is known as the [[Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs]], an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, whose mission is to be the voice for ethics in international affairs.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War was clearly a shock to Carnegie and his optimistic view on world peace. Although his promotion of [[anti-imperialism]] and world peace had all failed, and the Carnegie Endowment had not fulfilled his expectations, his beliefs and ideas on international relations had helped build the foundation of the [[League of Nations]] after his death, which took world peace to another level.\n\n===US colonial expansion===\nOn the matter of American colonial expansion, Carnegie had always thought it is an unwise gesture for the United States. He did not oppose the annexation of the Hawaiian islands or Puerto Rico, but he opposed the annexation of the Philippines. Carnegie believed that it involved a denial of the fundamental democratic principle, and he also urged [[William McKinley]] to withdraw American troops and allow the Filipinos to live with their independence.<ref>Carnegie, ''Americanism Versus Imperialism'', esp. pp. 12\u201313</ref> This act strongly impressed the other American anti-imperialists, who soon elected him vice-president of the Anti-Imperialist League.\n\nAfter he sold his steel company in 1901, Carnegie was able to get fully involved in the peace cause, both financially and personally. He gave away much of his fortunes to various peace-keeping agencies in order to keep them growing. When his friend, the British writer [[William T. Stead]], asked him to create a new organization for the goal of a peace and arbitration society, his reply was:\n\n{{quote|I do not see that it is wise to devote our efforts to creating another organization. Of course I may be wrong in believing that, but I am certainly not wrong that if it were dependent on any millionaire's money it would begin as an object of pity and end as one of derision. I wonder that you do not see this. There is nothing that robs a righteous cause of its strength more than a millionaire's money. Its life is tainted thereby.<ref>Quoted in Hendrick, B. J. (1932) ''The Life of Andrew Carnegie'', Vol.2, p. 337. Garden City, N. Y. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA376]</ref>}}\n\nCarnegie believed that it is the effort and will of the people, that maintains the peace in international relations. Money is just a push for the act. If world peace depended solely on financial support, it would not seem a goal, but more like an act of pity.\n\nLike Stead, he believed that the United States and the British Empire would merge into one nation, telling him \"We are heading straight to the Re-United States\". Carnegie believed that the combined country's power would maintain world peace and disarmament.<ref name=\"stead1901\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/americanizationo01stea#page/406/mode/2up |title=The Americanization of the World |publisher=Horace Markley |author=Stead, W.

Beyond a gift of $10 million for peace promotion, Carnegie also encouraged the \"scientific\" investigation of the various causes of war, and the adoption of judicial methods that should eventually eliminate them. He believed that the Endowment exists to promote information on the nations' rights and responsibilities under existing international law and to encourage other conferences to codify this law.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Patterson, David S. |title=Andrew Carnegie's Quest for World Peace|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=114|issue=5|year=1970|pages=371\u2013383|jstor=985802}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nCarnegie was a frequent contributor to periodicals on labor issues.

Hendrick]]:\n:His benefactions amounted to $350,000,000 \u2013 for he gave away not only his annual income of something more than $12,500,000, but most of the principal as well. Of this sum, $62,000,000 was allotted to the British Empire and $288,000,000 to the United States, for Carnegie, in the main, confined his benefactions to the English-speaking nations. His largest gifts were $125,000,000 to the Carnegie Corporation of New York (this same body also became his residuary legatee),  $60,000,000 to public library buildings, $20,000,000 to colleges (usually the smaller ones), $6,000,000 to church organs, $29,000,000 to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh, $22,000,000 to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, $10,000,000 to Hero Funds, $10,000,000 to the Endowment for International Peace, $10,000,000 to the Scottish Universities Trust, $10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Trust, and $3,750,000 to the Dunfermline Trust.<ref>Burton J. Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835 - 1919\" ''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1929) v. 3 p 505.</ref>\n\nHendricks argues that:\n:These gifts fairly picture Carnegie's conception of the best ways to improve the status of the common man. They represent all his personal tastes \u2013 his love of books, art, music, and nature \u2013 and the reforms which he regarded as most essential to human progress \u2013 scientific research, education both literary and technical, and, above all, the abolition of war. The expenditure the public most associates with Carnegie's name is that for public libraries. Carnegie himself frequently said that his favorite benefaction was the Hero Fund \u2013 among other reasons, because \"it came up my ain back\"; but probably deep in his own mind his library gifts took precedence over all others in importance. There was only one genuine remedy, he believed, for the ills that beset the human race, and that was enlightenment. \"Let there be light\" was the motto that, in the early days, he insisted on placing in all his library buildings. As to the greatest endowment of all, the Carnegie Corporation, that was merely Andrew Carnegie in permanently organized form; it was established to carry on, after Carnegie's death, the work to which he had given personal attention in his own lifetime.<ref>Hendrick, \"Carnegie, Andrew, 1835 - 1919\"</ref>\n\n===Research sources===\nCarnegie's personal papers are at the [[Library of Congress]] Manuscript Division.\nThe Carnegie Collections of the Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library consist of the archives of the following organizations founded by Carnegie: The [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] (CCNY); The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] (CEIP); the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] (CFAT);The Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs (CCEIA). These collections deal primarily with Carnegie philanthropy and have very little personal material related to Carnegie.

The correlation between semivowels and vowels is strong enough that cross-language differences between semivowels correspond with the differences between their related vowels.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Maddieson|Emmorey|1985}}</ref>\n\nVowels and their corresponding semivowels alternate in many languages depending on the phonological environment, or for grammatical reasons, as is the case with [[Indo-European ablaut]]. Similarly, languages often avoid configurations where a semivowel precedes its corresponding vowel.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=680}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Kawasaki|1982}}</ref> A number of phoneticians distinguish between semivowels and approximants by their location in a syllable. Although he uses the terms interchangeably, {{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}} remarks that, for example, the final glides of English ''par'' and ''buy'' differ from French ''par'' ('through') and ''baille'' ('tub') in that, in the latter pair, the approximants appear in the [[syllable coda]], whereas, in the former, they appear in the [[syllable nucleus]]. This means that opaque (if not minimal) contrasts can occur in languages like [[Italian language|Italian]] (with the i-like sound of ''piede'' 'foot', appearing in the nucleus: {{IPA|[\u02c8pi\u032fe\u02d1de]}}, and that of ''piano'' 'slow', appearing in the syllable onset: {{IPA|[\u02c8pja\u02d1no]}})<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Montreuil|2004|p=104}}</ref> and Spanish (with a near minimal pair being ''abyecto'' {{IPA|[a\u03b2\u02c8jekto]}} 'abject' and ''abierto'' {{IPA|[a\u02c8\u03b2i\u032ferto]}} 'opened').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Saporta|1956|p=288}}</ref>\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|+Approximant-vowel correspondences<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=202}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=323}}</ref>\n!

A transcription with the IPA character for an [[alveolar approximant]] ({{IPA|[\u0279]}}) is common, though the sound is more [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]]. Actual retroflexion may occur as well and both occur as variations of the same sound.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hall\u00e9|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}</ref> However, {{Harvcoltxt|Catford|1988|p=161f}} makes a distinction between the vowels of American English (which he calls \"rhotacized\") and vowels with \"retroflexion\" such as those that appear in [[Badaga language|Badaga]]; {{Harvcoltxt|Trask|1996|p=310}}, on the other hand, labels both as [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] and notes that both have a lowered third [[formant]].<ref>Both cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Hamann|2003|pp=25\u201326}}</ref>\n:{{note|Retroflex|**}} Because the vowels {{IPA|[i \u026f]}} are articulated with spread lips, spreading is implied for their approximant analogues, {{IPA|[j \u0270]}}.  However, these sounds generally have little or no lip-spreading. The fricative letters with a lowering diacritic, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u029d\u02d5 \u0263\u02d5}}}}, may therefore be justified for a neutral articulation between spread {{IPA|[j \u0270]}} and rounded {{IPA|[\u0265 w]}}.<ref>John Esling (2010) \"Phonetic Notation\", in Hardcastle, Laver & Gibbon (eds) ''The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences'', 2nd ed., p 699.</ref>\n\nIn articulation and often diachronically, [[palatal consonant|palatal]] approximants correspond to [[front vowel]]s, [[velar consonant|velar]] approximants to [[back vowel]]s, and labialized approximants to [[rounded vowel]]s. In American English, the [[rhotic consonant|rhotic]] approximant corresponds to the rhotic vowel. This can create alternations (as shown in the above table).\n\nIn addition to alternations, glides can be inserted to the left or the right of their corresponding vowels when they occur next to a hiatus.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=672}}</ref> For example, in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], medial {{IPA|/i/}} triggers the formation of an inserted {{IPA|[j]}} that acts as a syllable onset so that when the affix {{IPA|/-ist/}} is added to \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b ('football') to make \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0441\u0442 'football player', it is pronounced {{IPA|[futbo\u031e\u02c8list]}}, but \u043c\u0430\u043e\u0457\u0441\u0442 ('[[Maoist]]'), with the same affix, is pronounced {{IPA|[mao\u031e\u02c8'''j'''ist]}} with a glide.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=675\u2013676}}</ref> [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for many speakers has a similar process that extends to mid vowels:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|pp=677\u2013678}}</ref>\n* ''bioscoop'' \u2192 {{IPA|[bi'''j'''\u0254sko\u02d0p]}} ('cinema')\n* ''zee'' + ''en'' \u2192 {{IPA|[ze\u02d0'''j'''\u0259(n)]}} ('seas')\n* ''fluor'' \u2192 {{IPA|[fly'''\u0265'''\u0254r]}} ('fluor')\n* ''reu'' + ''en'' \u2192 {{IPA|[r\u00f8'''\u0265'''\u0259(n)]}} ('male dogs')\n* ''Rwanda'' \u2192 {{IPA|[ru'''\u028b'''and\u0250]}} ('[[Rwanda]]')<ref name=\"Dutch\">There is dialectal and allophonic variation in the realization of {{IPA|/\u028b/}}. For speakers who realize it as {{IPA|[\u028b]}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|2002|p=683}} postulates an additional rule that changes any occurrence of {{IPA|[w]}} from glide insertion into {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.</ref>\n* ''Boaz'' \u2192 {{IPA|[bo'''\u028b'''as]}} ('[[Boaz]]')<ref name=\"Dutch\"/>\n\nSimilarly, vowels can be inserted next to their corresponding glide in certain phonetic environments. [[Sievers' law]] describes this behaviour for [[Germanic languages|Germanic]].\n\nNon-high semivowels also occur. In colloquial [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speech, a process of [[glide-formation]] occurs, where one of two adjacent vowels becomes non-syllabic; the process includes mid vowels so that {{IPA|[d\u02b1o\u032fa]}} ('cause to wish') features a non-syllabic mid vowel.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=323\u2013324}}</ref> Spanish features a similar process and even nonsyllabic {{IPA|/a/}} can occur so that ''ahorita'' ('right away') is pronounced {{IPA|[a\u032fo\u031e\u02c8\u027eita]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|pp=256\u2013257}}</ref> It is not often clear, however, whether such sequences involve a semivowel (a consonant) or a diphthong (a vowel), and in many cases, it may not be a meaningful distinction.\n\nAlthough many languages have [[central vowel]]s {{IPA|[\u0268, \u0289]}}, which lie between back/velar {{IPA|[\u026f, u]}} and front/palatal {{IPA|[i, y]}}, there are few cases of a corresponding approximant {{IPA|[ \u0237\u0308]}}. One is in the Korean diphthong {{IPA|[ \u0237\u0308i]}} or {{IPA|[\u0268\u032fi]}}<ref>[https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/iverson/www/kordiph.pdf Ahn & Iverson (2006)]</ref> though it is more frequently analyzed as velar (as in the table above), and [[Mapudungun]] may be another, with three high vowel sounds, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/\u0268/}} and three corresponding consonants, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}, and a third one is often described as a voiced unrounded velar fricative; some texts note a correspondence between this approximant and {{IPA|/\u0268/}} that is parallel to {{IPA|/j/}}\u2013{{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}\u2013{{IPA|/u/}}. An example is ''liq'' {{IPA|/\u02c8li\u0263/}} ({{IPA|[\u02c8li\u0268\u032f]}}?)

For example, the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''ayuda'' ('help') features a palatal approximant that is pronounced as a fricative in emphatic speech.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|2004|p=204}}</ref> Spanish can be analyzed as having a meaningful distinction between fricative, approximant, and intermediate {{IPA|/\u029d \u029d\u02d5 j/}}.<ref>Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n, E. (2004) Problems in the classification of approximants. Journal of the International Phonetic Association, 34, 201\u201310.</ref> However, such frication is generally slight and intermittent, unlike the strong turbulence of fricative consonants.\n\nBecause voicelessness has comparatively reduced resistance to air flow from the lungs, the increased air flow creates more turbulence, making acoustic distinctions between voiceless approximants (which are extremely rare cross-linguistically<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Blevins|2006|p=13}}</ref>) and voiceless fricatives difficult.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ohala|1995|p=8}}</ref> This is why, for example, no language is known to contrast the voiceless labialized velar approximant {{IPA|[w\u0325]}} (also transcribed with the special letter {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u028d}}}}) with a voiceless labialized velar fricative {{IPA|[x\u02b7]}}.<ref name=\"Ladefoged 1996 326\">{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=326}}</ref> Similarly, [[Standard Tibetan]] has a voiceless [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] approximant, {{IPA|[l\u0325]}}, and [[Welsh phonology|Welsh]] has a voiceless lateral fricative {{IPA|[\u026c]}}, but the distinction is not always clear from descriptions of these languages.  Again, no language is known to contrast the two.<ref name=\"Ladefoged 1996 326\"/>  [[Iaai language|Iaai]] is reported to have an unusually large number of voiceless approximants, with {{IPA|/l\u0325 \u0265\u030a w\u0325/}}.\n\nFor places of articulation further back in the mouth, languages do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore, the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, with or without a lowering [[diacritic]].\n\nOccasionally, the glottal \"fricatives\" are called approximants, since {{IPA|[h]}} typically has no more frication than voiceless approximants, but they are often [[phonation]]s of the glottis without any accompanying manner or place of articulation.\n\n==Central approximants==\n\n*[[bilabial approximant]] {{IPA|[\u03b2\u031e]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u03b2}}}})\n*[[labiodental approximant]] {{IPA|[\u028b]}}\n*[[dental approximant]] {{IPA|[\u00f0\u031e]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u00f0}}}})\n*[[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}\n*[[retroflex approximant]] {{IPA|[\u027b&thinsp;]}} (a vocalic {{IPA|[\u025a]}})\n*[[palatal approximant]] {{IPA|[j]}} (a vocalic {{IPA|[i]}})\n*[[velar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0270]}} (a vocalic {{IPA|[\u026f]}})\n*[[uvular approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0281\u031e]}} (usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u0281}}}})\n*[[pharyngeal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0295\u031e]}} (a vocalic {{IPA|[\u0251]}}; usually transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|\u0295}}}})\n*[[breathy-voiced glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0266]}}\n*[[creaky-voiced glottal approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0294\u031e]}}\n\n==Lateral approximants==\nIn lateral approximants, the center of tongue makes solid contact with the roof of the mouth.

It is a [[Latin]] transliteration from the [[koine Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u1f41 [[wikt:\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd|\u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd]]}} (''ho aion''), from the archaic {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}  (''aiwon''). In [[Homer]] it typically refers to life or lifespan. Its latest meaning is more or less similar to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]]'' and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''[[olam (disambiguation)|olam]]''. A [[cognate]] [[Latin language|Latin]]  word ''aevum'' or ''aeuum'' (cf. {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f30\u03dd\u03ce\u03bd}}) for \"age\" is present in words such as ''longevity'' and ''mediaeval''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pballew.net/arithm16.html|title=Math words page 16|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term aeon may be used in reference to a period of a billion years (especially in [[geology]], [[cosmology]] or [[astronomy]]), its more common usage is for any long, indefinite, period.  Aeon can also refer to the four aeons on the [[Geologic Time Scale]] that make up the Earth's history, the [[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]], and the current aeon [[Phanerozoic]].\n\n==Astronomy and cosmology==\nIn astronomy an aeon is defined as a billion years (10<sup>9</sup> years, abbreviated AE).<ref name=Keel>{{cite book |title=Astrophysical Concepts |edition=2nd |author=Martin Harweit |isbn=3-540-96683-8 |year=1991 |publisher=Springer-Verlag}} p. 4.</ref>\n \n[[Roger Penrose]] uses the word ''aeon'' to describe the period between successive and cyclic [[big bang]]s within the context of [[conformal cyclic cosmology]].\n\n==Eternity or age==\n{{further|In saecula saeculorum}}\nThe [[Bible]] translation is a treatment of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''olam'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''aion''.  These words have similar meaning, and [[Young's Literal Translation]] renders them and their derivatives as \"age\" or \"age-during\". Other [[English language|English]] versions most often translate them to indicate eternity, being translated as eternal, everlasting, forever, etc. However, there are notable exceptions to this in all major translations, such as {{bibleref2|Matthew|28:20}}: \"...I am with you always, to the end of the age\" (NRSV), the word \"age\" being a translation of ''aion''. Rendering ''aion'' to indicate eternality in this verse would result in the contradictory phrase \"end of eternity\", so the question arises whether it should ever be so.<ref>Canon F. W.

After each man's mortal life ends, he is judged worthy of aeonian life or aeonian punishment. That is, after the period of the aeons, all punishment will cease and death is overcome and then God becomes the all in each one ({{bibleref2|1Cor|15:28|NKJV}}).  This contrasts with the conventional Christian belief in eternal life and eternal punishment.\n\n[[Occult]]ists of the [[Thelema]] and [[Ordo Templi Orientis|O.T.O.]] traditions sometimes speak of a \"magical Aeon\" that may last for far less time, perhaps as little as 2,000 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Order of Nine Angles|The Order of Nine Angles]], a UK-based [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|Left Hand Path]]/[[Satanism|Satanic]] organisation propose the concept of Aeons are central to the esoteric philosophy developed by the pseudonymous Anton Long, who wrote that \"an aeon is the term used [by the O9A] to describe a stage or a type of evolution. Evolution itself is taken to result from a certain specific process \u2013 and this process can be described, or explained [or 're-presented' ] via a bifurcation of time. That is, evolution is an expression of how the cosmos changes over or through or because of,'time' \u2013 this 'time' having two components. These two components are the causal and the acausal ...\n\n\"An aeon is a manifestation, in the causal, of a particular type of acausal energy. This energy re-orders, or changes, the causal. These changes have certain limits \u2013 in both causal space and causal time. That is, they have a specific beginning and a specific end. A civilization (or rather, a higher or aeonic-civilization) is how this energy becomes ordered or manifests itself in the causal: how this energy is revealed. A civilization represents the practical changes which this energy causes in the causal -in terms of the effect such energy has on individuals and this planet.

Generally, airline companies are recognized with an [[Air operator's certificate|air operating certificate]] or license issued by a governmental aviation body.\n\nAirlines vary in size, from small domestic airlines to full-service international airlines.

Using a fleet of former military [[Airco DH.4]]A biplanes that had been modified to carry two passengers in the [[fuselage]], it operated relief flights between [[Folkestone]] and [[Ghent]]. On 15 July 1919, the company flew a proving flight across the [[English Channel]], despite a lack of support from the British government. Flown by Lt. H Shaw in an [[Airco DH.9]] between [[RAF Hendon]] and [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport]], the flight took 2 hours and 30 minutes at \u00a321 per passenger.\n\nOn 25 August 1919, the company used [[Airco DH.16|DH.16s]] to pioneer a regular service from [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] to Le Bourget, the first regular international service in the world. The airline soon gained a reputation for reliability, despite problems with bad weather, and began to attract European competition. In November 1919, it won the first British civil [[airmail]] contract. Six [[Royal Air Force]] [[Airco DH.9A]] aircraft were lent to the company, to operate the airmail service between [[Hawkinge]] and [[Cologne]]. In 1920, they were returned to the Royal Air Force.<ref>''The Putnam Aeronautical Review'' edited by John Motum, p170 Volume one 1990 Naval Institute Press</ref>\n\nOther British competitors were quick to follow \u2013 [[Handley Page Transport]] was established in 1919 and used the company's converted [[World War One|wartime]] [[Handley Page Type O|Type O/400]] [[bomber]]s with a capacity for 12 passengers,<ref>https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1961/1961%20-%200055.PDF</ref> to run a [[London]]-[[Paris]] passenger service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airlinehistory.co.uk/Airline%20History/History1903.asp|title=Airline History 1903 to 1919|website=www.airlinehistory.co.uk|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\nThe first French airline was [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des lignes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re]], later known as A\u00e9ropostale, which started its first service in late 1918 to Spain.

Another early French airline was the [[Compagnie des Messageries A\u00e9riennes]], established in 1919 by [[Louis-Charles Breguet]], offering a mail and freight service between [[Paris \u2013 Le Bourget Airport|Le Bourget Airport]], [[Paris]] and [[Lesquin Airport]], [[Lille]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |title=World Aviation in 1919 - Part 1 |publisher=Royal Air Force Museum |accessdate=28 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105130943/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/milestones-of-flight/world/1919.cfm |archivedate=5 January 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00007, Berlin, Start eines Junkers-Flugzeuges.jpg|thumb| [[Junkers F.13]] ''D-190'' of [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]]]\nThe first German airline to use heavier than air aircraft was [[Deutsche Luft-Reederei]] established in 1917 which started operating in February 1919. In its first year, the D.L.R. operated regularly scheduled flights on routes with a combined length of nearly 1000 miles. By 1921 the D.L.R. network was more than 3000&nbsp;km (1865 miles) long, and included destinations in the Netherlands, Scandinavia and the Baltic Republics. Another important German airline was [[Junkers Luftverkehr]], which began operations in 1921. It was a division of the aircraft manufacturer [[Junkers]], which became a separate company in 1924. It operated joint-venture airlines in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\n[[File:Klm-poster-1919.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A 1919 advertisement for the Dutch airline [[KLM]]]]\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] airline [[KLM]] made its first flight in 1920, and is the oldest continuously operating airline in the world.

In 1921, KLM started scheduled services.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the charter establishing Aero O/Y (now [[Finnair]]) was signed in the city of [[Helsinki]] on September 12, 1923. [[Junkers F.13]] D-335 became the first aircraft of the company, when Aero took delivery of it on March 14, 1924. The first flight was between Helsinki and [[Tallinn]], capital of [[Estonia]], and it took place on March 20, 1924, one week later.\n\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], the Chief Administration of the Civil Air Fleet was established in 1921. One of its first acts was to help found Deutsch-Russische Luftverkehrs A.G. (Deruluft), a German-Russian joint venture to provide air transport from Russia to the West. Domestic air service began around the same time, when Dobrolyot started operations on 15 July 1923 between Moscow and Nizhni Novgorod. Since 1932 all operations had been carried under the name [[Aeroflot]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aeroflot.ru/us-en/about/history|title=Aeroflot History {{!}} Aeroflot|website=www.aeroflot.ru|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\nEarly European airlines tended to favor comfort \u2013 the passenger cabins were often spacious with luxurious interiors \u2013 over speed and efficiency. The relatively basic navigational capabilities of pilots at the time also meant that delays due to the weather were commonplace.\n\n====Rationalization====\n[[File:National Audit Office - Victoria - London - 020504.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|The [[Imperial Airways]] Empire Terminal, Victoria, London. Trains ran from here to [[flying boats]] in [[Southampton]], and to [[Croydon Airport]].]]\nBy the early 1920s, small airlines were struggling to compete, and there was a movement towards increased rationalization and consolidation. In 1924, [[Imperial Airways]] was formed from the merger of [[Instone Air Line|Instone Air Line Company]], [[British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd|British Marine Air Navigation]], [[Daimler Airway]] and [[Handley Page Transport|Handley Page Transport Co Ltd.]], to allow British airlines to compete with stiff competition from French and German airlines that were enjoying heavy government subsidies. The airline was a pioneer in surveying and opening up air routes across the world to serve far-flung parts of the [[British Empire]] and to enhance trade and integration.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1923/1923%20-%200760.html |title = Imperial Air Transport Company: Appointment of Government Directors|work = Flight|date = December 20, 1923|page = 760}}</ref>\n\nThe first new airliner ordered by Imperial Airways, was the [[Handley Page W8f]] ''City of Washington'', delivered on 3 November 1924.<ref>http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/coming%20of%20age/imperial%20airways.htm</ref> In the first year of operation the company carried 11,395 passengers and 212,380 letters. In April 1925, the film ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' became the first film to be screened for passengers on a scheduled airliner flight when it was shown on the London-Paris route.\n\nTwo French airlines also merged to form [[Air Union]] on 1 January 1923. This later merged with four other French airlines to become [[Air France]], the country's flagship carrier to this day, on 7 October 1933.\n\nGermany's [[Deutsche Luft Hansa]] was created in 1926 by merger of two airlines, one of them [[Junkers Luftverkehr]]. Luft Hansa, due to the [[Hugo Junkers|Junkers]] heritage and unlike most other airlines at the time, became a major investor in airlines outside of Europe, providing capital to [[Varig]] and Avianca. German airliners built by [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]], [[Dornier GmbH|Dornier]], and [[Fokker]] were among the most advanced in the world at the time.\n\n====Global expansion====\nIn 1926, [[Alan Cobham]] surveyed a flight route from the UK to [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], following this up with another proving flight to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. Other routes to [[British India]] and the [[Far East]] were also charted and demonstrated at this time. Regular services to [[Cairo]] and [[Basra]] began in 1927 and were extended to [[Karachi]] in 1929. The London-[[Australia]] service was inaugurated in 1932 with the [[Handley Page HP 42]] airliners. Further services were opened up to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], [[Rangoon]], [[Singapore]], [[Brisbane]] and [[Hong Kong]] passengers departed London on 14 March 1936 following the establishment of a branch from Penang to Hong Kong.\n\n[[File:Imperial routes April 1935.jpg|thumb|left|April 1935 map showing [[Imperial Airways]]' routes from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to [[Australia]] and [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]]] Imperial's aircraft were small, most seating fewer than twenty passengers, and catered for the rich. Only about 50,000 passengers used Imperial Airways in the 1930s. Most passengers on intercontinental routes or on services within and between British colonies were men doing colonial administration, business or research.<ref>Pirie, G.H. Incidental tourism: British imperial air travel in the 1930s. ''Journal of Tourism History'', 1 (2009) 49\u201366.</ref>\n\nLike Imperial Airways, [[Air France]] and [[KLM]]'s early growth depended heavily on the needs to service links with far-flung colonial possessions ([[French North Africa|North Africa]] and [[French Indochina|Indochina]] for the French and the [[Dutch Indies|East Indies]] for the Dutch). France began an air mail service to [[Morocco]] in 1919 that was bought out in 1927, renamed [[A\u00e9ropostale (aviation)|A\u00e9ropostale]], and injected with capital to become a major international carrier. In 1933, A\u00e9ropostale went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]], was nationalized and merged into [[Air France]].\n\nAlthough Germany lacked colonies, it also began expanding its services globally. In 1931, the airship [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]] began offering regular scheduled passenger service between Germany and South America, usually every two weeks, which continued until 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/lz127-graf-zeppelin/history |title=LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin |publisher=Airships.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> In 1936, the airship [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] entered passenger service and successfully crossed the Atlantic 36 times before crashing at Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airships.net/hindenburg |title=Hindenburg |publisher=Airships.net |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005073820/http://www.airships.net/hindenburg| archivedate= 5 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nFrom February 1934 until World War II began in 1939 [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Deutsche Lufthansa]] operated an airmail service from [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]] via [[Spain]], the [[Canary Islands]] and West Africa to [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]] in [[Brazil]].

During the Soviet era Aeroflot was synonymous with Russian civil aviation, as it was the only air carrier. It became the first airline in the world to operate sustained regular jet services on 15 September 1956 with the [[Tupolev Tu-104]].\n\n====EU airline deregulation====\nDeregulation of the [[European Union]] airspace in the early 1990s has had substantial effect on the structure of the industry there. The shift towards 'budget' airlines on shorter routes has been significant. Airlines such as [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]] have often grown at the expense of the traditional national airlines.\n\nThere has also been a trend for these national airlines themselves to be privatized such as has occurred for [[Aer Lingus]] and [[British Airways]]. Other national airlines, including Italy's [[Alitalia]], have suffered \u2013 particularly with the rapid increase of oil prices in early 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/alitalia-future-hinges-on-rescue-package/a-1320328|title=Alitalia Future Hinges on Rescue Package {{!}} Business {{!}} DW {{!}} 07.09.2004|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\n===U.S. airline industry===\n{{main article|Air transportation in the United States}}\n\n====Early development====\n[[File:TWA 1940.jpg|thumb|[[TWA]] [[Douglas DC-3]] in 1940.

Many decided to take their war-surplus aircraft on barnstorming campaigns, performing aerobatic maneuvers to woo crowds. In 1918, the [[United States Postal Service]] won the financial backing of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to begin experimenting with [[air mail]] service, initially using [[Curtiss Jenny]]<ref>Amick, George. \"How The Airmail Got Off The Ground.\" American History 33.3 (1998): 48.

In 1925, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] bought out the [[William Bushnell Stout|Stout Aircraft Company]] and began construction of the all-metal [[Ford Trimotor]], which became the first successful American airliner.

Pan Am and Northwest Airways (which began flights to Canada in the 1920s) were the only U.S. airlines to go international before the 1940s.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Boeing 247]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] in the 1930s, the U.S. airline industry was generally profitable, even during the [[Great Depression]].

They were eager to invest in the newly emerging flagships of air travel such as the [[Boeing Stratocruiser]], [[Lockheed Constellation]], and [[Douglas DC-6]]. Most of these new aircraft were based on American bombers such as the [[B-29]], which had spearheaded research into new technologies such as [[pressurization]].

New start-ups entered during the downturn, during which time they found aircraft and funding, contracted hangar and maintenance services, trained new employees, and recruited laid off staff from other airlines.\n\nMajor airlines dominated their routes through aggressive pricing and additional capacity offerings, often swamping new start-ups. In the place of high barriers to entry imposed by regulation, the major airlines implemented an equally high barrier called [[loss leader]] pricing.<ref name=\"Andrew R.

Although not exclusively attributable to deregulation, indeed the U.S. witnessed an explosive growth in demand for air travel. Many millions who had never or rarely flown before became regular fliers, even joining [[frequent flyer]] loyalty programs and receiving free flights and other benefits from their flying. New services and higher frequencies meant that business fliers could fly to another city, do business, and return the same day, from almost any point in the country. Air travel's advantages put long distance intercity [[railroad]] travel and bus lines under pressure, with most of the latter having withered away, whilst the former is still protected under [[nationalization]] through the continuing existence of [[Amtrak]].\n\nBy the 1980s, almost half of the total flying in the world took place in the U.S., and today the domestic industry operates over 10,000 daily departures nationwide.\n\nToward the end of the century, a new style of [[low-cost carrier|low cost airline]] emerged, offering a no-frills product at a lower price. [[Southwest Airlines]], [[JetBlue]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Skybus Airlines]] and other low-cost carriers began to represent a serious challenge to the so-called \"legacy airlines\", as did their low-cost counterparts in many other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/travel/article/budget-airline-trends-2016/index.html|title=Budget airlines changed the world. What next?|date=2016-03-21|work=CNN Travel|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}</ref> Their commercial viability represented a serious competitive threat to the legacy carriers. However, of these, [[ATA Airlines|ATA]] and Skybus have since ceased operations.\n\nIncreasingly since 1978, US airlines have been reincorporated and [[off spin|spun off]] by newly created and internally led management companies, and thus becoming nothing more than operating units and subsidiaries with limited financially decisive control. Among some of these [[holding company|holding companies]] and [[parent company|parent companies]] which are relatively well known, are the [[UAL Corporation]], along with the [[AMR Corporation]], among a long [[list of airline holding companies]] sometime recognized worldwide. Less recognized are the [[private equity firm]]s which often seize managerial, financial, and [[board of directors]] control of distressed airline companies by temporarily investing large sums of [[Equity (finance)|capital]] in air carriers, to rescheme an airlines assets into a profitable organization or [[liquidate|liquidating]] an air carrier of their profitable and worthwhile routes and business operations.\n\nThus the last 50 years of the airline industry have varied from reasonably profitable, to devastatingly depressed. As the first major market to deregulate the industry in 1978, U.S. airlines have experienced more turbulence than almost any other country or region. In fact, no U.S. [[legacy carrier]] survived bankruptcy-free. Among the outspoken critics of deregulation, former CEO of American Airlines, [[Robert Crandall]] has publicly stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing shows airline industry deregulation was a mistake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |title=Robert Cranall former CEO AA, CNBC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429202738/http://www.cnbc.com/id/45477274/AMR_Filing_Shows_Airline_Deregulation_Failed_Ex_CEO |archivedate=2013-04-29 }}</ref>\"</blockquote>\n\n====The airline industry bailout====\n\nCongress passed the [https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2926 Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act] (P.L. 107-42) in response to a severe liquidity crisis facing the already-troubled airline industry in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]. Through the [[Air Transportation Stabilization Board|ATSB]] Congress sought to provide cash infusions to carriers for both the cost of the four-day federal shutdown of the airlines and the incremental losses incurred through December 31, 2001, as a result of the terrorist attacks.

Following the end of the war in 1945, regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on July 29, 1946, under the name Air India. After the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]].

This Indonesian [[flag carrier]] is owned by the [[Politics of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]]]]\n\nMany countries have [[Flag carrier|national airline]]s that the government owns and operates. Fully private airlines are subject to a great deal of government regulation for economic, political, and safety concerns. For instance, governments often intervene to halt airline labor actions to protect the free flow of people, communications, and goods between different regions without compromising safety.\n\nThe United States, Australia, and to a lesser extent Brazil, Mexico, India, the United Kingdom, and Japan have \"deregulated\" their airlines. In the past, these governments dictated airfares, route networks, and other operational requirements for each airline. Since deregulation, airlines have been largely free to negotiate their own operating arrangements with different airports, enter and exit routes easily, and to levy airfares and supply flights according to market demand.\n[[File:Cyprus airways a330.jpg|thumb|[[Cyprus Airways]], the now defunct national airline of Cyprus]]\nThe entry barriers for new airlines are lower in a deregulated market, and so the U.S. has seen hundreds of airlines start up (sometimes for only a brief operating period). This has produced far greater competition than before deregulation in most markets. The added competition, together with pricing freedom, means that new entrants often take market share with highly reduced rates that, to a limited degree, full service airlines must match. This is a major constraint on profitability for established carriers, which tend to have a higher cost base.\n\nAs a result, profitability in a deregulated market is uneven for most airlines. These forces have caused some major airlines to go out of business, in addition to most of the poorly established new entrants.\n\nIn the United States, the airline industry is dominated by four large firms. Because of industry consolidation, after fuel prices dropped considerably in 2015, very little of the savings were passed on to consumers.<ref>\"Too Much of a Good Thing.\" ''The Economist'' 26 March 2016: 23. print.</ref>\n\n===International===\n[[File:SIA Airbus A380, 9V-SKA, SIN 8.jpg|thumb|[[Singapore Airlines]] [[Airbus A380]] landing at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]].

Most international air traffic is regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which designate specific carriers to operate on specific routes. The model of such an agreement was the [[Bermuda Agreement]] between the US and UK following World War II, which designated airports to be used for transatlantic flights and gave each government the authority to nominate carriers to operate routes.\n\nBilateral agreements are based on the \"[[freedoms of the air]]\", a group of generalized traffic rights ranging from the freedom to overfly a country to the freedom to provide domestic flights within a country (a very rarely granted right known as [[cabotage]]). Most agreements permit airlines to fly from their home country to designated airports in the other country: some also extend the freedom to provide continuing service to a third country, or to another destination in the other country while carrying passengers from overseas.\n\nIn the 1990s, \"[[open skies]]\" agreements became more common. These agreements take many of these regulatory powers from state governments and open up international routes to further competition. Open skies agreements have met some criticism, particularly within the European Union, whose airlines would be at a comparative disadvantage with the United States' because of [[cabotage]] restrictions.\n\n==Economic considerations==\n\nIn 2017, 4.1 billion passengers have been carried by airlines in 41.9 million commercial scheduled flights (an average payload of {{#expr:4100/41.9round0}} passengers), for 7.75 trillion [[passenger kilometre]]s (an average trip of {{#expr:7750/4.100round0}} km) over 45,091 airline routes served globally.<!--<ref name=ATAGOct2018>-->\nIn 2016, air transport generated $704.4 billion of revenue in 2016, employed 10.2 million workers, supported 65.5 million jobs and $2.7 trillion of economic activity: 3.6% of the global [[GDP]].<ref name=ATAGOct2018>{{cite web |url= https://www.aviationbenefits.org/media/166344/abbb18_full-report_web.pdf |publisher= Air Transport Action Group |title= Aviation: Benefits Beyond Borders |date= October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, the total weekly airline capacity was 181.1 billion [[Available Seat Kilometers]] (+6.9% compared to July 2015): 57.6bn in Asia-Pacific, 47.7bn in Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://html5.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/desktop/stage/default.aspx?pnum=78&edid=e030c749-44c6-4ab0-af51-84e8f4424689 |title= Capacity snapshot |work= Airline Business |date= July\u2013August 2016 |publisher= Flight Global |page= 78}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top 150 airline groups<ref name=WorldAirlineRankings2017>{{cite web |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/18223 |title= World Airline Rankings |date= 2017 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n! !! 2016 !! 2015 !! 2014 !! 2013 !! 2012 !! 2011 !! 2010 !! 2009 !! 2008\n|-\n!

The airline industry as a whole has made a cumulative loss during its 100-year history, once the costs include subsidies for aircraft development and airport construction.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,1715861,00.html Wings of Desire], Guardian, Thursday February 23, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.johnkay.com/2005/09/27/airlines-and-the-canine-features-of-unprofitable-industries/ Airlines and the canine features of unprofitable industries], Financial Times, September 27, 2005</ref>\n\nOne argument is that [[positive externalities]], such as higher growth due to global mobility, outweigh the microeconomic losses and justify continuing government intervention. A historically high level of government intervention in the airline industry can be seen as part of a wider political consensus on strategic forms of transport, such as [[highway]]s and [[Rail transport|railways]], both of which receive public funding in most parts of the world. Although many countries continue to operate state-owned or parastatal airlines, many large airlines today are privately owned and are therefore governed by microeconomic principles to maximize shareholder profit.\n\nIn December 1991, the collapse of Pan Am, an airline often credited for shaping the international airline industry, highlighted the financial complexities faced by major airline companies.\n\nFollowing the [[Airline Deregulation Act|1978 deregulation]], U.S. carriers did not manage to make an aggregate [[economic profit|profit]] for 12 years in 31, including four years where combined [[economic loss|losses]] amounted to $10 billion, but rebounded with eight consecutive years of profits since 2010, including its four with over $10 billion profits.<!--<ref name=AvWeek14May2018/>-->\nThey drop loss-making routes, avoid [[fare war]]s and [[market share]] battles, limit [[Seating capacity|capacity]] growth, add [[airline hub|hub]] feed with [[regional jet]]s to increase their [[profitability]].\nThey change [[schedule]]s to create more connections, buy used aircraft, reduce international frequencies and leverage [[partnership]]s to optimise capacities and benefit from overseas connectivity.<ref name=AvWeek14May2018>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/big-us-airlines-seek-long-term-profitability |title= Big U.S. Airlines Seek Long-term Profitability |date= May 14, 2018 |author= Sean Broderick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n=== Largest airlines ===\nThe [[world's largest airlines]] can be defined in several ways. [[American Airlines Group]] is the largest by its fleet size, [[revenue]], [[profit (accounting)|profit]], [[passenger]]s carried and [[revenue passenger mile]]. [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest by [[asset]]s value and [[market capitalization]]. [[Lufthansa Group]] is the largest by number of [[employee]]s, [[FedEx Express]] by freight [[tonne-kilometer]]s, [[Ryanair]] by number of international passengers carried and [[Turkish Airlines]] by number of countries served.\n{{main|World's largest airlines}}\n\n===Ticket revenue===\n\nAirlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized [[yield management]] systems.\n\nBecause of the complications in scheduling flights and maintaining profitability, airlines have many loopholes that can be used by the knowledgeable traveler. Many of these airfare secrets are becoming more and more known to the general public, so airlines are forced to make constant adjustments.\n\nMost airlines use differentiated pricing, a form of [[price discrimination]], to sell air services at varying prices simultaneously to different segments. Factors influencing the price include the days remaining until departure, the booked load factor, the forecast of total demand by price point, competitive pricing in force, and variations by day of week of departure and by time of day. Carriers often accomplish this by dividing each cabin of the aircraft (first, business and economy) into a number of [[travel class]]es for pricing purposes.\n\nA complicating factor is that of origin-destination control (\"O&D control\"). Someone purchasing a ticket from Melbourne to Sydney (as an example) for A$200 is competing with someone else who wants to fly Melbourne to Los Angeles through Sydney on the same flight, and who is willing to pay A$1400. Should the airline prefer the $1400 passenger, or the $200 passenger plus a possible Sydney-Los Angeles passenger willing to pay $1300? Airlines have to make hundreds of thousands of similar pricing decisions daily.\n[[File:Flughafen Frankfurt am Main.JPG|thumb|[[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 747-400]]. Lufthansa is the [[flag carrier]] airline of [[Germany]].]]\n\nThe advent of advanced computerized reservations systems in the late 1970s, most notably [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], allowed airlines to easily perform [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefit analyses]] on different pricing structures, leading to almost perfect price discrimination in some cases (that is, filling each seat on an aircraft at the highest price that can be charged without driving the consumer elsewhere).\n\nThe intense nature of airfare pricing has led to the term \"[[fare war]]\" to describe efforts by airlines to undercut other airlines on competitive routes. Through computers, new airfares can be published quickly and efficiently to the airlines' sales channels. For this purpose the airlines use the [[Airline Tariff Publishing Company]] (ATPCO), who distribute latest fares for more than 500 airlines to [[Computer Reservation System]]s across the world.\n\nThe extent of these pricing phenomena is strongest in \"legacy\" carriers. In contrast, low fare carriers usually offer pre-announced and simplified price structure, and sometimes quote prices for each leg of a trip separately.\n\nComputers also allow airlines to predict, with some accuracy, how many passengers will actually fly after making a reservation to fly. This allows airlines to overbook their flights enough to fill the aircraft while accounting for \"no-shows\", but not enough (in most cases) to force paying passengers off the aircraft for lack of seats, stimulative pricing for low demand flights coupled with [[overbooking]] on high demand flights can help reduce this figure. This is especially crucial during tough economic times as airlines undertake massive cuts to ticket prices to retain demand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |title=Recession 'prompts surge in cheap flights' |publisher=News.cheapflights.co.uk |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130120521/http://news.cheapflights.co.uk/flights/2009/05/recession-prompts-surge-in-cheap-flights.html |archive-date=2009-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nOver January/February 2018, the cheapest airline surveyed by price comparator [[rome2rio]] was [[Tigerair Australia]] with $0.06/km followed by [[AirAsia X]] with $0.07/km, while the most expensive was [[Charterlines, Inc.]] with $1.26/km followed by [[Buddha Air]] with $1.18/km.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.rome2rio.com/labs/2018-global-flight-price-ranking/ |title= 2018 Global Flight Price Ranking: What\u2019s the world\u2019s cheapest airline? |publisher= [[rome2rio]] |date= April 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[IATA]], the global airline industry [[revenue]] was $754 billion in 2017 for a $38.4 billion collective [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], and should rise by 10.7% to $834 billion in 2018 for a $33.8 billion profit forecast, down by 12% due to rising [[jet fuel]] and [[Workforce|labor]] costs.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/airlines-formula-protecting-profits-higher-fares |title= Airlines\u2019 Formula For Protecting Profits: Higher Fares |date= Jun 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau, Adrian Schofield and Aaron Karp |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==== Elasticity ====\n\nThe demand for air transport will be less [[Elasticity (economics)|elastic]] for [[flight length|longer flights]] than for shorter flights, and more elastic for [[leisure travel]] than for [[business travel]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.fin.gc.ca/consultresp/Airtravel/airtravStdy_-eng.asp |title= Air Travel Demand Elasticities: Concepts, Issues and Measurement |author= David W.

Thus all but a small percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost centers.\n\nMoreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations. If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for returning them back to the original country.\n\nAnalysis of the 1992\u20131996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2\u20133.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering companies 10\u201313%, handling companies 11\u201314%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global distribution companies more than 30%. (Source: Spinetta, 2000, quoted in Doganis, 2002)\n\nThe widespread entrance of a new breed of [[low cost airline]]s beginning at the turn of the century has accelerated the demand that full service carriers control costs. Many of these low cost companies emulate [[Southwest Airlines]] in various respects, and like Southwest, they can eke out a consistent profit throughout all phases of the business cycle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2015/10/08/the-southwest-effect-is-alive-and-well-airline-executives-say|title=The Southwest effect is|date=2015-10-08|work=Dallas News|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, a [[shakeout]] of airlines is occurring in the U.S. and elsewhere. [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] (twice), [[US Airways]] (twice), [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[Northwest Airlines]] have all declared [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.\n\nWhere an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or \"hub\") for its scheduled flights.\n\nOperating costs for US [[major airline]]s are primarily aircraft [[operating expense]] including [[jet fuel]], [[aircraft maintenance]], [[depreciation]] and [[aircrew]] for 44%, servicing expense for 29% (traffic 11%, passenger 11% and aircraft 7%), 14% for reservations and sales and 13% for [[overheads]] (administration 6% and advertising 2%).<!--<ref name=ICAO20feb2017/>-->\nAn average US major [[Boeing 757]]-200 flies {{cvt|1252|mile|km}} stages 11.3 block hours per day and costs $2,550 per block hour : $923 of ownership, $590 of maintenance, $548 of fuel and $489 of crew; or $13.34 per 186 seats per block hour.<!--<ref name=ICAO20feb2017/>-->\nFor a [[Boeing 737-500]], a low-cost carrier like Southwest have lower operating costs at $1,526 than a full service one like United at $2,974, and higher [[productivity]] with 399,746 [[available seat miles|ASM]] per day against 264,284, resulting in a unit cost of {{#expr:152600/399746round2}} $cts/ASM against {{#expr:297400/264284round2}} $cts/ASM.<ref name=ICAO20feb2017>{{cite web |url= https://www.icao.int/MID/Documents/2017/Aviation%20Data%20and%20Analysis%20Seminar/PPT3%20-%20Airlines%20Operating%20costs%20and%20productivity.pdf |title= Airline Operating Costs and Productivity |date= 20 February 2017 |publisher= ICAO}}</ref>\n\n===Assets and financing===\n[[File:Maslounge.jpg|thumb|The 'Golden Lounge' of [[Malaysia Airlines]] at [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA). The airline has ownership of special slots at KLIA, giving it a competitive edge over other airlines operating at the airport.]]\nAirline financing is quite complex, since airlines are highly leveraged operations. Not only must they purchase (or lease) new airliner bodies and engines regularly, they must make major long-term fleet decisions with the goal of meeting the demands of their markets while producing a fleet that is relatively economical to operate and maintain; comparably Southwest Airlines and their reliance on a single airplane type (the [[Boeing 737]] and derivatives), with the now defunct [[Eastern Air Lines]] which operated 17 different aircraft types, each with varying pilot, engine, maintenance, and support needs.\n\nA second financial issue is that of [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[fuel]] purchases, which are usually second only to [[Labour (economics)|labor]] in its relative cost to the company. However, with the current high fuel prices it has become the largest cost to an airline. Legacy airlines, compared with new entrants, have been hit harder by rising fuel prices partly due to the running of older, less fuel efficient aircraft.<ref name=\"Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. 2009\"/> While hedging instruments can be expensive, they can easily pay for themselves many times over in periods of increasing fuel costs, such as in the 2000\u20132005 period.\n\nIn view of the congestion apparent at many international [[airport]]s, the ownership of slots at certain airports (the right to take-off or land an aircraft at a particular time of day or night) has become a significant tradable asset for many airlines. Clearly take-off slots at popular times of the day can be critical in attracting the more profitable business traveler to a given airline's flight and in establishing a competitive advantage against a competing airline.\n\nIf a particular city has two or more airports, market forces will tend to attract the less profitable routes, or those on which competition is weakest, to the less congested airport, where slots are likely to be more available and therefore cheaper. For example, [[Reagan National Airport]] attracts profitable routes due partly to its congestion, leaving less-profitable routes to [[Baltimore-Washington International Airport]] and [[Dulles International Airport]].\n\nOther factors, such as surface transport facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights may need to operate from the one with the longest runway. For example, [[LaGuardia Airport]] is the preferred airport for most of [[Manhattan]] due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]'s longer runways.\n\n===Airline partnerships===\n[[File:largest airline alliances.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|Home countries of airlines in the largest airline alliances: Star Alliance (grey), SkyTeam (blue) and Oneworld (purple). IATA codes of founders are outlined in red.]]\n[[File:JA8941-oneworld-01.jpg|thumb|A [[Japan Airlines]] Boeing 777-300 with special [[Oneworld]] livery. Oneworld is the third largest airline alliance after [[Star Alliance]] and [[SkyTeam]].]]\n\n[[Codeshare agreement|Codesharing]] is the most common type of airline partnership; it involves one airline selling tickets for another airline's flights under its own airline code. An early example of this was Japan Airlines' (JAL) codesharing partnership with Aeroflot in the 1960s on [[Tokyo]]\u2013[[Moscow]] flights; Aeroflot operated the flights using Aeroflot aircraft, but JAL sold tickets for the flights as if they were JAL flights. This practice allows airlines to expand their operations, at least on paper, into parts of the world where they cannot afford to establish bases or purchase aircraft. Another example was the [[Austrian Airlines|Austrian]]\u2013[[Sabena]] partnership on the [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Brussels]]\u2013[[New York City|New York]]/JFK route during the late '60s, using a Sabena [[Boeing 707]] with Austrian [[Aircraft livery|livery]].\n\nSince airline reservation requests are often made by city-pair (such as \"show me flights from Chicago to D\u00fcsseldorf\"), an airline that can codeshare with another airline for a variety of routes might be able to be listed as indeed offering a Chicago\u2013[[D\u00fcsseldorf]] flight. The passenger is advised however, that airline no. 1 operates the flight from say Chicago to Amsterdam, and airline no. 2 operates the continuing flight (on a different airplane, sometimes from another terminal) to D\u00fcsseldorf. Thus the primary rationale for code sharing is to expand one's service offerings in city-pair terms to increase sales.\n\nA more recent development is the [[airline alliance]], which became prevalent in the late 1990s. These alliances can act as virtual mergers to get around government restrictions. Alliances of airlines such as [[Star Alliance]], [[Oneworld]], and [[SkyTeam]] coordinate their passenger service programs (such as [[Airport lounge|lounges]] and [[frequent-flyer program]]s), offer special [[Interlining|interline]] tickets, and often engage in extensive [[Codeshare agreement|codesharing]] (sometimes systemwide). These are increasingly integrated business combinations\u2014sometimes including cross-equity arrangements\u2014in which products, service standards, schedules, and airport facilities are standardized and combined for higher efficiency. One of the first airlines to start an alliance with another airline was [[KLM]], who partnered with [[Northwest Airlines]]. Both airlines later entered the SkyTeam alliance after the [[Air France-KLM|fusion of KLM and Air France]] in 2004.\n\nOften the companies combine [[Information technology|IT]] operations, or purchase fuel and aircraft as a bloc to achieve higher bargaining power. However, the alliances have been most successful at purchasing invisible supplies and services, such as fuel. Airlines usually prefer to purchase items visible to their passengers to differentiate themselves from local competitors. If an airline's main domestic competitor flies Boeing airliners, then the airline may prefer to use Airbus aircraft regardless of what the rest of the alliance chooses.\n\n===Fuel hedging===\n{{Main article|Fuel Hedging}}Fuel hedging is a [[contractual]] tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this practice.<ref name = economist>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/01/fuel-hedging-and-airlines|title=Gambles that haven't paid off|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date= | language =en}}</ref>\n\nSouthwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to its fuel hedging policy.

Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a ''Speedbird'' call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], while [[SkyEurope]] used ''Relax''.\n\n==Airline personnel==\n[[File:Air Bishkek A320-200 EX-32002 DME Dec 2012.png|thumb|[[Air Bishkek]] [[Airbus A320]] landing at [[Domodedovo Airport]] (2012)]]\nThe various types of airline personnel include:\nFlight operations personnel including flight safety personnel.\n* [[Flight crew]], responsible for the operation of the aircraft.

Larger airlines often appoint vice presidents to oversee each of the airline's hubs as well. Airlines employ [[lawyers]] to deal with regulatory procedures and other administrative tasks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hklaw.com/practices/aviation-regulation/|title=Aviation Regulation|website=www.hklaw.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Industry trends==\n[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Map of scheduled airline traffic in 2009]]\n\nThe pattern of ownership has been privatized in the recent years, that is, the ownership has gradually changed from governments to private and individual sectors or organizations. This occurs as regulators permit greater freedom and non-government ownership, in steps that are usually decades apart. This pattern is not seen for all airlines in all regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=List of Government-owned and Privatized Airlines (unofficial preliminary compilation) |publisher = [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] |url = https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/PrivatizedAirlines.pdf|date = 4 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nGrowth rates are not consistent in all regions, but countries with a de-regulated airline industry have more competition and greater pricing freedom. This results in lower fares and sometimes dramatic spurts in traffic growth. The U.S., Australia, Canada, [[Japan]], [[Brazil]], [[India]] and other markets exhibit this trend. The industry has been observed to be cyclical in its financial performance. Four or five years of poor earnings precede five or six years of improvement. But profitability even in the good years is generally low, in the range of 2\u20133% net profit after interest and tax. In times of profit, airlines lease new generations of airplanes and upgrade services in response to higher demand. Since 1980, the industry has not earned back the cost of capital during the best of times. Conversely, in bad times losses can be dramatically worse. [[Warren Buffett]] in 1999 said \"the money that had been made since the dawn of aviation by all of this country's airline companies was zero. Absolutely zero.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancapitalist.com/buffetts-spot-on-advice/ |title=Buffett\u2019s spot-on advice |publisher=Money Sense |date= |accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\nAs in many mature industries, consolidation is a trend. Airline groupings may consist of limited bilateral partnerships, long-term, multi-faceted alliances between carriers, equity arrangements, [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]], or [[takeover]]s. Since governments often restrict ownership and merger between companies in different countries, most consolidation takes place within a country. In the U.S., over 200 airlines have merged, been taken over, or gone out of business since deregulation in 1978. Many international airline managers are lobbying their governments to permit greater consolidation to achieve higher economy and efficiency.\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Air charter]]\n* [[Air ferry]]\n* [[Airline alliance]]\n* [[Airline complaints]]\n* [[:Category:Airline social networking services|Airline social networking services]]\n* [[Airline timetable]]\n* [[Airliners.net]]\n* [[Airlines of Africa]]\n* ''[[Airlines of North America]]'' (book)\n* [[Airport security]]\n* [[Aviation safety]]\n* [[Freedoms of the air#Beyond rights|Beyond rights]]\n* [[Cargo airline]]\n* [[Domestic flight]]\n* [[Environmental impact of aviation]]\n* [[Federal Aviation Administration]]\n* [[Flight length]]\n* [[Flight planning]]\n* [[FlightAware]]\n* [[Government contract flight]]\n* [[Hypermobility (travel)|Hyper-mobile travel]]\n* [[Inflight magazine]]\n* [[International Air Transport Association]]\n* [[International flight]]\n* [[Legacy carrier]]\n* [[Low-cost carrier]]\n* [[Red-eye flight]]\n* [[Regional airline]]\n* [[Transportation Security Administration]]\n* [[World's busiest passenger air routes]]\n}}\n\n===Airline related lists===\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Airline codes]]\n* [[Airline liveries and logos]]\n* [[List of airlines]]\n* [[List of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft]]\n* [[List of airline holding companies]]\n* [[List of airline mergers and acquisitions]]\n* [[List of defunct airlines]]\n* [[List of helicopter airlines]]\n* [[List of hub airports]]\n* [[List of low-cost airlines]]\n* [[Flag carrier|List of national airlines]]\n* [[List of regional airlines]]\n* [[Airline bankruptcies in the United States]]\n* [[World's largest airlines]]\n}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n# \"A history of the world's airlines\", [[R.

It was Australia's largest [[minor party]] from its formation in 1977 through to 2004 and frequently held the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] during that time. It was formally deregistered in 2016 for not having sufficient members.<ref name=\"aec deregister\"/><ref name=couldnot1/>\n\nThe party was formed as a merger of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]], both of which were descended from [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] splinter groups. The party's inaugural leader was [[Don Chipp]], a former Liberal cabinet minister, who famously promised to \"keep the bastards honest\". At the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]]. Its share of the vote collapsed at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[Australian federal election, 2007|in 2007]]; the party has not mounted a serious nationwide campaign since then, and its last senators left office in 2008. The current non-parliamentary party is factionally divided into small grouplets, some associated with one-time Democrat parliamentarians. From time to time, Democrats were also elected to the parliaments of four states and the [[Australian Capital Territory]].\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as [[Centrism|centrists]], occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.<ref name=\"SmithVromen2012\">{{cite book|author1=Rodney Smith|author2=Ariadne Vromen|author3=Ian Cook|title=Contemporary Politics in Australia: Theories, Practices and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szc-c7hVoOAC&pg=PA160|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=2 February 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13753-9|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe party was founded on principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and [[direct democracy]] through postal ballots of all members, so that \"there should be no [[hierarchical]] structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members.\"<ref name=thirdman>Chipp D and Larkin J ''The Third Man'' Rigby, Melbourne (1978) {{ISBN|0-7270-0827-7}}</ref>{{rp|p187}} From the outset, members' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences\u2014and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam#Inquiry, referendum and election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004]] and [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[South Australian state election, 2010#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u201379===\n[[File:DonChipp-1977.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Don Chipp]], Democrats federal leader 1977\u20131986]]\nOn the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a Centre-Line Party, which Chipp was invited to lead<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p185}}\u2014but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. The '''Centre-Line Party''' was the provisional title of the Australian Democrats party.<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p 185}}  The occasion was a meeting at the [[Perth Town Hall]] to which Don Chipp had been invited in the hope that he would accept the position of leader of the new party, which would be an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New LM|New Liberal Movement]]. On that occasion, Chipp declined to commit himself but did so at a corresponding public meeting in Melbourne on 9 May 1977. Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee.<ref name=thirdman/>{{rp|p186}} The new party was eventually renamed the Australian Democrats by a ballot of its membership. \"Fifty-six suggestions produced by members were listed on the ballot paper, including Uniting Australia Party, Australian Centre Line Party, Dinkum Democrats, Practical Idealists of Australia and People for Sanity Party!!

Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal elections]] after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since [[Australian federal election, 1969|1969]] and the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]], in [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974]] and [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975]]. The party's broad aim was to achieve a [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.\n\nThe grassroot support attracted by Chipp's leadership was measurable at the party's first electoral test at the [[Australian federal election, 1977|1977 federal election]] on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required [[Droop quota|quota]] was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and [[Colin Mason]] (NSW).\n\n===1980\u201382===\nThe Australian Democrats' first national conference, on 16\u201317 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir [[Mark Oliphant]], who said: <blockquote>I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party.<ref>1980 Conference Proceedings, ''Beyond our Expectations''</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAt a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election campaign]], Chipp described his party's aim as to \"keep the bastards honest\"\u2014the \"bastards\" being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp25.pdf Cathy Madden, Research Paper, \"Australian Democrats: the passing of an era\", p. 2 and note 6, 27 March 2009]; Retrieved 1 September 2013</ref>\n\nAt the October 1980 election, the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing Janine Haines (SA) and two new senators [[Michael Macklin]] (Qld) and [[John Siddons]] (Vic), bringing the party's strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .\n\nA by-election in the South Australian state seat of [[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]] (now [[Electoral district of Waite|Waite]]) saw [[Heather Southcott]] [[Mitcham state by-election, 1982|retain the seat]] for the Democrats in 1982. Since 1955 it had been held by conservative lawyer [[Robin Millhouse]] whose [[New LM|New Liberal Movement]] merged into the Democrats in 1977, and who was resigning to take up a senior judicial appointment. Southcott was defeated later that year at the [[South Australian state election, 1982|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.\n\n===1986\u201390===\n[[File:HainesChipp.jpg|thumb|[[Janine Haines]] and [[Don Chipp]], the first two leaders of the Australian Democrats]]\nDon Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as party leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator for Victoria by [[Janet Powell]].\n\nAt the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 election]] following a [[double dissolution]], the reduced [[Australian Senate#Voting system|quota]] of 7.7% necessary to win a seat assisted the election of three new senators. 6-year terms were won by [[Paul McLean (politician)|Paul McLean]] (NSW) and incumbents Janine Haines (South Australia) and Janet Powell (Victoria).

When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative [[News leak|media 'leaks']] concerning her openly established relationship with [[Sid Spindler]]<ref>Paas, Hans.

With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]]. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip [[Paul McLean (Australian politician)|Paul McLean]] who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by [[Karin Sowada]]. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.\n\n==Electoral fortunes==\n[[Image:Natasha_Stott_Despoja_Portrait_2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Senator [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] 1995\u20132008]]\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (Parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.  The party's parliamentary influence was weakened in 1996 after the [[Howard Government]] was elected, and a Labor senator, [[Mal Colston]], resigned from the Labor Party. Since the Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators, the Coalition government was able on occasion to pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and [[Brian Harradine]]. Following [[Australian federal election, 1998|the 1998 election]] the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at [[Australian federal election, 2004|the 2004 election]].\n\nThe party's integrity as a neutral [[Third party (politics)|third party]] suffered a serious blow from the resignation and defection of leader Cheryl Kernot in October 1997,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/97-10-15kernot-resigns.shtml |title=Cheryl Kernot's Resignation Speech |publisher=AustralianPolitics.com |date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526164818/https://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/97-10-15kernot-resigns.shtml |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> with revelations of her sexual relationship with [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]] and her aspirations to a ministerial position in a Labor government.<ref>{{cite news\n   | author     = Seccombe, Mike\n   | author2    = Fray, Peter\n   | title      = Cheryl and Gareth \u2013 the consuming passion\n   | work       = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n   | date       = 2002-07-04\n   | url        = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/03/1025667007922.html\n   | accessdate = 2010-07-31}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lyn Allison Portrait 2010.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Senator [[Lyn Allison]] 1996\u20132008]]\n\nUnder Lees' leadership, in the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], the Democrats' candidate [[John Schumann]] came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system.

The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly [[neo-Keynesian economics]] and a progressive environmental platform.\n\nThe original agenda included [[economic interventionism|interventionist economic]] policies, commitment to [[environmentalism|environmental]] causes, support for [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconciliation]] with Australia's [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous population]] through such mechanisms as formal treaties, [[pacifism|pacifist]] approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for [[human rights]] and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised [[tertiary education|tertiary-educated]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammeled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.\n\nThe party has a platform of [[participatory democracy]], with policies supporting [[proportional representation]] and [[citizen initiated referendum|citizen-initiated referenda]]. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.\n\nHowever, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community's growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party's journals, obtainable in major public libraries.\n\nIn a 2009 \"rebuild\" process, the party announced creation of a new policy process, attempts to improve internal communication, and envisaged development of a new party constitution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Clinton |last=Barnes |url=http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal200908.pdf |title=Activities of our rebuilding |publisher=Democrats National Journal |date=August 2009 |page=3 |accessdate=11 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126050231/http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal200908.pdf |archive-date=26 January 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], the party, though factionally divided into two separate organisations,<ref name=starr>[http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal201307.pdf Statement of Andrew Starr] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908004431/http://www.australian-democrats.org.au/journal/Journal201307.pdf |date=8 September 2013 }} ''Australian Democrats National Journal'', p. 2, July 2013.

Therefore, they never managed to win a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments.<ref>Ainsley Symons (2012), \"The Democrats and Local Government. Were they ever a threat to the ALP?\" in ''Recorder (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch)'' No. 274, Page 7.</ref>\n\nFollowing the internal conflict over [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (1998\u20132001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the [[Australian Greens]] who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial [[third party (politics)|third party]]. The trend was noted that year by political scientists [[Dean Jaensch]] et al.<ref>\"the Australian Democrats appear to be in decline, having performed very poorly at the 2004 federal election and look to be replaced by the Greens as the major 'minor' party\". --Jaensch D et al.

Major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=67}} The city centre is laid out on two perpendicular axes: a water axis stretching along [[Lake Burley Griffin]], and a ceremonial land axis stretching from Parliament House on [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] north-eastward along [[Anzac Parade, Canberra|Anzac Parade]] to the [[Australian War Memorial]] at the foot of [[Mount Ainslie]].{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}\n\nThe area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] is formed by three of Burley Griffin's axes, stretching from Capital Hill along [[Commonwealth Avenue, Canberra|Commonwealth Avenue]] to the Civic Centre around City Hill, along Constitution Avenue to the Defence precinct on Russell Hill, and along Kings Avenue back to Capital Hill.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}}\n\nThe larger scheme of Canberra's layout is based on the three peaks surrounding the city, Mount Ainslie, [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]], and [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Red Hill]]. The main symmetrical axis of the city is along [[Anzac Parade, Canberra|Anzac Parade]] and roughly<ref>Google Earth</ref> on the line{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64-67}} between Mount Ainslie and [[Bimberi Peak]]. Bimberi Peak being the highest mountain in the ACT approximately {{convert|52|km|0|abbr=on}} south west of Canberra . The precise alignment of Anzac parade is between Mount Ainslie and [[Capital Hill, Australian Capital Territory|Capital Hill]] (formally Kurrajong Hill).\n\nThe Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value. This part of their plan never came to fruition. In fact, WWI interrupted the construction and some conflicts after the war made it a difficult process for the Griffins. Nevertheless, Canberra stands halfway between the ski slopes and the beach. It enjoys a natural cooling from geophysical factors.\n\nThe urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts (with an eighth currently under construction), each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:\n* [[North Canberra]], mostly settled in the 1920s and '30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 14 suburbs\n* [[South Canberra]], settled from the 1920s to '60s, 13 suburbs\n* [[Woden Valley]], first settled in 1963, 12 suburbs\n* [[Belconnen]], first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs\n* [[Weston Creek]], settled in 1969, 8 suburbs\n* [[Tuggeranong]], settled in 1974, 19 suburbs\n* [[Gungahlin]], settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs although only 15 are developed or under development\n* [[Molonglo Valley]], first suburbs currently under construction\n\nThe North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} In 1967 the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the \"Y Plan\" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154\u2013155}} with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nDevelopment in Canberra has been closely regulated by government, both through the town planning process, but also through the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. All land in the ACT is held on 99 year leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.\n\nMost suburbs have their own local shops, and are located close to a larger shopping centre serving a group of suburbs. Community facilities and schools are often also located near local shops or group shopping centres. Many of Canberra's [[List of Canberra suburbs|suburbs]] are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] words for their title.\n\n[[Street name]]s typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of [[Duffy, Australian Capital Territory|Duffy]] are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of [[Dunlop, Australian Capital Territory|Dunlop]] are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of [[Page, Australian Capital Territory|Page]] are named after biologists and naturalists. Most [[diplomatic mission]]s are located in the suburbs of [[Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory|Yarralumla]], [[Deakin, Australian Capital Territory|Deakin]] and [[O'Malley, Australian Capital Territory|O'Malley]]. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of [[Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory|Fyshwick]], [[Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory|Mitchell]] and [[Hume, Australian Capital Territory|Hume]].\n\n==Education==\n{{main article|Education in the Australian Capital Territory}}\n[[File:John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The John Curtin School of Medical Research, [[Australian National University]]]]\nAlmost all educational institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are located within [[Canberra]].

''Standard drinks'' were referred to in the first UK guidelines (1984) that published \"safe limits\" for drinking, but these were replaced by references to \"alcohol units\" in the 1987 guidelines and the latter term has been used in all subsequent UK guidance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alcohol guidelines, Eleventh Report of Session 2010\u201312|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201012/cmselect/cmsctech/1536/1536.pdf|website=UK Parliament|publisher=House of Commons, Science and Technology Committee|accessdate=13 February 2015|page=7|format=PDF|date=7 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne '''unit of alcohol''' (UK) is defined as 10 [[litre|millilitres]] (8 [[grams]]) of pure [[ethanol|alcohol]].<ref name=\"Drinkaware-Unit\">{{cite web|title=Drinkaware - What is an alcohol unit?|url=http://www.drinkaware.co.uk/check-the-facts/what-is-alcohol/what-is-an-alcohol-unit/}}</ref><ref name=\"NHS-HowLong\">{{cite web|title=How long does alcohol stay in your blood?|url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/853.aspx?CategoryID=87|website=NHS Choices|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>  Typical drinks (i.e., typical quantities or servings of common alcoholic beverages) may contain 1\u20133 units of alcohol.<ref name=\"NHS-HowLong\" />\n\nContainers of alcoholic beverages sold directly to UK consumers are normally labelled to indicate the number of units of alcohol in a typical serving of the beverage (optional) and in the full container (can or bottle), as well as information about responsible drinking.<ref name=\"Labelling\">{{cite web|title=Alcohol Labelling|url=http://www.portmangroup.org.uk/codes/alcohol-marketing/alcohol-labelling|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs an approximate guideline, a typical healthy adult can metabolise (break down) about one unit of alcohol per hour,<ref name=\"NHS-HowLong\" /> although this may vary depending on sex, age, weight, health, and many other factors.\n\n== Formula ==\nThe number of UK units of alcohol in a drink can be determined by multiplying <var>the volume of the drink (in millilitres)</var> by its <var>percentage [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]]</var>, and dividing by 1000.\n\nFor example, one [[Imperial units|imperial]] [[pint]] (568 ml) of beer at 4% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV) contains: \n\n<br>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  568\\mbox{ ml} \\times 4\\% \\times \\frac{1\\mbox{ unit}}{10\\mbox{ ml}} && = && 568\\mbox{ ml} \\times \\frac{4}{100} \\times \\frac{1\\mbox{ unit}}{10\\mbox{ ml}} && = && 568\\mbox{ ml} \\times \\frac{4\\mbox{ units}}{1000\\mbox{ ml}} &= 2.3\\mbox{ units}\n\\end{align}</math> \n<br>\n\nThe formula uses {{math|<var>ml \u00f7 1000</var>}}. This results in exactly one unit per percentage point per litre, of any alcoholic beverage.\n\nThe formula can be simplified for everyday use by expressing the serving size in [[centilitre]]s and the alcohol content literally as a [[percentage]]:\n\n<br>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  75\\mbox{ cl} \\times 12\\% \\times \\frac{1\\mbox{ unit}}{1\\mbox{ cl}} && = && 75\\mbox{ cl} \\times \\frac{12}{100} \\times \\frac{1\\mbox{ unit}}{1\\mbox{ cl}} && = && 75 \\times \\frac{12}{100}\\mbox{ units} &= 9\\mbox{ units}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n<br>\n\nThus, a 750&nbsp;ml bottle of wine at 12% ABV contains 75&nbsp;cl \u00d7 12% = 9 units. Alternatively, the serving size in litres multiplied by the alcohol content as a number, the above example giving 0.75 \u00d7 12 = 9 units:\n\n<br>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  0.75\\mbox{ l} \\times 12\\% \\times \\frac{100\\mbox{ units}}{1\\mbox{ l}} && = && 0.75\\mbox{ l} \\times \\frac{12}{100} \\times \\frac{100\\mbox{ units}}{1\\mbox{ l}} && = && 0.75 \\times 12\\mbox{ units} &= 9\\mbox{ units}\n\\end{align}</math>\n<br>\n\nBoth pieces of input data are usually mentioned in this form on the bottle, so is easy to retrieve.\n\n==Labelling==\n[[File:Example_UK_Wine_Label.jpg|thumb|right|Example of Wine Bottle label in accordance with UK voluntary health labelling scheme]]\n\nUK alcohol companies pledged in March 2011 to implement an innovative health labelling scheme to provide more information about responsible drinking on alcohol labels and containers.

A typical \"medium\" glass of wine with 175 ml at 12% ABV has 2.1 units. And spirits, although typically 35\u201340% ABV, have single measures of 25&nbsp;ml or 35&nbsp;ml (so 1 or 1.4 units) depending on location.<ref name=\"bmj.com\"/><ref name=\"alcoholandyouni.com\"/><ref name=\"apas.org.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe misleading nature of \"one unit per half-pint of beer, or small glass of wine, or single measure of spirits\" can lead to people underestimating their alcohol intake.<ref name=\"bmj.com\"/><ref name=\"alcoholandyouni.com\"/><ref name=\"apas.org.uk\"/><ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\n=== Beers ===\n* Half an [[imperial pint]] (284 ml) of [[beer]] with 3.5% ABV contains almost exactly one unit; however, most beers are stronger. In pubs in the United Kingdom, beers generally range from 3.5\u20135.5% ABV, and continental lagers start at around 4% ABV. An imperial pint of such lager (e.g., 568 ml at 5.2%) contains almost 3 units of alcohol<ref>The volume of the drink in litres multiplied by its percentage strength in ABV give the number of units. In this case, {{nowrap|0.568 \u00d7 5.2 gives 2.95}}; i.e., almost 3 units.</ref> rather than the oft-quoted 2 units.\n* Stronger beer (6\u201312%) may contain 2 units or more per half pint (imperial).\n* A half litre (500&nbsp;ml) of standard [[lager]] or [[ale]] (5%) contains 2.5 units.\n* One litre (1000&nbsp;ml) of typical [[Oktoberfest]] beer (5.5\u20136%) contains 5.5\u20136 units of alcohol.\n\n=== Wines ===\n* A medium glass (175&nbsp;ml) of 12% ABV [[wine]] contains around two units of alcohol. However, British pubs and restaurants often supply larger quantities (large glass \u2248 250&nbsp;ml), which contain 3 units. Red wines often have a higher alcohol content (on average 12.5%, sometimes up to 16%).\n* Wine sold by the glass is often served in nearly full glasses. Wine served at home, or when bought by the bottle in, say, a restaurant, is usually served in glasses less than half filled; the capacity of a wine glass is not the only criterion for judging quantity.\n* A 750&nbsp;ml bottle of 12% ABV wine contains 9 units; 16% ABV wine contains 12 units; a [[fortified wine]] such as [[Port wine|port]] at 20% ABV contains 15 units.\n\n=== Fortified wines ===\n* A small glass (50&nbsp;ml) of [[sherry]], [[fortified wine]], or cream liqueur (\u224820% ABV) contains about one unit.\n\n=== Spirits ===\nMost [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] sold in the [[United Kingdom]] have 40% ABV or slightly less. In England, a single pub measure (25&nbsp;ml) of a spirit contains one unit. However, a larger 35&nbsp;ml measure is increasingly used (and in particular is standard in [[Northern Ireland]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcoholandyouni.com/alcohol-and-you-home/check-the-facts/what-is-a-unit-of-alcohol/|title=What is a unit of alcohol {{!}} Alcohol and You Northern Ireland|website=www.alcoholandyouni.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref>), which contains 1.4 units of alcohol at 40% ABV. Sellers of spirits by the glass must state the capacity of their standard measure in ml.\n\n=== Alcopops ===\n* According to Alcohol and You Northern Ireland resource website, \"Most [[alcopops]] contain 1.1\u20131.5 units per bottle. For example, a normal 275&nbsp;ml bottle of [[WKD Original Vodka|WKD]] contains 1.1 units, whereas [[Bacardi Breezer]] and [[Smirnoff Ice]] both contain 1.5 units of alcohol.\"<ref name=\"% volume of wkd\">{{cite web | url=http://www.qfak.com/livelihood/food_drink/?id=b158893#.UXvAYaKG2So | title=Question:- \"How much alcohol is there in WKD vodka blue?\" | accessdate=27 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Time to metabolise==\nOn average, it takes about one hour for the body to [[Metabolism|metabolise]] (break down) one unit of alcohol.

Read WP:MOSTV#Lead_paragraphs--> an American [[legal drama|legal]] [[comedy-drama]] [[television series]], originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from September 8, 1997 to May 20, 2002. Created by [[David E. Kelley]], the series stars [[Calista Flockhart]] in the [[Ally McBeal (character)|title role]] as a lawyer working in the fictional [[Boston]] [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]] Cage and Fish, with other lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous, and dramatic. The series received critical acclaim in its early seasons, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series&nbsp;\u2013 Musical or Comedy]] in 1997 and 1998, and also winning the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] in 1999.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series, set in the fictional [[Boston]] [[List of fictional law firms|law firm]] Cage and Fish, begins with main character [[Ally McBeal (character)|Allison Marie \"Ally\" McBeal]] joining the firm (co-owned by her law school classmate Richard Fish, played by [[Greg Germann]]) after leaving her previous job due to sexual harassment. On her first day, Ally is horrified to find that she will be working alongside her ex-boyfriend Billy Thomas ([[Gil Bellows]])&mdash;who she has never gotten over. To make things worse, Billy is now married to fellow lawyer Georgia ([[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]), who later joins Cage and Fish. The triangle among the three forms the basis for the main plot for the show's first three seasons.\n\nAlthough ostensibly a legal drama, the main focus of the series was the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as [[plot device]]s to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend. Legal arguments were also frequently used to explore multiple sides of various social issues.\n\nCage & Fish (which becomes Cage/Fish & McBeal or Cage, Fish, & Associates towards the end of the series), the fictional law firm where most of the characters work, is depicted as a highly sexualized environment symbolized by its unisex restroom. Lawyers and secretaries in the firm routinely date, flirt with, or have a romantic history with each other and frequently run into former or potential romantic interests in the courtroom or on the street outside.\n\nThe series had many offbeat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, such as Ally's tendency to immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, or Richard Fish's [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] fetish and humorous mottos (\"Fishisms\" & \"Bygones\"), or John's gymnastic dismounts out of the office's unisex bathroom stalls, or the dancing twins (played by Eric & Steve Cohen) at the bar, that ran through the series. The show used vivid, dramatic [[fantasy]] sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; particularly notable is the [[dancing baby]].\n\nThe series also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer [[Vonda Shepard]] regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters). The series also took place in the same [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] as David E. Kelley's legal drama ''[[The Practice]]'' (which aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), as the two shows crossed over with one another on occasion, a very rare occurrence for two shows that aired on different networks.\n\nUltimately, in the last installment of the fifth and final season, \"Bygones,\" Ally decided to resign from Cage & Fish, leave Boston, and return to New York City.\n\n==Cancellation==\nFox cancelled Ally McBeal after five seasons. In addition to being the lowest-rated season of Ally McBeal and the grounds for the show's cancellation, it was also the only season of the show that failed to win any Emmy or Golden Globe awards.[4].\n\n==Main cast==\n[[File:Ally mcbeal season 4 cast.jpg|thumb|Cast of season 4 (''from left''): (''top'') Liu, Downey, Krakowski, Germann, MacNicol; ''(middle)'' Carson, de Rossi, Flockhart; ''(bottom)'' Shepard, LeGros]]\n[[File:14 Beacon Street (Fish, Cage, & McBeal) (7183315650).jpg|thumb|14 Beacon Street in Boston, the exterior of which was used as the location for the law firm \"Cage & Fish\" (later \"Cage, Fish, & McBeal\"), which was located on the 7th floor of this building.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Character\n! colspan=\"5\" | Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:3%;\"|[[Ally McBeal (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:3%;\"|[[Ally McBeal (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:3%;\"|[[Ally McBeal (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:3%;\"|[[Ally McBeal (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:3%;\"|[[Ally McBeal (season 5)|5]]\n|-\n| [[Calista Flockhart]]\n| [[Ally McBeal (character)|Ally McBeal]]\n| colspan=\"5\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Greg Germann]]\n| Richard Fish\n| colspan=\"5\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Jane Krakowski]]\n| Elaine Vassal\n| colspan=\"5\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Peter MacNicol]]\n| [[John Cage (character)|John Cage]]\n| colspan=\"4\" {{cMain}}\n| {{cRecurring}}\n|-\n| [[Lisa Nicole Carson]]\n| Ren\u00e9e Raddick\n| colspan=\"4\" {{cMain}}\n| {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| [[Gil Bellows]]\n| Billy Allen Thomas\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]\n| Georgia Thomas\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cMain}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| [[Vonda Shepard]]\n| Herself\n| {{cRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Portia de Rossi]]\n| [[Nelle Porter]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Lucy Liu]]\n| [[Ling Woo]]\n| {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cMain}}\n| {{cRecurring}}\n|-\n| [[James LeGros]]\n| [[Mark Albert]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cRecurring}}\n| {{cMain}}\n| {{N/A|}}\n|-\n| [[Robert Downey Jr.]]\n| Larry Paul\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cMain}}\n| {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| [[Regina Hall]]\n| Coretta Lipp\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cRecurring}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Julianne Nicholson]]\n| Jenny Shaw\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[James Marsden]]\n| Glenn Foy\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Josh Hopkins]]\n| Raymond Millbury\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[John Michael Higgins]]\n| Steven Milter\n| colspan=\"3\" {{N/A|}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|-\n| [[Christina Ricci]]\n| Liza Bump\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cRecurring}}\n|-\n| [[Hayden Panettiere]]\n| Maddie Harrington\n| colspan=\"4\" {{N/A|}}\n| {{cMain}}\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ally McBeal episodes}}\n{{:List of Ally McBeal episodes}}\n\nIn Australia, ''Ally McBeal'' was aired by the Seven Network from 1997 to 2002. In 2010, it was aired repeatedly by Network Ten.\n\n===Crossovers with ''The Practice''===\n{{See also|The Practice#Crossovers}}\nSeymore Walsh, a stern judge often exasperated by the eccentricities of the Cage & Fish lawyers and played by actor Albert Hall, was also a recurring character on ''The Practice''. In addition, Judge Jennifer (Whipper) Cone appears on ''The Practice'' episode \"Line of Duty\" (S02 E15), while Judge Roberta Kittelson, a recurring character on ''The Practice'', has a featured guest role in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode \"Do you Wanna Dance?\"\n\nMost of the primary ''Practice'' cast members guest starred in the ''Ally McBeal'' episode \"The Inmates\" (S01 E20), in a storyline that concluded with the ''Practice'' episode \"Axe Murderer\" (S02 E26), featuring Calista Flockhart and Gil Bellows reprising their ''Ally'' characters. What's unusual about this continuing storyline is that ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice'' aired on different networks.  Bobby Donnell, the main character of ''The Practice'' played by [[Dylan McDermott]], was featured heavily in both this crossover and another ''Ally McBeal'' episode, \"These are the Days\".\n\nRegular ''Practice'' cast members [[Lara Flynn Boyle]] and [[Michael Badalucco]] each had a cameo in ''Ally McBeal'' (Boyle as a woman who trades insults with Ally in the episode \"Making Spirits Bright\" and Badalucco as one of Ally's dates in the episode \"I Know him by Heart\") but it is unclear whether they were playing the same characters they play on ''The Practice''.\n\n==Reception==\n\nUpon premiering in 1997, the show was an instant hit, averaging around 11 million viewers per episode. The show's second season saw an increase in ratings and soon became a top 20 show, averaging around 13 million viewers per episode. The show's ratings began to decline in the third season, but stabilized in the fourth season after [[Robert Downey Jr.]] joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul, and a fresher aesthetic was created by new art director Matthew DeCoste. However, Downey's character was written out after the end of the season due to the actor's troubles with drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2014/03/05/tv-legends-revealed-robert-downey-jr-was-written-out-of-own-tv-wedding/|title=TV Legends Revealed \u2013 Robert Downey Jr. Was Written Out of Own TV Wedding|author=Cronin|first=Brian|date=2014-03-05|website=Comic Book Resources|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180224014412/https://www.cbr.com/tv-legends-revealed-robert-downey-jr-was-written-out-of-own-tv-wedding/|archive-date=February 24, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-02-24|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first two seasons, as well as the fourth, remain the most critically acclaimed and saw the most awards success at the Emmys, SAG Awards and the Golden Globes.

The increased danger that co-optation poses for professional women is due to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, ''McBeal'' operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body.</ref>) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988616,00.html|title=Is Feminism Dead?

Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the June 29, 1998 cover story of ''Time'' magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists ([[Susan B.

[[Vonda Shepard]], a virtually unknown musician at the time, was featured continually on the show. Her song \"Searchin' My Soul\" became the show's theme song. Many of the songs Shepard performed were established hits with lyrics that paralleled the events of the episode, including \"[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]\", \"[[Hooked on a Feeling]]\" and \"[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]\". Besides recording background music for the show, Shepard frequently appeared at the ends of episodes as a musician performing at a local [[piano bar]] frequented by the main characters. On rare occasions, her character would have conventional dialogue. A portion of \"Searchin' My Soul\" was played at the beginning of each episode, but remarkably the song was never played in its entirety.\n\nSeveral of the characters had a musical [[leitmotif]] that played when they appeared. John Cage's was \"[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]\", Ling Woo's was the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] theme from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', and Ally McBeal herself picked \"[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]\", when told by a psychiatrist that she needed a theme.\n\nDue to the popularity of the show and Shepard's music, a soundtrack titled ''[[Songs from Ally McBeal]]'' was released in 1998, as well as a successor soundtrack titled ''Heart and Soul: New Songs From Ally McBeal'' in 1999. Two compilation albums from the show featuring Shepard were also released in 2000 and 2001. A Christmas album was also released under the title ''Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas''.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/The-Man-With-Bag/dp/B00138A8P0 ''Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas'' (2000) Sony Music]</ref> The album received positive reviews, and Shephard's version of [[Kay Starr]]\u2019s Christmas song \"[[(Everybody's Waitin' For) The Man with the Bag]]\", received considerable airplay during the holiday season.<ref>Atkinson, Terry (December 3, 2000) \"''TV Shows Breed Christmas Albums''\" The Post-Tribune (Gary, Indiana) (Entertainment News Service), page D-5.[http://0-search.proquest.com.libsys.arlingtonva.us/newsstand/docview/343646798/13B3F42545B27DF2559/7?accountid=46215]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOther artists featured on the show include [[Michael Jackson]], [[Barry White]], [[Al Green]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Macy Gray]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[Chayanne]], [[Barry Manilow]], [[Anastacia]], [[Elton John]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Mariah Carey]].  [[Josh Groban]] played the role of Malcolm Wyatt in the May 2001 season finale, performing \"You're Still You\". The series creator, David E. Kelley, was impressed with Groban's performance at The Family Celebration event and based on the audience reaction to Groban's singing, Kelley created a character for him in that finale. The background score for the show was composed by [[Danny Lux]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Soundtrack name\n!Tk#\n!

Little is known of Andreas Capellanus's life, but he is presumed to have been a courtier of [[Marie de Champagne]], and probably of French origin.\n\n==His work==\n''De Amore'' was written at the request of [[Marie de Champagne]], daughter of King [[Louis VII of France]] and of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. In it, the author informs a young pupil, Walter, of the pitfalls of love. A dismissive allusion in the text to the \"wealth of Hungary\" has suggested the hypothesis that it was written after 1184, at the time when [[Bela III of Hungary]] had sent to the French court a statement of his income and had proposed marriage to Marie's half-sister [[Margaret of France, Queen of England and Hungary|Marguerite of France]], but before 1186, when his proposal was accepted.\n\n''De Amore'' is made up of three books. The first book covers the etymology and definition of love and is written in the manner of an academic lecture. The second book consists of sample dialogues between members of different social classes; it outlines how the romantic process between the classes should work. Book three is made of stories from actual courts of love presided over by noble women.\n\n[[John Jay Parry]], the editor of one modern edition of ''De Amore'', quotes critic Robert Bossuat as describing ''De Amore'' as \"one of those capital works which reflect the thought of a great epoch, which explains the secret of a civilization\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  It may be viewed as didactic, mocking, or merely descriptive; in any event it preserves the attitudes and practices that were the foundation of a long and significant tradition in Western literature.\n\nThe social system of \"courtly love\", as gradually elaborated by the [[Proven\u00e7al literature|Proven\u00e7al]] [[troubadour]]s from the mid twelfth century, soon spread. One of the circles in which this poetry and its ethic were cultivated was the court of Eleanor of Aquitaine (herself the granddaughter of an early troubadour poet, [[William IX of Aquitaine]]). It has been claimed {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} that ''De Amore'' codifies the social and sexual life of Eleanor's court at Poitiers between 1170 and 1174, though it was evidently written at least ten years later and, apparently, at Troyes. It deals with several specific themes that were the subject of [[poetical debate (Occitan literature)|poetical debate]] among late twelfth century troubadours and [[trobairitz]].\n\nThe meaning of ''De Amore'' has been debated over the centuries. In the years immediately following its release many people took Andreas\u2019 opinions concerning [[Courtly Love]] seriously. In more recent times, however, scholars have come to view the priest's work as satirical. Many scholars now agree that Andreas was commenting on the materialistic, superficial nature of the nobles of the Middle Ages. Andreas seems to have been warning young Walter, his protege, about love in the Middle Ages.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Andreas Capellanus: ''The Art of Courtly Love'', trans. John Jay Parry.

Local affiliates of the ACLU are active in almost all 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The ACLU provides legal assistance in cases when it considers [[civil liberties]] to be at risk. Legal support from the ACLU can take the form of direct legal representation or preparation of ''[[amicus curiae]]'' [[brief (law)|briefs]] expressing legal arguments when another law firm is already providing representation.\n\nIn addition to representing persons and organizations in lawsuits, the ACLU lobbies for policy positions that have been established by its board of directors. Current positions of the ACLU include: opposing the death penalty; supporting [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] and the [[LGBT adoption|right of LGBT people to adopt]]; supporting [[Reproductive rights|birth control and abortion rights]]; eliminating discrimination against women, minorities, and [[LGBT]] people; supporting the rights of prisoners and opposing torture; and opposing government preference for religion over non-religion, or for particular faiths over others.\n\nLegally, the ACLU consists of two separate but closely affiliated [[nonprofit organization]]s: the American Civil Liberties Union, a [[501(c)(4)]] social welfare group, and the ACLU Foundation, a [[501(c)(3)]] [[public charity]]. Both organizations engage in civil rights litigation, advocacy, and education, but only donations to the 501(c)(3) foundation are tax deductible, and only the 501(c)(4) group can engage in unlimited political [[lobbying]].<ref name=\"nonprofit\">{{cite web|title=ACLU and ACLU Foundation: What Is the Difference?|work=American Civil Liberties Union web site|publisher=ACLU|url=https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|accessdate=September 5, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906190151/https://www.aclu.org/acluf.html|archivedate=September 6, 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|title = Maximizing Nonprofit Voices and Mobilizing the Public|last = Krehely|first = Jeff|date = 2005|journal = Responsive Philanthropy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = March 10, 2015|pages = 9\u201310, 15|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304134943/http://ncrp.org/files/rp-articles/RP-Winter-2005-Maximizing_Nonprofit_Voices_and_Mobilizing_the_Public.pdf|archivedate = March 4, 2016|df = mdy-all}}</ref> The two organizations share office space and employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/images/annualreports/asset_upload_file789_38050.pdf|title = Annual report fiscal year 2007|date = |accessdate = March 10, 2015|website = |publisher = American Civil Liberties Union|last = |first = |page = 2}}</ref>\n\nThe ACLU was founded in 1920 by a committee including [[Helen Keller]], [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], [[Crystal Eastman]], [[Walter Nelles]], [[Morris Ernst]], [[Albert DeSilver]], [[Arthur Garfield Hays]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], and [[Rose Schneiderman]].<ref>https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/03/23/why-free-speech-is-not-enough/</ref>  Its focus was on [[freedom of speech]], primarily for anti-war protesters.<ref name=found /> During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, and working with the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) to decrease [[racism]] and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating [[police misconduct]] and supporting [[Native American rights]]. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of [[Communist Party of the United States|Communist Party]] members and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During [[World War II]], the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to [[Japanese American internment|internment camps]]. During the [[Cold War]], the ACLU headquarters was dominated by [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.\n\nBy 1964, membership had risen to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand [[civil liberties]]. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce [[separation of church and state]]. It defended several [[anti-war activist]]s during the [[Vietnam War]]. The ACLU was involved in [[Miranda v. Arizona|the ''Miranda'' case]], which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in [[New York Times Co. v. United States|the ''New York Times'' case]], which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of [[creationism]] in public schools and challenged some provisions of [[Patriot Act|anti-terrorism legislation]] as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the [[United States elections, 2016|2016 election]]; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.<ref name=\"WeigelResistance\"/>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Leadership===\nThe ACLU is led by a president and an executive director, [[Susan N.

In 1919, the Court upheld the [[Schenck v. United States|conviction]] of [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]] leader [[Charles Schenck]] for publishing anti-war literature.<ref>Walker, p. 26.</ref> In ''[[Debs v. United States]],'' the court upheld the conviction of [[Eugene Debs]]. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat [[freedom of speech]] as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.<ref>Walker, p 27.</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Crystal Eastman resigned from the organization due to health issues.<ref>Walker, p. 30</ref> After assuming sole leadership of the CLB, Baldwin insisted that the organization be reorganized. He wanted to change its focus from litigation to direct action and public education.<ref name=W47>Walker, p. 47.</ref>\n\nThe CLB directors concurred, and on January 19, 1920, they formed an organization under a new name, the American Civil Liberties Union.<ref name=W47/> Although a handful of other organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) and [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme.<ref name=W47/> Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchisement]] of African Americans in the South that had taken place since the turn of the century.\n\nDuring the first decades of the ACLU, [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Baldwin]] continued as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks.<ref>Walker, p 66.</ref> Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and living on a very small salary.<ref name=\"Walker\">Walker, p 70.</ref> The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, but it was not particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state.<ref>Walker, p 67.</ref> Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the [[Garland Fund]].<ref name=\"Walker\" />\n\n===Free speech era===\n\nIn the 1920s, government censorship was commonplace. Magazines were routinely confiscated under the anti-obscenity [[Comstock laws]]; permits for labor rallies were often denied; and virtually all anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed.<ref name=\"Walker_a\">Walker, p. 51\u201352.</ref> Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic.<ref name=\"Walker_a\" /> In one typical instance in 1923, author [[Upton Sinclair]] was arrested for trying to read the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] during an [[Industrial Workers of the World]] rally.<ref name=\"Walker_b\">Walker, p 52.</ref>\n\n[[File:Norman Thomas 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Norman Thomas]] was one of the early leaders of the ACLU]]\nACLU leadership was divided on how to challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] and [[Norman Thomas]], believed that direct, militant action was the best path.<ref name=\"Walker_b\" /> Hays was the first of many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU.<ref name=W53>Walker, p 53.</ref> Another group, including [[Walter Nelles]] and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change.<ref name=W53/> Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.<ref name=W53/>\n\nDuring the 1920s, the ACLU's primary focus was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within the labor movement particularly.<ref>Walker, p. 55</ref> Because most of the ACLU's efforts were associated with the labor movement, the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the [[American Legion]], the [[National Civic Federation]], and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.<ref>Walker, p. 57.</ref>\n\nIn addition to labor, the ACLU also led efforts in non-labor arenas, for example, promoting free speech in public schools.<ref>Walker, p, 58.</ref> The ACLU itself was banned from speaking in New York public schools in 1921.<ref>Walker, p. 59.</ref> The ACLU, working with the [[NAACP]], also supported racial discrimination cases.<ref>Walker, p. 60.</ref> The ACLU defended free speech regardless of the opinions being espoused. For example, the reactionary, anti-Catholic, anti-black [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was a frequent target of ACLU efforts, but the ACLU defended the KKK's right to hold meetings in 1923.<ref>Walker, p. 61.</ref> There were some civil rights that the ACLU did not make an effort to defend in the 1920s, including censorship of the arts, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|government search and seizure]] issues, [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]], or [[wiretapping]].<ref>Walker, p 68.</ref>\n\nThe [[Communist Party USA]] was routinely harassed and oppressed by government officials, leading it to be the primary client of the ACLU.<ref name=W63>Walker, p. 63.</ref> The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU.<ref name=W63/> Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives.<ref name=W63/> This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.<ref name=W63/>\n\n===Public schools===\n====Scopes trial====\nWhen 1925 arrived {{en dash}} five years after the ACLU was formed {{en dash}} the organization had virtually no success to show for its efforts.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> That changed in 1925, when the ACLU persuaded [[John T. Scopes]] to defy Tennessee's anti-[[evolution]] law in ''[[Scopes Trial|The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes]]''. [[Clarence Darrow]], a member of the ACLU National Committee, headed Scopes' legal team. The prosecution, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], contended that the Bible should be interpreted literally in teaching [[creationism]] in school. The ACLU lost the case and Scopes was fined $100.

The newspaper was the ''St. Louis Post Dispatch''.</ref> The ACLU continued to fight for the separation of church and state in schoolrooms, decade after decade, including the 1982 case ''[[McLean v.

Dover Area School District]]''.<ref>Berkman, Michael (2010), ''Evolution, Creationism, and the Battle to Control America's Classrooms'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nBaldwin himself was involved in an important free speech victory of the 1920s, after he was arrested for attempting to speak at a rally of striking mill workers in New Jersey. Although the decision was limited to the state of New Jersey, the appeals court's judgement in 1928 declared that constitutional guarantees of free speech must be given \"liberal and comprehensive construction\", and it marked a major turning point in the [[civil rights movement]], signaling the shift of judicial opinion in favor of civil rights.<ref>Walker, pp 78\u201379. The case was in New Jersey, ''State v. Butterworth''. Decision quoted by Walker.</ref>\n\nThe most important ACLU case of the 1920s was ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'', in which [[Benjamin Gitlow]] was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism.<ref>Walker. p 79.</ref> Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the [[incorporation doctrine]]) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.<ref>Walker. p 80.</ref>\n\n====''Pierce v. Society of Sisters''====\n{{main|Pierce v. Society of Sisters}}\n{{see also|Political activity of the Knights of Columbus}}\n\nAfter the First World War, many native-born Americans had a revival of concerns about assimilation of immigrants and worries about \"foreign\" values; they wanted public schools to teach children to be American. Numerous states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture, and in 1922, the voters of Oregon passed the [[Oregon Compulsory Education Act]]. The law was primarily aimed at eliminating [[parochial school]]s, including Catholic schools.<ref name=\"pierce\">{{ussc|268|510|1925}}</ref><ref name=\"oregon\">{{cite web| url = https://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1924/1924_583| title = Pierce v.

The Knights of Columbus pledged an immediate $10,000 to fight the law and any additional funds necessary to defeat it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=283}}\n\nThe case became known as ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'', a seminal [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that significantly expanded coverage of the [[Due Process Clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. In a unanimous decision, the court held that the act was unconstitutional and that parents, not the state, had the authority to educate children as they thought best.{{sfn|Alley|1999|pp=41\u201344}} It upheld the religious freedom of parents to educate their children in religious schools.\n\n===First victories===\nLeaders of the ACLU were divided on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. [[Felix Frankfurter]] felt that legislation was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (and {{en dash}} in his opinion {{en dash}} should not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But [[Walter Herries Pollock|Walter Pollack]], [[Morris Ernst]], and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties.<ref>Walker, p 81</ref> A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, and there was a growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.<ref>Walker, p. 82. The cases included Gitlow (1925), Whitney (1927), Powell (1932) and Patterson (1935).</ref>\n\n===Free speech===\n[[File:H l mencken.jpg|thumb|The ACLU defended [[H. L. Mencken]] when he was arrested for distributing banned literature]]\n\nCensorship was commonplace in the early 20th century. State laws and city ordinances routinely outlawed speech deemed to be obscene or offensive, and prohibited meetings or literature that promoted unions or labor organization.<ref name=W82>Walker, p 82.</ref> Starting in 1926, the ACLU began to expand its free speech activities to encompass censorship of art and literature.<ref name=W82/> In that year, [[H. L. Mencken]] deliberately broke Boston law by distributing copies of his banned ''[[American Mercury]]'' magazine; the ACLU defended him and won an acquittal.<ref name=W82/> The ACLU went on to win additional victories, including the landmark case ''[[United States v. One Book Called Ulysses]]'' in 1933, which reversed a ban by the Customs Department against the book ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].<ref name=W86>Walker, p. 86.</ref> The ACLU only achieved mixed results in the early years, and it was not until 1966 that the Supreme Court finally clarified the obscenity laws in the ''[[Roth v. United States]]'' and ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts]]'' cases.\n\nThe [[Comstock laws]] banned distribution of sex education information, based on the premise that it was obscene and led to promiscuous behavior<ref name=W85>Walker, p. 85.</ref> [[Mary Ware Dennett]] was fined $300 in 1928, for distributing a pamphlet containing sex education material. The ACLU, led by Morris Ernst, appealed her conviction and won a reversal, in which judge [[Learned Hand]] ruled that the pamphlet's main purpose was to \"promote understanding\".<ref name=W85/>\n\nThe success prompted the ACLU to broaden their freedom of speech efforts beyond labor and political speech, to encompass movies, press, radio and literature.<ref name=W85/> The ACLU formed the National Committee on Freedom from Censorship in 1931 to coordinate this effort.<ref name=W85/> By the early 1930s, [[censorship in the United States]] was diminishing.<ref name=W86/>\n\nTwo major victories in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed the right of a communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result was the first time the Supreme Court used the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] to subject states to the requirements of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].<ref>Walker, p. 90</ref> In ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]'', also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise [[prior restraint]] and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.<ref>Walker, p. 91.</ref>\n\n==1930s==\nThe late 1930s saw the emergence of a new era of tolerance in the United States.<ref name=W112>Walker, p. 112</ref> National leaders hailed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy.<ref name=W112/> The 1939 Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization]]'' affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause.<ref name=W112/> Even conservative elements, such as the [[American Bar Association]] began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long considered to be the domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.<ref name=W112/>\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1929, after the Scopes and Dennett victories, Baldwin perceived that there was vast, untapped support for civil liberties in the United States.<ref name=W86/> Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, [[African American]] rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties.<ref name=W86/> The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the international efforts.<ref name=W87>Walker, p. 87.</ref>\n\nThe ACLU played a major role in passing the 1932 [[Norris\u2013La Guardia Act]], a federal law which prohibited employers from preventing employees from joining unions, and stopped the practice of outlawing strikes, unions, and labor organizing activities with the use of injunctions.<ref name=W87/> The ACLU also played a key role in initiating a nationwide effort to reduce misconduct (such as extracting false confessions) within police departments, by publishing the report ''Lawlessness in Law Enforcement'' in 1931, under the auspices of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Wickersham Commission]].<ref name=W87/> In 1934, the ACLU lobbied for the passage of the [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which restored some autonomy to Native American tribes, and established penalties for kidnapping Native American children.<ref name=W87/>\n\nAlthough the ACLU deferred to the NAACP for litigation promoting civil liberties for African Americans, the ACLU did engage in educational efforts, and published ''Black Justice'' in 1931, a report which documented institutional racism throughout the South, including lack of voting rights, segregation, and discrimination in the justice system.<ref name=W88>Walker, p. 88.</ref> Funded by the [[Garland Fund]], the ACLU also participated in producing the influential [[Margold Report]], which outlined a strategy to fight for civil rights for blacks.<ref name=W89>Walker, p. 89.</ref><ref>The Margold Report was named after its principal author, [[Nathan Ross Margold]], a white attorney.</ref> The ACLU's plan was to demonstrate that the \"[[separate but equal]]\" policies governing the Southern discrimination were illegal because blacks were never, in fact, treated equally.<ref name=W89/>\n\n===Depression era and the New Deal===\nIn 1932{{spaced ndash}}twelve years after the ACLU was founded{{spaced ndash}}it had achieved significant success; the Supreme Court had embraced the free speech principles espoused by the ACLU, and the general public was becoming more supportive of civil rights in general.<ref>Walker, p. 92.</ref> But the [[Great Depression]] brought new assaults on civil liberties; the year 1930 saw a large increase in the number of free speech prosecutions, a doubling of the number of lynchings, and all meetings of unemployed persons were banned in Philadelphia.<ref>Walker, p. 95.</ref>\n\nThe [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration proposed the [[New Deal]] to combat the depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the [[National Recovery Administration]] suspended anti-trust legislation.<ref name=W96>Walker, p. 96.</ref> Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many [[civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]] to key positions, including Interior Secretary [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a member of the ACLU.<ref name=W96/><ref name=W97>Walker, p. 97</ref>\n\nThe economic policies of the New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not.<ref name=W97/> In particular, movies were subject to a barrage of local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene.<ref name=W100>Walker, p. 100.</ref> Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.<ref name=W99>Walker, p. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church attained increasing political influence in the 1930s, and used its influence to promote censorship of movies, and to discourage publication of birth control information. This conflict between the ACLU and the Catholic Church led to the resignation of the last Catholic priest from ACLU leadership in 1934; a Catholic priest would not be represented there again until the 1970s.<ref name=W98>Walker, p. 98.</ref>\n\nThe ACLU took no official position on president Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1937 [[court-packing plan]], which threatened to increase the number of Supreme Court justices, unless the Supreme Court reversed its course and began approving New Deal legislation.<ref name=W105>Walker, p. 105\u2013106.</ref> The Supreme Court responded by making a [[The switch in time that saved nine|major shift in policy]], and no longer applied strict constitutional limits to government programs, and also began to take a more active role in protecting civil liberties.<ref name=W105/>\n\nThe first decision that marked the court's new direction was ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'', in which a communist labor organizer was arrested for calling a meeting to discuss unionization.<ref name=W106>Walker, p. 106.</ref> The ACLU attorney [[Osmond Fraenkel]], working with [[International Labor Defense]], defended De Jonge in 1937, and won a major victory when the Supreme Court ruled that \"peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.\"<ref>Court decision quoted by Walker, p. 106.</ref> The De Jonge case marked the start of an era lasting for a dozen years, during which Roosevelt appointees (led by [[Hugo Black]], [[William O. Douglas]], and [[Frank Murphy]]) established a body of civil liberties law.<ref name=W106/> In 1938, Justice [[Harlan F. Stone]] wrote the famous \"footnote four\" in ''[[United States v. Carolene Products Co.]]'' in which he suggested that state laws which impede civil liberties would{{spaced ndash}}henceforth{{spaced ndash}}require compelling justification.<ref name=W107>Walker, p. 107.</ref>\n\nSenator [[Robert F. Wagner]] proposed the [[National Labor Relations Act]] in 1935, which empowered workers to unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no stand on the legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government.<ref name=W101>Wagner, p. 101.</ref> The newly formed [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to [[Henry Ford]], prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature.<ref name=W102>Walker, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action.<ref name=W102/> But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech.<ref name=W102/> ACLU leader [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent in the years to come.<ref name=W102/>\n\nThe ACLU's support of the NLRB was a major development for the ACLU, because it marked the first time it accepted that a government agency could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.<ref name=W103>Walker, p. 103.</ref> Until 1937, the ACLU felt that civil rights were best upheld by citizens and private organizations.<ref name=W103/>\n\nSome factions in the ACLU proposed new directions for the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal.<ref name=W104>Walker, p. 104.</ref> Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus into the political arena, and to be more willing to compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.<ref name=W104/>\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\nThe ACLU's support of defendants with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties.<ref name=W107/> One such defendant was the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], who were involved in a [[United States Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses|large number of Supreme Court cases]].<ref name=W107/><ref>The ACLU was not the primary legal representative; the Witnesses had their own legal team, led by [[Hayden C. Covington]] during this era.</ref> Cases that the ACLU supported included ''[[Lovell v. City of Griffin]]'' (which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute \"literature of any kind\"); ''[[Martin v. Struthers]]'' (which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and ''[[Cantwell v.

In May, the two factions, one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued, the other advocating support for the President's policy of removing citizens whose \"presence may endanger national security,\" brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU's national leaders. They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens, and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>\n\nThe ACLU offices on the West Coast had been more directly involved in addressing the tide of anti-Japanese prejudice from the start, as they were geographically closer to the issue, and were already working on cases challenging the exclusion by this time. The Seattle office, assisting in [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]'s lawsuit, created an unaffiliated committee to continue the work the ACLU had started, while in Los Angeles, attorney [[A.L. Wirin]] continued to represent [[Ernest Kinzo Wakayama]] but without addressing the case's constitutional questions.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/> (Wirin would lose private clients because of his defense of Wakayama and other Japanese Americans.)<ref>Walker, p. 142.</ref> However, the San Francisco branch, led by [[Ernest Besig]], refused to discontinue its support for [[Fred Korematsu]], whose case had been taken on prior to the June 22 directive, and attorney [[Wayne M. Collins|Wayne Collins]], with Besig's full support, centered his defense on the illegality of Korematsu's exclusion.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>\n\nThe West Coast offices had wanted a test case to take to court, but had a difficult time finding a Japanese American who was both willing to violate the internment orders and able to meet the ACLU's desired criteria of a sympathetic, Americanized plaintiff. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans affected by the order, only 12 disobeyed, and Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and two others were the only resisters whose cases eventually made it to the Supreme Court.<ref name=W138/> ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'' came before the Court in May 1943, and the justices upheld the government's right to exclude Japanese Americans from the West Coast;<ref>Walker, p. 145.</ref> although it had earlier forced its local office in L.A. to stop aiding Hirabayashi, the ACLU donated $1,000 to the case (over a third of the legal team's total budget) and submitted an [[Amicus brief|''amicus'' brief]]. Besig, dissatisfied with [[Osmond Fraenkel]]'s tamer defense, filed an additional ''amicus'' brief that directly addressed Hirabayashi's constitutional rights. In the meantime, A.L. Wirin served as one of the attorneys in ''[[Yasui v. United States]]'' (decided the same day as the Hirabayashi case, and with the same results), but he kept his arguments within the perimeters established by the national office. The only case to receive a favorable ruling, ''[[ex parte Endo]]'', was also aided by two ''amicus'' briefs from the ACLU, one from the more conservative Fraenkel and another from the more putative Wayne Collins.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/>\n\n''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'' proved to be the most controversial of these cases, as Besig and Collins refused to bow to the national ACLU office's pressure to pursue the case without challenging the government's right to remove citizens from their homes. The ACLU board threatened to revoke the San Francisco branch's national affiliation, while Baldwin tried unsuccessfully to convince Collins to step down so he could replace him as lead attorney in the case. Eventually Collins agreed to present the case alongside [[Charles Antone Horsky|Charles Horsky]], although their arguments before the Supreme Court remained based in the unconstitutionality of the exclusion order Korematsu had disobeyed.<ref name=Niiya-ACLU/> The case was decided in December 1944, when the Court once again upheld the government's right to relocate Japanese Americans,<ref>Walker, pp. 146-147</ref> although Korematsu's, Hirabayashi's and Yasui's convictions were later overturned in ''[[coram nobis]]'' proceedings in the 1980s.<ref>Chin, Steven A. ''When Justice Failed: The Fred Korematsu Story'', Raintree, 1992, p. 95.</ref>\n\nThe national office of the ACLU was even more reluctant to defend anti-war protesters. A majority of the board passed a resolution in 1942 which declared the ACLU unwilling to defend anyone who interfered with the United States' war effort.<ref>Walker, p. 157.</ref> Included in this group were the thousands of Nisei who [[Renunciation Act of 1944|renounced their US citizenship]] during the war but later regretted the decision and tried to revoke their applications for \"repatriation.\" (A significant number of those slated to \"go back\" to Japan had never actually been to the country and were in fact being deported rather than repatriated.) Ernest Besig had in 1944 visited the [[Tule Lake Unit, World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument|Tule Lake Segregation Center]], where the majority of these \"renunciants\" were concentrated, and subsequently enlisted Wayne Collins' help to file a lawsuit on their behalf, arguing the renunciations had been given under duress. The national organization prohibited local branches from representing the renunciants, forcing Collins to pursue the case on his own, although Besig and the Northern California office provided some support.<ref>{{cite web|last=Niiya |first=Niiya |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Ernest%20Besig/ |title=Ernest Besig |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring his 1944 visit to Tule Lake, Besig had also became aware of a hastily constructed stockade in which Japanese American internees were routinely being brutalized and held for months without due process.  Besig was forbidden by the national ACLU office to intervene on behalf of the stockade prisoners or even to visit the Tule Lake camp without prior written approval from Baldwin.  Unable to help directly, Besig turned to Wayne Collins for assistance.  Collins, using the threat of habeas corpus suits managed to have the stockade closed down.  A year later, after learning that the stockade had been reestablished, he returned to the camp and had it closed down for good.<ref name=yamato>{{Cite news |last=Yamato |first=Sharon |title=Carrying the Torch: Wayne Collins Jr. on His Father's Defense of the Renunciants | newspaper=Discover Nikkei |date=October 21, 2014 |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2014/10/21/carrying-the-torch/}}</ref><ref name=wollenberg49>{{Cite book| last = Wollenberg | first = Charles | title = Rebel Lawyer: Wayne Collins and the Defense of Japanese American Rights | publisher = Heyday | year = 2018 | pages = 49-51 | isbn = 9781597144360}}</ref>\n\n====1945====\nWhen the war ended in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had accumulated an impressive set of legal victories.<ref name=W186>Walker, p. 186.</ref> President [[Harry S.

Some ACLU leaders were anti-Communist, and felt that the ACLU should not defend any victims. Some ACLU leaders felt that Communists were entitled to free speech protections, and the ACLU should defend them. Other ACLU leaders were uncertain about the threat posed by Communists, and tried to establish a compromise between the two extremes.<ref>Walker, pp. 175\u2013176.</ref> This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.<ref name=W176201>Walker, pp. 176, 210.</ref>\n\nIn 1947, President Truman issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which created the [[Federal Loyalty Program]].

All were imprisoned for [[contempt of Congress]]. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal.<ref name=W181>Walker, p. 181.</ref> The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a [[blacklist]] which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from working. The ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed.<ref name=W181/> The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report ''The Judges and the Judged'', prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]], described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.<ref>Walker, p. 183.</ref>\n\n[[File:DennisEugene.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU chose not to support [[Eugene Dennis]] or other leaders of the US Communist Party, and they were all imprisoned, along with their attorneys]]\nThe federal government took direct aim at the US Communist Party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the [[Foley Square trial]].<ref name=W185>Walker, p. 185.</ref> The case hinged on whether or not mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government.<ref name=W185/> The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison.<ref name=W185/> Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred.<ref name=\"W186\" /> When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them.<ref name=\"W186\"/> Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.<ref name=\"W186\"/>\n\nThe ACLU, in a change of heart, supported the party leaders during their appeal process.

United States (1950)|Henderson v. United States]]'' decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.<ref name=W238/>\n\nIn 1954, the ACLU filed an [[amicus brief]] in the case of ''[[Brown v.

Board of Education'', October 11, 1952 ([https://www.aclu.org/racialjustice/gen/15901lgl19521011.html PDF brief]).</ref> Southern states instituted a McCarthyism-style witch-hunt against the NAACP, attempting it to disclose membership lists. The ACLU's fight against racism was not limited to segregation; in 1964 the ACLU provided key support to plaintiffs, primarily lower income urban residents, in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', which required states to establish the voting districts in accordance with the \"one person, one vote\" principle.<ref>Walker, pp255\u2013 257.</ref>\n\n===Police misconduct===\nThe ACLU regularly tackled police misconduct issues, starting with the 1932 case ''[[Powell v. Alabama]]'' (right to an attorney), and including 1942's ''[[Betts v. Brady]]'' (right to an attorney), and 1951's ''[[Rochin v. California]]'' (involuntary stomach pumping).<ref>Walker, p. 246.</ref> In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues.<ref>Walker, p. 247.</ref> During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct.<ref>Walker, pp. 246\u2013250.</ref> The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board.<ref>Walker, pp. 246\u2013248.</ref> In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, ''Secret Detention by the Chicago Police'', which documented unlawful detention by police.<ref>Walker, pp. 248\u2013249.</ref>\n\nSome of the most well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed in a string of cases limiting the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'', the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home.<ref>Walker, pp. 249\u2013251.</ref> The ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents.<ref>Walker, pp. 252\u2013253.</ref> In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in ''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'', to permit suspects to have an attorney present during questioning.<ref>Walker, p. 250.</ref> And, in 1966, ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] in the following year's ''[[in re Gault]]'' (1967) federal ruling.<ref>Walker, pp. 250\u2013251.</ref> Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers.<ref>Walker, p. 252.</ref> In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.<ref>Walker, p. 274.</ref>\n\n===Civil liberties revolution of the 1960s===\nThe 1960s was a tumultuous era in the United States, and public interest in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth.<ref name=\"Walkerpp\">Walker, pp. 257, 261\u2013262.</ref> Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as [[sit in]]s and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics.<ref>Walker, pp. 262\u2013264.</ref> The ACLU played a central role in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as [[gay rights]], [[prisoner's rights]], [[abortion]], rights of the poor, and the death penalty.<ref name=\"Walkerpp\" /> Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970.<ref name=W262>Walker, p 262</ref> In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states.<ref name=W262 /><ref>The count of affiliates is of affiliates with a permanent staff.</ref> During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving [[amicus briefs]] submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested.<ref name=W262 /> At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from \"disengaged and elitist\" to \"emotionally engaged\".<ref>Walker, p. 263. Characterizations by Samuel Walker.</ref> The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled ''How Americans Protest'', which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.<ref>Walker, pp. 263\u2013264.</ref>\n\nAfrican-American protests in the South accelerated in the early 1960s, and the ACLU assisted at every step. After four African-American college students [[Greensboro sit-ins|staged a sit-in]] in a segregated North Carolina department store, the [[sit-in movement]] gained momentum across the United States.<ref>Walker, p. 261.</ref> During 1960\u201361, the ACLU defended black students arrested for demonstrating in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.<ref name=W263 /> The ACLU also provided legal help for the [[Freedom Riders|Freedom Rides]] in 1961, the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)#Integration of Mississippi universities, 1956\u201365|integration of the University of Mississippi]], the [[Birmingham campaign]] in 1963, and the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]].<ref name=W263>Walker, p. 263.</ref>\n\nThe NAACP was responsible for managing most sit-in related cases that made it to the Supreme Court, winning nearly every decision.<ref name=W264>Walker, p. 264.</ref> But it fell to the ACLU and other legal volunteer efforts to provide legal representation to hundreds of protestors{{spaced ndash}}white and black{{spaced ndash}}who were arrested while protesting in the South.<ref name=W264 /> The ACLU joined with other civil liberties groups to form the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) which subsequently provided legal representation to many of the protesters.<ref>Walker, pp. 264\u2013265.</ref> The ACLU provided the majority of the funding for the LCDC.<ref>Walker, p. 266.</ref>\n\nIn 1964, the ACLU opened up a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to serving Southern issues.<ref>Walker, p. 267.</ref> Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to [[Charles Morgan, Jr.]], the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (''[[Whitus v. Georgia]]''), desegregating prisons (''[[Lee v. Washington]]''), and [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era|reforming election laws]].<ref>Walker, pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman [[Julian Bond]] in ''[[Bond v. Floyd]]'', when the [[Georgia House of Representatives|Georgia congress]] refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature.<ref>Walker, pp 270\u2013271.</ref> Another widely publicized case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, who was convicted of refusing to train [[Green Berets]]. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in ''Parker v. Levy'', 417 US 733 (1974).<ref>Walker, p 271.</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the ACLU won a major victory for free speech, when it defended [[Dick Gregory]] after he was arrested for peacefully protesting against the mayor of Chicago. The court ruled in ''[[Gregory v. Chicago]]'' that a speaker cannot be arrested for disturbing the peace when the hostility is initiated by someone in the audience, as that would amount to a \"heckler's veto\".<ref>[https://www.aclu.org/successes-american-civil-liberties-union ACLU list of successes]; the case was ''Gregory v. Chicago'', 394 US 111</ref>\n\n===Vietnam War===\nThe ACLU was at the center of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: defending [[draft resister]]s, challenging the constitutionality of the war, the [[Watergate scandal|potential impeachment of Richard Nixon]], and the use of national security concerns to preemptively [[Censorship|censor]] newspapers.\n\nDavid J. Miller was the first person prosecuted for burning his [[draft card]]. The New York affiliate of the ACLU appealed his 1965 conviction (367 F.2d 72: ''United States of America v. David J. Miller'', 1966), but the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal. Two years later, the Massachusetts affiliate took the card-burning case of David O'Brien to the Supreme Court, arguing that the act of burning was a form of symbolic speech, but the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', 391 US 367 (1968).<ref name=\"Walker_e\">Walker, p. 280.</ref> Thirteen-year-old Junior High student Mary Tinker wore a black armband to school in 1965 to object to the war, and was suspended from school. The ACLU appealed her case to the Supreme Court and won a victory in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]''. This critical case established that the government may not establish \"enclaves\" such as schools or prisons where all rights are forfeit.<ref name=\"Walker_e\" />\n\n[[File:WCWProtest WashingtonDC.jpg|thumb|left|The ACLU contends that the Bill of Rights protects individuals who burn the US flag as a form of expression]]\nThe ACLU defended Sydney Street, who was arrested for burning an American flag to protest the reported assassination of civil rights leader [[James Meredith]]. In the ''[[Street v. New York]]'' decision, the court agreed with the ACLU that encouraging the country to abandon one of its national symbols was constitutionally protected form of expression.<ref>Walker, p. 280. Meredith, in fact, was not assassinated.</ref> The ACLU successfully defended Paul Cohen, who was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words \"fuck the draft\" on its back, while he walked through the Los Angeles courthouse. The Supreme Court, in ''[[Cohen v. California]]'', held that the vulgarity of the wording was essential to convey the intensity of the message.<ref name=W281>Walker, p. 281.</ref>\n\nNon-war related free speech rights were also advanced during the Vietnam war era; in 1969, the ACLU defended a [[Ku Klux Klan]] member who advocated long-term violence against the government, and the Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's argument in the landmark decision ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', which held that only speech which advocated ''imminent'' violence could be outlawed.<ref name=W281/>\n\nA major crisis gripped the ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted over whether to defend [[Benjamin Spock]] and the Boston Five against federal charges that they encouraged draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources to the cause of the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case.<ref name=W2845>Walker, pp. 284\u2013285.</ref> After the [[Kent State shootings]] in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.<ref>Walker, p 286.</ref>\n\nAlso in 1968, the ACLU held an internal symposium to discuss its dual roles: providing \"direct\" legal support (defense for accused in their initial trial, benefiting only the individual defendant), and appellate support (providing amicus briefs during the appeal process, to establish widespread legal precedent).<ref name=W285>Walker, p. 285.</ref> Historically, the ACLU was known for its appellate work which led to landmark Supreme Court decisions, but by 1968, 90% of the ACLU's legal activities involved direct representation. The symposium concluded that both roles were valid for the ACLU.<ref name=W285/>\n\n==1970s and 1980s==\n\n===Watergate era===\n[[File:Richard M. Nixon, ca. 1935 - 1982 - NARA - 530679.jpg|thumb|The ACLU was the first organization to call for the impeachment of [[Richard Nixon]]]]\n\nThe ACLU supported ''[[The New York Times]]'' in its 1971 suit against the government, requesting permission to publish the [[Pentagon papers]]. The court upheld the ''Times'' and ACLU in the ''[[New York Times Co. v. United States]]'' ruling, which held that the government could not preemptively prohibit the publication of classified information and had to wait until after it was published to take action.<ref>Walker, pp. 289\u2013290.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] saga unfolded, the ACLU became the first national organization to call for Nixon's impeachment.<ref name=W2924>Walker, pp. 292\u2013294. The ACLU published a full page newspaper advertisement on October 14, 1973, urging impeachment.</ref> This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, to claim that the ACLU had evolved into a liberal political organization.<ref>Walker, p. 294</ref>\n\n===Enclaves and new civil liberties===\nThe decade from 1965 to 1975 saw an expansion of the field of civil liberties. Administratively, the ACLU responded by appointing [[Aryeh Neier]] to take over from Pemberton as Executive Director in 1970. Neier embarked on an ambitious program to expand the ACLU; he created the ACLU Foundation to raise funds, and he created several new programs to focus the ACLU's legal efforts. By 1974, ACLU membership had reached 275,000.<ref>Walker, pp. 314\u2013316.</ref>\n\nDuring those years, the ACLU led the way in expanding legal rights in three directions: new rights for persons within government-run \"enclaves\", new rights for victim groups, and privacy rights for mainstream citizens.<ref>Walker, p. 299. Key ACLU leaders in this effort were [[Ira Glasser]] and [[Aryeh Neier]]</ref> At the same time, the organization grew substantially. The ACLU helped develop the field of constitutional law that governs \"enclaves\", which are groups of persons that live in conditions under government control. Enclaves include mental hospital patients, members of the military, and prisoners, and students (while at school). The term enclave originated with Supreme Court justice [[Abe Fortas]]'s use of the phrase \"schools may not be enclaves of totalitarianism\" in the ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'' decision.<ref>Raskin, James B. (2009), \"No Enclaves of Totalitarianism\", American University Law Review, Vol. 58:1193.</ref>\n\nThe ACLU initiated the legal field of student's rights with the ''Tinker v. Des Moines'' case, and expanded it with cases such as ''[[Goss v. Lopez]]'' which required schools to provide students an opportunity to appeal suspensions.<ref>Walker, p. 307.</ref>\n\nAs early as 1945, the ACLU had taken a stand to protect the rights of the mentally ill, when it drafted a model statute governing mental commitments.<ref name=W309>Walker, p. 309.</ref> In the 1960s, the ACLU opposed involuntary commitments, unless it could be demonstrated that the person was a danger to himself or the community.<ref name=W309/> In the landmark 1975 ''[[O'Connor v. Donaldson]]'' decision the ACLU represented a non-violent mental health patient who had been confined against his will for 15 years, and persuaded the Supreme Court to rule such involuntary confinements illegal.<ref name=W309/> The ACLU has also defended the rights of mentally ill individuals who are not dangerous, but who create disturbances. The New York chapter of the ACLU defended [[Billie Boggs]], a mentally ill woman who exposed herself and defecated and urinated in public.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Future Once Happened Here: New York, D.C., L.A., and the Fate of America's Big Cities|author=Siegel, F.|date=2013|publisher=Encounter Books|isbn=9781594035555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l73QSrSIcwC|page=205|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPrior to 1960, prisoners had virtually no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights.<ref>Note, \"Beyond the Ken of Courts\", ''Yale Law Journal'' 72 (1963):506.

Private attorney [[Phil Hirschkop]] discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the [[Virginia State Penitentiary strike]], and won an important victory in 1971's ''[[Landman v. Royster]]'' which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways.<ref>Walker, pp. 310\u2013311. The ACLU was not involved in the ''Landman'' case.</ref> In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the [[National Prison Project]]. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as ''[[Ruiz v. Estelle]]'' (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 [[United States Congress|US Congress]] enacted the [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.\n\n===Victim groups===\n[[File:Ruth Bader Ginsburg official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] co-founded the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in 1971.<ref>Pullman, Sandra (March 7, 2006).

The Women's Rights Project dominated the legal field, handling more than twice as many cases as the [[National Organization for Women]], including breakthrough cases such as ''[[Reed v.

Louisiana]]''.<ref>Walker, pp. 304\u2013305.</ref>\n\nACLU leader [[Harriet Pilpel]] raised the issue of the rights of homosexuals in 1964, and two years later the ACLU formally endorsed [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]]. In 1972, ACLU cooperating attorneys in Oregon filed the first federal civil rights case involving a claim of unconstitutional discrimination against a gay or lesbian public school teacher.  The US District Court held that a state statute that authorized school districts to fire teachers for \"immorality\" was unconstitutionally vague, and awarded monetary damages to the teacher.  The court refused to reinstate the teacher, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that refusal by a 2 to 1 vote. ''Burton v. Cascade School District'', 353 F. Supp. 254 (D. Or. 1972), aff'd 512 F.2d 850 (1975).  In 1973, the ACLU created the Sexual Privacy Project (later the Gay and Lesbian Rights Project) which combated discrimination against homosexuals.<ref>Walker, p. 312.</ref> This support continues even today. After then-Senator [[Larry Craig]] was arrested for soliciting sex in a public restroom, the ACLU wrote an amicus brief for Craig, saying that sex between consenting adults in public places was protected under privacy rights.<ref>[https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/freespeech/craig_v_minnesota_acluamicus.pdf State Of Minnesota].

In 1980, the Project filed ''Poe v. Lynchburg Training School'' after 8,000 women had been sterilized without their authorization. In 1985, the state decided to provide counseling and medical treatment for problems caused by what had happened 5 years prior. In 1977, the ACLU took part in and litigated ''Walker v. Pierce'', the Supreme Court case that created federal regulations to prevent [[Medicaid]] patients from being sterilized without their knowledge or consent. In 1981\u20131990, the Project litigated ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'', a case defending the rights of teenagers who chose not to comply with a state law requiring them to receive parental permission for an abortion. In the 1990s, the Project provided legal assistance and resource kits to those who were being attacked for educating about sexuality and [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. In 1995, the Project filed ''Curtis v. School Committee of Falmouth'', the US's first [[condom]] availability program.\n\n====Current initiatives====\n\nThe Reproductive Freedom Project is presently working on three ideas: (1) to \"reverse the shortage of trained abortion providers throughout the country\" (2) to \"block state and federal welfare \"reform\" proposals that cut off benefits for children who are born to women already receiving welfare, unmarried women, or teenagers\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=dejanikus|first=tacie|date=1982-01-01|title=spousal notification upheld in florida suit|jstor=25774248|journal=Off Our Backs|volume=12|issue=2|pages=9\u20139}}</ref> and (3) to \"stop the elimination of vital reproductive health services as a result of hospital mergers and health care networks\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphia.pa.networkofcare.org/ps/services/agency.aspx?pid=ACLUofPAClaraBellDuvallReproductiveFreedomProject_1147_12_0|title=ACLU of PA: Clara Bell Duvall Reproductive Freedom Project - Philadelphia - - Philadelphia.pa, Pennsylvania|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> The Project says they are hoping to achieve these goals through legal action and litigation.\n\n===Privacy===\nThe [[Privacy laws of the United States|right to privacy]] is not explicitly identified in the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], but the ACLU led the charge to establish such rights in the indecisive 1961 ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'' case, which addressed a state statute outlawing contraception. The issue arose again in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965), and this time the Supreme Court adopted the ACLU's position, and formally declared a right to privacy.<ref>Walker, pp. 300\u2013301</ref> The New York affiliate of the ACLU pushed to eliminate [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion laws]] starting in 1964, a year before ''Griswold'' was decided, and in 1967 the ACLU itself formally adopted the [[Support for the legalization of abortion|right to abortion]] as a policy.<ref>Walker, p. 302.</ref> The ACLU led the defense in ''[[United States v. Vuitch]]'' which expanded the right of physicians to determine when [[abortion]]s were necessary.<ref>Walker, p. 303.</ref> These efforts culminated in one of the most controversial Supreme Court decisions of all time, ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which legalized abortion in the first three months of pregnancy.<ref>Walker, p. 303. The ACLU did not participate directly in ''Roe v. Wade'', but did lead the effort in the companion case ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]''.</ref> The ACLU successfully argued against state bans on [[interracial marriage]], in the case of ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' (1967).\n\nRelated to privacy, the ACLU engaged in several battles to ensure that government records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]], which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.<ref>Walker, p. 308.</ref>\n\n===Allegations of bias===\nIn the early 1970s, conservatives and libertarians began to criticize the ACLU for being too political and too liberal.<ref>Walker, p. 317.</ref> Legal scholar Joseph W.

Bishop cited by Walker. Bishop was professor of law at Yale.</ref> Critics also blamed the ACLU for encouraging the Supreme Court to embrace [[judicial activism]].<ref name=W318>Walker, p. 318.</ref> Critics claimed that the ACLU's support of controversial decisions like ''[[Roe v.

Bush quoted by Walker.</ref>\n\n===The Skokie case===\n{{main|National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie}}\nIt is the policy of the ACLU to support the civil liberties of defendants regardless of their ideological stance. The ACLU takes pride in defending individuals with unpopular viewpoints, such as [[George Wallace]], [[George Lincoln Rockwell]], and [[KKK]] members.<ref>Walker, p 323 (Rockwell); Walker p 242 (Wallace).</ref> The ACLU has defended American Nazis many times, and their actions often brought protests, particularly from American Jews.<ref>Walker, p. 323.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, a small group of American Nazis, led by [[Frank Collin]], applied to the town of [[Skokie, Illinois]], for permission to hold a demonstration in the town park. Skokie at the time had a majority population of Jews, totaling 40,000 of 70,000 citizens, some of whom were survivors of [[Nazi concentration camp]]s. Skokie refused to grant permission, and an Illinois judge supported Skokie and prohibited the demonstration.<ref name=Skokie>Walker, pp. 323\u2013331.</ref> Skokie immediately passed three ordinances aimed at preventing the group from meeting in Skokie. The ACLU assisted Collin and appealed to federal court.<ref name=Skokie/> The appeal dragged on for a year, and the ACLU eventually prevailed in ''Smith v.

The ACLU, joined by [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]], represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge [[John E.

The Court ruled in favor of the ACLU, stating that, \"the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row.\" Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is \"one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States\". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and 6:30&nbsp;am.

He observed himself in multiple mirrors and saw that he was contracting his posture in preparation for any speech. He hypothesized that a habitual conditioned pattern (of pulling his head backwards and downwards) needlessly was disrupting the normal working of his total postural, breathing, and vocal processes.\n\nWith experimentation, Alexander developed the ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, displacement of his head, and shortening of his stature. As he became practised at speaking without these interferences, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss was resolved. While on a recital tour in [[New Zealand]] (1895), he came to believe in the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning although evidence from his own publications appears to indicate it happened less systematically and over a long period of time.<ref name=bloch>{{cite book | last = Bloch | first = Michael | title = F.M. : the life of Frederick Matthias Alexander : founder of the Alexander technique | publisher = Little, Brown | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-316-86048-2 }}</ref>{{rp|36}}\n\n===Influence===\n\nThe American [[philosopher]] and [[educator]] [[John Dewey]] became impressed with the Alexander Technique after his [[headache]]s, [[neck pain]]s, [[blurred vision]], and [[Psychological stress|stress]] symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's advice to change his posture.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ryan, Alan |title=John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism |publisher=W.W.

He rated Alexander's work highly enough to base the character of the doctor who saves the protagonist in '[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]' (an experimental form of autobiographical work) on F.M. Alexander, putting many of his phrases into the character's mouth.<ref>Aldous Huxley, ''Eyeless in Gaza'', Chatto & Windus, 1936 {{ISBN|978-0-06172-489-3}} F. M. Alexander is named in the last section of Chapter 2.

[[Fritz Perls]], who originated [[Gestalt&nbsp;therapy]], credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work.<ref>\n{{cite journal|last=Tengwall|first=Roger\n|title=A note on the influence of F.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Alexander on the development of gestalt therapy\n|year=1996|pages=126\u2013130|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|volume=17|publisher=Wiley|issn=1520-6696\n|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198101)17:1<126::AID-JHBS2300170113>3.0.CO;2-X|issue=1|pmid=7007480\n}}</ref> The [[Mitzvah Technique]] was influenced by the Alexander Technique; as was the [[Feldenkrais Method]] - who expanded on the one exercise in Alexander Technique called \"The Whispered Ah.\"\n\n==Process==\n\nAlexander's approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action, (which could be now called '[[Mindfulness|mindful]]' action, though in his four books he did not use that term.)\n\nActions such as sitting, [[Squatting position|squatting]], lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student that is tailored to their interests or work activities: hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or artistic performance or practice, sports, speech or horseback riding. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment-to-moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with a highly skilled light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the student into a more coordinated state in movement and at rest during in-person lessons. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific, as everyone starts out with slightly different habits.<ref name=\"Arnold 1997\">{{cite web | last = Arnold | first = Joan |author2=Hope Gillerman | title =  Frequently Asked Questions | publisher = American Society for the Alexander Technique | year = 1997 | url = http://www.alexandertech.org/misc/faq.html | accessdate =2 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\nExercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a \"correct\" position. There are only two specific procedures that are practiced by the student; the first is lying [[Supine position#Semi-supine|semi-supine]]. Resting in this way uses \"mechanical advantage\" as a means of redirecting long-term and short-term accumulated muscular tension into a more integrated and balanced state. This position is sometimes referred to as \"constructive rest\", or \"the balanced resting state\". It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of [[conscious]] \"directing\" without \"doing\". The second exercise is the \"Whispered Ah\", which is used to co-ordinate freer breathing and vocal production.\n\nFreedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual conclusions about the nature of training and experimentation. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient, or not in keeping with best \"use\" of themselves as a whole. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.<ref name=\"ptjournal.org\">{{cite journal | last1 = Cacciatore | first1 = W | title = Improvement in Automatic Postural Coordination Following Alexander Technique Lessons in a Person With Low Back Pain | url = http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | journal = Physical Therapy | volume = 85 | issue = 6 | page = 565 | display-authors = etal | access-date = 15 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029170552/http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/content/full/85/6/565 | archive-date = 29 October 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThis specialized hands-on skill also allows Alexander teachers to bring about a balanced working of the student's supportive musculature as it relates to gravity's downward pull from moment to moment. Often, students require a great deal of hands-on work in order to first gain an experience of a fully poised relation to gravity and themselves. The hands-on skill requires Alexander teachers to maintain in themselves from moment-to-moment their own improved psycho-physical co-ordination that the teacher is [[communicating]] to the student.<ref name=\"ptjournal.org\"/>\n\n[[File:POSITION OF SKELETON IN GOOD AND POOR POSTURE - NARA - 515194.tif|thumb|An illustration of alignment.]]\n\nAlexander developed terminology to describe his methods, outlined in his four books that explain the experience of learning and substituting new improvements.\n\n;Constructive Conscious Control\n:Alexander insisted on the need for strategic reasoning because [[kinesthetic]] and [[proprioceptive]] sensory awareness are relative senses, not truthful indicators of a person's factual relationships within him/herself or within the environment. A person's habitual neuro-muscular relation to gravity is habitually sensed internally as \"normal,\" despite being inefficient. Alexander's term, \"debauched sensory appreciation\" describes how the [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] of an action or response encourages the formation of habits as a person adapts to various circumstances or builds skills. Once trained and forgotten, completed habits may be used without feedback sensations that these habits are in effect, (even when only thinking about the situations that elicit them.)<ref>''Body_Learning \u2013 An_Introduction to the Alexander Technique'', Macmillan, 1996 {{ISBN|0805042067}}, quote p. 74, an article in New Scientist by Professor John Basmajian entitled \"Conscious Control of Single Nerve Cells\"</ref> Short-sighted habits are capable of becoming harmfully exaggerated over time, such as restricted breathing or other habitually assumed adaptations to past circumstances. Even exaggerated habits will stop after learning to perceive and prevent them.\n\n;End-gaining\n:Another example is the term \"end-gaining\". This term means to focus on a goal so as to lose sight of the \"means-whereby\"<ref>The subject of \"Means whereby, rather than the end, to be considered\" is discussed many times in ''Man's Supreme Inheritance'', typically Chapter VI, p. 263</ref> the goal could be most appropriately achieved. According to Alexander teachers, \"end-gaining\" increases the likelihood of automatically selecting older or multiple conflicting coping strategies. End-gaining is usually carried out because an imperative priority of impatience or frustration justifies it. Excessive speed in thinking and acting often facilitates end-gaining. Going slowly is a strategy to undo \"end-gaining.\"\n\n;Inhibition\n:In the Alexander Technique lexicon, the principle of \"inhibition\" is considered by teachers to be the most important to gaining improved \"use.\" F.M. Alexander's selection of this word predates the meaning of the word originated by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Inhibition, or 'intentional inhibition'. It is the act of refraining from responding in one's habitual manner - in particular, imposed tension in neck muscles (see Primary Control). Inhibition describes a moment of conscious awareness of a choice to interrupt, stop or entirely prevent an unnecessary habitual \"misuse\". As unnecessary habits are prevented or interrupted, a freer capacity and range of motion resumes and a more spontaneous choice of action or behavior can be discovered, which is experienced by the student as a state of \"non-doing\" or \"allowing.\"\n\n;Primary control\n:How the eyes and head initiate movement governs the training of ourselves in relationship to gravity. Our responses are influenced for good or ill by the qualities of head and eye direction at the inception of any reaction. The qualities and direction of our \"primary control\" occur in every waking moment in response to the stimulus to 'do\" - everything. A person can learn to influence their primary control, improving effortlessness. This influence involves the education of a particular quality of head, neck, torso, and limb relationship that works as we move and respond. A student learns to pay attention during action, without imposing expectations.\n\n;Directions\n:To continue to select and reinforce the often less dominant new ways, it is recommended to repeatedly suggest, by thinking to oneself, a particular series of \"Orders\" or \"Directions.\" \"Giving Directions\" is the expression used for thinking and projecting the positive aspect of how one's self might be used in the most unified psycho-physical way as conveyed by the teacher's hands during a lesson. \n\"Directing\" serves to counteract the common backward and downward pull and shortening in stature that can be detected at the beginning of every movement - particularly addressing a startle pattern of \"fight, flight or freeze.\" A mere thought, as a projection of intention, shapes preparatory movement below the level of sensing it. Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: \"The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen.\"  Some teachers have shortened this to a suggestion of, \"Freer?\" Negative directions (that use Alexander's other preventive principle of \"inhibition\") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.\nWhichever is used, all \"Directing\" is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to \"Directing\" often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. \nTeacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.\n\n;Psycho-physical unity\n:Global concepts such as \"Psycho-physical Unity\" and \"Use\" describe how thinking strategies and attention work together during preparation for an action or for withholding one. They connote the general sequence of how intention joins together with execution to directly affect the perception of events and the outcome of intended results.<ref name=actor>{{cite book|title=The Actor and the Alexander Technique|pages=14|isbn=0-312-29515-4|first=Kelly|last= McEvenue|location=New York|publisher= Macmillan|year= 2002|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ixvTPRlcSMoC}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe Alexander Technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons.
