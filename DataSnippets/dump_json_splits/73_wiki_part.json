Bizar]], the company's first publications were the wargames ''Gladiators'' and ''Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age''. Upon the sudden appearance and massive popularity of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' from [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], the company turned its attentions to role-playing games, seeking out and producing systems created by amateurs and freelancers. Rather than focusing on any one line and supporting it with subsequent supplements, FGU produced a continuous stream of new games. Because of the disparate authors, the rules systems were mutually incompatible. FGU Incorporated published dozens of different role-playing games.\n\nIn 1989, Fantasy Games Unlimited won the All Time Best Ancient Medieval Rules for 1979 [[Origins Award|H.G.

Also functional decomposition may result in a compressed representation of the global function, a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of ''modularity'' (i.e., independence or non-interaction).\n\nInteractions between the components are critical to the function of the collection. All interactions may not be observable, but possibly deduced through repetitive perception, synthesis, validation and verification of composite behavior.\n\n== Basic mathematical definition ==\n[[Image:Chow-liu.png|thumb|400 px|An example of a sparsely connected dependency structure. Direction of causal flow is upward.]]For a multivariate function <math>y = f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)</math>, functional decomposition generally refers to a process of identifying a set of functions <math>\\{g_1, g_2, \\dots g_m\\}</math> such that\n\n:<math>f(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) = \\phi(g_1(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n), g_2(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n), \\dots g_m(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n))</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\phi</math> is some other function. Thus, we would say that the function <math>f</math> is decomposed into functions <math>\\{g_1, g_2, \\dots g_m\\}</math>. This process is intrinsically hierarchical in the sense that we can (and often do) seek to further decompose the functions <math>g_i</math> into a collection of constituent functions <math>\\{h_1, h_2, \\dots h_p\\} </math>such that\n\n:<math>g_i(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) = \\gamma(h_1(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n), h_2(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n), \\dots h_p(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n))</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma</math> is some other function. Decompositions of this kind are interesting and important for a wide variety of reasons. In general, functional decompositions are worthwhile when there is a certain \"sparseness\" in the dependency structure; that is, when constituent functions are found to depend on approximately [[disjoint sets]] of variables. Thus, for example, if we can obtain a decomposition of <math>x_1 = f(x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_6)</math> into a hierarchical composition of functions <math>\\{g_1, g_2, g_3\\}</math> such that <math>x_1 = g_1(x_2)</math>, <math>x_2 = g_2(x_3,x_4,x_5)</math>, <math>x_5 = g_3(x_6)</math>, as shown in the figure at right, this would probably be considered a highly valuable decomposition.\n\n===Example: Arithmetic===\nA basic example of functional decomposition is expressing the four binary arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in terms of the two binary operations of addition <math>a + b</math> and multiplication <math>a \\times b,</math> and the two unary operations of additive inversion <math>-a</math> and multiplicative inversion <math>1/a.</math> Subtraction can then be realized as the composition of addition and additive inversion, <math>a - b = a + (-b),</math> and division can be realized as the composition of multiplication and multiplicative inverse, <math>a \\div b = a \\times (1/b).</math> This simplifies the analysis of subtraction and division, and also makes it easier to axiomatize these operations in the notion of a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], as there are only two binary and two unary operations, rather than four binary operations.\n\nExtending these primitive operations, there is a rich literature on the topic of [[Polynomial decomposition|polynomial decomposition.]]\n\n===Example: Decomposition of continuous functions===\n\n==Motivation for decomposition==\nAs to ''why'' the decomposition is valuable, the reason is twofold.  Firstly, decomposition of a function into non-interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function.  For example, on a set of quaternary (i.e., 4-ary) variables, representing the full function <math>x_1=f(x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_6)</math> requires storing <math>4^5=1024</math> values, the value of the function for each element in the [[Cartesian product]] <math>\\{x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_6\\}</math>, i.e., each of the 1024 possible combinations for  <math>\\{x_2,x_3,\\dots,x_6\\}</math>. However, if the decomposition into <math>\\{g_1, g_2, g_3\\}</math> given above is possible, then <math>g_1 = g_1(x_2)</math> requires storing 4 values, <math>g_2 = g_2(x_3,x_4,x_5)</math> requires storing <math>4^3=64</math> values, and <math>g_3 = g_3(x_6)</math> again requires storing just 4 values. So in virtue of the decomposition, we need store only <math>4+64+4=72</math> values rather than 1024 values, a dramatic savings.\n\n[[Image:West-side-highway traffic.png|thumb|400px|Causal influences on West Side Highway traffic. Weather and GW Bridge traffic ''screen off'' other influences]]\nIntuitively, this reduction in representation size is achieved simply because each variable depends only on a subset of the other variables. Thus, variable <math>x_1</math> only depends directly on variable <math>x_2</math>, rather than depending on the ''entire set'' of variables. We would say that variable <math>x_2</math> ''screens off'' variable <math>x_1</math> from the rest of the world.  Practical examples of this phenomenon surround us, as discussed in the \"Philosophical Considerations\" below, but let's just consider the particular case of \"northbound traffic on the [[West Side Highway]].\"  Let us assume this variable (<math>{x_1}</math>) takes on three possible values of {\"moving slow\", \"moving deadly slow\", \"not moving at all\"}.  Now let's say variable <math>{x_1}</math> depends on two other variables,  \"weather\" with values of {\"sun\", \"rain\", \"snow\"}, and \"[[GW Bridge]] traffic\" with values {\"10mph\", \"5mph\", \"1mph\"}.  The point here is that while there are certainly many secondary variables that affect the weather variable (e.g., low pressure system over Canada, [[Butterfly Effect|butterfly flapping]] in Japan, etc.) and the Bridge traffic variable (e.g., an accident on [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]], presidential motorcade, etc.) all these other secondary variables are not directly relevant to the West Side Highway traffic.  All we need (hypothetically) in order to predict the West Side Highway traffic is the weather and the GW Bridge traffic, because these two variables ''screen off'' West Side Highway traffic from all other potential influences. That is, all other influences act ''through'' them.\n\nOutside of purely mathematical considerations, perhaps the greatest value of functional decomposition is the insight it provides into the structure of the world. When a functional decomposition can be achieved, this provides ontological information about what structures actually exist in the world, and how they can be predicted and manipulated. For example, in the illustration above, if it is learned that <math>{x_1}</math> depends directly only on <math>{x_2}</math>, this means that for purposes of prediction of <math>{x_1}</math>, it suffices to know only <math>{x_2}</math>. Moreover, interventions to influence <math>{x_1}</math> can be taken directly on <math>{x_2}</math>, and nothing additional can be gained by intervening on variables <math>\\{x_3,x_4,x_5\\}</math>, since these only act through <math>{x_2}</math> in any case.\n\n==Philosophical considerations==\nThe philosophical antecedents and ramifications of functional decomposition are quite broad, as functional decomposition in one guise or another underlies all of modern science. Here we review just a few of these philosophical considerations.\n\n===Reductionist tradition===\nOne of the major distinctions that is often drawn between [[Eastern philosophy]] and [[Western Philosophy]] is that the Eastern philosophers tended to espouse ideas favoring [[holism]] while the Western thinkers tended to espouse ideas favoring [[reductionism]]. This distinction between East and West is akin to other philosophical distinctions such as  [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[anti-realism]]). Some examples of the Eastern holistic spirit:\n\n* \"Open your mouth, increase your activities, start making distinctions between things, and you'll toil forever without hope.\" <small>\u2014 The [[Tao Te Ching]] of [[Lao Tzu]] (Brian Browne Walker, translator)</small>\n* \"It's a hard job for [people] to see the meaning of the fact that everything, including ourselves, depends on everything else and has no permanent self-existence.\" <small>\u2014 [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (Anne Bankroft, translator)</small>\n*\"A name is imposed on what is thought to be a thing or a state and this divides it from other things and other states.  But when you pursue what lies behind the name, you find a greater and greater subtlety that has no divisions...\" <small>\u2014 [[Visuddhi Magga]] (Anne Bankroft, translator)</small>\n\nThe Western tradition, from its origins among the [[Greek philosophers]], preferred a position in which drawing correct distinctions, divisions, and contrasts was considered the very pinnacle of insight.  In the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]]/[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyrian]] worldview, to be able to distinguish (via strict proof) which qualities of a thing represent its [[essence]] vs. [[Property (philosophy)|property]] vs. [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] vs. [[Intensional definition|definition]], and by virtue of this formal description to segregate that entity into its proper place in the taxonomy of nature \u2014 this was to achieve the very height of wisdom.\n\n===Characteristics of hierarchy and modularity===\nIn natural or artificial systems that require components to be integrated in some fashion, but where the number of components exceeds what could reasonably be fully interconnected (due to square wise growth in number of connections (= n over two or = n * (n - 1) / 2)), one often finds that some degree of hierarchicality must be employed in the solution. The general advantages of sparse hierarchical systems over densely connected systems\u2014and quantitative estimates of these advantage\u2014are presented by {{Harvtxt|Resnikoff|1989}}. In prosaic terms, a hierarchy is \"a collection of elements that combine lawfully into complex wholes which depend for their properties upon those of their constituent parts,\" and wherein novelty is \"fundamentally combinatorial, iterative, and transparent\" {{Harv|McGinn|1994}}.\n\nAn important notion that always arises in connection with hierarchies is modularity, which is effectively implied by the sparseness of connections in hierarchical topologies. In physical systems, a module is generally a set of interacting components that relates to the external world via a very limited interface, thus concealing most aspects of its internal structure. As a result, modifications that are made to the internals of a module (to improve efficiency for example) do not necessarily create a ripple effect through the rest of the system {{Harv|Fodor|1983}}. This feature makes the effective use of modularity a centerpiece of all good software and hardware engineering.\n\n===Inevitability of hierarchy and modularity===\nThere are many compelling arguments regarding the prevalence and necessity of hierarchy/modularity in nature {{Harv|Koestler|1973}}. {{Harvtxt|Simon|1996}} points out that among evolving systems, only those that can manage to obtain and then reuse stable subassemblies (modules) are likely to be able to search through the fitness landscape with a reasonably quick pace; thus, Simon submits that \"among possible complex forms, hierarchies are the ones that have the time to evolve.\" This line of thinking has led to the even stronger claim that although \"we do not know what forms of life have evolved on other planets in the universe, ... we can safely assume that 'wherever there is life, it must be hierarchically organized'\" {{Harv|Koestler|1967}}. This would be a fortunate state of affairs since the existence of simple and isolable subsystems is thought to be a precondition for successful science {{Harv|Fodor|1983}}. In any case, experience certainly seems to indicate that much of the world possesses hierarchical structure.\n\nIt has been proposed that perception itself is a process of hierarchical decomposition {{Harv|Leyton|1992}}, and that phenomena which are not essentially hierarchical in nature may not even be \"theoretically intelligible\" to the human mind ({{Harvnb|McGinn|1994}},{{Harvnb|Simon|1996}}). In Simon's words,\n\n{{quotation|The fact then that many complex systems have a nearly decomposable, hierarchic structure is a major facilitating factor enabling us to understand, describe, and even \"see\" such systems and their parts. Or perhaps the proposition should be put the other way round. If there are important systems in the world that are complex without being hierarchic, they may to a considerable extent escape our observation and understanding. Analysis of their behavior would involve such detailed knowledge and calculations of the interactions of their elementary parts that it would be beyond our capacities of memory or computation.}}\n\n==Applications==\nPractical applications of functional decomposition are found in [[Bayesian networks]], [[structural equation modeling]], [[linear systems]], and [[database systems]].\n\n===Knowledge representation===\nProcesses related to functional decomposition are prevalent throughout the fields of [[knowledge representation]] and [[machine learning]]. Hierarchical model induction techniques such as [[Logic circuit minimization]], [[decision trees]], [[grammatical inference]], [[hierarchical clustering]], and [[quadtree decomposition]] are all examples of function decomposition. A review of other applications and function decomposition can be found in {{Harvtxt|Zupan|Bohanec|Bratko|Dem\u0161ar|1997}}, which also presents methods based on [[information theory]] and [[graph theory]].\n\nMany statistical inference methods can be thought of as implementing a function decomposition process in the presence of noise; that is, where functional dependencies are only expected to hold ''approximately''. Among such models are [[mixture models]] and the recently popular methods referred to as \"causal decompositions\" or [[Bayesian networks]].\n\n===Database theory===\nSee [[database normalization]].\n\n===Machine learning===\nIn practical scientific applications, it is almost never possible to achieve perfect functional decomposition because of the incredible complexity of the systems under study.  This complexity is manifested in the presence of \"noise,\" which is just a designation for all the unwanted and untraceable influences on our observations.\n\nHowever, while perfect functional decomposition is usually impossible, the spirit lives on in a large number of statistical methods that are equipped to deal with noisy systems.  When a natural or artificial system is intrinsically hierarchical, the [[joint distribution]] on system variables should provide evidence of this hierarchical structure. The task of an observer who seeks to understand the system is then to infer the hierarchical structure from observations of these variables. This is the notion behind the hierarchical decomposition of a joint distribution, the attempt to recover something of the intrinsic hierarchical structure which generated that joint distribution.\n\nAs an example, [[Bayesian network]] methods attempt to decompose a joint distribution along its causal fault lines, thus \"cutting nature at its seams\". The essential motivation behind these methods is again that within most systems (natural or artificial), relatively few components/events interact with one another directly on equal footing {{Harv|Simon|1963}}. Rather, one observes pockets of dense connections (direct interactions) among small subsets of components, but only loose connections between these densely connected subsets. There is thus a notion of \"causal proximity\" in physical systems under which variables naturally precipitate into small clusters. Identifying these clusters and using them to represent the joint provides the basis for great efficiency of storage (relative to the full joint distribution) as well as for potent inference algorithms.\n\n===Software architecture===\n{{main|Decomposition (computer science)}}\nFunctional Decomposition is a design method intending to produce a non-implementation, architectural description of a computer program. Rather than conjecturing Objects and adding methods to them ([[Object-oriented programming|OOP]]), with each Object intending to capture some service of the program, the software architect first establishes a series of functions and types that accomplishes the main processing problem of the computer program, decomposes each to reveal common functions and types, and finally derives Modules from this activity.\n\nFor example, the design of the editor [[Emacs]] can initially be thought about in terms of functions:\n\n<math>\ne\\, \\equiv \\text{state of the Emacs editor and running operating system}\n</math>\n<br>\n<math>\ne'\\, \\equiv e\\text{ with some component/part of its state changed}\n</math>\n\n<math>\nf: (e, lisp\\,\\,expression) \\rightarrow e'\n</math>\n\nAnd a possible '''function decomposition''' of ''f'':\n\n<math>\nfromExpr: lisp\\,\\,expression \\rightarrow\n\\begin{cases}\nobject, & \\text{if success} \\\\\nerror, & \\text{if failure}\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\n<math>\nevaluate: (object, e) \\rightarrow e'\n</math>\n\n<math>\nprint: (error, e) \\rightarrow e'\n</math>\n\nThis leads one to the plausible Module, Service, or Object, of an interpreter (containing the function ''fromExpr''). Function Decomposition arguably yields  insights about re-usability, such as if during the course of analysis, two functions produce the same type, it is likely that a common function/[[cross-cutting concern]] resides in both. To contrast, in [[Object-oriented programming|OOP]], it is a common practice to conjecture Modules prior to considering such a decomposition. This arguably results in costly [[refactoring]] later. FD mitigates that risk to some extent. Further, arguably, what separates FD from other design methods- is that it provides a concise high-level medium of architectural discourse that is end-to-end, revealing flaws in upstream [[requirements]] and beneficially exposing more design decisions in advance. And lastly, FD is known to prioritize development. As arguably, if the FD is correct, the most re-usable and cost-determined parts of the program are identified far earlier in the development cycle.\n\n===Signal processing===\nFunctional decomposition is used in the analysis of many [[signal processing]] systems, such as [[LTI system theory|LTI systems]]. The input signal to an LTI system can be expressed as a function, <math>f(t)</math>. Then <math>f(t)</math> can be decomposed into a linear combination of other functions, called component signals:\n::<math> f(t) = a_1 \\cdot g_1(t) + a_2 \\cdot g_2(t) + a_3 \\cdot g_3(t) + \\dots + a_n \\cdot g_n(t) </math>\nHere, <math> \\{g_1(t), g_2(t), g_3(t), \\dots , g_n(t)\\} </math> are the component signals. Note that <math> \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots , a_n\\} </math> are constants. This decomposition aids in analysis, because now the output of the system can be expressed in terms of the components of the input. If we let <math>T\\{\\}</math> represent the effect of the system, then the output signal is <math>T\\{f(t)\\}</math>, which can be expressed as:\n::<math> T\\{f(t)\\} = T\\{ a_1 \\cdot g_1(t) + a_2 \\cdot g_2(t) + a_3 \\cdot g_3(t) + \\dots + a_n \\cdot g_n(t)\\}</math>\n::<math> = a_1 \\cdot T\\{g_1(t)\\} + a_2 \\cdot T\\{g_2(t)\\} + a_3 \\cdot T\\{g_3(t)\\} + \\dots + a_n \\cdot T\\{g_n(t)\\}</math>\nIn other words, the system can be seen as acting separately on each of the components of the input signal. Commonly used examples of this type of decomposition are the [[Fourier series]] and the [[Fourier transform]].\n\n===Systems engineering ===\nFunctional decomposition in [[systems engineering]] refers to the process of defining a system in functional terms, then defining lower-level functions and sequencing relationships from these higher level systems functions.<ref>[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-885j-aircraft-systems-engineering-fall-2005/readings/sefguide_01_01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''], Defense Acquisition University Press, Fort Belvoir, VA, January 2001, p45</ref>  The basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of a [[Functional flow block diagram|block diagram]] can be described without an \"and\" or \"or\" in the description.\n\nThis exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure [[role|function]]. When a system is designed as pure functions, they can be reused, or replaced. A usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic. Since the interfaces usually become simple, it is easier to replace a pure function with a related, similar function.\n\nFor example, say that one needs to make a [[boombox|stereo]] system. One might functionally decompose this into [[loudspeaker|speakers]], [[amplifier]], a [[tape deck]] and a front panel. Later, when a different model needs an audio [[CD]], it can probably fit the same interfaces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bayesian networks]]\n*[[Currying]]\n*[[Database normalization]]\n*[[Function

He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the [[Baffin Island]] Inuit. He went on to do field work with the indigenous cultures and languages of the Pacific Northwest. In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became a professor of anthropology at [[Columbia University]], where he remained for the rest of his career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology. Among his most significant students were [[Manuel Gamio]], [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[Ruth Benedict]], [[Edward Sapir]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Melville Herskovits]], [[Anita Brenner]], [[Ella Cara Deloria|Ella Deloria]], and [[Zora Neale Hurston]].<ref name=Moore>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jerry D.|year=2009|chapter=Franz Boas: Culture in Context |title=Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists|location=Walnut Creek, California|publisher=Altamira|pages=33\u201346}}</ref>\n\nBoas was one of the most prominent opponents of the then-popular ideologies of [[scientific racism]], the idea that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] is a biological concept and that human behavior is best understood through the typology of biological characteristics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gossett|first=Thomas|year=1997|origyear=1963|title=Race: The History of an Idea in America|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=418|quote= It is possible that Boas did more to combat race prejudice than any other person in history.|location=New York, Oxford}}</ref> In a series of groundbreaking studies of skeletal anatomy he showed that cranial shape and size was highly malleable depending on environmental factors such as health and nutrition, in contrast to the claims by racial anthropologists of the day that held head shape to be a stable racial trait. Boas also worked to demonstrate that differences in human behavior are not primarily determined by innate biological dispositions but are largely the result of cultural differences acquired through social learning. In this way, Boas introduced culture as the primary concept for describing differences in behavior between human groups, and as the central analytical concept of anthropology.<ref name=Moore/>\n\nAmong Boas's main contributions to anthropological thought was his rejection of the then-popular evolutionary approaches to the study of culture, which saw all societies progressing through a set of hierarchic technological and cultural stages, with Western European culture at the summit. Boas argued that culture developed historically through the interactions of groups of people and the diffusion of ideas and that consequently there was no process towards continuously \"higher\" cultural forms. This insight led Boas to reject the \"stage\"-based organization of ethnological museums, instead preferring to order items on display based on the affinity and proximity of the cultural groups in question.\n\nBoas also introduced the ideology of [[cultural relativism]], which holds that cultures cannot be objectively ranked as higher or lower, or better or more correct, but that all humans see the world through the lens of their own culture, and judge it according to their own culturally acquired norms. For Boas, the object of anthropology was to understand the way in which culture conditioned people to understand and interact with the world in different ways and to do this it was necessary to gain an understanding of the language and cultural practices of the people studied. By uniting the disciplines of [[archaeology]], the study of material culture and history, and [[physical anthropology]], the study of variation in human anatomy, with [[ethnology]], the study of cultural variation of customs, and descriptive linguistics, the study of unwritten indigenous languages, Boas created the [[Four field approach|four field subdivision]] of anthropology which became prominent in American anthropology in the 20th century.<ref name=Moore/>\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Boas1881.jpg|thumb|Boas' dissertation: ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Erkenntniss der Farbe des Wassers'' (Faculty of Philosophy, [[University of Kiel]] 1881)]]\nFranz Boas was born in [[Minden]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]]. Although his grandparents were observant [[Jew]]s, his parents embraced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values, including their assimilation into modern [[Germany|German]] society. Boas's parents were educated, well-to-do, and liberal; they did not like [[dogma]] of any kind. Due to this, Boas was granted the independence to think for himself and pursue his own interests. Early in life, he displayed a penchant for both nature and natural sciences. Boas vocally opposed anti-Semitism and refused to convert to [[Christianity]], but he did not identify himself as a Jew.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Glick |first1 = L.

In 1883, encouraged by Theobald Fischer, Boas went to [[Baffin Island]] to conduct geographic research on the impact of the physical environment on native [[Inuit]] migrations. The first of many ethnographic field trips, Boas culled his notes to write his first monograph titled ''The Central Eskimo'', which was published in 1888 in the 6th Annual Report from the Bureau of American Ethnology. Boas lived and worked closely with the Inuit peoples on Baffin Island, and he developed an abiding interest in the way people lived.<ref name=\"Central_Eskimo_1988\">{{citation |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42084/42084-h/42084-h.htm |work=Smithsonian Institution via Gutenberg |location=Washington |pages=399\u2013670 |year=1888 |first=Franz |last=Boas |title=The Central Eskimo |series=Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1884-1885, Government Printing Office|accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the perpetual darkness of the Arctic winter, Boas reported, he and his traveling companion became lost and were forced to keep sledding for twenty-six hours through ice, soft snow, and temperatures that dropped below \u221246&nbsp;\u00b0C.

It was a difficult year filled with tremendous hardships that included frequent bouts of disease, mistrust, pestilence, and danger.

Boas had studied anatomy with Virchow two years earlier while preparing for the Baffin Island expedition. At the time, Virchow was involved in a vociferous debate over evolution with his former student, [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Haeckel had abandoned his medical practice to study comparative anatomy after reading [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''The Origin of Species'', and vigorously promoted Darwin's ideas in Germany. However, like most other natural scientists prior to the rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]] in 1900 and the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], Virchow felt that Darwin's theories were weak because they lacked a theory of cellular mutability. Accordingly, Virchow favored [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarckian]] models of evolution. This debate resonated with debates among geographers. Lamarckians believed that environmental forces could precipitate rapid and enduring changes in organisms that had no inherited source; thus, Lamarckians and environmental determinists often found themselves on the same side of debates.\n\nBut Boas worked more closely with Bastian, who was noted for his antipathy to environmental determinism. Instead, he argued for the \"psychic unity of mankind\", a belief that all humans had the same intellectual capacity, and that all cultures were based on the same basic mental principles. Variations in custom and belief, he argued, were the products of historical accidents. This view resonated with Boas's experiences on Baffin Island and drew him towards anthropology.\n\nWhile at the Royal Ethnological Museum Boas became interested in the Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest, and after defending his habilitation thesis, he left for a three-month trip to British Columbia via New York. In January&nbsp;1887, he was offered a job as assistant editor of the journal ''Science''. Alienated by growing [[antisemitism]] and [[nationalism]] as well as the very limited academic opportunities for a geographer in Germany, Boas decided to stay in the United States. Possibly he received additional motivation for this decision from his romance with Marie Krackowizer, whom he married in the same year.\n\nAside from his editorial work at ''Science'', Boas secured an appointment as ''docent'' in anthropology at [[Clark University]], in 1888. Boas was concerned about university president [[G.&nbsp; Stanley Hall]]'s interference in his research, yet in 1889 he was appointed as the head of a newly created department of anthropology at Clark University. In the early 1890s, he went on a series of expeditions which were referred to as the Morris K. Jesup Expedition. The primary goal of these expeditions was to illuminate Asiatic-American relations.<ref>Cole, Douglas 1983 \"The Value of a Person Lies in His Herzensbildung\": Franz Boas's Baffin Island Letter-Diay, 1883\u20131884.

Putnam argued that showing late nineteenth century Inuit and First Nations (then called Eskimo and Indians) \"in their natural conditions of life\" would provide a contrast and celebrate the four centuries of Western accomplishments since 1493.<ref name=\"Lorini_2003\">{{citation |url=http://www.cromohs.unifi.it/8_2003/lorini.html |year=2003 |title=Alice Fletcher and the Search for Women's Public Recognition in Professionalizing American Anthropology |first=Alessandra |last=Lorini |work=Cromohs |volume=8 |pages=1\u201325 |location=Florence, Italy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127183350/http://www.cromohs.unifi.it/8_2003/lorini.html |archivedate=2016-01-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFranz Boas traveled north to gather ethnographic material for the Exposition. Boas had intended public science in creating exhibitions for the Exposition where visitors to the Midway could learn about other cultures. Boas arranged for fourteen Kwakiutl aboriginals from British Columbia to come and reside in a mock Kwakiutl village, where they could perform their daily tasks in context. Inuit were there with 12' long whips made of sealskin, wearing sealskin clothing and showing how adept they were in sealskin kayaks. His experience with the Exposition provided the first of a series of shocks to Franz Boas' faith in public anthropology. The visitors were not there to be educated. By 1916, Boas had come to recognize with a certain resignation that \"the number of people in our country who are willing and able to enter into the modes of thought of other nations is altogether too small ...

In 1897, he organized the [[Jesup North Pacific Expedition]], a five-year-long field-study of the natives of the Pacific Northwest, whose ancestors had migrated across the Bering Strait from Siberia. He attempted to organize exhibits along contextual, rather than evolutionary, lines. He also developed a research program in line with his curatorial goals: describing his instructions to his students in terms of widening contexts of interpretation within a society, he explained that \"... they get the specimens; they get explanations of the specimens; they get connected texts that partly refer to the specimens and partly to abstract things concerning the people; and they get grammatical information\". These widening contexts of interpretation were abstracted into one context, the context in which the specimens, or assemblages of specimens, would be displayed: \"... we want a collection arranged according to tribes, in order to teach the particular style of each group\". His approach, however, brought him into conflict with the President of the Museum, [[Morris Jesup]], and its director, [[Hermon Bumpus]]. By 1900 Boas had begun to retreat from American museum anthropology as a tool of education or reform (Hinsley 1992: 361). He resigned in 1905, never to work for a museum again.\n\n==Fin de Si\u00e8cle debates==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Science versus history===\nSome scholars, like Boas's student [[Alfred Kroeber]], believed that Boas used his research in physics as a model for his work in anthropology. Many others, however\u2014including Boas's student [[Alexander Lesser]], and later researchers such as [[Marian W. Smith]], [[Herbert S. Lewis]], and [[Matti Bunzl]]\u2014have pointed out that Boas explicitly rejected physics in favor of history as a model for his anthropological research.\n\nThis distinction between science and history has its origins in 19th-century German academe, which distinguished between ''Naturwissenschaften'' (the sciences) and ''Geisteswissenschaften'' (the humanities), or between ''Gesetzwissenschaften'' (the law - giving sciences) and ''Geschichtswissenschaften'' (history). Generally, ''Naturwissenschaften'' and ''Gesetzwissenschaften'' refer to the study of phenomena that are governed by objective natural laws, while the latter terms in the two oppositions refer to those phenomena that have to mean only in terms of human perception or experience.\n\nIn 1884, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] philosopher [[Wilhelm Windelband]] coined the terms [[nomothetic]] and [[idiographic]] to describe these two divergent approaches. He observed that most scientists employ some mix of both, but in differing proportions; he considered physics a perfect example of a nomothetic science, and history, an idiographic science. Moreover, he argued that each approach has its origin in one of the two \"interests\" of reason [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had identified in the ''Critique of Judgement''\u2014one \"generalizing\", the other \"specifying\". (Winkelband's student [[Heinrich Rickert]] elaborated on this distinction in ''The Limits of Concept Formation in Natural Science : A Logical Introduction to the Historical Sciences''; Boas's students [[Alfred Kroeber]] and [[Edward Sapir]] relied extensively on this work in defining their own approach to anthropology.)\n\nAlthough Kant considered these two interests of reason to be objective and universal, the distinction between the natural and human sciences was institutionalized in Germany, through the organization of scholarly research and teaching, following the Enlightenment. In Germany, the Enlightenment was dominated by Kant himself, who sought to establish principles based on universal rationality. In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (an influence to Boas)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/herder/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Johann Gottfried von Herder |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2016-05-20 |author=Michael Forster}}</ref> argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. In 1795, the great [[Linguistics|linguist]] and philosopher [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. Humboldt founded the [[University of Berlin]] in 1809, and his work in geography, history, and psychology provided the milieu in which Boas's intellectual orientation matured.\n\nHistorians working in the Humboldtian tradition developed ideas that would become central in Boasian anthropology. [[Leopold von Ranke]] defined the task of the historian as \"merely to show as it actually was\", which is a cornerstone of Boas's empiricism. [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] emphasized the centrality of \"understanding\" to human knowledge, and that the lived experience of a historian could provide a basis for an empathic understanding of the situation of a historical actor.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0gN2LBm3MXsC&dq= ''A Franz Boas Reader: The Shaping of American Anthropology, 1883-1911''], [[University of Chicago Press]], 1989, p. 11.</ref> For Boas, both values were well-expressed in a quote from Goethe: \"A single action or event is interesting, not because it is explainable, but because it is true.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe influence of these ideas on Boas is apparent in his 1887 essay, \"The Study of Geography,\" in which he distinguished between physical science, which seeks to discover the laws governing phenomena, and historical science, which seeks a thorough understanding of phenomena on their own terms. Boas argued that geography is and must be historical in this sense. In 1887, after his Baffin Island expedition, Boas wrote \"The Principles of Ethnological Classification\", in which he developed this argument in application to anthropology:\n\n{{quote|Ethnological phenomena are the result of the physical and psychical character of men, and of its development under the influence of the surroundings ... 'Surroundings' are the physical conditions of the country, and the sociological phenomena, i.e.,&nbsp; the relation of man to man. Furthermore, the study of the present surroundings is insufficient: the history of the people, the influence of the regions through which it has passed on its migrations, and the people with whom it came into contact, must be considered|Boas and Stocking 1989.}}\n\nThis formulation echoes Ratzel's focus on historical processes of human migration and culture contact and Bastian's rejection of environmental determinism. It also emphasizes culture as a context (\"surroundings\"), and the importance of history. These are the hallmarks of Boasian anthropology (which [[Marvin Harris]] would later call \"[[historical particularism]]\"), would guide Boas's research over the next decade, as well as his instructions to future students. (see Lewis 2001b for an alternative view to Harris'.)\n\nAlthough context and history were essential elements to Boas's understanding of anthropology as ''Geisteswissenschaften'' and ''Geschichtswissenschaften'', there is one essential element that Boasian anthropology shares with ''Naturwissenschaften'': empiricism. In 1949, Boas's student, [[Alfred Kroeber]] summed up the three principles of empiricism that define Boasian anthropology as a science:\n# The method of science is, to begin with, questions, not with answers, least of all with value judgments.\n# Science is a dispassionate inquiry and therefore cannot take over outright any ideologies \"already formulated in everyday life\" since these are themselves inevitably traditional and normally tinged with emotional prejudice.\n# Sweeping all-or-none, black-and-white judgments are characteristic of categorical attitudes and have no place in science, whose very nature is inferential and judicious.\n\n===Orthogenetic versus Darwinian evolution===\nOne of the greatest accomplishments of Boas and his students was their critique of theories of physical, social, and cultural evolution current at that time. This critique is central to Boas's work in museums, as well as his work in all four fields of anthropology. As historian [[George W. Stocking, Jr.|George Stocking]] noted, however, Boas's main project was to distinguish between biological and cultural heredity, and to focus on the cultural processes that he believed had the greatest influence over social life.<ref>Stocking, George W., Jr. I968. Race, culture, and evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. New York: Free Press. 264</ref> In fact, Boas supported Darwinian theory, although he did not assume that it automatically applied to cultural and historical phenomena (and indeed was a lifelong opponent of 19th-century theories of [[cultural evolution]], such as those of [[Lewis&nbsp; H.&nbsp; Morgan]] and [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]).<ref>Alexander Lesser, 1981 \"Franz Boas\" p. 25 in Sydel Silverman, ed. ''From Totems to Teachers'' New York: Columbia University Press</ref> The notion of evolution that the Boasians ridiculed and rejected was the then dominant belief in [[orthogenesis]]\u2014a determinate or [[teleology|teleological]] process of evolution in which change occurs progressively regardless of [[natural selection]]. Boas rejected the prevalent theories of [[social evolution]] developed by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], [[Lewis Henry Morgan]], and [[Herbert Spencer]] not because he rejected the notion of \"evolution\" per se, but because he rejected orthogenetic notions of evolution in favor of Darwinian evolution.\n\nThe difference between these prevailing theories of cultural evolution and Darwinian theory cannot be overstated: the orthogeneticists argued that all societies progress through the same stages in the same sequence. Thus, although the [[Inuit]] with whom Boas worked at [[Baffin Island]], and the [[German people|Germans]] with whom he studied as a graduate student, were contemporaries of one another, evolutionists argued that the Inuit were at an earlier stage in their evolution, and Germans at a later stage. This echoed a popular misreading of Darwin that suggested that human beings are descended from [[chimpanzee]]s. In fact, Darwin argued that chimpanzees and humans are equally evolved. What characterizes Darwinian theory is its attention to the ''processes'' by which one species transforms into another; \"adaptation\" as a key principle in explaining the relationship between a species and its environment; and \"natural selection\" as a mechanism of change. In contrast, Morgan, Spencer, and Tylor had little to say about the process and mechanics of change.\n\nFurthermore, Darwin built up his theory through a careful examination of considerable empirical data. Boasian research revealed that virtually every claim made by cultural evolutionists was contradicted by the data, or reflected a profound misinterpretation of the data. As Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]] remarked, \"Contrary to some misleading statements on the subject, there have been no responsible opponents of evolution as 'scientifically proved', though there has been determined hostility to an evolutionary metaphysics that falsifies the established facts\".\n\nIn an unpublished lecture, Boas characterized his debt to Darwin thus:\n\n<blockquote>Although the idea does not appear quite definitely expressed in Darwin's discussion of the development of mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.</blockquote>\n\nThus, Boas suggested that what appear to be patterns or structures in a culture were not a product of conscious design, but rather the outcome of diverse mechanisms that produce cultural variation (such as diffusion and independent invention), shaped by the social environment in which people live and act. Boas concluded his lecture by acknowledging the importance of Darwin's work:\n\n{{quote|I hope I may have succeeded in presenting to you, however imperfectly, the currents of thought due to the work of the immortal Darwin which have helped to make anthropology what it is at the present time.|Boas, 1909 lecture; see Lewis 2001b.}}\n\n==Early career: museum studies==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}\nIn the late 19th century anthropology in the United States was dominated by the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], directed by [[John Wesley Powell]], a geologist who favored [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]'s theory of [[cultural evolution]]. The BAE was housed at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, and the Smithsonian's curator for ethnology, [[Otis&nbsp; T.&nbsp; Mason]], shared Powell's commitment to cultural evolution. (The Peabody Museum at [[Harvard University]] was an important, though lesser, center of anthropological research).\n[[File:Franz Boas - posing for figure in USNM exhibit entitled - Hamats'a coming out of secret room - 1895 or before.jpg|thumb|left|\"Franz Boas posing for figure in US Natural History Museum exhibit entitled \"Hamats'a coming out of secret room\" 1895 or before. Courtesy of National Anthropology Archives. ([[Kwakiutl]] culture)]]\nIt was while working on museum collections and exhibitions that Boas formulated his basic approach to culture, which led him to break with museums and seek to establish anthropology as an academic discipline.\n\nDuring this period Boas made five more trips to the Pacific Northwest. His continuing field research led him to think of culture as a local context for human action. His emphasis on local context and history led him to oppose the dominant model at the time, [[cultural evolution]].\n\nBoas initially broke with evolutionary theory over the issue of kinship. [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] had argued that all human societies move from an initial form of [[matrilineal]] organization to [[patrilineal]] organization. First Nations groups on the northern coast of British Columbia, like the [[Tsimshian]], and [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], were organized into matrilineal clans. First Nations on the southern coast, like the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] and the [[Coast Salish peoples|Salish]], however, were organized into patrilineal groups. Boas focused on the [[Kwakiutl]], who lived between the two clusters. The Kwakiutl seemed to have a mix of features. Prior to marriage, a man would assume his wife's father's name and crest. His children took on these names and crests as well, although his sons would lose them when they got married. Names and crests thus stayed in the mother's line. At first, Boas\u2014like Morgan before him\u2014suggested that the Kwakiutl had been matrilineal like their neighbors to the north, but that they were beginning to evolve patrilineal groups. In 1897, however, he repudiated himself, and argued that the Kwakiutl were changing from a prior patrilineal organization to a matrilineal one, as they learned about matrilineal principles from their northern neighbors.\n\nBoas's rejection of Morgan's theories led him, in an 1887 article, to challenge Mason's principles of museum display. At stake, however, were more basic issues of causality and classification. The evolutionary approach to material culture led museum curators to organize objects on display according to function or level of technological development. Curators assumed that changes in the forms of artifacts reflect some natural process of progressive evolution. Boas, however, felt that the form an artifact took reflected the circumstances under which it was produced and used. Arguing that \"[t]hough like causes have like effects like effects have not like causes\", Boas realized that even artifacts that were similar in form might have developed in very different contexts, for different reasons. Mason's museum displays, organized along evolutionary lines, mistakenly juxtapose like effects; those organized along contextual lines would reveal like causes.\n\n===Minik Wallace===\nIn his capacity as Assistant Curator at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Franz Boas requested that Arctic explorer [[Robert E. Peary]] bring one Inuk from Greenland to New York. Peary obliged and brought six Inuit to New York in 1897 who lived in the basement of the American Museum of Natural History. Four of them died from tuberculosis within a year of arriving in New York, with the exception of one young boy, [[Minik Wallace]]. Boas staged a funeral for the father of the boy, and instead of resting the remains in peace, Boas had the remains dissected and placed in the museum. Later Minik Wallace realized that his father's bones were kept at the museum and requested their return. Boas then no longer worked at the museum, but the museum did not want to return the bones. Minik eventually was able to return to Greenland, but Boas did not help him or pay any attention to the plight of the Inuit whom he had brought to New York. Boas has been widely critiqued for his role in bringing Minik and the five other Inuit to New York, and his disinterest in them once they had served their purpose at the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/15/books/eskimo-boy-injustice-old-new-york-campaigning-writer-indicts-explorer-museum.html|title=An Eskimo Boy And Injustice In Old New York; A Campaigning Writer Indicts An Explorer and a Museum|first=Dinitia|last=Smith|date=15 March 2000|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/minik/program/pt.html|title=American Experience .

However, the various anthropologists teaching at Columbia had been assigned to different departments. When Boas left the Museum of Natural History, he negotiated with Columbia University to consolidate the various professors into one department, of which Boas would take charge. Boas's program at Columbia became the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program in [[anthropology]] in America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}<ref>(The first American Ph.D. in anthropology was actually granted from [[Clark University]], though still under the leadership of Boas.)\nMoore, Jerry D. (2009). \"Franz Boas: Culture in Context\". Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists. Walnut Creek, California: Altamira. pp. 33.</ref>\n\nDuring this time Boas played a key role in organizing the American Anthropological Association&nbsp;(AAA) as an umbrella organization for the emerging field. Boas originally wanted the AAA to be limited to professional anthropologists, but W.&nbsp; J.&nbsp; McGee (another geologist who had joined the BAE under Powell's leadership) argued that the organization should have an open membership. McGee's position prevailed and he was elected the organization's first president in 1902; Boas was elected a vice-president, along with Putnam, Powell, and Holmes.\n\nAt both Columbia and the AAA, Boas encouraged the \"four-field\" concept of anthropology; he personally contributed to [[physical anthropology]], [[linguistics]], [[archaeology]], as well as [[cultural anthropology]]. His work in these fields was pioneering: in physical anthropology he led scholars away from static taxonomical classifications of race, to an emphasis on human biology and evolution; in linguistics he broke through the limitations of classic [[philology]] and established some of the central problems in modern linguistics and cognitive anthropology; in cultural anthropology he (along with Polish-English anthropologist [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]]) established the contextualist approach to culture, cultural relativism, and the [[participant observation]] method of fieldwork.\n\nThe four-field approach understood not merely as bringing together different kinds of anthropologists into one department, but as reconceiving anthropology through the integration of different objects of anthropological research into one overarching object, was one of Boas's fundamental contributions to the discipline, and came to characterize American anthropology against that of\n[[England]], [[France]], or [[Germany]]. This approach defines as its object the human species as a totality. This focus did not lead Boas to seek to reduce all forms of humanity and human activity to some lowest common denominator; rather, he understood the essence of the human species to be the tremendous variation in human form and activity (an approach that parallels Charles Darwin's approach to species in general).\n\nIn his 1907 essay, \"Anthropology\", Boas identified two basic questions for anthropologists: \"Why are the tribes and nations of the world different, and how have the present differences developed?\" Amplifying these questions, he explained the object of anthropological study thus:\n\n<blockquote>We do not discuss the anatomical, physiological, and mental characteristics of a man considered as an individual; but we are interested in the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. It is our task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.</blockquote>\n\nThese questions signal a marked break from then-current ideas about human diversity, which assumed that some people have a history, evident in a historical (or written) record, while other people, lacking writing, also lack history. For some, this distinction between two different kinds of societies explained the difference between history, sociology, economics and other disciplines that focus on people with writing, and anthropology, which was supposed to focus on people without writing. Boas rejected this distinction between kinds of societies, and this division of labor in the academy. He understood all societies to have a history, and all societies to be proper objects of the anthropological society. In order to approach literate and non-literate societies the same way, he emphasized the importance of studying human history through the analysis of other things besides written texts. Thus, in his 1904 article, \"The History of Anthropology\", Boas wrote that\n\n<blockquote>The historical development of the work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain of knowledge that heretofore has not been treated by any other science. It is the biological history of mankind in all its varieties; linguistics applied to people without written languages; the ethnology of people without historical records; and prehistoric archeology.</blockquote>\n\nHistorians and social theorists in the 18th and 19th centuries had speculated as to the causes of this differentiation, but Boas dismissed these theories, especially the dominant theories of [[social evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]] as speculative. He endeavored to establish a discipline that would base its claims on a rigorous empirical study.\n\nOne of Boas's most important books, ''[[The Mind of Primitive Man]]'' (1911), integrated his theories concerning the history and development of cultures and established a program that would dominate American anthropology for the next fifteen years. In this study, he established that in any given population, biology, language, material, and symbolic culture, are autonomous; that each is an equally important dimension of human nature, but that no one of these dimensions is reducible to another. In other words, he established that culture does not depend on any independent variables. He emphasized that the biological, linguistic, and cultural traits of any group of people are the product of historical developments involving both cultural and non-cultural forces. He established that cultural plurality is a fundamental feature of humankind and that the specific cultural environment structures much individual behavior.\n\nBoas also presented himself as a role model for the citizen-scientist, who understand that even were the truth pursued as its own end, all knowledge has moral consequences. ''The Mind of Primitive Man'' ends with an appeal to [[humanism]]:\n\n<blockquote>I hope the discussions outlined in these pages have shown that the data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if we are only willing to give them a fair opportunity.</blockquote>\n\n===Physical anthropology===\nBoas's work in [[physical anthropology]] brought together his interest in Darwinian evolution with his interest in migration as a cause of change. His most important research in this field was his study of changes in the body from among children of immigrants in New York. Other researchers had already noted differences in height, cranial measurements, and other physical features between Americans and people from different parts of Europe. Many used these differences to argue that there is an innate biological difference between races. Boas's primary interest\u2014in symbolic and material culture and in language\u2014was the study of processes of change; he, therefore, set out to determine whether bodily forms are also subject to processes of change. Boas studied 17,821 people, divided into seven ethno-national groups. Boas found that average measures of the cranial size of immigrants were significantly different from members of these groups who were born in the United States. Moreover, he discovered that average measures of the cranial size of children born within ten years of their mothers' arrival were significantly different from those of children born more than ten years after their mothers' arrival. Boas did not deny that physical features such as height or cranial size were inherited; he did, however, argue that the environment has an influence on these features, which is expressed through change over time. This work was central to his influential argument that differences between races were not immutable.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = John S. | year = 1989 | title = Franz Boas's Physical Anthropology: The Critique of Racial Formalism Revisited | url = | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 79\u201384 | doi=10.1086/203716}}</ref><ref name=\"Jackson2005p148\">{{Cite book |title=Science for Segregation: Race, Law, and the Case against Brown v.

They argue that Sparks and Jantz misrepresented Boas's claims and that Sparks's and Jantz's data actually support Boas. For example, they point out that Sparks and Jantz look at changes in cranial size in relation to how long an individual has been in the United States in order to test the influence of the environment. Boas, however, looked at changes in cranial size in relation to how long the mother had been in the United States. They argue that Boas's method is more useful because the prenatal environment is a crucial developmental factor.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040421082034/http://www.anthro.fsu.edu/people/faculty/CG_pubs/gravlee03b.pdf ]</ref>\n\nA further publication by Jantz based on Gravlee et al. claims that Boas had [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] two groups of immigrants (Sicilians and Hebrews) which had varied most towards the same mean, and discarded other groups which had varied in the opposite direction.

In 1888, he declared that \"the development of ethnology is largely due to the general recognition of the principle of biological evolution\"; since Boas's times, physical anthropologists have established that the human capacity for culture is a product of human evolution. In fact, Boas's research on changes in body form played an important role in the rise of Darwinian theory.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Boas was trained at a time when biologists had no understanding of genetics; [[Mendelian genetics]] became widely known only after 1900. Prior to that time biologists relied on the measurement of physical traits as empirical data for any theory of evolution. Boas's biometric studies, however, led him to question the use of this method and kind of data. In a speech to anthropologists in Berlin in 1912, Boas argued that at best such statistics could only raise biological questions, and not answer them. It was in this context that anthropologists began turning to genetics as a basis for any understanding of biological variation.\n\n===Linguistics===\nBoas also contributed greatly to the foundation of linguistics as a science in the United States. He published many descriptive studies of Native American languages, and wrote on theoretical difficulties in classifying languages, and laid out a research program for studying the relations between language and culture which his students such as [[Edward Sapir]], [[Paul Rivet]], and [[Alfred Kroeber]] followed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jakobson | first1 = Roman | last2 = Boas | first2 = Franz | year = 1944 | title = Franz Boas' Approach to Language | url = | journal = International Journal of American Linguistics | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 188\u2013195 | doi=10.1086/463841}}</ref><ref>Boas' view of grammatical meaning.

It is a response to a paper presented in 1888 by [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]], at the time a professor of American linguistics and archeology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Brinton observed that in the spoken languages of many Native Americans, certain sounds regularly alternated. This is clearly not a function of individual accents; Brinton was not suggesting that some individuals pronounced certain words differently from others. He was arguing that there were many words that, even when repeated by the same speaker, varied considerably in their vocalization. Using [[evolutionary theory]], Brinton argued that this pervasive inconsistency was a sign of linguistic inferiority, and evidence that Native Americans were at a low stage in their evolution.\n\nBoas was familiar with what Brinton was talking about; he had experienced something similar during his research in Baffin Island and in the Pacific Northwest. Nevertheless, he argued that \"alternating sounds\" is not at all a feature of Native American languages\u2014indeed, he argued, they do not really exist. Rather than take alternating sounds as objective proof of different stages in cultural evolution, Boas considered them in terms of his longstanding interest in the subjective perception of objective physical phenomena. He also considered his earlier critique of evolutionary museum displays. There, he pointed out that two things (artifacts of material culture) that appear to be similar may, in fact, be quite different. In this article, he raises the possibility that two things (sounds) that appear to be different may, in fact, be the same.\n\nIn short, he shifted attention to the ''perception'' of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes that he is not concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit\u2014the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive [[linguistics]]: when studying a new language, how are we to note the [[pronunciation]] of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between [[phonemics]] and [[phonetics]].) People may pronounce a word in a variety of ways and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not \"that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality\" (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds \"are classified according to their similarity\" (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word \"green\" can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for \"[[green]]\".<ref>Berlin, Brent and Paul Kay 1969 ''Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution''</ref> In such cases, people might classify what we would call \"green\" as either \"yellow\" or \"blue\". This is not an example of color-blindness\u2014people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.\n\nBoas applied these principles to his studies of [[Inuit languages]]. Researchers have reported a variety of spellings for a given word. In the past, researchers have interpreted this data in a number of ways\u2014it could indicate local variations in the pronunciation of a word, or it could indicate different [[dialect]]s. Boas argues an alternative explanation: that the difference is not in how Inuit pronounce the word, but rather in how English-speaking scholars perceive the pronunciation of the word. It is not that English speakers are physically incapable of perceiving the sound in question; rather, the phonetic system of English cannot accommodate the perceived sound.\n\nAlthough Boas was making a very specific contribution to the methods of descriptive linguistics, his ultimate point is far reaching: observer bias need not be personal, it can be cultural. In other words, the perceptual categories of Western researchers may systematically cause a Westerner to misperceive or to fail to perceive entirely a meaningful element in another culture. As in his critique of Otis Mason's museum displays, Boas demonstrated that what appeared to be evidence of cultural evolution was really the consequence of unscientific methods and a reflection of Westerners' beliefs about their own cultural superiority. This point provides the methodological foundation for Boas's [[cultural relativism]]: elements of a culture are meaningful in that culture's terms, even if they may be meaningless (or take on a radically different meaning) in another culture.\n\n===Cultural anthropology===\n{{main|Boasian anthropology}}\n[[File: Boas Kwakiutl mask drawing - cropped.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a [[Kwakiutl]] mask from Boas's ''The Social Organization and the Secret Societies of the Kwakiutl Indians'' (1897). Wooden skulls hang from below the mask, which represents one of the cannibal bird helpers of Bakbakwalinooksiwey.]]\n\nThe essence of Boas's approach to ethnography is found in his early essay on \"The Study of Geography\". There he argued for an approach that\n\n{{quote|... considers every phenomenon as worthy of being studied for its own sake. Its mere existence entitles it to a full share of our attention, and the knowledge of its existence and evolution in space and time fully satisfies the student.\n\nWhen Boas's student [[Ruth Benedict]] gave her presidential address to the American Anthropological Association in 1947, she reminded anthropologists of the importance of this [[idiographic]] stance by quoting literary critic A.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Bradley: \"We watch 'what is', seeing that so it happened and must have happened\".}}\n\nThis orientation led Boas to promote a cultural anthropology characterized by a strong commitment to\n* [[Empiricism]] (with a resulting skepticism of attempts to formulate \"scientific laws\" of culture)\n* A notion of [[culture]] as fluid and dynamic\n* [[ethnography|Ethnographic]] fieldwork, in which the anthropologist resides for an extended period among the people being researched, conducts research in the native language, and collaborates with native researchers, as a method of collecting data, and\n* [[Cultural relativism]] as a methodological tool while conducting fieldwork, and as a heuristic tool while analyzing data.\n\nBoas argued that in order to understand \"what is\"\u2014in cultural anthropology, the specific cultural traits (behaviors, beliefs, and symbols)\u2014one had to examine them in their local context. He also understood that as people migrate from one place to another, and as the cultural context changes over time, the elements of a culture, and their meanings, will change, which led him to emphasize the importance of local histories for an analysis of cultures.\n\nAlthough other anthropologists at the time, such as [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] and [[Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown]] focused on the study of societies, which they understood to be clearly bounded, Boas's attention to history, which reveals the extent to which traits diffuse from one place to another, led him to view cultural boundaries as multiple and overlapping, and as highly permeable. Thus, Boas's student [[Robert Lowie]] once described culture as a thing of \"shreds and patches\". Boas and his students understood that as people try to make sense of their world they seek to integrate its disparate elements, with the result that different cultures could be characterized as having different configurations or patterns. But Boasians also understood that such integration was always in tensions with diffusion, and any appearance of a stable configuration is contingent (see Bashkow 2004: 445).\n\nDuring Boas's lifetime, as today, many Westerners saw a fundamental difference between modern societies, which are characterized by dynamism and individualism, and traditional societies which are stable and homogeneous. Boas's empirical field research, however, led him to argue against this comparison. For example, his 1903 essay, \"Decorative Designs of Alaskan Needlecases: A History of Conventional Designs, Based on Materials in a U.S.&nbsp; Museum\", provides another example of how Boas made broad theoretical claims based on a detailed analysis of empirical data. After establishing formal similarities among the needlecases, Boas shows how certain formal features provide a vocabulary out of which individual artisans could create variations in design. Thus, his emphasis on culture as a context for meaningful action made him sensitive to individual variation within a society ([[William Henry Holmes]] suggested a similar point in an 1886 paper, \"Origin and development of form and ornament in ceramic art\", although unlike Boas he did not develop the ethnographic and theoretical implications).\n\nIn a programmatic essay in 1920, \"The Methods of Ethnology\", Boas argued that instead of \"the systematic enumeration of standardized beliefs and customs of a tribe\", anthropology needs to document \"the way in which the individual reacts to his whole social environment, and to the difference of opinion and of mode of action that occur in primitive society and which are the causes of far-reaching changes\". Boas argued that attention to individual agency reveals that \"the activities of the individual are determined to a great extent by his social environment, but in turn, his own activities influence the society in which he lives and may bring about modifications in a form\". Consequently, Boas thought of culture as fundamentally dynamic: \"As soon as these methods are applied, primitive society loses the appearance of absolute stability ... All cultural forms rather appear in a constant state of flux ...\" (see Lewis 2001b)\n\nHaving argued against the relevance of the distinction between literate and non-literate societies as a way of defining anthropology's object of study, Boas argued that non-literate and literate societies should be analyzed in the same way. Nineteenth-century historians had been applying the techniques of [[philology]] to reconstruct the histories of, and relationships between, literate societies. In order to apply these methods to non-literate societies, Boas argued that the task of fieldworkers is to produce and collect texts in non-literate societies. This took the form not only of compiling lexicons and grammars of the local language, but of recording myths, folktales, beliefs about social relationships and institutions, and even recipes for local cuisine. In order to do this, Boas relied heavily on the collaboration of literate native ethnographers (among the Kwakiutl, most often [[George Hunt (ethnologist)|George Hunt]]), and he urged his students to consider such people valuable partners, inferior in their standing in Western society, but superior in their understanding of their own culture. (see Bunzl 2004: 438\u2013439)\n\nUsing these methods, Boas published another article in 1920, in which he revisited his earlier research on Kwakiutl kinship. In the late 1890s, Boas had tried to reconstruct transformation in the organization of Kwakiutl clans, by comparing them to the organization of clans in other societies neighboring the Kwakiutl to the north and south. Now, however, he argued against translating the Kwakiutl principle of kin groups into an English word. Instead of trying to fit the Kwakiutl into some larger model, he tried to understand their beliefs and practices in their own terms. For example, whereas he had earlier translated the Kwakiutl word ''numaym'' as \"clan\", he now argued that the word is best understood as referring to a bundle of privileges, for which there is no English word. Men secured claims to these privileges through their parents or wives, and there were a variety of ways these privileges could be acquired, used, and transmitted from one generation to the next. As in his work on alternating sounds, Boas had come to realize that different ethnological interpretations of Kwakiutl kinship were the result of the limitations of Western categories. As in his work on Alaskan needlecases, he now saw variation among Kwakiutl practices as the result of the play between social norms and individual creativity.\n\nBefore his death in 1942, he appointed [[Helen Codere]] to edit and publish his manuscripts about the culture of the Kwakiutl people.\n\n==Franz Boas and folklore==\n\nFranz Boas was an immensely influential figure throughout the development of [[folklore]] as a discipline. At first glance, it might seem that his only concern was for the discipline of anthropology\u2014after all, he fought for most of his life to keep folklore as a part of anthropology. Yet Boas was motivated by his desire to see both anthropology and folklore become more professional and well-respected. Boas was afraid that if folklore was allowed to become its own discipline the standards for folklore scholarship would be lowered. This, combined with the scholarships of \"amateurs\", would lead folklore to be completely discredited, Boas believed.\n\nIn order to further professionalize folklore, Boas introduced the strict scientific methods which he learned in college to the discipline. Boas championed the use of exhaustive research, fieldwork, and strict scientific guidelines in folklore scholarship. Boas believed that a true theory could only be formed from thorough research and that even once you had a theory it should be treated as a \"work in progress\" unless it could be proved beyond doubt. This rigid scientific methodology was eventually accepted as one of the major tenets of folklore scholarship, and Boas's methods remain in use even today. Boas also nurtured many budding folklorists during his time as a professor, and some of his students are counted among the most notable minds in folklore scholarship.\n\nBoas was passionate about the collection of folklore and believed that the similarity of folktales amongst different folk groups was due to dissemination. Boas strove to prove this theory, and his efforts produced a method for breaking a folktale into parts and then analyzing these parts. His creation of \"catch-words\" allowed for categorization of these parts, and the ability to analyze them in relation to other similar tales. Boas also fought to prove that not all cultures progressed along the same path, and that non-European cultures, in particular, were not primitive, but different.\n\nBoas remained active in the development and scholarship of folklore throughout his life. He became the editor of the ''Journal of American Folklore'' in 1908, regularly wrote and published articles on folklore (often in the ''Journal of American Folklore''), and helped to elect Louise Pound as president of the American Folklore Society in 1925.\n\n==Scientist as activist==\n\n{{quote|There are two things to which I am devoted: absolute academic and spiritual freedom, and the subordination of the state to the interests of the individual; expressed in other forms, the furthering of conditions in which the individual can develop to the best of his ability\u2014as far as it is possible with a full understanding of the fetters imposed upon us by tradition; and the fight against all forms of power policy of states or private organizations.

Perhaps because Boas, like other early anthropologists, was originally trained in the natural sciences, he and his students never expressed such anxiety. Moreover, he did not believe that detachment, objectivity, and quantifiability was required to make anthropology scientific. Since the object of study of anthropologists is different from the object of study of physicists, he assumed that anthropologists would have to employ different methods and different criteria for evaluating their research. Thus, Boas used statistical studies to demonstrate the extent to which variation in data is context-dependent, and argued that the context-dependent nature of human variation rendered many abstractions and generalizations that had been passing as scientific understandings of humankind (especially theories of social evolution popular at the time) in fact unscientific. His understanding of ethnographic fieldwork began with the fact that the objects of ethnographic study (e.g.,&nbsp; the [[Inuit]] of [[Baffin Island]]) were not just objects, but subjects, and his research called attention to their creativity and agency. More importantly, he viewed the Inuit as his teachers, thus reversing the typical hierarchical relationship between scientist and object of study.\n\nThis emphasis on the relationship between anthropologists and those they study\u2014the point that, while astronomers and stars; chemists and elements; botanists and plants are fundamentally different, anthropologists and those they study are equally human\u2014implied that anthropologists themselves could be objects of anthropological study. Although Boas did not pursue this reversal systematically, his article on alternating sounds illustrates his awareness that scientists should not be confident about their objectivity, because they too see the world through the prism of their culture.\n\nThis emphasis also led Boas to conclude that anthropologists have an obligation to speak out on social issues. Boas was especially concerned with [[racism|racial inequality]], which his research had indicated is not biological in origin, but rather social. Boas is credited as the first scientist to publish the idea that all people\u2014including white and African-Americans\u2014are equal.<ref name=levi-strauss/> He often emphasized his abhorrence of racism, and used his work to show that there was no scientific basis for such a bias. An early example of this concern is evident in his 1906 commencement address to [[Atlanta University]], at the invitation of [[W.&nbsp; E.&nbsp; B. Du&nbsp;Bois]]. Boas began by remarking that \"If you did accept the view that the present weakness of the American Negro, his uncontrollable emotions, his lack of energy, are racially inherent, your work would still be noble one\". He then went on, however, to argue against this view. To the claim that European and Asian civilizations are, at the time, more advanced than African societies, Boas objected that against the total history of humankind, the past two thousand years is but a brief span. Moreover, although the technological advances of our early ancestors (such as taming fire and inventing stone tools) might seem insignificant when compared to the invention of the steam engine or control over electricity, we should consider that they might actually be even greater accomplishments. Boas then went on to catalogue advances in Africa, such as smelting iron, cultivating millet, and domesticating chickens and cattle, that occurred in Africa well before they spread to Europe and Asia (evidence now suggests that chickens were first domesticated in Asia; the original domestication of [[Bos|cattle]] is under debate). He then described the activities of African kings, diplomats, merchants, and artists as evidence of cultural achievement. From this, he concluded, any social inferiority of Negroes in the United States cannot be explained by their African origins:\n\n<blockquote>If therefore, it is claimed that your race is doomed to economic inferiority, you may confidently look to the home of your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You may say that you go to work with bright hopes and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.</blockquote>\n\nBoas proceeds to discuss the arguments for the inferiority of the \"Negro race\", and calls attention to the fact that they were brought to the Americas through force. For Boas, this is just one example of the many times conquest or colonialism has brought different peoples into an unequal relation, and he mentions \"the conquest of England by the Normans, the Teutonic invasion of Italy, [and] the Manchu conquest of China\" as resulting in similar conditions. But the best example, for Boas, of this phenomenon is that of the Jews in Europe:\n\n<blockquote>Even now there lingers in the consciousness of the old, sharper divisions which the ages had not been able to efface, and which is strong enough to find\u2014not only here and there\u2014expression as antipathy to the Jewish type. In France, that let down the barriers more than a hundred years ago, the feeling of antipathy is still strong enough to sustain an anti-Jewish political party.</blockquote>\n\nBoas's closing advice is that [[African-Americans]] should not look to whites for approval or encouragement because people in power usually take a very long time to learn to sympathize with people out of power. \"Remember that in every single case in history the process of adaptation has been one of exceeding slowness. Do not look for the impossible, but do not let your path deviate from the quiet and steadfast insistence on full opportunities for your powers.\"\n\nDespite Boas's caveat about the intractability of white prejudice, he also considered it the scientist's responsibility to argue against white myths of racial purity and racial superiority and to use the evidence of his research to fight racism.\n\nBoas was also critical of one nation imposing its power over others. In 1916, Boas wrote a letter to ''[[The New York Times]]'' which was published under the headline, \"Why German-Americans Blame America\". Although Boas did begin the letter by protesting bitter attacks against German-Americans at the time of the war in Europe, most of his letter was a critique of American nationalism. \"In my youth, I had been taught in school and at home not only to love the good of my own country, but also to seek to understand and to respect the individualities of other nations. For this reason, one-sided nationalism, that is so often found nowadays, is to be unendurable.\" He writes of his love for American ideals of freedom, and of his growing discomfort with American beliefs about its own superiority over others.\n\n<blockquote>I have always been of the opinion that we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in utilizing the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideas may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to what we like to call \"our free institutions.\" Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishes is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Boas felt that scientists have a responsibility to speak out on social and political problems, he was appalled that they might involve themselves in disingenuous and deceitful ways. Thus, in 1919, when he discovered that four anthropologists, in the course of their research in other countries, were serving as spies for the American government, he wrote an angry letter to ''[[The Nation]]''. It is perhaps in this letter that he most clearly expresses his understanding of his commitment to science:\n\n<blockquote>A soldier whose business is murder as a fine art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a businessman whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law\u2014such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not come up to the standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we have to put up with these because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Boas did not name the spies in question, he was referring to a group led by [[Sylvanus G. Morley]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Browman | first1 = David L. | year = 2011 | title = Spying by American Archaeologists in World War I | url = | journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Archaeology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 10\u201317 | doi = 10.5334/bha.2123 }}</ref> who was affiliated with Harvard University's Peabody Museum. While conducting research in [[Mexico]], Morley and his colleagues looked for evidence of German submarine bases, and collected intelligence on Mexican political figures and [[German immigrants in Mexico]].\n\nBoas's stance against spying took place in the context of his struggle to establish a new model for academic anthropology at Columbia University. Previously, American anthropology was based at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington and the Peabody Museum at Harvard, and these anthropologists competed with Boas's students for control over the American Anthropological Association (and its flagship publication ''[[American Anthropologist]]''). When the [[National Academy of Sciences]] established the National Research Council in 1916 as a means by which scientists could assist the United States government to prepare for entry into the war in Europe, competition between the two groups intensified. Boas's rival, W.&nbsp; H. Holmes (who had gotten the job of Director at the [[Field Museum]] for which Boas had been passed over 26 years earlier), was appointed to head the NRC; Morley was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Holmes.\n\nWhen Boas's letter was published, Holmes wrote to a friend complaining about \"the Prussian control of anthropology in this country\" and the need to end Boas's \"Hun regime\".<ref>[[Adam Kuper]], 1988 ''The Invention of Primitive Society'' p. 149. London: Routledge</ref> Opinion{{whose?|date=June 2016}} was influenced by anti-German and probably also by anti-Jewish sentiment.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The Anthropological Society of Washington passed a resolution condemning Boas's letter for unjustly criticizing President Wilson; attacking the principles of American democracy; and endangering anthropologists abroad, who would now be suspected of being spies (a charge that was especially insulting, given that his concerns about this very issue were what had prompted Boas to write his letter in the first place). This resolution was passed on to the [[American Anthropological Association]]&nbsp;(AAA) and the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]. Members of the American Anthropological Association (among whom Boas was a founding member in 1902), meeting at the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at Harvard (with which Morley, Lothrop, and Spinden were affiliated), voted by 20 to 10 to censure Boas. As a result, Boas resigned as the AAA's representative to the NRC, although he remained an active member of the AAA. The AAA's censure of Boas was not rescinded until 2005.\n\nBoas continued to speak out against racism and for intellectual freedom. When the [[Naziism|Nazi Party]] in Germany denounced \"[[Deutsche Physik|Jewish Science]]\" (which included not only Boasian Anthropology but [[Freudian psychoanalysis]] and [[Einsteinian]] physics), Boas responded with a public statement signed by over 8,000 other scientists, declaring that there is only one science, to which race and religion are irrelevant. After World War&nbsp; I, Boas created the Emergency Society for German and Austrian Science. This organization was originally dedicated to fostering friendly relations between American and German and Austrian scientists and for providing research funding to German scientists who had been adversely affected by the war,<ref>[[Robert F. Barsky]]. 2011. ''Zellig Harris: From American Linguistics to Socialist Zionism''. [[MIT Press]], Apr 15, 2011, p. 196</ref> and to help scientists who had been interned. With the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], Boas assisted German scientists in fleeing the Nazi regime. Boas helped these scientists not only to escape but to secure positions once they arrived.<ref>Lewis 2001:458-59</ref> Additionally, Boas addressed an open letter to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in protest against Hitlerism. He also wrote an article in [[The American Mercury]] arguing that there were no differences between Aryans and non-Aryans and the German government should not base its policies on such a false premise.<ref>Boas, Franz, \"Aryans and Non-Aryans,\" The American Mercury, June 1934, at p. 219.</ref>\n\nBoas, and his students such as [[Melville J. Herskovits]], opposed the racist pseudoscience developed at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] under its director [[Eugen Fischer]]: \"Melville J. Herskovits (one of Franz Boas's students) pointed out that the health problems and social prejudices encountered by these children ([[Rhineland Bastard]]s) and their parents explained what Germans viewed as racial inferiority was not due to racial heredity. This \"... provoked polemic invective against the latter [Boas] from Fischer. \"The views of Mr.&nbsp; Boas are in part quite ingenious, but in the field of heredity Mr.&nbsp;Boas is by no means competent\" even though \"a great number of research projects at the KWI-A which had picked up on Boas' studies about immigrants in New York had confirmed his findings\u2014including the study by Walter Dornfeldt about Eastern European Jews in Berlin. Fischer resorted to polemic simply because he had no arguments to counter the Boasians' critique.\"<ref>Hans-Walter Schmuhl, ''The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, 1927\u20131945'', Wallstein Verlag, G\u00f6ttingen, 2003, pp. 212\u2013213</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Lee D. | year = 2004 | title = Franz Boas out of the ivory tower | url = | journal = [[Anthropological Theory]] | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 29\u201351 | doi=10.1177/1463499604040846}}</ref><ref>\"Boasian Anthropology and the Critique of American Culture\".

Although by today's standards this is a very small number, at the time it was sufficient to establish Boas's Anthropology Department at Columbia as the preeminent anthropology program in the country. Moreover, many of Boas's students went on to establish anthropology programs at other major universities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Charles | last2 = Baumann | first2 = Richard | year = 1999 | title = The Foundation of All Future Researches\": Franz Boas.

He also trained [[William Jones (anthropologist)|William Jones]] (1904), one of the first Native American Indian anthropologists ([[Fox (Native American)|the Fox nation]]) who was killed while conducting research in the Philippines in 1909, and Albert B. Lewis (1907). Boas also trained a number of other students who were influential in the development of academic anthropology: [[Frank Speck]] (1908) who trained with Boas but received his PhD. from the University of Pennsylvania and immediately proceeded to found the anthropology department there; [[Edward Sapir]] (1909) and [[Fay-Cooper Cole]] (1914) who developed the anthropology program at the [[University of Chicago]]; [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]] (1910), who, with [[Elsie Clews Parsons]] (who received her doctorate in sociology from Columbia in 1899, but then studied ethnology with Boas), started the anthropology program at the [[New School for Social Research]]; [[Leslie Spier]] (1920) who started the anthropology program at the University of Washington together with his wife [[Erna Gunther]], also one of Boas's students, and [[Melville Herskovits]] (1923) who started the anthropology program at [[Northwestern University]]. He also trained [[John R. Swanton]] (who studied with Boas at Columbia for two years before receiving his doctorate from Harvard in 1900), [[Paul Radin]] (1911), [[Ruth Benedict]] (1923), [[Gladys Reichard]] (1925) who had begun teaching at [[Barnard College]] in 1921 and was later promoted to the rank of professor, [[Ruth Bunzel]] (1929), [[Alexander Lesser]] (1929), [[Margaret Mead]] (1929), and [[Gene Weltfish]] (who defended her dissertation in 1929, although she did not officially graduate until 1950 when Columbia reduced the expenses required to graduate), [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] (1934), [[Jules Henry]] (1935), [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]] (1938),and [[Ashley Montagu]] (1938).\n\nHis students at Columbia also included [[Mexico|Mexican]] anthropologist [[Manuel Gamio]], who earned his M.A. after studying with Boas from 1909 to 1911, and became the founding director of Mexico's Bureau of Anthropology in 1917; [[Clark Wissler]], who received his doctorate in [[psychology]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1901, but proceeded to study anthropology with Boas before turning to research Native Americans; [[Esther Schiff Goldfrank|Esther Schiff]], later Goldfrank, worked with Boas in the summers of 1920 to 1922 to conduct research among the [[Cochiti]] and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] [[Pueblo Indians]] in New Mexico; [[Gilberto Freyre]], who shaped the concept of \"racial democracy\" in Brazil;<ref>That Freyre was ever Boas's student is under contention. Boas was opposed to racism, as were students such as [[Ashley Montagu]], etc. It seems unlikely that the \"father\" of the modern racist theory of [[Lusotropicalism]] had ever worked closely with Boas. \"The invention of Freyre included his self-invention. For example, he too presented himself as if he had been a follower of Boas ever since his student days.\" See Peter Burke, Maria Lucia G. Pallares-Burke: \"Gilberto Freyre: social theory in the tropics\", Peter Lang, 2008, p. 19</ref> [[Viola Garfield]], who carried forth Boas's [[Tsimshian]] work; [[Frederica de Laguna]], who worked on the [[Inuit]] and the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]; and anthropologist, folklorist and novelist [[Zora Neale Hurston]], who graduated from [[Barnard College]], the women's college associated with Columbia, in 1928.\n\nBoas and his students were also an influence on [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]], who interacted with Boas and the Boasians during his stay in New York in the 1940s.<ref>Moore, Jerry D. (2004). Visions of Culture: An Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists. Rowman Altamira. p. 234</ref>\n\nSeveral of Boas's students went on to serve as editors of the American Anthropological Association's flagship journal, ''American Anthropologist'': John R. Swanton (1911, 1921\u20131923), Robert Lowie (1924\u20131933), Leslie Spier (1934\u20131938), and Melville Herskovits (1950\u20131952). Edward Sapir's student [[John Alden Mason]] was editor from 1945 to 1949, and Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie's student, [[Walter Goldschmidt]], was editor from 1956 to 1959.\n\nMost of Boas's students shared his concern for careful, historical reconstruction, and his antipathy towards speculative, evolutionary models. Moreover, Boas encouraged his students, by example, to criticize themselves as much as others. For example, Boas originally defended the [[cephalic index]] (systematic variations in head form) as a method for describing hereditary traits, but came to reject his earlier research after further study; he similarly came to criticize his own early work in Kwakiutl (Pacific Northwest) language and mythology.\n\nEncouraged by this drive to self-criticism, as well as the Boasian commitment to learn from one's informants and to let the findings of one's research shape one's agenda, Boas's students quickly diverged from his own research agenda. Several of his students soon attempted to develop theories of the grand sort that Boas typically rejected. Kroeber called his colleagues' attention to [[Sigmund Freud]] and the potential of a union between cultural anthropology and [[psychoanalysis]]. [[Ruth Benedict]] developed theories of \"culture and personality\" and \"national cultures\", and Kroeber's student, [[Julian Steward]] developed theories of \"cultural ecology\" and \"multilineal evolution\".\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Boasian anthropology}}\nNevertheless, Boas has had an enduring influence on anthropology. Virtually all anthropologists today accept Boas's commitment to empiricism and his methodological cultural relativism. Moreover, virtually all cultural anthropologists today share Boas's commitment to field research involving extended residence, learning the local language, and developing social relationships with informants. Finally, anthropologists continue to honor his critique of racial ideologies. In his 1963 book, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'', Thomas Gossett wrote that \"It is possible that Boas did more to combat race prejudice than any other person in history.\"\n\n==Leadership roles and honors==\n* 1887\u2014Accepted a position as Assistant Editor of Science in New York.\n* 1889\u2014Appointed as the head of a newly created department of anthropology.

There he received a liberal education at the Lyceum and [[Karl Joseph Hieronymus Windischmann]] drew his attention to the languages and literature of the East. (Windischmann, along with [[Georg Friedrich Creuzer]], [[Johann Joseph von G\u00f6rres]], and the brothers [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]], expressed great enthusiasm for Indian wisdom and philosophy.) Moreover Karl Wilhelm Friedrich von Schlegel's book, ''\u00dcber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier'' (''On the Speech and Wisdom of the Indians'', Heidelberg, 1808), had just begun to exert a powerful influence on the minds of German philosophers and historians, and stimulated Bopp's interest in the sacred language of the [[Hindu]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=240}}\n\n==Career==\nIn 1812, he went to [[Paris]] at the expense of the Bavarian government, with a view to devoting himself vigorously to the study of [[Sanskrit]]. There he enjoyed the society of such eminent men as [[Antoine-L\u00e9onard de Ch\u00e9zy]] (his primary instructor), [[Silvestre de Sacy]], [[Louis Mathieu Langl\u00e8s]], and, above all [[Alexander Hamilton (linguist)|Alexander Hamilton]] (1762\u20131824), cousin of the American statesman, who had acquired an acquaintance with Sanskrit when in [[India]] and had brought out, along with Langl\u00e8s, a descriptive catalogue of the Sanskrit manuscripts of the Imperial Library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=240}}\n\nIn the library, Bopp had access not only to the rich collection of Sanskrit manuscripts (mostly brought from India by [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Pons]] in the early 18th century), but also to the Sanskrit books that had been issued from the [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and [[Serampore]] presses.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=240}} He spent five years of laborious study, almost living in the libraries of Paris and unmoved by the turmoils that agitated the world around him, including [[Napoleon]]'s escape, the [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] campaign and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]].{{sfn|Rines|1920|p=261}}\n\nThe first paper from his years of study in Paris appeared in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1816, under the title of ''\u00dcber das Conjugationssystem der Sanskritsprache in Vergleichung mit jenem der griechischen, lateinischen, persischen und germanischen Sprache (On the Conjugation System of Sanskrit in comparison with that of Greek, Latin, Persian and Germanic)'', to which Windischmann contributed a preface. In this first book, Bopp entered at once the path on which he would focus the philological researches of his whole subsequent life. His task was not to point out the similarity of Sanskrit with [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]] or [[German language|German]], for previous scholars had long established that, but he aimed to trace the postulated common origin of the languages' [[grammar|grammatical]] forms, of their [[inflection]]s from composition. This was something no predecessor had attempted. By a historical analysis of those forms, as applied to the verb, he furnished the first trustworthy materials for a history of the languages compared.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=240}}\n\nAfter a brief sojourn in Germany, Bopp travelled to London where he made the acquaintance of [[Sir Charles Wilkins]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]]. He also became friends with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], the [[Prussia]]n ambassador at the [[Court of St. James's]], to whom he taught Sanskrit. He brought out, in the ''Annals of Oriental Literature'' (London, 1820), an essay entitled \"Analytical Comparison of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin and Teutonic Languages\" in which he extended to all parts of grammar what he had done in his first book for the verb alone. He had previously published a critical edition, with a Latin translation and notes, of the story of Nala and Damayanti (London, 1819), the most beautiful episode of the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. Other episodes of the ''Mahabharata'', Indralok\u00e2gama, and three others (Berlin, 1824); ''Diluvium'', and three others (Berlin, 1829); a new edition of Nala (Berlin, 1832) followed in due course, all of which, with [[August Wilhelm von Schlegel]]'s edition of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (1823), proved excellent aids in initiating the early student into the reading of Sanskrit texts. On the publication, in Calcutta, of the whole ''Mahabharata'', Bopp discontinued editing Sanskrit texts and confined himself thenceforth exclusively to grammatical investigations.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=240}}\n\nAfter a short residence at [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]], Bopp gained, on the recommendation of Humboldt, appointment to the chair of Sanskrit and [[comparative grammar]] at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1821, which he occupied for the rest of his life. He also became a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Royal Prussian Academy]] the following year.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=240\u2013241}}\n\nIn 1827, he published his ''Ausf\u00fchrliches Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der Sanskritsprache'' (''Detailed System of the Sanskrit Language''), on which he had worked since 1821. Bopp started work on a new edition in Latin, for the following year, completed in 1832; a shorter grammar appeared in 1834. At the same time he compiled a ''Sanskrit and Latin Glossary'' (1830), in which, more especially in the second and third editions (1847 and 1868\u201371), he also took account of the cognate languages. His chief activity, however, centered on the elaboration of his ''Comparative Grammar'', which appeared in six parts at considerable intervals (Berlin, 1833, 1835, 1842, 1847, 1849, 1852), under the title ''Vergleichende Grammatik des Sanskrit, Zend, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Litthauischen, Altslawischen, Gotischen und Deutschen'' (''Comparative Grammar of Sanskrit, Zend [Avestan], Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavonic, Gothic and German'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}\n\nHow carefully Bopp matured this work emerges from the series of monographs printed in the ''Transactions of the Berlin Academy'' (1824\u20131831), which preceded it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}} They bear the general title ''Vergleichende Zergliederung des Sanskrits und der mit ihm verwandten Sprachen (Comparative Analysis of Sanskrit and its related Languages)''.{{sfn|Rines|1920|p=262}} Two other essays (on the ''Numerals'', 1835) followed the publication of the first part of the ''Comparative Grammar''. [[Proto-Slavic|Old Slavonian]] began to take its stand among the languages compared from the second part onwards. [[Edward Backhouse Eastwick|E. B. Eastwick]] translated the work into English in 1845. A second German edition, thoroughly revised (1856\u20131861), also covered Old [[Armenian language|Armenian]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}\n\nIn his ''Comparative Grammar'' Bopp set himself a threefold task:\n#to give a description of the original grammatical structure of the languages as deduced from their inter-comparison.\n#to trace their [[phonetic]] laws.\n#to investigate the origin of their grammatical forms.\n\nThe first and second points remained dependent upon the third. As Bopp based his research on the best available sources and incorporated every new item of information that came to light, his work continued to widen and deepen in the making, as can be witnessed from his monographs on the vowel system in the [[Teutonic languages]] (1836), on the [[Celtic language]]s (1839), on the [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]] (1853) and [[Albanian language]]s (''\u00dcber das Albanesische in seinen verwandtschaftlichen Beziehungen'', Vienna, 1854), on the [[stress (phonology)|accent]] in Sanskrit and Greek (1854), on the relationship of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] to the Indo-European languages (1840), and on the [[Caucasian language]]s (1846). In the last two, the impetus of his genius led him on a wrong track.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}} He is the first philologist to prove [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as a separate branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], an analysis that has never been challenged<ref>{{cite journal| publisher=Dielli| location=New York| language=Albanian| url=http://gazetadielli.com/histori-cfare-ka-ndodhur-me-22-tetor/| title=\nHistori: \u00c7far\u00eb ka ndodhur m\u00eb 22 tetor?|trans-title=History: what happened on 22 October?| first=Astrit| last=Lulushi|date=22 October 2013}}</ref> Bopp was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1855.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780\u20132010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics have charged Bopp with neglecting the study of the native Sanskrit grammars, but in those early days of Sanskrit studies, the great libraries of Europe did not hold the requisite materials; if they had, those materials would have demanded his full attention for years, and such grammars as those of [[Charles Wilkins]] and [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]], from which Bopp derived his grammatical knowledge, had all used native grammars as a basis. The further charge that Bopp, in his ''Comparative Grammar'', gave undue prominence to Sanskrit is disproved by his own words; for, as early as 1820, he gave it as his opinion that frequently, the cognate languages serve to elucidate grammatical forms lost in Sanskrit (''Annals of Or. Lit.'' i. 3), which he further developed in all his subsequent writings.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (11th edition of 1911) assesses Bopp and his work as follows:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}}\n\n{{quote|Bopp's researches, carried with wonderful penetration into the most minute and almost microscopical details of linguistic phenomena, have led to the opening up of a wide and distant view into the original seats, the closer or more distant affinity, and the tenets, practices and domestic usages of the ancient Indo-European nations, and the science of comparative grammar may truly be said to date from his earliest publication. In grateful recognition of that fact, on the fiftieth anniversary (May 16, 1866) of the date of Windischmann's preface to that work, a fund called Die Bopp-Stiftung, for the promotion of the study of Sanskrit and comparative grammar, was established at Berlin, to which liberal contributions were made by his numerous pupils and admirers in all parts of the globe. Bopp lived to see the results of his labours everywhere accepted, and his name justly celebrated. But he died, on the 23rd of October 1867, in poverty, though his genuine kindliness and unselfishness, his devotion to his family and friends, and his rare modesty, endeared him to all who knew him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=241}} }}\n\nEnglish scholar Russell Martineau, who had studied under Bopp, gave the following tribute:{{sfn|Rines|1920|p=261}}\n\n{{quote|Bopp must, more or less, directly or indirectly, be the teacher of all who at the present day study, not this language or that language, but language itself \u2014 study it either as a universal function of man, subjected, like his other mental or physical functions, to law and order, or else as an historical development, worked out by a never ceasing course of education from one form into another.<ref name=\"Rines 1920 p. 261 cites Martineau 1867.\">{{harvnb|Rines|1920|p=261}} cites {{harvnb|Martineau|1867}}</ref>\n}}\n\nMartineau also wrote: \n\n{{quote|\"Bopp's Sanskrit studies and Sanskrit publications are the solid foundations upon which his system of comparative grammar was erected, and without which that could not have been perfect. For that purpose, far more than a mere dictionary knowledge of Sanskrit was required. The resemblances which he detected between Sanskrit and the Western cognate tongues existed in the syntax, the combination of words in the sentence and the various devices which only actual reading of the literature could disclose, far more than in the mere vocabulary. As a comparative grammarian he was much more than as a Sanskrit scholar, ... [and yet] it is surely much that he made the grammar, formerly a maze of Indian subtilty, as simple and attractive as that of Greek or Latin, introduced the study of the easier works of Sanskrit literature and trained (personally or by his books) pupils who could advance far higher, invade even the most intricate parts of the literature and make the Vedas intelligible. The great truth which his ''Comparative Grammar'' established was that of the mutual relations of the connected languages. Affinities had before him been observed between Latin and German, between German and Slavonic, etc., yet all attempts to prove one the parent of the other had been found preposterous.<ref name=\"Rines 1920 p. 261 cites Martineau 1867.\"/>\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Francis Bopp |volume=4 |pages=49\u201350 }}\n*{{citation |last=Martineau |year=1867 |first=Russell |title=Obituary of Franz Bopp |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |location=London |pages=305\u201314}}\n\n'''Attribution'''\n* {{EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bopp, Franz |volume=4 |pages=240\u2013241 }}\n* {{Americana|mode=cs2 |wstitle=Bopp, Franz|year=1920 |volume=4 |pages= 261\u2013262}}\n\n==External links==\n*Franz Bopp, [https://archive.org/details/comparativegramm01boppuoft \"A Comparative Grammar, Volume 1\"], 1885, at the [[Internet Archive]].\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bopp, Franz}}\n[[Category:Balticists]]\n[[Category:1791 births]]\n[[Category:1867 deaths]]\n[[Category:Linguists from Germany]]\n[[Category:Indo-Europeanists]]\n[[Category:People from Mainz]]\n[[Category:People from Aschaffenburg]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]\n[[Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty]]\n[[Category:Corresponding Members of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]]\n[[Category:German philologists]]\n[[Category:Albanologists]]", "sha1": "799kki7z1pq0ac58t5w6uwhqzbvqw1r"}}, {"title": "Full Metal Jacket", "ns": "0", "id": "11701", "revision": {"id": "866604330", "parentid": "866542454", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T11:21:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cydebot", "id": "1215485"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot - Moving category United States Marine Corps in films to [[:Category:Films about the United States Marine Corps]] per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 October 23]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the type of bullet|Full metal jacket bullet}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name                 = Full Metal Jacket\n| image                = Full Metal Jacket poster.jpg\n| alt                  = Against a white backdrop is a camouflaged military helmet with \"Born to Kill\" written on it, a peace sign attached to it, and a row of bullets lined up inside the helmet strap.

Lee Ermey]], [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] and [[Adam Baldwin]]. The screenplay by Kubrick, [[Michael Herr]], and [[Gustav Hasford]] was based on Hasford's novel ''[[The Short-Timers]]'' (1979). The storyline follows a [[platoon]] of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] through their [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|training]], primarily focusing on two privates, Joker and Pyle, who struggle to get through boot camp under their abusive drill instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences of two of the platoon's Marines in the [[Tet Offensive]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The film's title refers to the [[full metal jacket bullet]] used by soldiers. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 1987. It was the last of Kubrick's films to be released during his lifetime.\n\n''Full Metal Jacket'' received critical acclaim and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Kubrick, Herr, and Hasford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208011732/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearchInput.jsp |archivedate=February 8, 2009}}</ref> In 2001, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it at No. 95 in their \"[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]]\" poll.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/100years/thrills.aspx |title=AFI'S 100 Most Thrilling American Films |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=afi.com |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |quote=2001}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nDuring the United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], a group of [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] recruits arrive at [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], [[South Carolina]], for [[United States Marine Corps Recruit Training|boot camp]]. [[Drill instructor|Drill Instructor]] Hartman employs forceful methods to turn the recruits into combat-ready Marines. Among the recruits are privates \"Joker\", \"Cowboy\", and the overweight and dim-witted Leonard Lawrence, who Hartman nicknames \"[[Gomer Pyle]]\".\n\nPyle is initially inept at basic training, but slowly improves after Hartman pairs him with Joker. However, when Hartman discovers a [[contraband]] doughnut in Pyle's foot locker, he adopts a [[collective punishment]] policy, punishing the rest of the platoon for Pyle's mistakes. One night, the recruits [[Hazing|haze]] Pyle with a [[blanket party]]; Joker reluctantly participates. Following this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model recruit and shows expertise in marksmanship. This impresses Hartman, but worries Joker, who notices Pyle talking to his rifle and believes he may be suffering a [[mental breakdown]].\n\nThe recruits graduate and receive their [[List of United States Marine Corps MOS|Military Occupational Specialty]] assignments. Joker is assigned to [[Military journalism|Military Journalism]], while most of the others - including Cowboy and Pyle - are assigned to Infantry. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom loading his rifle. Pyle executes drill commands and loudly recites the [[Rifleman's Creed]], waking the others, including Hartman, who storms into the bathroom, insults Pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle. Pyle shoots Hartman dead and then kills himself, while Joker watches in horror.\n\nIn January 1968, Joker - now a sergeant - is a war correspondent in South Vietnam for ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' with Private First Class Rafterman, a combat photographer. Rafterman wants to go into combat, as Joker claims he has. At the Marine base, Joker is mocked for his lack of the [[thousand-yard stare]], indicating his lack of war experience. They are interrupted by the start of the [[Tet Offensive]] as the [[Vietnam People's Army|North Vietnamese Army]] unsuccessfully attempts to overrun the base.\n\nThe following day, the journalism staff is briefed about enemy attacks throughout South Vietnam. Joker is sent to [[Phu Bai International Airport|Phu Bai]], accompanied by Rafterman. They meet the [[Lusthog Squad]], where Joker is reunited with Cowboy. Joker accompanies the squad during the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]], where platoon commander \"Touchdown\" is killed by the enemy. After the Marines declare the area secure, a team of American news journalists and reporters enter Hu\u1ebf and interviews various Marines about their experiences in Vietnam and their opinions about the war.\n\nWhile patrolling Hu\u1ebf, Crazy Earl, the squad leader, is killed by a [[booby trap]], leaving Cowboy in command. The squad becomes lost and Cowboy orders Eightball to scout the area. A [[Viet Cong]] sniper wounds Eightball and Doc Jay, the squad medic. Cowboy learns that tank support is unavailable and orders the team to prepare for withdrawal. The squad's machine gunner, \"Animal Mother\", disobeys Cowboy and attempts to save his comrades. He discovers there is only one sniper, but Doc Jay and Eightball are killed when Doc Jay attempts to indicate the sniper's location. While maneuvering toward the sniper, Cowboy is shot and killed.\n\nAnimal Mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper. Joker discovers the sniper, a teenage girl, and attempts to shoot her, but his rifle jams and alerts her to his presence. Rafterman shoots the sniper, mortally wounding her. As the squad converges, the sniper begs for death, prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker stares into the distance, displaying the thousand-yard stare.

Neither Hasford nor Herr knew how much he had contributed to the screenplay, which led to a dispute over the final credits.<ref name=\"carlton\" /> Hasford remembers, \"We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I was putting on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley was the only one who knew that this was going to end up being a car.\"<ref name=\"carlton\" /> Herr says the director was not interested in making an anti-war film, but \"he wanted to show what war is like\".<ref name=\"vulliamy\" />\n\nAt some point, Kubrick wanted to meet Hasford in person, but Herr advised against this, describing ''The Short-Timers'' author as a \"scary man\" and believing he and Kubrick would not \"get on\".<ref name=\"vulliamy\" /> Nonetheless, Kubrick insisted, and they all met at Kubrick's house in England for dinner. It did not go well, and Hasford did not meet with Kubrick again.<ref name=\"vulliamy\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThrough [[Warner Bros.]], Kubrick advertised a national casting search in the United States and Canada. The director used videotape to audition actors and received over 3,000 submissions. His staff screened all of the tapes, leaving 800 of them for Kubrick to review personally.<ref name=\"lobrutto\" />{{rp|461}}\n\nFormer U.S. Marine Drill Instructor Ermey, originally hired as a [[technical advisor]], asked Kubrick if he could audition for the role of Hartman. Kubrick had seen Ermey's portrayal of Drill Instructor Staff Sergeant Loyce in ''[[The Boys in Company C]]'' (1978) and told the Marine that he was not vicious enough to play the character. Ermey improvised insulting dialogue against a group of [[Royal Marines]] who were being considered for the part of background Marines, to demonstrate his ability to play the character, as well as to show how a Drill Instructor goes about breaking down the individuality of new recruits.<ref name=\"lobrutto\" />{{rp|462}} Upon viewing the videotape of these sessions, Kubrick gave Ermey the role, realizing he \"was a genius for this part\".<ref name=\"rose\" /> Kubrick also incorporated the 250-page transcript of Ermey's rants into the script.<ref name=\"lobrutto\" />{{rp|462\u2013463}} Ermey's experience as a Drill Instructor during the Vietnam era proved invaluable. Kubrick estimated that Ermey wrote 50% of his own dialogue, especially the insults.<ref name=\"cahill\" />\n\nWhile Ermey practiced his lines in a rehearsal room, a production assistant would throw tennis balls and oranges at him. Ermey had to catch the ball and throw it back as quickly as possible, while at the same time saying his lines as fast as he could. Any hesitation, slur, or missed line would necessitate starting over. Twenty error-free runs were required. \"[He] was my drill instructor\", Ermey said of the production assistant.<ref name=\"lobrutto\" />{{rp|463}}\n\nThe original casting plan envisaged [[Anthony Michael Hall]] starring as Private Joker. After eight months of negotiations, a deal between Kubrick and Hall fell through.<ref name=\"ugodz\" /> Kubrick offered [[Bruce Willis]] a role, but the actor had to turn it down because he was to start filming of the first six episodes of his TV series ''[[Moonlighting (TV series)|Moonlighting]]''.<ref name=\"Willis\" />\n\n===Filming===\nKubrick shot the film in England: in [[Cambridgeshire]], on the [[Norfolk Broads]], and at the former [[Millennium Mills]], [[Beckton Gas Works]], [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]] (east London) and the [[Isle of Dogs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/movies/fullmetaljacket.htm|title=Movies, films TV locations in the UK Film and TV Set information, \u2013 Full Metal Jacket|publisher=}}</ref> A former [[RAF]] and then [[British Army]] base, [[Bassingbourn Barracks]] doubled as the Parris Island Marine boot camp.<ref name=\"rose\" /> A British Army rifle range near Barton, outside Cambridge, was used in the scene where Hartman congratulates Private Pyle for his shooting skills. Kubrick worked from still photographs of Hu\u1ebf, taken in 1968, and found an area owned by [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] that closely resembled it and was scheduled to be demolished. The disused Beckton Gas Works, a few miles from central London, were filmed to represent Hu\u1ebf after attacks.<ref name=\"cahill\"/> Kubrick had buildings blown up, and the film's art director used a [[wrecking ball]] to knock specific holes in certain buildings over the course of two months.<ref name=\"cahill\"/> Originally, Kubrick had a plastic replica jungle flown in from California, but once he looked at it he was reported to have said, \"I don't like it.

Although the Wessex was a licensed derivative of the Sikorsky H-34, the Wessex substituted two gas turbine engines for the H-34's radial (piston) engine. This resulted in a much longer and less rounded nose than that of the Vietnam era H-34. Kubrick also obtained a selection of rifles, [[M79 grenade launcher]]s, and [[M60 machine gun]]s from a licensed weapons dealer.<ref name=\"rose\"/>\n\nModine described the shoot as difficult: [[Beckton Gas Works]] was a toxic and environmental nightmare for the entire film crew. Asbestos and hundreds of other chemicals poisoned the earth and air. Modine documents details of shooting at Beckton in his book, ''[[Full Metal Jacket Diary]]'' (2005). During the \"Boot Camp\" sequence of the film, Modine and the other recruits had to endure the rigors of Marine Corps training, including having Ermey yelling at them for 10 hours a day during the shooting of the Parris Island scenes. To ensure the actors' reactions to Ermey were as authentic and fresh as possible, Ermey and the recruits did not rehearse together.<ref name=\"lobrutto\" />{{rp|468}} For film continuity, each recruit had to have his head shaved once a week.<ref name=\"linfield\"/>\n\nAt one point during filming, Ermey had a car accident, broke all of his ribs on one side, and was out for four-and-half months.<ref name=\"cahill\"/>\n\nCowboy's death scene shows a building in the background that resembles the famous alien monolith in Kubrick's ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). Kubrick described the resemblance as an \"extraordinary accident\".<ref name=\"cahill\"/>\n\nDuring filming, Hasford contemplated taking legal action over the writing credits. Originally, the filmmakers intended for Hasford to receive an \"additional dialogue\" credit, but he fought for and eventually received full credit.<ref name=\"carlton\"/> The writer took two friends and visited the set dressed as extras, only to be mistaken by a crew member for Herr when Hasford identified himself as the writer whose work the film was based on.<ref name=\"lewis\"/>\n\nKubrick's daughter [[Vivian Kubrick|Vivian]]\u2014who appears uncredited as a news-camera operator at the mass grave\u2014shadowed the filming of ''Full Metal Jacket.'' She shot 18 hours of behind-the-scenes footage for a potential \"making-of\" documentary similar to her earlier film documentary on Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980). In this case, she did not complete such a documentary. Snippets of her work can be seen in the documentary ''[[Stanley Kubrick's Boxes]]'' (2008).\n\n==Themes==\nCompared to Kubrick's other works, the themes of ''Full Metal Jacket'' have received little attention from critics and reviewers. Michael Pursell's essay \"''Full Metal Jacket'': The Unravelling of Patriarchy\" (1988) was an early, in-depth consideration of the film's two-part structure and its criticism of masculinity, arguing that the film shows \"war and pornography as facets of the same system\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pursell|first=Michael|title=''Full Metal Jacket'': The Unravelling of Patriarchy|journal=Literature/Film Quarterly|year=1988|volume=16|issue=4|pages=324}}</ref>\n\nMost reviews have focused on military [[brainwashing]] themes in the boot camp training section of the film, while seeing the latter half of the film as more confusing and disjointed in content. Rita Kempley of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote, \"it's as if they borrowed bits of every war movie to make this eclectic finale.\"<ref name=\"Kempley\" /> [[Roger Ebert]] said, \"The movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> Julian Rice, in his book ''Kubrick's Hope'' (2008), sees the second part of the film as continuing the psychic journey of Joker in trying to come to grips with human evil.<ref name=\"JulianRice\" />\n\nTony Lucia, in his July 5, 1987, review of ''Full Metal Jacket'' for the ''Reading Eagle'', looked at the themes of Kubrick's career, suggesting \"the unifying element may be the ordinary man dwarfed by situations too vast and imposing to handle\". Lucia specifically refers to the \"military mentality\" in this film. He said further that the theme covered \"a man testing himself against his own limitations\", and he concluded: \"''Full Metal Jacket'' is the latest chapter in an ongoing movie which is not merely a comment on our time or a time past, but on something that reaches beyond.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Lucia|first=Tony|date=July 5, 1987|title='Full Metal Jacket' takes deadly aim at the war makers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19870705&id=__khAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4108,3337251|format=Review|newspaper=Reading Eagle|location=Reading, Pennsylvania|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBritish critic [[Gilbert Adair]] wrote: \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic in nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all the whims, shades and modulations of personal expression\".{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=10}}\n\nMichael Herr wrote of his work on the screenplay: \"The substance was single-minded, the old and always serious problem of how you put into a film or a book the living, behaving presence of what [[Jung]] called The Shadow, the most accessible of [[archetypes]], and the easiest to experience&nbsp;... War is the ultimate field of Shadow-activity, where all of its other activities lead you. As they expressed it in Vietnam, 'Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for I {{em|am}} the Evil'.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|p=11}}\n\nIn a 2009 review, Dan Schneider alleged that Kubrick took the idea of a recruit being broken down in boot camp and driven to suicide from the epic film series [[The Human Condition (film series)|''The Human Condition'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cosmoetica.com/B860-DES685.htm|title=DVD Review Of The Human Condition|year=2009|author=Dan Schneider}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nKubrick's daughter, [[Vivian Kubrick]], under the alias \"Abigail Mead\", wrote the film's score. According to an interview which appeared in the January 1988 issue of ''[[Keyboard (magazine)|Keyboard]]'', the film was scored mostly with a [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer (the then-current Series III edition) and a [[Synclavier]]. For the period music, Kubrick went through ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'s}} list of Top 100 Hits for each year from 1962\u20131968 and tried many songs, but \"sometimes the dynamic range of the music was too great, and we couldn't work in dialogue.\"<ref name=\"cahill\"/>\n\n* [[Johnnie Wright]] \u2013 \"[[Hello Vietnam]]\"\n* [[The Dixie Cups]] \u2013 \"[[Chapel of Love]]\"\n* [[Sam the Sham|Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs]] \u2013 \"[[Wooly Bully]]\"\n* [[Chris Kenner]] \u2013 \"[[I Like It Like That (Chris Kenner song)|I Like It Like That]]\"\n* [[Nancy Sinatra]] \u2013 \"[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]\"\n* [[The Trashmen]] \u2013 \"[[Surfin' Bird]]\"\n* [[Goldman Band]] \u2013 \"[[Marines' Hymn]]\"\n* [[The Rolling Stones]] - \"[[Paint It Black]]\"\n\nA single, \"Full Metal Jacket (I Wanna Be Your Drill Instructor)\", credited to Mead and Nigel Goulding, was released to promote the film.

Corliss also appreciated \"the Olympian elegance and precision of Kubrick's filmmaking\".<ref name=\"RevTime\" /> ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Ian Nathan awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying it is \"inconsistent\" and describing it as \"both powerful and frustratingly unengaged\". Nathan felt that after leaving the opening act following the recruit training, the film becomes \"bereft of purpose\", but he summarized his review by calling it a \"hardy Kubrickian effort that warms on you with repeated viewings\". Nathan also praised Ermey's \"staggering performance\".<ref name=\"RevEmpire\" /> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"harrowing, beautiful and characteristically eccentric\". Canby echoed praise for Ermey, calling him \"the film's stunning surprise&nbsp;... he's so good\u2014so obsessed\u2014that you might think he wrote his own lines\". Canby also said D'Onofrio's performance should be admired, and he called Modine \"one of the best, most adaptable young film actors of his generation\". Canby concluded: ''Full Metal Jacket'' was \"a film of immense and very rare imagination\".<ref name=\"RevNewYorkTimes\" />\n\nJim Hall, writing for [[Film4]] in 2010, awarded the film 5 out of 5 stars and added to the praise for Ermey, saying his \"performance as the foul-mouthed Hartman is justly celebrated and it's difficult to imagine the film working anything like as effectively without him\". The review also preferred the opening training to the later Vietnam sequence, calling it \"far more striking than the second and longer section\". Film4 commented that the film ends abruptly but felt \"it demonstrates just how clear and precise the director's vision could be when he resisted a fatal tendency for indulgence\". Film4 concluded: \"''Full Metal Jacket'' ranks with ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' as one of Kubrick's very best.\"<ref name=\"RevFilm4\" /> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it \"Elliptical, full of subtle inner rhymes \u2026 and profoundly moving, this is the most tightly crafted Kubrick film since ''Dr. Strangelove'', as well as the most horrific.\"<ref name=\"RevChicagoReader\" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film an \"intense, schematic, superbly made\" drama \"loaded with vivid, outrageously vulgar military vernacular that contributes heavily to the film's power\", but felt that it never develops \"a particularly strong narrative.\" The cast performances were all labeled \"exceptional\" with Modine being singled out as \"embodying both what it takes to survive in the war and a certain omniscience.\"<ref name=\"RevVariety\" /> [[Gilbert Adair]], writing in a review for ''Full Metal Jacket'', commented that \"Kubrick's approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature.

Ebert called it \"one of the best-looking war movies ever made on sets and stage\" but felt this was not enough to compete with the \"awesome reality of ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' and ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\" Ebert also criticized the film's second act set in Vietnam, saying the \"movie disintegrates into a series of self-contained set pieces, none of them quite satisfying\" and concluded that the film's message was \"too little and too late\", having been done by other Vietnam War films. However, Ebert also gave praise to Ermey and D'Onofrio, saying \"these are the two best performances in the movie, which never recovers after they leave the scene.\"<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> This review angered [[Gene Siskel]] on their television show ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|At The Movies]]''; he criticized Ebert for liking ''[[Benji the Hunted]]'' (which came out the same week) more than ''Full Metal Jacket''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=A.

The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on [[Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island|Parris Island]], and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick has had since the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=128}}\n \nSergeant Hartman (renamed from the book's Gerheim) has an expanded role in the film. In the film, Private Pyle's incompetence is presented as weighing negatively on the rest of the platoon and in the film, unlike the novel, he is the only under-performing recruit. {{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=123}} The film omits \"Hartman's\" disclosure to other troops that he thinks Pyle might be mentally unstable, a \"[[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]]\". In contrast, Hartman praises Pyle, saying that he is \"born again hard\". Jenkins says that the character of Hartman could not have been portrayed as having a warmer social relationship with the troops, as that would have upset the balance of the film, which depends on the spectacle of ordinary soldiers coming to grips with Hartman as a force of nature embodying a killer culture.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=124}}\n \nVarious episodes in the book have been cut from the screenplay or conflated with others.  For example, Cowboy's introduction of the \"Lusthog Squad\" has been both markedly shortened and supplemented by material from other sections of the book. Although the book's final, third section was largely dropped, elements from this section were inserted into other episodes of the film.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=146}} For instance, the climactic episode with the sniper is a conflation of two episodes in the book, from Parts II and III. Jenkins thinks the film presents this passage more dramatically but in less gruesome detail than in the novel.\n\nThe film often has a more tragic tone than the book, which relies on callous humor. Joker in the film remains a model of humane thinking, as evidenced by his moral struggle in the sniper episode and elsewhere. He works to overcome his own meekness, rather than to compete with other Marines. The film omits the book's showing his eventual domination over Animal Mother.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=147}}\n\nThe film also omits the death of the character Rafterman. Jenkins believed this allowed viewers to reflect on Rafterman's personal growth in the film and speculate on his future growth after the war. Jenkins also believed Rafterman's death would not have fit the plot of the screenplay.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1997|p=146}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Paths of Glory]]''\n* [[Vietnam War in film]]\n{{Portal bar|Film in the United States|1980s|Military history|United Kingdom}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"BAFTA\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1987 |title=Film Nominations 1987 |accessdate=16 October 2011|work=bafta.org}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BOMojoRun\">{{cite web|title=Full Metal Jacket 1987|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&id=fullmetaljacket.htm |work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=25 October  2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BostonSOFCA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bostonfilmcritics.org/content/past-award-winners#1980s |title=BSFC Past Award Winners |work=BSFC |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204120731/http://www.bostonfilmcritics.org/content/past-award-winners#1980s |archive-date=2012-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"cahill\">{{cite news | last = Cahill | first = Tim | coauthors = | title = The ''Rolling Stone'' Interview | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | pages = | language = | publisher =  | year = 1987 | url = http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0077.html | accessdate = 11 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"carlton\">{{cite news| last = Carlton| first = Bob | coauthors = | title = Alabama Native wrote the book on Vietnam Film | work = [[The Birmingham News]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | url = http://www.gustavhasford.com/interview.htm| accessdate = 11 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Channel4\">{{cite web|title=Channel 4's 100 Greatest War Movies of All Time  |url=http://www.listal.com/list/100-greatest-war-films |accessdate=13 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"DailyBeast\">{{cite web|title=The Undeclared War Over Full Metal Jacket |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-03-26/seven-classic-at-the-movies-moments/full/|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=RTST, INC|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"daviddidonatello\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daviddidonatello.it/english/cercafilmvincitori2.php?idfilm=114&vinfilm=full_metal_jacket|title=David di Donatello Awards|accessdate=16 October 2011|work=daviddidonatello.it|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401223319/http://www.daviddidonatello.it/english/cercafilmvincitori2.php?idfilm=114&vinfilm=full_metal_jacket|archive-date=2012-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Full Metal Jacket|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/full-metal-jacket-1987|work=rogerebert.com| publisher=rogerebert.com|accessdate=October 19, 2017|date=June 26, 1987}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Empire500\">{{cite web|title=The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/8.asp|publisher=Bauer Consumer Media.|accessdate=28 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goldenglobes\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/24107 |title=Awards Search |accessdate=16 October 2011 |work=goldenglobes.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927184801/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/film/24107 |archive-date=27 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"JulianRice\">Rice, Julian (2008).

'''coquetry''' is a [[Social behavior|social]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] involving verbal or written communication, as well as [[body language]], by one person to another, either to suggest interest in a deeper relationship with the other person, or if done playfully, for amusement.\n\nIn most cultures, it is socially disapproved for a person to make explicit sexual advances in public, or in private to someone not romantically acquainted, but indirect or suggestive advances may at times be considered acceptable.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nFlirting usually involves speaking and behaving in a way that suggests a mildly greater [[intimacy]] than the actual [[personal relationship|relationship]] between the parties would justify, though within the rules of social [[etiquette]], which generally disapproves of a direct expression of sexual interest in the given setting. This may be accomplished by communicating a sense of playfulness or irony. [[Double entendre]]s (where one meaning is more formally appropriate, and another more suggestive) may be used. Body language can include flicking the hair, eye contact, brief touching, open stances, proximity, and other gestures. Vocal communication of interest can include, for example,\n* alterations in vocal tone (such as pace, volume, and intonation), and\n* challenges (including teasing, questions, qualifying, and feigned disinterest), which reason may to serve to increase tension, and to test intention and congruity.\n\nFlirting behavior varies across cultures due to different modes of social etiquette, such as how closely people should stand ([[proxemics]]), how long to hold eye contact, how much touching is appropriate and so forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,419712,00.html |title=Scoring a German: Flirting with Fr\u00e4uleins, Hunting for Herren  |publisher=Spiegel.de |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref> Nonetheless, some behaviors may be more universal. For example, ethologist [[Iren\u00e4us Eibl-Eibesfeldt]] found that in places as different as Africa and North America, women exhibit similar flirting behavior, such as a prolonged stare followed by a [[head tilt]] away with a little [[smile]], as seen in the accompanying image associated with a [[Hollywood film]].[[File:Marilyn Monroe and Cary Grant in Monkey Business trailer 3.JPG|thumb|right|Laurel (played by [[Marilyn Monroe]]) flirting with Dr. Fulton (played by [[Cary Grant]]) in the film ''[[Monkey Business (1952 film)|Monkey Business]]'']]\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of the word ''[[wikt:flirt|flirt]]'' is obscure. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (first edition) associates it with such onomatopoeic words as ''flit'' and ''flick'', emphasizing a lack of seriousness; on the other hand, it has been attributed to the old French ''conter fleurette'', which means \"to (try to) [[seduction|seduce]]\" by the dropping of flower petals, that is, \"to speak sweet nothings\". While old-fashioned, this expression is still used in French, often mockingly, but the English [[gallicism]] ''to flirt'' has made its way and has now become an [[anglicism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k486334v/f532.item|title=M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie royale du Gard|first=Acad\u00e9mie de N\u00eemes.

She wrote of the Americans, \"The boy learns to make advances and rely upon the girl to repulse them whenever they are inappropriate to the state of feeling between the pair\", as contrasted to the British, where \"the girl is reared to depend upon a slight barrier of chilliness... which the boys learn to respect, and for the rest to rely upon the men to approach or advance, as warranted by the situation.\" This resulted, for example, in British women interpreting an American soldier's gregariousness as something more intimate or serious than he had intended.<ref name=\"uk\"/>\n\nCommunications theorist [[Paul Watzlawick]] used this situation, where \"both American soldiers and British girls accused one another of being sexually brash\", as an example of differences in \"punctuation\" in interpersonal communications. He wrote that courtship in both cultures used approximately 30 steps from \"first eye contact to the ultimate consummation\", but that the sequence of the steps was different. For example, kissing might be an early step in the American pattern but a relatively intimate act in the English pattern.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  | last = Watzlawick\n  | first = Paul\n  | title = How Real Is Real?\n  | publisher = Souvenir Press\n  | year = 1983\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 63\u201364\n  | isbn = 978-0-285-62573-0\n}}</ref>\n\nJapanese courtesans had another form of flirting, emphasizing non-verbal relationships by hiding the lips and showing the eyes, as depicted in much [[Shunga (art)|Shunga art]], the most popular print media at the time, until the late 19th century.\n\n===European hand fans===\n{{Further|European hand fans in the 18th century}}\nThe fan was extensively used as a means of communication and therefore a way of flirting from the 16th century onwards in some European societies, especially [[England]] and [[Spain]]. A whole sign language was developed with the use of the fan, and even [[etiquette]] books and magazines were published. Charles Francis Badini created the Original Fanology or Ladies' Conversation Fan which was published by William Cock in [[London]] in 1797. The use of the fan was not limited to women, as men also carried fans and learned how to convey messages with them. For instance, placing the fan near the heart meant \"I love you\", while opening a fan wide meant \"Wait for me\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avictorian.com/fanlanguage.html|publisher=Avictorian.com| title=Ladies and their Fans|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Spain, where the use of fans (called \"abanicos\") is still very popular today,{{when|date=August 2018}} ladies used them to communicate with suitors or prospective suitors without attracting the notice of their families or [[Chaperone (social)|chaperons]]. This use was highly popular during the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/module-News-display-sid-236.htm|publisher=Spainforvisitors.com| title=The Language of the Fan|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nPeople flirt for a variety of reasons. Flirting can indicate an interest in a deeper personal relationship with another person. Some people flirt simply for amusement, with no intention of developing any further relationship. For others, flirting serves a purpose and is employed as a tool to achieve a specific (professional) goal (good salespeople will recognise situations where flirting will help a sale).\n \n===Courtship===\n{{main|Mating (human)}}\nIn order to bond and/or to express sexual interest, people flirt. According to [[social anthropologist]] [[Kate Fox]], there are two main types of flirting: flirting just for fun and flirting with further intent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html |title=SIRC Guide to flirting |publisher=Sirc.org |accessdate=2011-08-14}}</ref> Flirting for fun can take place between friends, co-workers, or total strangers that wish to get to know each other. This type of flirting does not intend to lead to sexual intercourse or a romantic relationship, but increases the bonds between two people.\n\nFlirting with intent plays a role in the mate-selection process. The person flirting will send out signals of sexual availability to another, and expects to see the interest returned in order to continue flirting. Flirting can involve non-verbal signs, such as an exchange of glances, hand-touching, and hair-touching; or verbal signs, such as chatting, giving flattering comments, and exchanging telephone numbers in order to initiate further contact. In the 21st century flirting is increasingly taking place in instant messaging and other social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.com/news/local_news/pittsburgh-is-the-flirtiest-city-in-the-country/article_d2877ebc-6d39-5f10-a4da-880d5651d193.html |title=Pittsburgh is the 'flirtiest' city in the country |publisher=Timesonline.com |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n{{globalize/West|section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Jealousy and Flirtation.jpg|thumb|A study in [[body language]]: [[Haynes King]]'s ''Jealousy and Flirtation'']]\nFlirting may consist of stylized gestures, language, [[body language]], [[Human position|postures]], and [[physiology|physiologic signs]] which act as cues to another person.

For example, for many western cultures one very common flirting strategy includes eye contact. However, eye contact can have a very different meaning in some Asian countries, where women might get in trouble if they return a glance to men who stare at them. Furthermore, Chinese and Japanese women are sometimes not expected to initiate eye contact as it could be considered rude and disrespectful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/education/languages/articles/35828.aspx| title=Covert glances and eye contact|publisher=Brighthub.com|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eugen de Blaas The Flirtation.jpg|thumb|''The Flirtation'' by [[Eugene de Blaas]]. A study of body language: a man flirting]]\nThe distance between two people is also important when flirting. People from the \"contact cultures\", such as those in the Mediterranean or Latin America, may feel comfortable with closer proximity, whereas a British or Northern European person may typically need more space. Although touching, especially of the hand or arm, can constitute flirting, touching is also often done without intentions of flirting, particularly in the contact cultures where it forms a natural part of communication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html| title=SIRC Guide to Flirting|publisher=Sirc.org|accessdate= 2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anti-Flirt Club]]\n* [[Making out]]\n* [[Public display of affection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Commons category|Flirting}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource|The_Royal_Path_of_Life/Flirting|A nineteenth century perspective on flirting}}\n\n{{Human sexuality and sexology}}\n{{Human sexuality}}\n\n[[Category:Sexual attraction]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of love]]", "sha1": "gwsn0rf6qf4vx7t2uowamwanrpmfx68"}}, {"title": "Franklin J.

Some are reasonable interpretations of the evidence that happen to be false.  For a given word there may often have been many serious attempts by scholars to propose etymologies based on the best information available at the time, and these can be later modified or rejected as linguistic scholarship advances.  The results of [[medieval etymology]], for example, were plausible given the insights available at the time, but have often been rejected by modern linguists.  The etymologies of [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the early modern period began to produce more reliable results, but many of their hypotheses have also been superseded.\n\nOther false etymologies are the result of specious and untrustworthy claims made by individuals, such as the unfounded claims made by [[Daniel Cassidy]] that hundreds of common English words such as ''baloney'', ''grumble'', and ''bunkum'' derive from the [[Irish language]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Zwicky |first=Arnold |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005098.html |title=Language Log: Gullibility in high places |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Liberman |first=Mark |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003326.html |title=Language Log: The bunkum of \"The Bunkum of Bunkum\"? |publisher=Itre.cis.upenn.edu |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==Association with urban legends==\nSome etymologies are part of [[urban legend]]s, and seem to respond to a general taste for the surprising, counter-intuitive and even scandalous. One common example has to do with the phrase ''[[rule of thumb]]'', meaning \"a rough guideline\". An urban legend has it that the phrase refers to an old English law under which a man could legally beat his wife with a stick no thicker than his thumb.<ref name=thumb>{{cite web|url=http://www.quinion.com/words/qa/qa-rul1.htm |title=World Wide Words: Rule of thumb |publisher=Quinion.com |date=1999-11-13 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref>{{efn|Centuries ago, under common law a man might chastise his wife in moderation, as he might a servant or child.

The \"discovery\" of these alleged etymologies is often believed by those who circulate them to draw attention to racist attitudes embedded in ordinary discourse.

Finches have stout conical bills adapted for eating seeds and often have colourful plumage. They occupy a great range of habitats where they are usually resident and do not migrate. They have a worldwide distribution except for Australia and the polar regions. The family includes species known as siskins, canaries, redpolls, serins, grosbeaks and euphonias.\n\nMany birds in other families are also commonly called \"finches\". These groups include: the [[estrildid finch]]es ([[Estrildidae]]) of the Old World tropics and [[Australia]]; some members of the Old World [[bunting (bird)|bunting]] family ([[Emberizidae]]) and the [[American sparrow]] family ([[Passerellidae]]); and the [[Darwin's finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] islands, now considered members of the [[tanager]] family ([[Thraupidae]]).<ref name = nc7393>Newton (1973), Clement ''et al.'' (1993)</ref>\n\nFinches and [[Domestic canary|canaries]] were used in the UK, Canada and USA in the [[coal mining]] industry, to detect [[carbon monoxide]] from the eighteenth to twentieth century.

The study of the relationship between the [[taxa]] has been confounded by the recurrence of similar morphologies due to the [[convergent evolution|convergence]] of species occupying similar niches.<ref name=Zuccon2012/> In 1968 the American ornithologist Raymond Andrew Paynter Jr. wrote:\n<blockquote>\nLimits of the genera and relationships among the species are less understood \u2013 and subject to more controversy \u2013 in the carduelines than in any other species of passerines, with the possible exception of the estrildines [waxbills].<ref>{{ cite book | editor-last=Paynter | editor-first=Raymond A.

Several groups of birds that had previously been assigned to other families were found to be related to the finches. The [[Neotropical]] ''Euphonia'' and the ''Chlorophonia'' were formerly placed in the tanager family [[Thraupidae]] due to their similar appearance but analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that both genera were more closely related to the finches. They are now placed in a separate subfamily Euphoniinae within the Fringillidae.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Banks | first1=Richard C. | last2=Cicero | first2=Carla | last3=Dunn | first3=Jon L. | last4=Kratter | first4=Andrew W. | last5=Rasmussen | first5=Pamela C. | last6=Remsen  | first6=J.V.

All true finches have 9 primary [[remiges]] and 12 [[rectrices]]. The basic [[plumage]] colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s are commonplace in this family, and thus blue [[structural colour]]s are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong [[sexual dichromatism]], the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.<ref name = nc7393 />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:American Goldfinch-27527.jpg|thumb|[[American goldfinch]] (''Spinus tristis'') male (left) and female (right) in [[Johnston County, North Carolina|Johnson County]], [[North Carolina]], USA]]\nThe finches have a near-global distribution, being found across the Americas, Eurasia and Africa, as well as some island groups such as the Hawaiian islands. They are absent from Australasia, Antarctica, the Southern Pacific and the islands of the Indian Ocean, although some European species have been widely [[introduced species|introduced]] in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nFinches are typically inhabitants of well-wooded areas, but some can be found on mountains or even in [[desert]]s.\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe finches are primarily [[granivorous]], but [[Euphoniinae|euphoniines]] include considerable amounts of [[arthropod]]s and [[berries]] in their diet, and Hawaiian honeycreepers [[evolution|evolve]]d to utilize a wide range of food sources, including [[nectar]]. The diet of Fringillidae [[nestling]]s includes a varying amount of small arthropods. True finches have a bouncing flight like most small [[passerine]]s, alternating bouts of flapping with gliding on closed wings. Most sing well and several are commonly seen [[cagebird]]s; foremost among these is the [[domestication|domesticated]] [[Domestic Canary|canary]] (''Serinus canaria domestica'').

First, the transport relies on molecular binding between the cargo and the membrane-embedded channel or carrier protein. Second, the rate of facilitated diffusion is saturable with respect to the concentration difference between the two phases; unlike free diffusion which is linear in the concentration difference. Third, the temperature dependence of facilitated transport is substantially different due to the presence of an activated binding event, as compared to free diffusion where the dependence on temperature is mild.<ref>{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Morton|title=Principles and models of biological transport|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0387-79239-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blausen 0394 Facilitated Diffusion.png|thumb|350px|3D rendering of facilitated diffusion]]\nPolar molecules and large ions dissolved in water cannot diffuse freely across the plasma membrane due to the [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] nature of the fatty acid tails of the [[phospholipid]]s that make up the [[lipid bilayer]]. Only small, non-polar molecules, such as [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]], can diffuse easily across the membrane. Hence, no nonpolar molecules are transported by proteins in the form of transmembrane channels. These channels are gated, meaning that they open and close, and thus deregulate the flow of ions or small polar molecules across [[cell membrane|membranes]], sometimes against the osmotic gradient. Larger molecules are transported by transmembrane carrier proteins, such as [[permease]]s, that change their conformation as the [[molecules]] are carried across (e.g. [[glucose]] or [[amino acids]]). \nNon-polar molecules, such as [[retinol]] or [[lipid]]s, are poorly soluble in water. They are transported through aqueous compartments of cells or through extracellular space by water-soluble carriers (e.g. [[retinol binding protein]]).  The metabolites are not altered because no energy is required for facilitated diffusion. Only permease changes its shape in order to transport metabolites. The form of transport through a cell membrane in which a metabolite is modified is called [[PEP group translocation|group translocation]] transportation.\n\nGlucose, sodium ions, and chloride ions are just a few examples of molecules and ions that must efficiently cross the plasma membrane but to which the lipid bilayer of the membrane is virtually impermeable. Their transport must therefore be \"facilitated\" by proteins that span the membrane and provide an alternative route or bypass mechanism.\n\nVarious attempts have been made by engineers to mimic the process of facilitated transport in synthetic (i.e., non-biological) membranes for use in industrial-scale gas and liquid separations, but these have met with limited success to date, most often for reasons related to poor carrier stability and/or dissociation of the carrier from the passive transport.\n\n== In Vivo model of facilitated diffusion ==\nIn living organisms, the main physical and biochemical processes that are required for survival are regulated by [[diffusion]].<ref name=\"KleninMerlitz2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Klenin|first1=Konstantin V.|last2=Merlitz|first2=Holger|last3=Langowski|first3=J\u00f6rg|last4=Wu|first4=Chen-Xu|title=Facilitated Diffusion of DNA-Binding Proteins|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|issue=1|year=2006|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.018104}}</ref> Facilitated diffusion is one form of diffusion and it is important in several metabolic processes of living cells. One vital role of facilitated diffusion is that it is the main mechanism behind the binding of Transcription Factors (TFs) to designated target sites on the [[DNA]] molecule. The in vitro model, which is a very well known method of facilitated diffusion, that takes place outside of a living [[Cell (biology)|cell]], explains the 3-dimensional pattern of diffusion in the [[cytosol]] and the 1-dimensional diffusion along the DNA contour.<ref name=\"pmid23349772\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bauer M, Metzler R | title = In vivo facilitated diffusion model | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = e53956 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23349772 | pmc = 3548819 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0053956}}</ref> After carrying out extensive research on processes occurring out of the cell, this mechanism was generally accepted but there was a need to verify that this mechanism could take place in vivo or inside of living cells. Bauer & Metzler (2013)<ref name=\"pmid23349772\"/> therefore carried out an experiment using a bacterial genome in which they investigated the average time for TF \u2013 DNA binding to occur. After analyzing the process for the time it takes for TF's to diffuse across the contour and cytoplasm of the bacteria's DNA, it was concluded that in vitro and in vivo are similar in that the association and dissociation rates of TF\u2019s to and from the DNA are similar in both. Also, on the DNA contour, the motion is slower and target sites are easy to localize while in the [[cytoplasm]], the motion is faster but the TF's are not sensitive to their targets and so binding is restricted.\n\n===Intracellular facilitated diffusion===\n\nSingle-molecule imaging is an imaging technique which provides an ideal resolution necessary for the study of the Transcription factor binding mechanism in living cells.<ref name=\"HammarLeroy2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Hammar|first1=P.|last2=Leroy|first2=P.|last3=Mahmutovic|first3=A.|last4=Marklund|first4=E.

(2013), during the process of protein sliding, the protein searches the entire length of the DNA chain using 3-D and 1-D diffusion patterns. During 3-D diffusion, the high incidence of Crowder proteins creates an osmotic pressure which brings searcher proteins (e.g. Lac Repressor) closer to the DNA to increase their attraction and enable them to bind, as well as [[steric effect]] which exclude the Crowder proteins from this region (Lac operator region). Blocker proteins participate in 1-D diffusion only i.e. bind to and diffuse along the DNA contour and not in the cytosol.\n\n==Facilitated diffusion of proteins on Chromatin==\n\nThe in vivo model mentioned above clearly explains 3-D and 1-D diffusion along the DNA strand and the binding of proteins to target sites on the chain. Just like prokaryotic cells, in [[eukaryotes]], facilitated diffusion occurs in the [[nucleoplasm]] on [[chromatin]] filaments, accounted for by the switching dynamics of a protein when it is either bound to a chromatin thread or when freely diffusing in the nucleoplasm.<ref name=\"pmid21405302\">{{cite journal | vauthors = B\u00e9nichou O, Chevalier C, Meyer B, Voituriez R | title = Facilitated diffusion of proteins on chromatin | journal = Phys.

Following reviews of proposals, the [[United States Air Force]] selected McDonnell Douglas' design in 1967 to meet the service's need for a dedicated air-superiority fighter. The Eagle first flew in July 1972, and entered service in 1976. It is among the most successful modern fighters, with over 100 victories and no losses in aerial combat, with the majority of the kills by the [[Israeli Air Force]].<ref name=Davies_icover /><ref name=Spick_p127>Spick 2000, p. 127.</ref>\n\nThe Eagle has been exported to Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air-superiority aircraft. Its design included a secondary ground-attack capability<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/94122923/PS-940-F-15-Armament-Handbook-Oct-1979 \"PS 940 F-15 Armament Handbook, Oct-1979.\"] ''scribd.com.'' Retrieved: 29 November 2012.</ref> that was largely unused. The aircraft design proved flexible enough that an all-weather [[strike fighter|strike derivative]], the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]], an improved and enhanced version which was later developed, entered service in 1989 and has been exported to several nations. As of 2017, the aircraft is being produced in different variants with production set to end in 2022.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe F-15 can trace its origins to the early [[Vietnam War]], when the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] fought each other over future tactical aircraft. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] was pressing for both services to use as many common aircraft as possible, even if performance compromises were involved. As part of this policy, the USAF and Navy had embarked on the [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|TFX (F-111)]] program, aiming to deliver a medium-range [[interdiction aircraft]] for the Air Force that would also serve as a long-range [[interceptor aircraft]] for the Navy.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=42}}\n\nIn January 1965, Secretary McNamara asked the Air Force to consider a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and [[close air support]] to replace several types like the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100 Super Sabre]] and various [[light bomber]]s then in service. Several existing designs could fill this role; the Navy favored the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] and [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]], which were pure [[attack aircraft]], while the Air Force was more interested the [[Northrop F-5]] fighter with a secondary attack capability. The A-4 and A-7 were more capable in the attack role, while the F-5 less so, but could defend itself. If the Air Force chose a pure attack design, maintaining air superiority would be a priority for a new airframe. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] aircraft to obsolete [[MiG-15]]s or [[MiG-17]]s on 4 April 1965.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=42}}\n\nIn April 1965, [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]], at that time director of the [[Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering|Department of Defense Research and Engineering]], stated the favored position was to consider the F-5 and begin studies of an \"F-X\".<ref group=N>\"F-X\" should be read as \"Fighter, Unknown designation number\", but is often translated as \"Fighter-Experimental\".</ref> These early studies envisioned a production run of 800 to 1,000 aircraft and stressed maneuvrability over speed; it also stated that the aircraft would not be considered without some level of ground-attack capability.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=43}} On 1 August, [[Gabriel P. Disosway|Gabriel Disosway]] took command of [[Tactical Air Command]]  and reiterated calls for the F-X, but lowered the required performance from Mach 3.0 to 2.5 to lower costs.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=44}} \n\nAn official requirements document for an air superiority fighter was finalized in October 1965, and sent out as a [[request for proposal]]s  to 13 companies on 8 December. Meanwhile, the Air Force chose the A-7 over the F-5 for the support role on 5 November 1965,<ref>Munzenmaier, Walter. \"'LTV A-7D/K Corsair II: The 'SLUF' in USAF and USANG Service 1968\u20131993,\" Famous Aircraft of the USAF and USAG, Volume 1.</ref> giving further impetus for an air superiority design as the A-7 lacked any credible air-to-air capability. \n\nEight companies responded with proposals. Following a downselect, four companies were asked to provide further developments. In total, they developed some 500 design concepts. Typical designs featured [[variable-sweep wing]]s, weight over {{convert|60000|lb|kg}}, included a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.7 and a [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] of 0.75.<ref name=Jenkins_p5-7>Jenkins 1998, pp. 5\u20137.</ref> When the proposals were studied in July 1966, the aircraft were roughly the size and weight of the TFX F-111, and like that aircraft, were designs that could not be considered an air-superiority fighter.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=46}}\n\n===Smaller, lighter===\nThrough this period, studies of combat over Vietnam were producing worrying results. Theory had stressed long-range combat using missiles and optimized aircraft for this role. The result was highly loaded aircraft with large radar and excellent speed, but limited maneuverability and often lacking a gun. The canonical example was the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], used by the USAF, USN, and [[U.S. Marine Corps]] to provide air superiority over Vietnam, the only fighter with enough power, range, and maneuverability to be given the primary task of dealing with the threat of Soviet fighters while flying with visual engagement rules.<ref name=Davies_p9-11 />\n\nIn practice, due to policy and practical reasons,<ref name=Davies_p9-11 /> aircraft were closing to visual range and maneuvering, placing the larger US aircraft at a disadvantage to the much less expensive [[day fighter]]s such as the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]. Missiles proved to be much less reliable than predicted, especially at close range. Although improved training and the introduction of the [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon did much to address the disparity, these early outcomes led to considerable re-evaluation of the 1963 Project Forecast doctrine.<ref>Michael Gorn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l-cjq0nIJEsC&pg=PA45 \"Technology and the Air Force: A Retrospective Assessment\"], pp. 44\u201347. See also \"Harnessing the genie: science and technology forecasting for the Air Force\".</ref> This led to [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]]'s [[energy\u2013maneuverability theory]], which stressed that [[extra power]] and maneuverability were key aspects of a successful fighter design and these were more important than outright speed. Through tireless championing of the concepts and good timing with the \"failure\" of the initial F-X project, the \"[[fighter mafia]]\" pressed for a lightweight day fighter that could be built and operated in large numbers  to ensure air superiority.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=46\u201347}} In early 1967, they proposed that the ideal design had a [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] near 1:1, a maximum speed further reduced to Mach 2.3, a weight of {{convert|40000|lb|kg}}, and a [[wing loading]] of 80&nbsp;lb/ft\u00b2.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=47}}\n\nBy this time, the Navy had decided the F-111 would not meet their requirements and began the development of a new dedicated fighter design, the VFAX program. In May 1966, McNamara again asked the forces to study the designs and see whether the VFAX would meet the Air Force's F-X needs. The resulting studies took 18 months and concluded that the desired features were too different; the Navy stressed loiter time and mission flexibility, while the Air Force was now looking primarily for maneuverability.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=49}}\n\n===Focus on air superiority===\nIn 1967, the [[Soviet Union]] revealed the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]] at the [[Domodedovo International Airport|Domodedovo airfield]] near Moscow.<ref name=Davies_p9-11>Davies 2002, pp. 9\u201311.</ref><ref>\"In July 1967, at Domodedovo airfield near Moscow, the Soviet Union unveiled a new generation of combat aircraft\u2026 [codenamed] Foxbat by NATO\": \"Development\" in ''Modern Fighting Aircraft'', 1983.</ref> The MiG-25 was designed as a high-speed, high-altitude interceptor aircraft, and made many performance tradeoffs to excel in this role.<ref name=Bowman_p193>Bowman 1980, p. 193.</ref> Among these was the requirement for very high speed, over Mach 2.8, which demanded the use of [[stainless steel]] instead of [[aluminum]] for many parts of the aircraft. The added weight demanded a much larger wing to allow the aircraft to operate at the required high altitudes. However, to observers, it appeared outwardly similar to the very large F-X studies, an aircraft with high speed and a large wing offering high maneuverability, leading to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense and the various arms that the US was being outclassed. The [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23]] was likewise a subject of concern, and it was generally believed to be a better aircraft than the F-4. The F-X would outclass the MiG-23, but now the MiG-25 appeared to be superior in speed, ceiling, and endurance to all existing US fighters, even the F-X.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=48}} Thus, an effort to improve the F-X followed.<ref>Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 12.</ref>\n\nBoth Headquarters USAF and the TAC continued to call for a multipurpose aircraft, while both Disosway and Air Chief of Staff [[Bruce K. Holloway]] pressed for a pure air-superiority design that would be able to meet the expected performance of the MiG-25. During the same period, the Navy had ended its VFAX program and instead accepted a proposal from [[Grumman Aircraft]] for a smaller and more maneuverable design known as VFX, later becoming the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]]. VFX was considerably closer to the evolving F-X requirements. The Air Force in-fighting was eventually ended by the worry that the Navy's VFAX would be forced on them; in May 1968, it was stated that \"We finally decided \u2013 and I hope there is no one who still disagrees \u2013 that this aircraft is going to be an air superiority fighter\".{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=49}}\n\n[[File:F-15 Eagle Cockpit.jpg|thumb|F-15A [[cockpit]]|alt=Cockpit of jet fighter with circular dials and gauges: A control stick protrude from between where the pilot's legs would be.]]\nIn September 1968, a request for proposals  was released to major aerospace companies. These requirements called for single-seat fighter having a maximum take-off weight of {{convert|40000|lb|kg}} for the air-to-air role with a maximum speed of Mach 2.5 and a thrust-to-weight ratio of nearly 1:1 at mission weight.<ref name=Jenkins_p8-10>Jenkins 1998, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> It also called for a twin-engined arrangement, as this was believed to respond to throttle changes more rapidly and might offer commonality with the Navy's VFX program. However, details of the avionics were left largely undefined, as  whether to build a larger aircraft with a powerful radar that could detect the enemy at longer ranges was not clear, or alternatively a smaller aircraft that would make detecting it more difficult for the enemy.{{sfn|Neufeld|2007|p=52}}\n\nFour companies submitted proposals, with the Air Force eliminating [[General Dynamics]] and awarding contracts to [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild Republic]], [[North American Aviation|North American Rockwell]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]] for the definition phase in December 1968. The companies submitted technical proposals by June 1969. The Air Force announced the selection of McDonnell Douglas on 23 December 1969.<ref name=Jenkins_p9-11>Jenkins 1998, pp. 9\u201311.</ref> The winning design resembled the twin-tailed [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]], but with fixed [[wing]]s; both designs were based on configurations studied in wind-tunnel testing by NASA.<ref>Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 14.</ref>\n\n[[File:F-15A first prototype 2.jpg|thumb|left|McDonnell Douglas F-15A (S/N 71-0280) during the type's first flight|alt=Jet aircraft with distinctive orange markings banking left over desert, with landing gears extended]]\nThe Eagle's initial versions were the F-15 single-seat variant and TF-15 twin-seat variant. (After the F-15C was first flown, the designations were changed to \"F-15A\" and \"F-15B\"). These versions would be powered by new [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] engines to achieve a combat thrust-to-weight ratio in excess of 1:1. A proposed 25-mm Ford-Philco [[GAU-7 cannon]] with caseless ammunition suffered development problems. It was dropped in favor of the standard M61 Vulcan gun. The F-15 used conformal carriage of four Sparrow missiles like the Phantom. The fixed wing was put onto a flat, wide [[fuselage]] that also provided an effective lifting surface. The first F-15A flight was made on 27 July 1972, with the first flight of the two-seat F-15B following in July 1973.<ref name=Spick_p130-1>Spick 2000, pp. 130\u2013131.</ref>\n\nThe F-15 has a \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" [[radar]] that can distinguish low-flying moving targets from ground [[clutter (radar)|clutter]]. It would use computer technology with new controls and displays to lower pilot workload and require only one pilot to save weight. Unlike the F-14 or F-4, the F-15 has only a single [[aircraft canopy|canopy]] frame with clear vision forward. The USAF introduced the F-15 as \"the first dedicated USAF air-superiority fighter since the [[North American F-86 Sabre]]\".<ref>[http://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR939/MR939.ch5.pdf \"Chapter 5: Return of the Air Superiority Fighter\"].

Criticism from the [[fighter mafia]] that the F-15 was too large to be a dedicated [[dogfight]]er and too expensive to procure in large numbers, led to the [[Lightweight Fighter]] (LWF) program, which led to the USAF [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the middle-weight Navy [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]].<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 1\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Further development===\nThe single-seat F-15C and two-seat F-15D models entered production in 1978 and conducted their first flights in February and June of that year.<ref name=Jenkins_p33-4>Jenkins 1998, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> These models were fitted with the Production Eagle Package (PEP 2000), which included 2,000 [[pound (mass)|lb]] (900&nbsp;kg) of additional internal fuel, provisions for exterior [[conformal fuel tank]]s, and an increased maximum takeoff weight up to 68,000&nbsp;lb (30,700&nbsp;kg).<ref name=green /> The increased takeoff weight allows internal fuel, a full weapons load, conformal fuel tanks, and three external fuel tanks to be carried. The APG-63 radar uses a programmable signal processor (PSP), enabling the radar to be reprogrammable for additional purposes such as the addition of new armaments and equipment. The PSP was the first of its kind in the world, and the upgraded APG-63 radar was the first radar to use it. Other improvements included strengthened landing gear, a new digital central computer,<ref>Davies and Dildy 2007, p. 115.</ref> and an overload warning system, which allows the pilot to fly up to 9&nbsp;g at all weights.<ref name=Jenkins_p33-4 />\n\nThe F-15 Multistage Improvement Program (MSIP) was initiated in February 1983 with the first production MSIP F-15C produced in 1985. Improvements included an upgraded central computer; a Programmable Armament Control Set, allowing for advanced versions of the [[AIM-7]], [[AIM-9]], and [[AIM-120A]] missiles; and an expanded Tactical Electronic Warfare System that provides improvements to the ALR-56C radar warning receiver and ALQ-135 countermeasure set. The final 43 F-15Cs included the Hughes APG-70 radar developed for the F-15E; these are sometimes referred as Enhanced Eagles. Earlier MSIP F-15Cs with the APG-63 were upgraded to the APG-63(V)1 to improve maintainability and to perform similar to the APG-70. Existing F-15s were [[retrofitted]] with these improvements.<ref>Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 161\u201365.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, McDonnell Douglas and F-15 radar manufacturer, [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]], teamed to privately develop a [[strike fighter]] version of the F-15. This version competed in the Air Force's [[Enhanced Tactical Fighter|Dual-Role Fighter]] competition starting in 1982. The [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E]] strike variant was selected for production over General Dynamics' competing [[F-16XL]] in 1984.<ref>Davies 2003, pp. 15\u201316, 25, 31\u201332.</ref> Beginning in 1985, F-15C and D models were equipped with the improved P&W F100-PW-220 engine and digital engine controls, providing quicker throttle response, reduced wear, and lower fuel consumption.

The wing planform of the F-15 suggests a modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge sweepback angle of 45\u00b0. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are used. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.<ref>{{cite web|title=F-15 Eagle Design|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/f-15-design.htm|website=Global Security dot org|publisher=John Pike|accessdate=July 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[empennage]] is metal and composite construction, with twin aluminium/[[composite material]] [[honeycomb structure]] [[vertical stabilizer]]s with [[boron]]-composite [[Skin (aeronautics)|skin]], resulting in an exceptionally thin tailplane and rudders.  Composite horizontal [[stabilator|all-moving tails]] outboard of the vertical stabilizers move independently to provide roll control in some flight maneuvers.  The F-15 has a spine-mounted [[air brake (aircraft)|air brake]] and [[Retractable landing gear|retractable]] [[tricycle gear|tricycle]] [[landing gear]]. It is powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] [[axial compressor]] [[turbofan]] engines with [[afterburner]]s, mounted side-by-side in the fuselage and fed by [[intake ramp]]s. The [[cockpit]] is mounted high in the forward fuselage with a one-piece windscreen and large canopy for increased visibility and a 360\u00b0 field of view for the pilot.  The airframe began to incorporate advanced [[superplastic forming|superplastically]] formed titanium components in the 1980s.\n\nThe F-15's maneuverability is derived from low [[wing loading]] (weight to wing area ratio) with a high [[thrust-to-weight ratio]], enabling the aircraft to turn tightly without losing [[airspeed]]. The F-15 can climb to {{convert|30000|ft}} in around 60 seconds. The [[thrust]] output of the dual engines is greater than the aircraft's combat weight, so it has the ability to accelerate vertically. The weapons and flight-control systems are designed so that one person can safely and effectively perform air-to-air combat.<ref name=eden>Eden and Moeng 2002, p. 944.</ref> The A and C models are single-seat variants; these were the main air-superiority versions produced. B and D models add a second seat behind the pilot for training. E models use the second seat for a [[weapon systems officer]]. Visibly, the F-15 has a unique feature'' vis-\u00e0-vis ''other modern fighter aircraft; it does not have the distinctive \"turkey feather\" aerodynamic exhaust petals covering its [[De Laval nozzle|engine nozzles]], because the petal design on the F-15 was problematic and could fall off in flight; therefore, they were removed, resulting in a 3% [[aerodynamic drag]] increase.<ref>Davies and Dildy 2007, pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\n===Avionics===\n[[File:AN-APG-63, view 1, X-band pulse-doppler radar, Hughes Aircraft, 1973 - National Electronics Museum - DSC00395.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[AN/APG-63]] radar]]\n\nA multimission [[avionics]] system includes a [[head-up display]] (HUD), advanced radar, [[AN/ASN-109]] [[inertial guidance system]], flight instruments, [[ultra high frequency]]  communications, and [[tactical air navigation system]] and [[instrument landing system]]  receivers.

These radars can detect and track aircraft and small high-speed targets at distances [[beyond visual range]] down to close range, and at altitudes down to treetop level. The APG-63 has a basic range of {{convert|100|mi|nmi km}}.  The radar feeds target information into the central computer for effective weapons delivery. For close-in [[dogfight]]s, the radar automatically acquires enemy aircraft, and this information is projected on the head-up display. The F-15's [[electronic warfare]] system provides both threat warning ([[radar warning receiver]]) and automatic countermeasures against selected threats.<ref name=Jenkins_p97>Jenkins 1998, pp. 97\u2013104.</ref>\n\n===Weaponry and external stores===\n[[File:M61 Vulcan Mount on F15.jpg|thumb|[[M61 Vulcan]] mounted on the side of right engine intake]]\n\nA variety of air-to-air weaponry can be carried by the F-15. An automated weapon system enables the pilot to release weapons effectively and safely, using the head-up display and the avionics and weapons controls located on the engine throttles or control stick. When the pilot changes from one weapon system to another, visual guidance for the required weapon automatically appears on the head-up display.<ref>Huenecke 1987, pp. 232\u2013236.</ref>\n\nThe Eagle can be armed with combinations of four different air-to-air weapons: [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AIM-7F/M Sparrow]] missiles or [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles on its lower fuselage corners, [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L/M Sidewinder]] or AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles on two pylons under the wings, and an internal {{convert|20|mm}} [[M61 Vulcan]] [[Gatling gun]] in the right [[wing root]].<ref name=lambert>Lambert 1993, p. 521.</ref>\n\n[[File:F-15C AIM-9 AIM-120 m02006120700063.jpg|thumb|left|F-15C underside with external stores]]\nLow-drag conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) were developed for the F-15C and D models. They can be attached to the sides of the engine air intakes under each wing and are designed to the same load factors and airspeed limits as the basic aircraft.<ref name=lambert /> These tanks slightly degrade performance by increasing aerodynamic drag and cannot be jettisoned in-flight. However, they cause less drag than conventional external tanks. Each conformal tank can hold 750 U.S. [[gallon]]s (2,840 l) of fuel.<ref name=Jenkins_p111>Jenkins 1998, p. 111.</ref> These CFTs increase range and reduce the need for [[aerial refueling|in-flight refueling]]. All external stations for munitions remain available with the tanks in use. Moreover, Sparrow or AMRAAM missiles can be attached to the corners of the CFTs.<ref name=green>Green and Swanborough 1998, p. 371.</ref> The 57 FIS based at Keflavik NAS, Iceland, was the only C-model squadron to use CFTs on a regular basis due to its extended operations over the North Atlantic. With the closure of the 57 FIS, the F-15E is the only variant to carry them on a routine basis. CFTs have also been sold to Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\n===Upgrades===\n[[File:F-15E with the speed brake up.jpg|thumb|upright|F-15E with [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brake]] deployed and CFTs fitted]]\n\nThe [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle]] is a two-seat, dual-role, totally integrated fighter for all-weather, air-to-air, and deep [[air interdiction|interdiction]] missions.

The F-111 manufacturer [[General Dynamics]] partnered with [[Grumman]] on the Navy F-111B. With the F-111B program in distress, Grumman began studying improvements and alternatives.

Much of the testing, including the first of many compressor stalls and multiple ejections, took place over Long Island Sound. In order to save time and forestall interference from Secretary McNamara, the Navy skipped the prototype phase and jumped directly to full-scale development; the Air Force took a similar approach with its [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]].<ref name=\"Jenkins\">Jenkins, Dennis R.

The [[United States Marine Corps]] was initially interested in the F-14 as an F-4 Phantom II replacement; going so far as to send officers to Fighter Squadron One Twenty-Four ([[VF-124]]) to train as instructors. The Marine Corps pulled out of any procurement when the development of the stores' management system for ground attack munitions was not pursued. An air-to-ground capability was not developed until the 1990s.<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/>\n\nFiring trials involved launches against simulated targets of various types, from cruise missiles to high-flying bombers.

So the early arrangement of the AIM-54A Phoenix [[Active radar homing|active-radar]] air-to-air missile, the AIM-7E-2 Sparrow [[semi-active radar homing]] air-to-air missile, and the AIM-9J Sidewinder [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking]] air-to-air missile was replaced in the 1980s with the B (1983) and C (1986) version of the Phoenix, the F (1977), M (1982), P (1987 or later) for Sparrows, and with the Sidewinder, L (1979) and M (1982).

[[VFAX]] was revived in the 1970s as a lower cost solution to replacing the Navy and Marine Corps's fleets of F-4s, and A-7s. VFAX was directed to review the fighters in the USAF [[Light Weight Fighter]] competition, which led to the development of the F/A-18 Hornet as roughly a midsize fighter and attack aircraft.  In 1994, Congress would reject Grumman proposals to the Navy to upgrade the Tomcat beyond the D model (such as the Super Tomcat 21, the cheaper QuickStrike version, and the more advanced Attack Super Tomcat 21).<ref name=\"Donald\">Donald 2004, pp. 13, 15.</ref>\n\n===Ground attack upgrades===\n[[File:F14Missile.jpg|thumb|An F-14D launching an [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]; a [[GBU-24 Paveway III]] is also carried.]]\n\nIn the 1990s, with the pending retirement of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]], the F-14 [[Ground attack aircraft|air-to-ground]] program was resurrected.

However, the upgrades would have taken too long to implement to meet the gap, and were priced in the billions. The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] considered this too expensive for an interim solution.<ref name=\"Warplanes\"/> A quick, inexpensive upgrade using the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night ([[LANTIRN]]) targeting pod was devised.

[[John Lehman]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] in the 1980s, told the U.S. Congress that the TF30/F-14 combination was \"probably the worst engine/airframe mismatch we have had in years\" and that the TF30 was \"a terrible engine\";<ref name=\"Dorr p.50.\"/><ref name=\"Sgarlato_p40-46\"/> 28% of all F-14 accidents were attributed to the engine. A high frequency of turbine [[Turbine engine failure|blade failures]] led to the reinforcement of the entire engine bay to limit damage from such failures. The engines also had proved to be extremely prone to [[compressor stall]]s, which could easily result in loss of control, severe yaw oscillations, and could lead to an unrecoverable [[spin (flight)|flat spin]]. At specific altitudes, exhaust produced by missile launches could cause an engine compressor [[stall (engine)|stall]].  This led to the development of a bleed system that temporarily blocks the frontal [[intake ramp]] and reduces engine power during missile launch.

At the time, the Tomcat had been thought too large and vulnerable to be used over land, but the need for imagery was so great that Tomcat aircrews developed high-speed medium altitude tactics to deal with considerable AAA and [[SA-7]] SAM threat in the Bekaa area. The first exposure of a Navy Tomcat to an [[SA-2]] missile was over Somalia in April 1983 when a local battery was unaware of two Tomcats scheduled for a TARPS mission in a prelude to an upcoming international exercise in the vicinity of Berbera. An SA-2 was fired at the second Tomcat while conducting 10,000-ft mapping profile at max conserve setting. The Tomcat aircrews spotted the missile launch and dove for the deck thereby evading it without damage. The unexpected demand for combat TARPS laid the way for high altitude sensors such as the KA-93 Long Range Optics (LOROP) to be rapidly procured for the Tomcat as well as an Expanded Chaff Adapter (ECA) to be incorporated in an AIM-54 Phoenix Rail. Commercial \"Fuzz buster\" type radar detectors were also procured and mounted in pairs in the forward cockpit as a stop gap solution to detect SAM radars such as the SA-6.

Until the waning days of Desert Storm, in-country air superiority was tasked to USAF [[F-15 Eagle]]s due to the way the Air Tasking Orders (ATO) delegated primary overland CAP stations to the F-15 Eagle. The governing Rules of Engagement (ROE) also dictated a strict Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) requirement when employing Beyond Visual Range weapons such as the AIM-7 Sparrow and particularly the AIM-54 Phoenix.

In the early 1970s, the Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) was searching for an advanced fighter, specifically one capable of intercepting Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25]] reconnaissance flights. After a visit of U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to Iran in 1972, during which Iran was offered the latest in American military technology, the IIAF narrowed its choice between the F-14 Tomcat or the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]]. Grumman Corporation arranged a competitive demonstration of the Eagle against the Tomcat before the Shah, and in January 1974, Iran ordered 30 F-14s and 424 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles, initiating Project ''Persian King'', worth US$300&nbsp;million. A few months later, this order was increased to a total of 80 Tomcats and 714 Phoenix missiles as well as spare parts and replacement engines for 10 years, complete armament package, and support infrastructure (including construction of the [[Isfahan International Airport|Khatami Air Base]] near [[Isfahan]]).\n\nThe first F-14 arrived in January 1976, modified only by the removal of classified avionics components, but fitted with the TF-30-414 engines. The following year 12 more were delivered. Meanwhile, training of the first groups of Iranian crews by the U.S. Navy was underway in the US; one of these conducted a successful shoot-down with a Phoenix missile of a target drone flying at {{convert|50000|ft|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nFollowing the [[Iranian Revolution|overthrow of the Shah]] in 1979, the air force was renamed the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force]] (IRIAF) and the post-revolution [[Interim Government of Iran|interim government of Iran]] canceled most Western arms orders. In 1980, an Iranian F-14 shot down an Iraqi [[Mil Mi-24|Mil Mi-25]] helicopter for its first air-to-air kill during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988).<ref name=\"Persian Cats\">Cooper, Tom.

They were also crucial to the defense of areas deemed vital by the Iranian government, such as oil terminals on [[Kharg Island]] and industrial infrastructure in the capital [[Tehran]]. Many of these patrols had the support of [[Boeing 707#707-320C|Boeing 707-3J9C]] in-flight refueling tankers. As fighting escalated between 1982 and 1986, the F-14s gradually became more involved in the battle. They performed well, but their primary role was to intimidate the Iraqi Air Force and avoid heavy engagement to protect the fleet's numbers. Their presence was often enough to drive away opposing Iraqi fighters. The precision and effectiveness of the Tomcat's AWG-9 weapons system and AIM-54A Phoenix long-range air-to-air missiles enabled the F-14 to maintain air superiority.<ref name=\"Persian Cats \u2013 acig.org\" /><ref name=\"Iran \u2013 National Interest\">{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/revealed-irans-air-force-flies-american-made-f-14-tomcats-16758|title=Fact: Iran's Air Force Flies American-Made F-14 Tomcats|last=Axe|first=David|date=28 June 2016|work=The National Interest|accessdate=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jalil Z.jpg|thumb|right|Iranian ace [[Jalil Zandi]] is credited with shooting down 11 Iraqi aircraft during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], making him the most successful F-14 pilot.<ref name=\"Combat 2004, pp. 85\">Cooper, Tom and Farzad Bishop.

The F-14A's TF30 engine was replaced with the improved [[General Electric F110|GE F110-GE-400]] engine. The F-14A+ also received the state-of-the-art [[ALR-67]] Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) system. Much of the avionics suite, as well as the AWG-9 radar, were retained.

In the overland attack role this gave the F-14D 60 percent more striking range or one-third more time on station. The rate of climb was increased by 61 percent. The F110's increased thrust allowed almost all carrier launches to be made in military (dry) power. While this did result in fuel savings, the main reason not to use afterburner during carrier launches was that if an engine failed the F110's thrust in full afterburner would produce a yawing moment too abruptly for the pilot to correct.

Cheney called the F-14 a \"jobs program\", and when the F-14 was canceled, an estimated 80,000 jobs of Grumman employees, subcontractors, or support personnel were affected.<ref>Saul, Stephanie. \"Cheney Aims Barrage at F-14D Calls keeping jet a jobs program.\" ''Newsday'' Washington Bureau, 24 August 1989, p. 6.</ref> Starting in 2005, some F-14Ds received the [[ROVER|ROVER III]] upgrade.\n\n===Projected variants===\nThe first ''F-14B'' was to be an improved version of the F-14A with more powerful \"Advanced Technology Engine\" [[Pratt & Whitney F401|F401]] turbofans.  The ''F-14C'' was a projected variant of this initial F-14B with advanced multi-mission avionics.<ref>Spick 2000, p. 75.</ref>  Grumman also offered an interceptor version of the F-14B in response to the U.S. Air Force's Improved Manned Interceptor Program to replace the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]] as an [[Aerospace Defense Command]] interceptor in the 1970s.  The F-14B program was terminated in April 1974.<ref>Isham, Marty. ''U.S. Air Force Interceptors: A Military Photo Logbook 1946\u20131979''.

The first was the ''Quickstrike'', which was an F-14D with navigational and targeting pods, additional attach points for weapons, and added ground attack capabilities to its radar. The Quickstrike was to fill the role of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] after it was retired. This was not considered enough of an improvement by Congress, so the company shifted to the ''Super Tomcat 21'' proposed design. The Super Tomcat 21 was a proposed lower cost alternative to the [[Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter|Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (NATF). The Grumman design would have the same shape and body as the Tomcat, and an upgraded [[AN/APG-71]] radar. New GE F110-129 engines were to provide a supercruise speed of Mach 1.3 and featured thrust vectoring nozzles. The version would have increased fuel capacity and modified control surfaces for improved takeoffs and lower landing approach speed. The ''Attack Super Tomcat 21'' version was the last Super Tomcat proposed design. It added even more fuel capacity, more improvements to control surfaces, and possibly an [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar from the canceled [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|A-12]] attack aircraft.<ref name=Donald_p9-11/>\n\nThe last \"Tomcat\" variant was the ''ASF-14'' (Advanced Strike Fighter-14), Grumman's replacement for the NATF concept. By all accounts, it would not be even remotely related to the previous Tomcats save in appearance, incorporating the new technology and design know-how from the [[Advanced Tactical Fighter]] (ATF) and [[McDonnell Douglas A-12 Avenger II|Advanced Tactical Aircraft]] (ATA) programs. The ASF-14 would have been a new-build aircraft; however, its projected capabilities were not that much better than that of the (A)ST-21 variants.<ref>[http://anft.net/f-14/f14-history-f14x.htm \"F-14 History.\"] anft.net. Retrieved: 16 November 2010.</ref> In the end, the Attack Super Tomcat was considered to be too costly.

The F-117 was based on the ''[[Lockheed Have Blue|Have Blue]]'' technology demonstrator.\n\nThe Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft to be designed around [[stealth technology]]. Its [[maiden flight]] took place in 1981, and the aircraft achieved [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983.  The Nighthawk was shrouded in secrecy until it was revealed to the public in 1988. Of the 64 F-117s built, 59 were production versions, with the other five being prototypes.\n\nThe F-117 was widely publicized for its role in the Persian [[Gulf War]] of 1991. Although it was commonly referred to as the \"Stealth Fighter\", it was strictly a ground-attack aircraft. F-117s took part in the conflict in [[Yugoslav Wars|Yugoslavia]], where [[1999 F-117A shootdown|one was shot down]] by a [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) in 1999; it was the only Nighthawk to be lost in combat. The U.S. Air Force retired the F-117 in 2008, primarily due to the fielding of the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]].\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Background and ''Have Blue'' ===\n{{Main|Lockheed Have Blue}}\n\nIn 1964, [[Pyotr Ufimtsev]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] mathematician, published a seminal paper titled ''Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction'' in the journal of the Moscow Institute for Radio Engineering, in which he showed that the strength of the [[radar]] return from an object is related to its edge configuration, not its size.<ref name=\"dtic\" /> Ufimtsev was extending theoretical work published by the German physicist [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref name=\"Centennial\" /><ref name=\"diffraction\" /><ref name=\"filling\" /> Ufimtsev demonstrated that he could calculate the [[radar cross-section]] across a wing's surface and along its edge. The obvious and logical conclusion was that even a large aircraft could reduce its radar signature by exploiting this principle. However, the resulting design would make the aircraft [[Relaxed stability|aerodynamically unstable]], and the state of computer technology in the early 1960s could not provide the kinds of flight computers which would later allow aircraft such as the F-117 and [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] to stay airborne. By the 1970s, when Lockheed analyst Denys Overholser found Ufimtsev's paper, computers and software had advanced significantly, and the stage was set for the development of a stealthy airplane.<ref name=\"Advent\" />\n\n[[File:F-117 Grey Dragon.jpg|thumb|F-117A painted in \"Gray Dragon\" experimental camouflage scheme|alt=Aircraft parked inside an open hangar]]\nThe F-117 was born after combat experience in the [[Vietnam War]] when increasingly sophisticated [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) downed heavy bombers.<ref name=\"air-attack\" /> It was a [[black project]], an ultra-secret program for much of its life: very few people in [[the Pentagon]] knew the program even existed, until the F-117s were revealed to the public in 1988.<ref name=\"maxwell\" /><ref name=\"bbc\" /> The project began in 1975 with a model called the \"Hopeless Diamond\"<ref name=\"rich\" /><ref name=\"f117reunion\" /> (a wordplay on the [[Hope Diamond]] because of its appearance). The following year, the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) issued Lockheed Skunk Works a contract to build and test two Stealth Strike Fighters, under the code name \"''[[Lockheed Have Blue|Have Blue]]''\".<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" /> These subscale aircraft incorporated jet engines of the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|Northrop T-38A]], [[fly-by-wire]] systems of the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], landing gear of the [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10]], and [[Built environment|environmental systems]] of the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]].<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" /> By bringing together existing technology and components, Lockheed built two demonstrators under budget, at $35&nbsp;million for both aircraft, and in record time.<ref name=\"Goodall p.19\" />\n\nThe [[maiden flight]] of the demonstrators occurred on 1&nbsp;December 1977.<ref name=\"eden\" /> Although both aircraft were lost during the demonstration program, test data proved positive. The success of ''Have Blue'' led the government to increase funding for [[stealth technology]]. Much of that increase was allocated towards the production of an operational stealth aircraft, the Lockheed F-117A, under the program code name \"''Senior Trend''\".<ref name=\"goodall\" /><ref name=\"f-117a\" />\n\n=== ''Senior Trend'' ===\nThe decision to produce the F-117A was made on 1 November 1978, and a contract was awarded to Lockheed Advanced Development Projects, popularly known as the Skunk Works, in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California.<ref name=\"rich1\" /> The program was led by [[Ben Rich]], with Alan Brown as manager of the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzQPIlXe2H0|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>  Rich called on Bill Schroeder, a Lockheed mathematician, and Denys Overholser, a computer scientist, to exploit Ufimtsev's work. The three designed a computer program called \"Echo\", which made it possible to design an airplane with flat panels, called facets, which were arranged so as to scatter over 99% of a radar's signal energy \"painting\" the aircraft.<ref name=\"Advent\" /><ref name=\"discovery\" /><ref name=\"air-attack\" />\n\nThe first YF-117A, serial number ''79-0780'', made its maiden flight from [[Area 51|Groom Lake]], Nevada, on 18 June 1981,<ref name=\"Goodall p.27\" /> only 31 months after the full-scale development decision. The first production F-117A was delivered in 1982, and operational capability was achieved in October 1983.<ref name=\"Centennial\" /><ref name=\"Goodall p.29\" /> The [[4450th Tactical Group]] stationed at [[Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]] were tasked with the operational development of the early F-117, and between 1981 (prior to the arrival of the first models) and 1989 they used [[LTV A-7 Corsair II]]s for training, to bring all pilots to a common flight training baseline and later as chase planes for F-117A tests.<ref name=Holder&Wallace>{{cite book |last1=Holder |first1=Bill |last2=Wallace |first2=Mike |title=Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk: An Illustrated History of the Stealth Fighter |date=2000 |publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd |location=Atglen, PA |isbn=978-0-7643-0067-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Force denied the existence of the aircraft until 10 November 1988, when Assistant Secretary of Defense [[J. Daniel Howard]] displayed a grainy photograph at a Pentagon press conference, disproving the many inaccurate rumors about the shape of the secret \"[[F-19]]\". After the announcement pilots could fly the F-117 during daytime and no longer needed to be associated with the A-7, flying the T-38 [[supersonic]] trainer for travel and training instead.{{r|crickmorep2003}} In April 1990, two F-117 aircraft were flown into [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, arriving during daylight and publicly displayed to a crowd of tens of thousands.<ref name=\"dreamlandresort\">Gregos, J.

The F-117A program demonstrates that a stealth aircraft can be designed for reliability and maintainability.\"<ref name=\"Nat_Museum_factsht\" />\n\n=== Designation ===\nThe operational aircraft was officially designated \"F-117A\".<ref name=\"dtic3\" />  Most modern U.S. military aircraft use [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|post-1962 designations]] in which the designation \"F\" is usually an [[Fighter aircraft|air-to-air fighter]], \"B\" is usually a [[bomber]], \"A\" is usually a ground-attack aircraft, etc. (Examples include the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]], the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]], and the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6]].)  The F-117 is primarily an attack aircraft,<ref name=eden_p240>{{harvnb|Eden|2004|p=240.}}</ref> so its \"F\" designation is inconsistent with the [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] system. This is an inconsistency that has been repeatedly employed by the [[U.S. Air Force]] with several of its attack aircraft since the late 1950s, including the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]]. A televised documentary quoted project manager Alan Brown as saying that [[Robert J. Dixon]], a four-star Air Force general who was the head of [[Tactical Air Command]] felt that the top-notch USAF fighter pilots required to fly the new aircraft were more easily attracted to an aircraft with an \"F\" designation for fighter, as opposed to a bomber (\"B\") or attack (\"A\") designation.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81S4W8rOCgo&t=1658s|title=Modern Marvels S11E62 F117|first=|last=Moderns|date=13 April 2017|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nThe designation \"F-117\" seems to indicate that it was given an official designation prior to the 1962 U.S. Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System and could be considered numerically to be a part of the earlier \"Century series\" of fighters. The assumption prior to the revealing of the aircraft to the public was that it would likely receive the [[F-19]] designation as that number had not been used. However, there were no other aircraft to receive a \"100\" series number following the F-111. Soviet fighters obtained by the U.S. via various means under the [[Constant Peg]] program<ref name=\"airforce-magazine\" /> were given F-series numbers for their evaluation by U.S. pilots, and with the advent of the [[Teen Series]] fighters, most often [[Century Series]] designations.<ref name=\"Merlin_groom_2011_p32\">{{cite book |title=Images of Aviation: Area 51 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |author=Peter W.

This same radio call had been used by the enigmatic [[4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron]], also known as the \"Red Hats\" or \"Red Eagles\", that often had flown expatriated [[Mikoyan#List of MiG aircraft|MiG jet fighters]] in the area, but there was no relationship to the call and the formal F-19 designation then being considered by the Air Force. Apparently, use of the \"117\" radio call became commonplace and when Lockheed released its first flight manual (i.e., the Air Force \"dash one\" manual for the aircraft), F-117A was the designation printed on the cover.<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:F-117 Front View.jpg|thumb|Front view of an F-117|alt=Closeup view of the nose of a black jet, emphasizing the many angled-surfaces]]\n\nWhen the Air Force first approached Lockheed with the stealth concept, Skunk Works Director Kelly Johnson proposed a rounded design. He believed smoothly blended shapes offered the best combination of speed and stealth. However, his assistant, Ben Rich, showed that faceted-angle surfaces would provide significant reduction in radar signature, and the necessary aerodynamic control could be provided with computer units. A May 1975 Skunk Works report, \"Progress Report No. 2, High Stealth Conceptual Studies\", showed the rounded concept, which was rejected in favor of the flat-sided approach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/secrets-skunk-works-180952122/?page=6%5D|title=Secrets of the Skunk Works \u2013 'Little Harvey, Concept B'|first=Chad|last=Slattery|publisher=[[Air & Space/Smithsonian]]}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting unusual design surprised and puzzled experienced pilots; a [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, who flew it as an [[exchange officer]] while it was still a secret project, stated that when he first saw a photograph of the F-117, he \"promptly giggled and thought to [himself] 'this clearly can't fly{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"crickmore\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IOshjF1z5dgC&lpg=PT69&pg=PT69#v=onepage&f=false|title=Nighthawk F-117 Stealth Fighter|publisher=Zenith Imprint|author=Crickmore, Paul and Alison J.|origyear=1999|year=2003|pages=85\u201386|isbn=978-1-61060-737-7}}</ref> Early stealth aircraft were designed with a focus on minimal [[radar cross-section]] (RCS) rather than aerodynamic performance.

To lower development costs, the avionics, fly-by-wire systems, and other parts were derived from the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle]]. The parts were originally described as spares on budgets for these aircraft, to keep the F-117 project secret.\n\n[[File:Lockheed F-117A cockpit at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Dayton, Ohio, USA.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\nThe aircraft is equipped with sophisticated navigation and attack systems integrated into a digital avionics suite. It navigates primarily by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and high-accuracy [[inertial navigation]]. Missions are coordinated by an automated planning system that can automatically perform all aspects of an attack mission, including weapons release. Targets are acquired by a [[thermal imaging]] [[infrared]] system, slaved to a [[laser rangefinder]]/[[laser designator]] that finds the range and designates targets for [[laser-guided bomb]]s. The F-117A's split internal bay can carry {{convert|5000|lb}} of ordnance. Typical weapons are a pair of [[GBU-10]], [[GBU-12]], or [[GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs, two [[BLU-109]] penetration bombs, or two Joint Direct Attack Munitions ([[JDAM]]s), a GPS/INS guided stand-off bomb.\n\n=== Stealth ===\n{{Main|Stealth aircraft}}\n\nThe F-117 has a [[radar cross-section]] of about {{Convert|0.001|m2|sqft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"richardson\" /> Among the penalties for stealth are lower engine thrust due to losses in the inlet and outlet, a very low wing [[Aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]], and a high [[sweep angle]] (50\u00b0) needed to deflect incoming radar waves to the sides.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" /> With these design considerations and no [[afterburner]], the F-117 is limited to subsonic speeds.\n\nThe F-117A carries no radar, which lowers emissions and cross-section, and whether it carries any radar detection equipment is classified.<ref name=\"Sweetman AS dj2008\" />\n\nThe F-117A's [[faceting|faceted]] shape (made from 2-dimensional flat surfaces) resulted from the limitations of the 1970s-era computer technology used to calculate its radar cross-section. Later [[supercomputer]]s made it possible for subsequent aircraft like the [[B-2 bomber]] to use curved surfaces while maintaining stealth, through the use of far more computational resources to perform the additional calculations.<ref name=\"rich4\" />\n\nAn exhaust plume contributes a significant [[infrared signature]]. The F-117 reduces IR signature with a non-circular [[exhaust system|tail pipe]] (a slit shape) to minimize the exhaust cross-sectional volume and maximize the mixing of hot exhaust with cool ambient air. The F-117 lacks [[afterburner]]s, because the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature, and breaking the [[sound barrier]] would produce an obvious [[sonic boom]], as well as surface heating of the aircraft skin which also increases the infrared footprint. As a result, its performance in [[air combat maneuvering]] required in a [[dogfight]] would never match that of a dedicated fighter aircraft. This was unimportant in the case of this aircraft since it was designed to be a bomber.\n\n[[Passive radar|Passive (multistatic) radar]], [[bistatic radar]]<ref name=\"Bistatic Radar Sets\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/05.bistatic/bs04.en.html|title=Bistatic Radar Sets|publisher=Radartutorial.eu|accessdate=16 December 2010}}</ref> and especially [[multistatic radar]] systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional [[monostatic radar]]s, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy away from the transmitter's [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], effectively increasing the [[radar cross section]] (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:F-117A GBU-28.JPEG|thumb|An F-117 conducts a live exercise bombing run using [[GBU-27]] laser-guided bombs.]]\n\nDuring the program's early years, from 1984 to mid-1992, the F-117A fleet was based at [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]], [[Nevada]], where it served under the 4450th Tactical Group. Because the F-117 was classified during this time, the unit was officially located at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], Nevada, and equipped with [[A-7 Corsair II]] aircraft. All military personnel were permanently assigned to Nellis AFB, and most personnel and their families lived in Las Vegas. This required commercial air and trucking to transport personnel between Las Vegas and Tonopah each week. The 4450th was absorbed by the [[37th Fighter Wing|37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] in 1989. In 1992, the entire fleet was transferred to [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]], under the command of the [[49th Fighter Wing]]. This move also eliminated the [[Key Air]] and [[American Trans Air]] contract flights to Tonopah, which flew 22,000 passenger trips on 300 flights from Nellis to Tonopah per month.\n\nThe F-117 reached [[initial operating capability]] status in 1983.<ref name=\"Nat_Museum_factsht\" />  The Nighthawk's pilots called themselves \"Bandits\". Each of the 558 Air Force pilots who have flown the F-117 has a Bandit number, such as \"Bandit 52\", that indicates the sequential order of their first flight in the F-117.<ref name=\"Topolsky\" />\n\nThe F-117 has been used several times in war. Its first mission was during the [[United States invasion of Panama]] in 1989.<ref name=\"Tread\" /> During that invasion two F-117A Nighthawks dropped two bombs on Rio Hato airfield.\n\nDuring the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, the F-117 flew approximately 1,300 sorties and scored direct hits on 1,600 high-value targets in Iraq<ref name=\"Nat_Museum_factsht\" /> over 6,905 flight hours.<ref name=\"frontline\" /> [[Leaflet drop]]s on Iraqi forces displayed the F-117 destroying ground targets and warned \"Escape now and save yourselves\".{{r|crickmorep2003}} Initial claims of its effectiveness were later found to be overstated. For instance it was claimed that the F-117 made up 2.5% of [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] tactical aircraft in Iraq and they attacked more than 40% of the strategic targets;<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> this ignored the fact that only 229 Coalition aircraft could drop and designate laser-guided bombs of which 36 F-117 represented 15.7%, and only the USAF had the I-2000 bombs intended for hardened targets, so the F-117 represented 32% of all coalition aircraft that could deliver such bombs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns97134.pdf|title=OPERATION DESERT STORM Evaluation of the Air Campaign GAO/NSIAD-97-134|pages=73\u201374|publisher=General Accounting Office|date=12 June 1997}}</ref> Initial reports of F-117s hitting 80% of their targets were later scaled back to \"41\u201360%\".<ref>GAO/NSIAD-97-134 p132</ref> On the first night, they failed to hit 40% of their assigned air-defense targets, including the Air Defense Operations Center in Baghdad, and 8 such targets remained functional out of 10 that could be assessed.<ref>GAO/NSIAD-97-134 pp. 136\u201337</ref> In their Desert Storm white paper, the USAF claimed that \"the F-117 was the only airplane that the planners dared risk over downtown Baghdad\" and that this area was particularly well defended.<ref name=GAO1378>GAO/NSIAD-97-134 pp. 137\u201338. Dozens of F-16s were routinely tasked to attack Baghdad in the first few days of the war.</ref> In fact, most of the air defenses were on the outskirts of the city and many other aircraft hit targets in the downtown area, with minimal casualties when they attacked at night like the F-117.<ref name=GAO1378 /> This meant they avoided the optically aimed [[Anti-aircraft cannon#AA warfare systems|AAA]] and infra-red [[Surface-to-Air Missile|SAMs]] which were the biggest threat to Coalition aircraft.<ref>GAO/NSIAD-97-134 p. 105</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was operated in secret from Tonopah for almost a decade, but after the Gulf War the aircraft moved to Holloman in 1992 \u2013 however its integration with the USAF's non-stealth \"iron jets\" occurred slowly.

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]]'s November 1940 production proposals specified heavier armament.<ref>O'Leary 1980, pp. 101\u2013102.</ref> The increased armament comprised three .50 caliber machine guns mounted in each wing panel. This improvement greatly increased the ability of the Corsair to shoot down enemy aircraft.\n\nFormal U.S. Navy acceptance trials for the XF4U-1 began in February 1941. The Navy entered into a letter of intent on 3 March 1941, received Vought's production proposal on 2 April and awarded Vought a contract for 584 F4U-1 fighters, which were given the name \"Corsair\" \u2014 inherited from the firm's late-1920s [[Vought O2U]] naval biplane scout which first bore the name \u2014 on 30 June of the same year.

To extract as much power as possible, a relatively large [[Hamilton Standard]] Hydromatic three-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m}} was used.\n\n===Landing gear and wings===\n[[File:F4U-Corsair OE-EAS OTT 2013 04 main landing gear.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Landing gear on an F4U-4 Corsair.]]\nTo accommodate a folding wing the designers considered retracting the main landing gear rearward but, for the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord of wing]] that was chosen, it was difficult to make the landing gear struts long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an [[gull wing|inverted gull wing]], which considerably shortened the required length of the struts.<ref name=\"Green p. 188\">Green 1973, p. 188.</ref> The [[Dihedral (aircraft)|anhedral]] of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing [[Parasitic drag|drag]], without using wing root fairings.<ref name=\"Green p. 188\"/> The bent wing, however, was heavier and more difficult to construct, offsetting these benefits.\n\nThe Corsair's aerodynamics were an advance over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U was the first U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear [[oleo strut]]s \u2014 each with its own strut door enclosing it when retracted \u2014 rotated through 90\u00b0 during retraction, with the wheel atop the lower end of the strut when retracted. A pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing.<ref name=\"Swinhert\">Swinhert, Earl.

Retrieved: 3 March 2007.</ref> This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss P-40]] (and its predecessor, the [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]]), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]]. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the [[supercharger]] air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of [[aluminum]]<ref>Kinzey, Bert. ''F4U Corsair In Detail And Scale, Part 1''. Carrollton, Texas: Squadron/Signal Publications Inc., 1998. {{ISBN|1-888974-08-7}}.</ref> and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of [[spot welding]], thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced [[fighter aircraft]] to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main [[Spar (aviation)|spar]] and armament bays, and for the [[aileron]]s, [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]] and [[rudder]]. The elevators were also constructed from plywood.<ref>Russell 1984, p. 26.</ref> The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full [[flap (aircraft)|flap]] deployment of 60\u00b0.\n\n===Technical issues===\nIn part because of its advances in technology and a top speed greater than existing Navy aircraft, numerous technical problems had to be solved before the Corsair entered service. Carrier suitability was a major development issue, prompting changes to the main landing gear, tail wheel and [[tailhook]]. Early F4U-1s had difficulty recovering from developed spins, since the inverted gull wing's shape interfered with elevator authority. It was also found that the Corsair's right wing could [[Stall (flight)|stall]] and drop rapidly and without warning during slow carrier landings.<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1944, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> In addition, if the throttle were suddenly advanced (for example, during an [[Go-around|aborted landing]]) the left wing could stall and drop so quickly that the fighter could flip over with the rapid increase in power.<ref>Brown 1980, pp. 86\u201387.</ref> These potentially lethal characteristics were later solved through the addition of a small, {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}}-long [[stall strip]] to the leading edge of the outer right wing, just outboard of the gun ports. This allowed the right wing to stall at the same time as the left.<ref name=\"O'Leary 1980, pp.106-107.\">O'Leary 1980, pp. 106\u2013107.</ref>\n[[Image:F4U-1 NACA 1943.jpeg|thumb|An early F4U-1 showing the \"birdcage\" canopy with rearwards production cockpit location.]]\n\nOther problems were encountered during early carrier trials. The combination of an aft cockpit and the Corsair's long nose made landings hazardous for newly trained pilots. During landing approaches, it was found that oil from the opened hydraulically-powered cowl flaps could spatter onto the windscreen, severely reducing visibility, and the undercarriage [[oleo strut]]s had bad rebound characteristics on landing, allowing the aircraft to bounce down the carrier deck.<ref name=\"O'Leary 1980, pp.106-107.\"/> The first problem was solved by locking the top cowl flaps in front of the windscreen down permanently, then replacing them with a fixed panel. The undercarriage bounce took more time to solve, but eventually a \"bleed valve\" incorporated in the legs allowed the hydraulic pressure to be released gradually as the aircraft landed. The Corsair was not considered fit for carrier use until the wing stall problems and the deck bounce could be solved.\n\nMeanwhile, the more docile and simpler-to-build F6F Hellcat had begun entering service in its intended carrier-based use. The Navy wanted to standardize on one type of carrier fighter, and the Hellcat, while slower than the Corsair, was considered simpler to land on a carrier by an inexperienced pilot and proved to be successful almost immediately after introduction. The Navy's decision to choose the Hellcat meant that the Corsair was released to the U.S. Marine Corps. With no initial requirement for carrier landings, the Marine Corps deployed the Corsair to devastating effect from land bases. Corsair deployment aboard U.S. carriers was delayed until late 1944, by which time the last of the carrier landing problems, relating to the Corsair's long nose, had been tackled by the British.{{#tag:ref|A landing technique using a curving approach that kept the LSO (landing signal officer) in view while coming aboard was developed by the [[Royal Navy]] and was adopted by the U.S. Navy.<ref>O'Leary 1980, p. 111.</ref>|group=N}}\n\n===Design modifications===\nProduction F4U-1s featured several major modifications from the XF4U-1. A change of armament to six wing-mounted .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s (three in each outer wing panel) and their ammunition (400 rounds for the inner pair, 375 rounds for the outer)<ref>O'Leary 1980, p. 102.</ref> meant that the location of the wing fuel tanks had to be changed. In order to keep the fuel tank close to the [[center of gravity]], the only available position was in the forward fuselage, ahead of the cockpit. Accordingly, as a 237&nbsp;gal (897&nbsp;l) [[self-sealing fuel tank]] replaced the fuselage mounted armament, the cockpit had to be moved back by {{convert|32|in|mm|abbr=on}} and the fuselage lengthened.<ref name=\"Green p. 188\"/> In addition, 150&nbsp;lb of armor plate was installed, along with a {{convert|1.5|in|mm|adj=on|abbr=on}} bullet-proof windscreen which was set internally, behind the curved [[Plexiglas]] windscreen. The canopy could be jettisoned in an emergency, and half-elliptical planform transparent panels, much like those of certain models of the [[Curtiss P-40]], were inset into the sides of the fuselage's turtledeck structure behind the pilot's headrest, providing the pilot with a limited rear view over his shoulders. A rectangular Plexiglas panel was inset into the lower center section to allow the pilot to see directly beneath the aircraft and assist with deck landings.{{#tag:ref| F2A Buffalos and F4F Wildcats used similar glazed panels. Prior to the F4U-4, Corsair cockpits did not have a complete floor.|group=N}} The engine used was the more powerful R-2800-8 (B series) Double Wasp which produced 2,000&nbsp;hp (1,491&nbsp;kW). On the wings the flaps were changed to a [[NACA cowling|NACA]] slotted type and the ailerons were increased in span to increase the roll rate, with a consequent reduction in flap span.

The framed \"birdcage\" style canopy provided inadequate visibility for deck taxiing, and the long \"hose nose\" and nose-up attitude of the Corsair made it difficult to see straight ahead. The enormous torque of the Double Wasp engine also made it a handful for inexperienced pilots if they were forced to [[Bolter (aeronautics)|bolter]].

The Commander, Air Forces, Pacific had a different opinion, stating that \"In order to simplify spares problems and also to insure flexibility in carrier operations present practice in the Pacific is to assign all Corsairs to Marines and to equip FightRons [fighter squadrons] on medium and light carriers with Hellcats.\"<ref>Bell, p.2</ref> VF-12 soon abandoned its aircraft to the Marines.

For them, it was not as important that the F4U could be recovered aboard a carrier, as they usually flew from land bases. Growing pains aside, Marine Corps squadrons readily took to the radical new fighter. \n\n[[File:Boyingtons Corsair.jpg|thumb|Vought F4U-1A Corsair, BuNo 17883, of Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington, the commander of VMF-214, Vella Lavella end of 1943]]\n\n=====Marine Corps combat=====\n[[Image:Vought F4U-1 Corsairs of VF-17 in flight, 1943.jpg|thumb|Early F4U-1s of VF-17]]\n\nFrom February 1943 onward, the F4U operated from [[Guadalcanal]] and ultimately other bases in the [[Solomon Islands]]. A dozen USMC F4U-1s of VMF-124, commanded by [[Major]] William E. Gise, arrived at [[Honiara International Airport|Henderson Field]] (code name \"Cactus\") on 12 February. The first recorded combat engagement was on 14 February 1943, when Corsairs of VMF-124 under Major Gise assisted P-40s and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]]s in escorting a formation of [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s on a raid against a Japanese aerodrome at [[Kahili Airfield|Kahili]]. Japanese fighters contested the raid and the Americans got the worst of it, with four P-38s, two P-40s, two Corsairs and two Liberators lost. No more than four Japanese Zeros were destroyed. A Corsair was responsible for one of the kills, albeit due to a midair collision. The fiasco was referred to as the \"Saint Valentine's Day Massacre\".<ref>Styling 1995, pp. 6\u20139.</ref><ref>Sherrod 1952, pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> Despite the debut, the Marines quickly learned how to make better use of the aircraft and started demonstrating its superiority over Japanese fighters. By May, the Corsair units were getting the upper hand, and VMF-124 had produced the first Corsair ace, [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Kenneth A. Walsh]], who would rack up a total of 21 kills during the war.<ref>Sherrod 1952, p. 431.</ref> He remembered:\n{{quote|I learned quickly that altitude was paramount. Whoever had altitude dictated the terms of the battle, and there was nothing a Zero pilot could do to change that \u2014 we had him. The F4U could outperform a Zero in every aspect except slow speed manoeuvrability and slow speed rate of climb. Therefore you avoided getting slow when combating a Zero. It took time but eventually we developed tactics and deployed them very effectively... There were times, however, that I tangled with a Zero at slow speed, one on one. In these instances I considered myself fortunate to survive a battle. Of my 21 victories, 17 were against Zeros, and I lost five aircraft in combat. I was shot down three times and I crashed one that ploughed into the line back at base and wiped out another F4U.<ref>Styling 1995, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>}}\n\nVMF-113 was activated on 1 January 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro as part of Marine Base Defense Air Group 41. They were soon given their full complement of 24 F4U Corsairs. On 26 March 1944, while escorting four B-25 bombers on a raid over Ponape, they recorded their first enemy kills, downing eight Japanese aircraft. In April of that year, VMF-113 was tasked with providing air support for the landings at [[Ujelang Atoll|Ujelang]]. Since the assault was unopposed, the squadron quickly returned to striking Japanese targets in the [[Marshall Islands]] for the remainder of 1944.\n\nCorsairs were flown by the \"Black Sheep\" Squadron ([[VMA-214|VMF-214]], led by Marine [[Major]] [[Pappy Boyington|Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington]]) in an area of the Solomon Islands called \"[[New Georgia Sound|The Slot]]\". Boyington was credited with 22 kills in F4Us (of 28 total, including six in an [[American Volunteer Group|AVG]] [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]], although his score with the AVG has been disputed).<ref>Styling 1995, pp. 31, 50, 87, 93.</ref> Other noted Corsair pilots of the period included VMF-124's Kenneth Walsh, [[James E.

Nightfighter versions equipped Navy and Marine units afloat and ashore.\n\nOne particularly unusual kill was scored by Marine Lieutenant R. R. Klingman of [[VMFA-312|VMF-312]] (the \"Checkerboards\") over Okinawa. Klingman was in pursuit of a [[Kawasaki Ki-45]] ''Toryu'' (\"Nick\") twin-engine fighter at high altitude when his guns jammed due to the gun lubrication thickening from the extreme cold. He flew up and chopped off the Ki-45's tail with the big propeller of the Corsair. Despite missing five inches (127&nbsp;mm) off the end of his propeller blades, he managed to land safely after this [[aerial ramming]] attack. He was awarded the [[Navy Cross]].<ref>Current 2011, p. 478.</ref>\n\nAt war's end, Corsairs were ashore on [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], combating the ''kamikaze'', and also were flying from fleet and escort carriers.

On 6 December 1943, the Bureau of Aeronautics issued guidance on weight-reduction measures for the F4U-1, FG-1, and F3A. Corsair squadrons operating from land bases were authorized to remove catapult hooks, arresting hooks, and associated equipment, which eliminated 48 pounds of unnecessary weight.<ref>D\u2019Angina 2014, p.22.</ref> While there are no data to indicate to what extent these modifications where incorporated, there are numerous photos in evidence of Corsairs, of various manufacturers and models, on islands in the Pacific without tailhooks installed.<ref>Sullivan 2010, p.16-21</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ww2 157.jpg|left|thumb|A Corsair fires its rockets at a Japanese stronghold on Okinawa]]\n\n=====Fighter-bomber=====\n\nCorsairs also served well as fighter-bombers in the Central Pacific and the Philippines. By early 1944, Marine pilots were beginning to exploit the type's considerable capabilities in the close-support role in amphibious landings. [[Charles Lindbergh]] flew Corsairs with the Marines as a civilian technical advisor for [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation|United Aircraft Corporation]] in order to determine how best to increase the Corsair's payload and range in the attack role and to help evaluate future viability of single- versus twin-engine fighter design for Vought.<ref name = \"sgyjgp\">[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/wwii/ \"Charles Lindbergh and the 475th Fighter Group\" (from the book ''Lightning Strikes'').\"] ''charleslindbergh.com.''

The U.S. Navy did not get into combat with the type until September 1943. The work done by the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm|FAA]] meant those models qualified the type for U.S. carrier operations first. The U.S. Navy finally accepted the F4U for shipboard operations in April 1944, after the longer oleo strut was fitted, which eliminated the tendency to bounce.<ref>Tillman 1979, pp. 15\u201317.</ref> The first US Corsair unit to be based effectively on a carrier was the pioneer USMC squadron [[VMA-124|VMF-124]], which joined ''Essex'' in December 1944.

The Royal Navy hurriedly adopted higher-performance single-seat aircraft such as the [[Hawker Hurricane variants#Sea Hurricanes|Hawker Sea Hurricane]] and the less robust [[Supermarine Seafire]], but neither aircraft had sufficient range to operate at a distance from a carrier task force. The Corsair was welcomed as a more robust and versatile alternative.<ref>Styling 1995, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\nIn November 1943, the Royal Navy received its first batch of 95 Vought F4U-1s, which were given the designation of \"Corsair I\". The first squadrons were assembled and trained on the U.S. East Coast and then shipped across the Atlantic. The Royal Navy put the Corsair into carrier operations immediately. They found its landing characteristics dangerous, suffering a number of fatal crashes, but considered the Corsair to be the best option they had.\n\nIn Royal Navy service, because of the limited [[hangar]] deck height in several classes of British carrier, many Corsairs had their outer wings \"clipped\" by {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} to clear the deckhead.<ref name=\"Styling 1995, p.68.\">Styling 1995, p. 68.</ref> The change in span brought about the added benefit of improving the [[sink rate]], reducing the F4U's propensity to \"float\" in the final stages of landing.<ref name=\"Styling 1995, p.68.\"/> Despite the clipped wings and the shorter decks of British carriers, Royal Navy aviators found landing accidents less of a problem than they had been to U.S. Navy aviators, thanks to the curved approach they used: British units solved the landing visibility problem by approaching the carrier in a medium left-hand turn, which allowed the pilot to keep the carrier's deck in view over the [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] in the left [[wing root]]. This technique was later adopted by U.S. Navy and Marine fliers for carrier use of the Corsair.<ref>Tillman 1979, pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy developed a number of modifications to the Corsair that made carrier landings more practical. Among these are a bulged canopy (similar to the [[Malcolm Hood]]), raising the pilot's seat {{convert|7|in|mm|abbr=on}}<ref>Goebel, Greg.

It was not without problems; one was excessive wear of the arrester wires, due both to the weight of the Corsair and the understandable tendency of the pilots to stay well above the stalling speed. A total of 2,012 Corsairs were supplied to the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Swanboroughp404\">Swanborough and Bowers 1976, p. 404.</ref>\n\n[[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) units were created and equipped in the United States, at [[Quonset Point]] or [[Naval Air Station Brunswick|Brunswick]] and then shipped to war theaters aboard escort carriers. The first FAA Corsair unit was [[1830 Naval Air Squadron|1830 NAS]], created on the first of June 1943, and soon operating from {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}. At the end of the war, 18 FAA squadrons were operating the Corsair. British Corsairs served both in Europe and in the Pacific. The first, and also most important, European operations were the series of attacks ([[Operation Tungsten]]) in April, July and August 1944 on the {{Ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}}, for which Corsairs from {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}} and {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}} provided fighter cover.<ref>Thetford 1978, p. 73.</ref> It appears the Corsairs did not encounter aerial opposition on these raids.\n\nFrom April 1944, Corsairs from the [[British Pacific Fleet]] took part in a several [[Bombing of South East Asia, 1944\u20131945|major air raids in South East Asia]] beginning with [[Operation Cockpit]], an attack on Japanese targets at [[Sabang, Indonesia|Sabang]] island, in the [[Dutch East Indies]].\n\nIn July and August 1945, Corsair naval squadrons 1834, 1836, 1841 and 1842 took part in a series of strikes on the Japanese mainland, near Tokyo.

The British did likewise, starting with a simple paintover with white paint, of their \"Type C\" roundel's red center, at about the time the U.S. Navy removed the red-center from their roundel.

Because each of the SUs painted its aircraft with distinctive markings<ref>Russell 1984, pp. 40\u201345.</ref> and the aircraft themselves could be repainted in several different color schemes, the RNZAF Corsairs were far less uniform in appearance than their American and FAA contemporaries.<ref>Russell 1984, pp. 90\u2013104.</ref> By late 1944, the F4U had equipped all ten Pacific-based fighter squadrons of the RNZAF.<ref name=\"Russell 1984, pp. 48-87.\"/>\n\nBy the time the Corsairs arrived, there were very few Japanese aircraft left in New Zealand's allocated sectors of the Southern Pacific, and despite the RNZAF squadrons extending their operations to more northern islands, they were primarily used for close support of American, Australian, and New Zealand soldiers fighting the Japanese.

The pilot, Lt Mattholie, was taken prisoner and the aircraft captured undamaged. Luftwaffe interrogators failed to get the pilot to explain how to fold the wings so as to transport the aircraft to Narvik. The Corsair was ferried by boat for further investigation. Later the Corsair was taken to Germany and listed as one of the captured enemy aircraft (''Beuteflugzeug'') based at ''[[Rechlin-L\u00e4rz Airfield|Erprobungsstelle Rechlin]]'', the central German military aviation test facility and the equivalent of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], for 1944 under repair.

Its low-speed handling was tricky due to the left wing stalling before the right wing. This factor, together with poor visibility over the long nose (leading to one of its nicknames, \"The Hose Nose\"), made landing a Corsair on a carrier a difficult task. For these reasons, most Corsairs initially went to [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] squadrons who operated off land-based runways, with some early Goodyear-built examples (designated '''FG-1A''') being built with fixed wings{{#tag:ref| The wings were not actually \u201cfixed\u201d.  The hydraulic wing folding hardware was simply not installed. The wings could still be manually folded.|group=N}}.<ref name=\"Swanboroughp404\"/> The USMC aviators welcomed the Corsair with open arms as its performance was far superior to the contemporary [[Brewster Buffalo]] and [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman F4F-3 and -4 Wildcat]].\n\nMoreover, the Corsair was able to outperform the primary Japanese fighter, the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]]. While the Zero could outturn the F4U at low speed, the Corsair was faster and could outclimb and outdive the A6M.<ref name=\"Styling\">Styling 1995</ref>\n\nThis performance advantage, combined with the ability to take severe punishment, meant a pilot could place an enemy aircraft in the killing zone of the F4U's six [[.50 BMG|.50]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s and keep him there long enough to inflict major damage. The 2,300 rounds carried by the Corsair gave just under 30 seconds of fire from each gun, which, fired in three to six-second bursts, made the F4U a devastating weapon against aircraft, ground targets, and even ships.\n\n[[Image:F4U Coursair Udvar Hazy.jpg|left|thumb|Corsair on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Steven F.

Speed was increased from {{convert|417|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|425|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Due to the U.S. Navy's need for fighter-bombers, it had a payload of rockets double the -1A's carried on permanent launching rails, as well as twin pylons for bombs or drop tanks. These modifications caused extra drag, but the additional fuel carried by the two drop tanks would still allow the aircraft to fly relatively long missions despite heavy, un-aerodynamic loads.

He served as [[chairman]] of the [[board of directors]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] from 1971 until 1989. After his retirement as chairman and CEO, Heineken continued to sit on the board of directors until his death and served as chairman of the [[supervisory board]] from 1989 till 1995. At the time of his death, Heineken was one of the richest people in the Netherlands, with a net worth of 9.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[Dutch guilder|guilders]].<ref>{{nl}} [http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/famous/freddy_heineken/index.html Freddy Heineken] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529051445/http://stadsarchief.amsterdam.nl/english/amsterdam_treasures/famous/freddy_heineken/index.html |date=2014-05-29 }}, Stadsarchief Amsterdam, 10 December 2005</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nHeineken was born on 4 November 1923 in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. He was the grandson of [[Gerard Adriaan Heineken]], who was the founder of the [[brewery]] [[Heineken International|Heineken]]. He died in 2002.\n\nHe entered the service of the Heineken company \u2013 which by then was no longer owned by the family \u2013 on 1 June 1941 and bought back stock several years later, to ensure the family controlled the company again. He created the [[Heineken Holding]] that owned 50.005% of [[Heineken International]]; he personally held a majority stake in Heineken Holding. By the time of his resignation as chairman of the board in 1989 he had transformed Heineken from a [[brand]] that was known chiefly in the [[Netherlands]] to a brand that is currently famous worldwide.\n\n===Kidnapping===\n{{Main|Kidnapping of Freddy Heineken}}\nFreddy Heineken and his driver Ab Doderer were [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] in 1983 and released on a ransom of 35 million [[Dutch guilder]]s (about \u00a315.7 million [[Pound sterling|GBPs]]). The kidnappers [[Cor van Hout]], [[Willem Holleeder]], [[Jan Boellaard]], Frans Meijer, and Martin Erkamps, were eventually caught and served [[prison]] terms. Before being extradited, Van Hout and Holleeder stayed for more than three years in [[France]], first on the run, then in prison, and then, awaiting a change of the extradition treaty, under [[house arrest]], and finally in prison again. Meijer escaped and lived in [[Paraguay]] for years, until he was discovered by [[Peter R. de Vries]] and imprisoned there. In 2003, Meijer halted resisting his [[extradition]] to the Netherlands, and was transferred to a Dutch prison to serve the last part of his term.  \n\nThe films ''[[The Heineken Kidnapping]]'' (2011) and ''[[Kidnapping Freddy Heineken]]'' (2015) are based on this incident.\n\n===Personal===\nHeineken married Lucille Cummins, an [[United States|American]] from a [[Kentucky]] family of [[bourbon whiskey]] distillers. Heineken died unexpectedly from [[pneumonia]] on 3 January 2002 at the age of seventy-eight in his home in [[Noordwijk]]. The businessman died around 6pm in the presence of his immediate family, including his daughter [[Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken]]. Heineken struggled for some time with deteriorating health, in 1999 he suffered a mild stroke but recovered. Shortly before his death he broke his arm in a fall. Heineken was buried at the General Cemetery in Noordwijk.

[[Formula Two]] had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing. The series began as an open specification, then tyres were standardized from 1986 onwards, followed by engines and chassis in 1996. The series ran annually until 2004, and was replaced in 2005 by the [[GP2 Series]].\n\nThe series was staged as the '''Formula 3000 European Championship''' in 1985,<ref>1986 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 82</ref> as the '''Formula 3000 Intercontinental Championship''' in 1986<ref>1987 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 98</ref> and 1987<ref>1988 FIA Yearbook, Red section, page 97</ref> and then as the '''Formula 3000 International Championship''' from 1988<ref>Automobile Year 1988/89, pages 236-242</ref> to 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041216021312/http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F3000/Classifications/2004.html 2004 FIA Formula 3000 International Championship Classifications] Retrieved from web.archive.org on 25 April 2010</ref>\n\n==Engines==\nFormula 3000 replaced Formula Two, and was so named because the engines used were limited to 3000cc maximum capacity. Initially, the [[Cosworth DFV]] was a popular choice, having been made obsolete in Formula One by the adoption of 1.5 litre turbocharged engines. (It has been observed{{who|date=May 2015}} that [[Bernie Ecclestone]] had purchased a job-lot of DFVs in 1984, with no obvious use for them at the time).\n\nThe rules permitted any 90-degree V8 engine, fitted with a rev-limiter to keep power output under control. As well as the Cosworth, a Honda engine based on an Indy V8 by [[Judd (engine)|John Judd]] also appeared; a rumoured [[Lamborghini]] V8 never raced. In later years, a [[Mugen-Honda]] V8 became the thing to have, eclipsing the DFV; Cosworth responded with the brand new AC engine. Costs, not unlike the senior series, were getting out of control.\n\n==Chassis==\n[[File:F\u00f3rmula 3000 (Fernado Alonso)01.jpg|thumb|200px| [[Fernando Alonso|Fernando Alonso's]] [[Lola Cars|Lola]] chassis in the [[2000 International Formula 3000 Championship|2000 season]].]]\nThe first chassis from [[March Engineering|March]], [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] and [[Ralt]] were developments of their existing 1984 [[Formula Two]] designs, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]]'s entry was based on and looked very much like an [[Champ car|IndyCar]]. A few smaller teams tried obsolete three-litre [[Formula One]] cars (from [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]], [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]], [[Minardi]], [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] and RAM), with little success\u2014the Grand Prix and Indycar-derived entries were too unwieldy\u2014their fuel tanks were about twice the size of those needed for F3000 races, and the weight distribution was not ideal. The first few years of the championship saw March establishing a superiority over Ralt and Lola\u2014there was little to choose between the chassis, but more Marches were sold and ended up in better hands. The form book was rewritten in 1988 with the entry of the ambitious [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] marque with a brand new chassis; Reynard had won their first race in every formula they'd entered. This would continue in F3000. The next couple of years saw Lola improve slightly\u2014their car was arguably marginally superior to the Reynard in 1990\u2014and March slip, but both were crushed by the Reynard teams and by the mid-90s, F3000 was a virtual Reynard monopoly, although [[Lola Cars|Lola]] did eventually return with a promising car and the Japanese [[Footwork (racing team)|Footwork]] and [[Dome (constructor)|Dome]] chassis were seen in Europe. [[Dallara]] briefly tried the series before moving up to [[Formula One]], and [[Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives|AGS]] moved up from Formula Two but never recaptured their occasional success. At least one unraced F3000 chassis existed\u2014the Wagner fitted with a straight-six short-stroke BMW. This was converted into a sports car, however.\n\n==Politics==\nThe series was not without controversy. Definitive rules for the 1985 season did not appear until the championship was well under way. In 1987 questions were asked about the ability of some of the drivers, given the high number of accidents in the formula. In 1989 the eligibility of the new [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] chassis was challenged - it was raced with a different (but safer and no faster) nose to the one that had been crash tested. This season also saw problems with driver changes - the cost of F3000 was escalating to the point that teams were finding it difficult to run drivers for a whole season. A badly implemented \"two driver changes per car per season\" rule meant that some cars had to sit idle while drivers with budgets could not race them (rather than allowing two drivers to share a drive through the season on a race-by-race basis, teams could only change the driver of any entry twice in a year). In 1991 the performance of some Italian teams attracted attention - they had started using [[Agip]]'s \"jungle juice\" [[Formula One]] fuel, worth an estimated 15&nbsp;bhp\u2014giving their drivers a significant advantage. In the early years of the formula there was much concern about safety, with a high number of accidents resulting in injuries to drivers and, unfortunately, one fatality in the International Championship - [[Marco Campos]] in the very last round of the 1995 series.\n\n==Races==\nFormula 3000 races during the \"open chassis\" era tended to be of about 100\u2013120 miles in distance, held at major circuits, either headlining meetings or paired with other international events. The \"jewel in the crown\" of the F3000 season was traditionally the [[Pau Grand Prix]] street race, rivalled for a few years by the [[Birmingham Superprix|Birmingham]] round. Most major circuits in France, [[Italy]], Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom saw the series visit at least once.\n\n==The spec-chassis years==\nIn 1996, new rules introduced a single engine (a detuned [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] V8 engine, re-engineered by and badged as a [[Zytek]]) and chassis ([[Lola Cars|Lola]]), to go along with tyre standardization ([[Avon Tyres|Avon]]) introduced in 1986. The following year the calendar was combined with that of Formula One, so the series became support races for the Grand Prix. Several Grand Prix teams established formal links with F3000 teams to develop young drivers (and engineering talent); these relationships varied from formal \"junior teams\" (such as the one [[McLaren]] set up for [[Nick Heidfeld]]) to fairly distant relationships based mostly upon shared sponsors and the use of the 'parent' team's name. The series grew dramatically through the late nineties, reaching an entry of nearly 40 cars - although this in itself was problematic as it meant many drivers failed to qualify. In 2000, the series was restricted to 15 teams of two cars each.\n\nHowever, by 2002 expenses were once more very high and the number of entries, and sponsors, rapidly dwindled. International Formula 3000 was experiencing tough competition with cheaper formulae, such as [[Auto GP|European F3000]] (using ex-FIA 1999 and 2002 Lola chassis), [[World Series by Nissan]] (also known as Formula Nissan) and [[Formula Renault 3.5|Formula Renault V6 Eurocup]]. By the end of 2003, car counts had fallen to new lows.\n\nThe [[2004 International Formula 3000 Championship|2004 season]] was the last F3000 campaign, due in part to dwindling field sizes. In 2005 it was replaced with a new series known as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], with [[Renault]] backing.\n\n==Champions==\n:''For a complete list of drivers, see [[List of International Formula 3000 drivers]].''\n[[File:Bjorn Wirdheim 2003 F3000 Hungary.jpg|thumb|right|Sweden's [[Bj\u00f6rn Wirdheim]] won the 2003 FIA Formula 3000 International Championship for Drivers]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Season\n!Champion Driver\n!Team\n!Car\n!Champion Team\n!Car\n|-\n!

The risk of overdose is increased if flunitrazepam is taken in combination with CNS [[depressants]] such as [[ethanol]] (alcohol) and [[opioid]]s. Flunitrazepam overdose responds to the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist [[flumazenil]], which thus can be used as a treatment.\n\n==Detection==\nAs of 2016, blood tests can identify flunitrazepam at concentrations of as low as 4&nbsp;ng/ml; the elimination half life of the drug is 11\u201325 hours. For urine samples, metabolites can be identified 60 hours to 28 days, depending on the dose and analytical method used. Hair and saliva can also be analyzed; hair is useful when a long time has transpired since ingestion, and saliva for workplace drug tests.<ref name=Kiss2016/>\n\nFlunitrazepam can be measured in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma flunitrazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 5\u201320 \u03bcg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically as a nighttime hypnotic, 10\u201350 \u03bcg/L in those arrested for impaired driving and 100\u20131000 \u03bcg/L in victims of acute fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine drug abuse monitoring purposes. The presence of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a pharmacologically-active metabolite and ''in vitro'' degradation product, is useful for confirmation of flunitrazepam ingestion. In postmortem specimens, the parent drug may have been entirely degraded over time to 7-aminoflunitrazepam.<ref>Jones AW, Holmgren A, Kugelberg FC.

Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, including forklifts, automobiles, buses, boats, motorcycles and submarines.\n\nThere are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an [[anode]], a [[cathode]], and an [[electrolyte]] that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing [[direct current]] electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). A related technology is [[Flow battery|flow batteries]], in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are \"stacked\", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements.<ref>Nice, Karim and Strickland, Jonathan.

In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for the [[General Electric]] Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This became known as the \"Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/pem/pem2.htm|title=Fuel Cell Project: PEM Fuel Cells photo #2|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/pem/pemmain.htm|title=Collecting the History of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells|publisher=}}</ref> GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during [[Project Gemini]]. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15&nbsp;kW fuel cell tractor for [[Allis-Chalmers]], which was demonstrated across the U.S. at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and [[compressed hydrogen]] and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, Pratt and Whitney licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks).

They are made up of three adjacent segments: the [[anode]], the [[electrolyte]], and the [[cathode]]. Two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments. The net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed, water or carbon dioxide is created, and an electric current is created, which can be used to power electrical devices, normally referred to as the load.\n\nAt the anode a [[catalyst]] oxidizes the fuel, usually hydrogen, turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron. The electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it, but the electrons cannot. The freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current. The ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode. Once reaching the cathode, the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical, usually oxygen, to create water or carbon dioxide.\n\n[[File:Fuel Cell Block Diagram.svg|400px|thumb|right| A block diagram of a fuel cell]]\nDesign features in a fuel cell include:\n* The electrolyte substance, which usually defines the ''type'' of fuel cell, and can be made from a number of substances like potassium hydroxide, salt carbonates, and phosphoric acid.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.energygroove.net/technologies/fuel-cells| title=Fuel Cells - EnergyGroove.net|work=EnergyGroove.net|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n* The fuel that is used.

In this type of fuel cell, the membrane must be hydrated, requiring water to be evaporated at precisely the same rate that it is produced. If water is evaporated too quickly, the membrane dries, resistance across it increases, and eventually it will crack, creating a gas \"short circuit\" where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly, generating heat that will damage the fuel cell. If the water is evaporated too slowly, the electrodes will flood, preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction. Methods to manage water in cells are being developed like [[electroosmotic pump]]s focusing on flow control. Just as in a combustion engine, a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently.\n* Temperature management. The same temperature must be maintained throughout the cell in order to prevent destruction of the cell through [[thermal loading]]. This is particularly challenging as the 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O reaction is highly exothermic, so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell.\n* Durability, [[service life]], and special requirements for some type of cells.

These cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees Celsius. This high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly.

Since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small, platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate. A key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte.

At low temperatures, [[solid acid]]s have an ordered molecular structure like most salts. At warmer temperatures (between 140 and 150 degrees Celsius for CsHSO<sub>4</sub>), some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered \"superprotonic\" structures, which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude.

Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes.

Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode.

One such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode, which slows down the internal reforming process. Research to address this \"carbon coking\" issue at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based [[cermet]] (heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal) can reduce coking and the loss of performance.<ref>Hill, Michael.

''Ceramic Industry'', 1 September 2005.</ref> Another disadvantage of SOFC systems is slow start-up time, making SOFCs less useful for mobile applications. Despite these disadvantages, a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum, thereby reducing cost. Additionally, waste heat from SOFC systems may be captured and reused, increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80%\u201385%.<ref name=Types1/>\n\nThe high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the YSZ electrolyte. As temperature decreases, so does the [[ionic conductivity]] of YSZ. Therefore, to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell, a high operating temperature is required. According to their website, [[Ceres Power]], a UK SOFC fuel cell manufacturer, has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their SOFC system to 500\u2013600 degrees Celsius. They replaced the commonly used YSZ electrolyte with a CGO (cerium gadolinium oxide) electrolyte. The lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate, which reduces cost and start-up time of the system.<ref>[http://www.cerespower.com/Technology/TheCeresCell/ \"The Ceres Cell\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213064702/http://www.cerespower.com/Technology/TheCeresCell/ |date=13 December 2013 }}.

MCFCs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte, and this salt liquefies at high temperatures, allowing for the movement of charge within the cell \u2013 in this case, negative carbonate ions.<ref name=moltencarb>[http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/fuelcells/fuelcells_moltencarb.html \"Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell Technology\"]. U.S. Department of Energy, accessed 9 August 2011</ref>\n\nLike SOFCs, MCFCs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode, eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally. The reforming process creates {{CO2}} emissions. MCFC-compatible fuels include natural gas, biogas and gas produced from coal. The hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water, carbon dioxide, electrons and small amounts of other chemicals. The electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode. There, oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte, completing the circuit.<ref name=moltencarb/> The chemical reactions for an MCFC system can be expressed as follows:<ref>[http://www.fctec.com/fctec_types_mcfc.asp \"Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC)\"].

This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.<ref name=Types1/>\n\nMCFCs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies, including their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to \"carbon coking\", which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel [[Fossil fuel reforming|reforming]] process. Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system. The Department of Energy claims that coal, itself, might even be a fuel option in the future, assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen.<ref name=Types1/> MCFCs also have relatively high efficiencies. They can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50%, considerably higher than the 37\u201342% efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. Efficiencies can be as high as 65% when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine, and 85% if heat is captured and used in a [[Cogeneration|Combined Heat and Power]] (CHP) system.<ref name=moltencarb/>\n\nFuelCell Energy, a Connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer, develops and sells MCFC fuel cells. The company says that their MCFC products range from 300&nbsp;kW to 2.8&nbsp;MW systems that achieve 47% electrical efficiency and can utilize CHP technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies. One product, the DFC-ERG, is combined with a gas turbine and, according to the company, it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65%.<ref>[http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/products.php \"Products\"].

The first is the microfuel cell market, in the 1-50 W range for power smaller electronic devices. The second is the 1-5&nbsp;kW range of generators for larger scale power generation (e.g. military outposts, remote oil fields).\n\nMicrofuel cells are primarily aimed at penetrating the market for phones and laptops. This can be primarily attributed to the advantageous energy density provided by fuel cells over a lithium-ion battery, for the entire system. For a battery, this system includes the charger as well as the battery itself. For the fuel cell this system would include the cell, the necessary fuel and peripheral attachments. Taking the full system into consideration, fuel cells have been shown to provide 530Wh/kg compared to 44 Wh/kg for lithium ion batteries.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, while the weight of fuel cell systems offer a distinct advantage the current costs are not in their favor. while a battery system will generally cost around $1.20 per Wh, fuel cell systems cost around $5 per Wh, putting them at a significant disadvantage.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAs power demands for cell phones increase, fuel cells could become much more attractive options for larger power generation. The demand for longer on time on phones and computers is something often demanded by consumers so fuel cells could start to make strides into laptop and cell phone markets. The price will continue to go down as developments in fuel cells continues to accelerate. Current strategies for improving micro fuelcells is through the use of [[carbon nanotube]]s. It was shown by Girishkumar et al. that depositing nanotubes on electrode surfaces allows for substantially greater surface area increasing the oxygen reduction rate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Girishkumar|first1=G.|last2=Vinodgopal|first2=K.|last3=Kamat|first3=Prashant|title=Carbon Nanostructures in Portable Fuel Cells: Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Electrodes for Methanol Oxidation and Oxygen Reduction|journal=J.

Portable power systems that use fuel cells can be used in the leisure sector (i.e. RVs, cabins, marine), the industrial sector (i.e. power for remote locations including gas/oil wellsites, communication towers, security, weather stations), and in the military sector. SFC Energy is a German manufacturer of [[direct methanol fuel cell]]s for a variety of portable power systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfc.com/en/|title=Welcome to SFC|publisher=}}</ref> Ensol Systems Inc. is an integrator of portable power systems, using the SFC Energy DMFC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ensolsystems.com/|title=Ensol Systems Inc. - Remote Power Systems, EFOY Pro Fuel Cells, Electrical Control Panels|publisher=}}</ref> The key advantage of fuel cells in this market is the great power generation per weight. While fuel cells can be expensive, for remote locations that require dependable energy fuel cells hold great power. For a 72-h excursion the comparison in weight is substantial, with a fuel cell only weighing 15 pounds compared to 29 pounds of batteries needed for the same energy.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\"/>\n\n===Other applications===\n* Providing power for [[base station]]s or [[cell site]]s<ref>[http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 \"Ballard fuel cells to power telecom backup power units for motorola\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172302/http://fr.chfca.ca/itoolkit.asp?pg=BALLARD_07132009 |date=6 July 2011 }}.

As the term was used in Germany and other [[NATO]] countries, it referred to the decision of a [[country]] not to challenge a more powerful neighbour in foreign politics, while maintaining national [[sovereignty]].  It is commonly used in reference to Finland's policies in relation to the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War, but it can refer more generally to similar international relations, such as [[Denmark]]'s attitude toward Germany between 1871 and 1945, or the policies of the Swiss government towards [[Nazi Germany]] until the end of World War II.\n\n== Origin and international usage ==\nIn Germany, the term was used mainly by proponents of closer adaptation to [[United States|US]] policies, chiefly [[Franz Josef Strauss]], but was initially coined in scholarly debate, and made known by the German political scientists [[Walter Hallstein]] and [[Richard L\u00f6wenthal]], reflecting feared effects of withdrawal of US troops from Germany. It came to be used in the debate of the NATO countries in response to [[Willy Brandt]]'s attempts to [[Ostpolitik|normalise relations with East Germany]], and the following widespread scepticism in Germany against NATO's [[Dual-Track Decision]]. Later, after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the term has been used in [[Finland]] for the post-1968 radicalisation in the latter half of the [[Urho Kekkonen]] era.\n\n==Finnish perception==\n[[File:1970 - Lenin.jpg|thumb|In April 1970, a Finnish stamp was issued in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin and then the Lenin Symposium held in Tampere.]]\nIn Finland, the term \"Finlandization\" was perceived as blunt criticism,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} stemming from an inability to understand the practicalities of how a small nation needs to deal with an adjacent [[superpower]] without losing its [[sovereignty]]. These practicalities existed especially because of the lingering effect of Russian rule in their time, before the [[Finns]] first gained sovereignty, and because of the precarious power balance eastwards, springing from a geographically extended yet sparsely populated state with a traditionally imperialist superpower right across the eastern border.\n\nThe reason Finland engaged in Finlandization was primarily [[Realpolitik]]: to survive. On the other hand, the threat of the Soviet Union was used also in Finland's domestic politics in a way that possibly deepened Finlandization (playing the so-called ''id\u00e4nkortti'', \"east card\"). Finland cut such a deal with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s government in the late 1940s, and it was largely respected by both parties\u2014and to the gain of both parties\u2014until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. While the Finnish political and intellectual elite mostly understood the term to refer more to the foreign policy problems of other countries, and meant mostly for domestic consumption in the speaker's own country, many ordinary Finns considered the term highly offensive.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Finnish political cartoonist [[Kari Suomalainen]] once explained Finlandization as ''the art of bowing to the East without [[mooning]] the West''.\n\n===Historical background===\nFinland's foreign politics before this deal had been varied: independence from [[Imperial Russia]] with support of [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] in 1917; participation in the [[Russian Civil War]] (without official declaration of war) alongside the [[Triple Entente]] 1918\u20131920; a non-ratified alliance with [[Poland]] in 1922; association with the neutralist and [[democracy|democratic]] [[Scandinavia]]n countries in the 1930s ended by the [[Winter War]] (1939); and finally in 1940, a rapprochement with [[Nazi Germany]], the only power able and willing to help Finland against the expansionist Soviet Union, which lead to the nation's [[Continuation War|re-entry into the Second World War]] in 1941.\n\nThe [[Wehrmacht]]'s defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] led Finland to basically revert to its 19th-century traditions, which had been perceived as highly successful until the [[Russification of Finland]] (1899\u20131905).  Finland's leaders realised that opposing the Soviets head-on was no longer feasible. No [[power (international)|international power]] was able to give the necessary support. [[Nazi Germany]], Finland's chief supporter against Russia, was losing the war. [[Sweden]] was not big enough, and its leadership was wary of confronting Russia. The [[Western countries|western powers]] were allied with the Soviet Union. Thus Finland had to face its big neighbour on its own, without any greater power's protection.  As in the 19th century, Finland chose not to challenge Imperial Russia's foreign policy, but exerted caution to keep its [[independence]].\n\n===Paasikivi doctrine===\n{{see also|Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen doctrine}}\nAfter the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty]] of 1947, Finland succeeded in retaining [[democracy]] and [[parliamentarism]], despite the heavy political pressure on Finland's foreign and internal affairs by the Soviet Union. [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign relations]] were guided by the doctrine formulated by [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], emphasising the necessity to maintain a good and trusting relationship with the Soviet Union.\n\nFinland signed an [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] with the Soviet Union in April 1948, under which Finland was obliged to resist armed attacks by \"Germany or its allies\" against Finland, or against the Soviet Union through Finland, and, if necessary, ask for Soviet military aid to do so. At the same time, the agreement recognised Finland's desire to remain outside [[Great Power|great power]] conflicts, allowing the country to adopt a policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nAs a consequence, Finland did not participate in the [[Marshall Plan]] and took neutral positions on Soviet overseas initiatives. By keeping very cool relations to [[NATO]] and western military powers in general, Finland could fend off Soviet pressure for affiliation to the [[Warsaw Pact]].\n\n===Self-censorship and excessive Soviet adaptation===\nHowever, from the political scene following the post-1968 radicalisation, the Soviet adaptation spread to the editors of [[mass media]], sparking strong forms of self-control, [[self-censorship]] and pro-Soviet attitudes. Most of the \u00e9lite of media and politics shifted their attitudes to match the values that the Soviets were thought to favor and approve.\n\nOnly after the ascent of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to Soviet leadership in 1985 did mass media in Finland gradually begin to criticise the Soviet Union more. When the Soviet Union allowed non-communist governments to take power in Eastern Europe, Gorbachev suggested they could look to Finland as an example to follow.\n\n== Censorship ==\nIn the years immediately after the war (1944\u20131946), the Soviet part of the allied control commission demanded that public libraries should remove from circulation more than 1,700 books that were deemed anti-Soviet, and bookstores were given catalogs of banned books.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ekholm |first=Kai |year=2001 |title=Political Censorship in Finnish Libraries in 1944\u20131946 |journal=Libraries & Culture |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=51\u201357 |doi=10.1353/lac.2001.0008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.uta.fi/laitokset/kirjasto/oppimiskeskus/verkkoaineisto/inf/makinen.pdf M\u00e4kinen, Ilkka. 2001.

P.131</ref> The [[Valtion elokuvatarkastamo|Finnish Board of Film Classification]] likewise banned movies that it considered to be anti-Soviet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Banned movies included ''[[One, Two, Three]]'' (1961 film), directed by [[Billy Wilder]], ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', directed by [[John Frankenheimer]] in 1962, ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (film)|One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' 1970 by Finnish director [[Caspar Wrede]] and ''[[Born American]]'' by Finnish director [[Renny Harlin]] in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n== Criticism ==\n[[United States]] foreign policy experts consistently feared that [[Western Europe]] and [[Japan]] would be Finlandized, leading to a situation in which these key allies no longer supported the United States against the Soviet Union. The theory of [[bandwagoning]] provided support for the idea that if the United States was not able to provide strong and credible support for the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] positions of its allies, [[NATO]] and the U.S.\u2013Japan alliance could collapse.\n\nHowever, foreign policy scholars such as [[Eric Nordlinger]] in his book ''Isolationism Reconfigured'' have argued that \"a vision of Finlandization in America's absence runs up squarely against the [[Europe]]an states' long-standing Communist antipathies and wariness of Moscow's peaceful wiles, valued national traditions and strong democratic institutions, as well as their size and wherewithal\".<ref>\"[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=37&articleID=489 Isolationism Reconfigured: American Foreign Policy for a New Century]\", ''The Independent Review'', The Independent Institute.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|International relations}}\n* [[Appeasement]]\n* [[Balkanization]]\n* [[Finnish Security Intelligence Service]]\n* {{Format link|History of Finland#Postwar}}\n* [[Satellite state]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links and references ==\n* [http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1985-6/documents/FinlandsRelationswiththeSovietUnion1940-1986.pdf ''Finland's Relations with the Soviet Union, 1940\u20131986''] by Peter Botticelli\n* [http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/14/esau-55.pdf ''\"Finlandization\" in action: Helsinki's experience with Moscow''] presented at the web site of CIA\n* [http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0501balkanization.htm ''Three cheers for Balkanization!''] by Bruce Walker, re-evaluating the Finlandization concept\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040909012249/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/br_158.html ''The Silenced Media: The Propaganda War between Russia and the West in Northern Europe''] - review by Jussi M.

Scheuering writes that his work involved conducting experiments on rockets and satellites, remote sensing, [[radiation belts]], the [[magnetosphere]], and [[meteorites]]. He developed a new method of launching rockets into space: firing them from a high-flying plane, both with and without a pilot. The Navy adopted the idea and Singer supervised the project.

Singer wrote: \"My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\"<ref>S. F.

He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

Delany]]'s ''[[Dhalgren]]'' and [[Joanna Russ]]'s ''[[The Female Man]]''.<ref name=\"SFWA\" /> He also edited a number of science-fiction [[anthology|anthologies]].\n\n===Later career===\nAfter World War II, Pohl worked as an advertising [[Copywriting|copywriter]] and then as a copywriter and book editor for ''[[Popular Science]]''.<ref name=\"popsci\" /> Following the war, Pohl began publishing material under his own name, much in collaboration with his fellow Futurian, Cyril Kornbluth.\n\nThough the pen names of \"Gottesman\", \"Lavond\", and \"MacCreigh\" were retired by the early 1950s, Pohl still occasionally used pseudonyms, even after he began to publish work under his real name.  These occasional pseudonyms, all of which date from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, included Charles Satterfield, Paul Flehr, Ernst Mason, Jordan Park (two collaborative novels with Kornbluth), and Edson McCann (one collaborative novel with [[Lester del Rey]]).\n\nIn the 1970s, Pohl re-emerged as a novel writer in his own right, with books such as ''[[Man Plus]]'' and the ''[[Heechee]]'' series. He won back-to-back Nebula Awards with ''Man Plus'' in 1976 and ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'', the first ''Heechee'' novel, in 1977. In 1978, ''Gateway'' swept the other two major novel honors, also winning the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] and [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel|John W. Campbell Memorial Award for the best science-fiction novel]]. Two of his stories have also earned him Hugo Awards: \"The Meeting\" (with Kornbluth) tied in 1973 and \"[[Fermi and Frost]]\" won in 1986. Another award-winning novel is ''[[Jem (novel)|Jem]]'' (1980), winner of the [[National Book Award]].\n\nHis works include not only science fiction, but also articles for ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Family Circle]]'' magazines and nonfiction books. For a time, he was the official authority for ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' on the subject of [[Tiberius|Emperor Tiberius]].

Douglas, better known as [[Morojo]]), which sparked decades of fan costuming thereafter, the latest incarnation of which is [[cosplay]]. He attended every [[Worldcon]] but two thereafter during his lifetime. Ackerman invited [[Ray Bradbury]] to attend the Los Angeles Chapter of the Science Fiction League, then meeting weekly at Clifton's Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles. The club changed its name to the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]] during the period it was meeting at the restaurant. (There never was a \"Clifton\u2019s Cafeteria Science Fiction Club\".) Among the writers frequenting the club were [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Emil Petaja]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Leigh Brackett]], and [[Jack Williamson]]. Bradbury often attended meetings with his friend [[Ray Harryhausen]]; the two Rays had been introduced to each other by Ackerman. With $90 from Ackerman and Morojo, Bradbury launched a fanzine, ''[[Futuria Fantasia]]'', in 1939, which ran for four issues.\n\nAckerman was an early member of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Science Fiction League and became so active in and important to the club that in essence he ran it, including (after the name change) the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]], a prominent regional fan organization, as well as the [[National Fantasy Fan Federation]] (N3F). Together with Morojo, he edited and produced ''Imagination!'', later renamed ''[[Voice of the Imagi-Nation]]'' (which in 1996 would be awarded the [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine#Retro Hugos|Retro Hugo for Best Fanzine of 1946]], and in 2014 for 1939), which was nominally the club fanzine for the LASFS.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Ackerman amassed an extremely large and complete collection of science fiction, [[fantasy]], and [[horror film]] memorabilia, which, until 2002, he maintained in an 18-room home and museum known as the \"Son of Ackermansion\". (The original Ackermansion where he lived from the early 1950s until the mid-1970s was at 915 S. Sherbourne Drive in Los Angeles; the site is now an apartment building.) This second house, in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California|Los Feliz]] district of Los Angeles, contained some 300,000 books and pieces of film and science-fiction memorabilia. From 1951 to 2002, Ackerman entertained some 50,000 fans at open houses - including, on one such evening, a group of 186 fans and professionals that included astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Ackerman was a board member of the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] [[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]], where many items of his collection are now displayed.\n\nHe knew most of the writers of science fiction in the first half of the twentieth century. As a literary agent, he represented some 200 writers, and he served as agent of record for many long-lost authors, thereby allowing their work to be reprinted in anthologies. He was [[Ed Wood]]'s \"illiterary\" agent.<ref>[http://www.dragoncon.org/people/ackermf.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011211125005/http://www.dragoncon.org/people/ackermf.html |date=December 11, 2001 }}</ref> Ackerman was credited with nurturing and even inspiring the careers of several early contemporaries<ref name=\"Interview with Forrest J Ackerman on Geekson\">{{cite web | last=Robinson | first=Peter | title=Interview with Forrest J Ackerman | year=2006 | publisher=Geekson.com | url=http://www.geekson.com/archives/archivedepisodes/2006/episode081808.htm }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved August 18, 2006.</ref> like Ray Bradbury, [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[Charles Beaumont]], [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], and [[L.

In this way, Ackerman provided inspiration to many who would later become successful artists, including [[Joe Dante]], [[Peter Jackson]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Tim Burton]], [[Stephen King]], [[Donald F. Glut]], [[Penn & Teller]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], [[Gene Simmons]] (of the band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]), [[Rick Baker (makeup artist)|Rick Baker]], [[George Lucas]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Frank Darabont]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Kirk Hammett]] (of the band Metallica), [[John Landis]] and countless other writers, directors, artists, and craftsmen.\n\nHe also contributed to film magazines from all around the world, including the Spanish-language ''[[La Cosa: Cine Fant\u00e1stico]]'' magazine from [[Argentina]], where he had a monthly column for more than four years.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ackerman organized the publication of an English translation in the U.S. of the German science fiction series ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'', the longest-running science fiction series in history. These were published by Ace Books from 1969 through 1977. Ackerman's German-speaking wife Wendayne (\"Wendy\") did most of the translation. The American books were issued with varying frequency from one to as many as four per month. Ackerman also used the paperback series to promote science fiction short stories, including his own on occasion. These \"magabooks\" or \"bookazines\" also included a film review section, known as \"Scientifilm World\", and letters from readers. The American series came to an end when the management of Ace changed, and the new management decided that the series was too juvenile for their taste. The last Ace issue was #118, which corresponded to German issue #126 as some of the Ace editions contained two of the German issues, and three of the German issues had been skipped. Ackerman later published translations of German issues #127 through #145 on his own under the Master Publications imprint. (The original German series continues today and passed issue #2800 in 2015.)\n\n===Appearances in film, television, and music===\nA lifelong fan of science fiction \"[[B-movie]]s\", Ackerman appeared in more than 210 films, including parts in many monster movies and [[science fiction film]]s (''[[Dracula vs. Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Howling (film)|The Howling]]'', ''[[The Aftermath (1982 film)|The Aftermath]]'', ''[[Scalps]]'', ''[[Return of the Living Dead Part II]]'', ''[[Innocent Blood (film)|Innocent Blood]]''), more traditional \"imagi-movies\" (''[[The Time Travelers (1964 film)|The Time Travelers]]'', ''[[Future War]]''), spoofs and comedies (''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'', ''[[The Wizard of Speed and Time]]'', ''[[Curse of the Queerwolf]]'', ''[[Transylvania Twist]]'', ''[[Hard to Die]]'', ''[[Nudist Colony of the Dead]]'', ''[[Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold]]'') and at least one major music video (''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]''). His [[Bacon number]] is 2.\n\nIn 1961, Ackerman narrated the record ''Music for Robots'' created by Frank Allison Coe. The cover featured Ackerman's face superimposed on the robot from the film ''[[Tobor the Great]]''. The record was reissued on CD in 2005.\n\nAckerman (as himself) appears as a character in ''The Vampire Affair'' by [[David McDaniel]] (a novel in the ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.|Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' series), and [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s novel [[The Image Of The Beast]], first published as the short story \"Blown\" in [[Screw Magazine]] by [[Al Goldstein]].\n\nA character based on Ackerman and an analog to the Ackermansion appears in the collaborative novel '[[Fallen Angels (science fiction novel)|Fallen Angels]]' written jointly by [[Larry Niven]], [[Jerry Pournelle]], and [[Michael F. Flynn]].\n\n\"Eccar the Man\" is mentioned in ''[[The Flying Sorcerers]]'', a novel jointly written by Niven and [[David Gerrold]], which features a number of characters based on notables from the science fiction community.\n[[File:Forrest J Ackerman at the Ackermansion.jpg|thumb|right|200x|Forrest J Ackerman at the Ackermansion]]\nHe appeared on the intro track of Ohio [[horror punk]] music group Manimals' 1999 album ''Horrorcore''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/manimals|title=Featured Content on Myspace|work=Myspace|accessdate=2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Ackerman played the part of an old wax museum caretaker in the camp comedy film ''[[The Double-D Avenger]]'' directed by [[William Winckler]] and starring [[Russ Meyer]] luminaries [[Kitten Natividad]], [[Haji (actress)|Haji]], and [[Raven De La Croix]]. Ackerman played a crazy old man who was in love with Kitten Natividad's character, The Double-D Avenger, and his character also talked to the [[Frankenstein]] figure and other wax monsters in the museum's chamber of horrors.\n\nAckerman appeared extensively on-screen discussing his life and the history of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 2006 documentary film ''Finding the Future''.<ref>[http://www.findingthefuture.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209112015/http://www.findingthefuture.com/ |date=February 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Roadhouse Films of Canada released a documentary, ''Famous Monster: Forrest J Ackerman''. The documentary, available on DVD only in the UK, airs regularly on the BRAVO channel.\n\nIn the 2012 action film ''[[Premium Rush]]'', the character of the corrupt policeman Bobby Monday (played by [[Michael Shannon]]) repeatedly uses the alias \"Forrest J Ackerman\".\n\nIn 2013, the science fiction author [[Jason V Brock]] released a feature-length documentary about Ackerman called ''The Ackermonster Chronicles!''.\n\n==Personal life==\nAckerman had one sibling, a younger brother, Alden Lorraine Ackerman, who was killed at the [[Battle of the Bulge]].\n\nAckerman was married to a German-born teacher and translator, Mathilda Wahrman (1912\u20131990), whom he met in the early 1950s while she was working in a book store he happened to visit. He eventually dubbed her \"Wendayne\" or, less formally, \"Wendy\", by which name she became most generally known within SF and film fandoms, after the character in ''[[Peter Pan]]'', his favorite fantasy.<ref name=time/> Although they went through a period of separation during the late 1950s and early 1960s, they remained officially married until her death: she suffered serious internal injuries when she was violently mugged while visiting Italy in 1990 and irreparable damage to her kidneys led to her death. They had no children of their own by choice, but Wahrman did have a son by an earlier marriage, Michael Porges, who did not get along with Ackerman and would not live in Ackerman's home.\n\nAckerman was fluent in the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] [[Esperanto]], and claimed to have walked down [[Hollywood Boulevard]] arm-in-arm with [[Leo G. Carroll]] singing ''[[La Espero]]'', the hymn of Esperanto.<ref name=\"4forry.best.vwh.net\"/>\n\nAckerman was an atheist, but did not emphasize that fact in his public life and welcomed people of all faiths as well as no faith into his home and personal circle equally.<ref>http://www.unknowncountry.com/insight/ackerman-enigma-strange-case-forrest-j-ackerman-paul-davids</ref>\nHis first public stance on any political issue was in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Death==\nIn 2003, Ackerman said, \"I aim at hitting 100 and becoming the [[George Burns]] of science fiction\". His health, however, had been failing. He was susceptible to infection in his later life and, after one final trip to the hospital in October 2008, informed his best friend and caregiver Joe Moe that he did not want to go on. Honoring his wishes, his friends brought him home to hospice care. However, it turned out that in order to get Ackerman home, the hospital had cured his infection with antibiotics. So Ackerman went on for a few more weeks holding what he delighted in calling \"a living funeral\". In his final days he saw everyone he wanted to say good-bye to. Fans were encouraged to send messages of farewell by mail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38960|title=Forrest J Ackerman is slipping away|author=|date=3 November 2008|work=Aint It Cool News}}</ref>\n\nWhile there were several premature reports of his death in the month prior,<ref>these reports originated from a news article on the British Fantasy Society website; a correction was subsequently made.

The [[Film genre|genre]] is considered a form of [[speculative fiction]] alongside [[science fiction film]]s and [[horror film]]s, although the genres do overlap. Fantasy films often have an element of magic, [[myth]], wonder, escapism, and the extraordinary.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/fantasyfilms.html Fantasy Films<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Subgenres==\nSeveral sub-categories of fantasy films can be identified, although the delineations between these subgenres, much as in fantasy literature, are somewhat fluid.\n\nThe most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are [[High fantasy|High Fantasy]] and [[Sword and sorcery|Sword and Sorcery]].{{according to whom|date=October 2016}} Both categories typically employ quasi-medieval settings, wizards, magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories.\n\nHigh Fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world, and may also be more character-oriented or thematically complex. Often, they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle. Many scholars cite [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novel as the prototypical modern example of High Fantasy in literature, and the recent [[Peter Jackson]] [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film adaptation]] of the books is a good example of the High Fantasy subgenre on the silver screen.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Conan the barbarian.jpg|thumb|left|''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982), a typical Sword and Sorcery film]] -->\nSword and Sorcery movies tend to be more plot-driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences, often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy.  Although Sword and Sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High Fantasy movies, they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations, such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village, or even being driven by the desire for vengeance.\n\nThe [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|1982 film adaptation]] of [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'', for example, is a personal (non-epic) story concerning the hero's quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac\u2014while saving a beautiful princess in the process.  Some critics refer to such films by the term [[Sword and sandal|Sword and Sandal]] rather than Sword and Sorcery, although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth, and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever.  To some, the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations, designating a film with a low-quality script, bad acting, and poor production values.\n\nAnother important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is [[contemporary fantasy]].  Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the \"real\" world of today.\n\n[[Films with live action and animation]] such as [[Disney]]'s ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and the [[Robert Zemeckis]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action/animation hybrids (2 of those are also classified as musicals).\n\nFantasy films set in the [[afterlife]], called [[Bangsian fantasy|Bangsian Fantasy]], are less common, although films such as the 1991 [[Albert Brooks]] comedy ''[[Defending Your Life]]'' would likely qualify.  Other uncommon subgenres include [[Historical fantasy|Historical Fantasy]] and [[Romantic fantasy|Romantic Fantasy]], although 2003's ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' successfully incorporated elements of both.\n\nAs noted above, superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films, although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres.\n\n==Fantasy movies and the film industry==\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:LOTRROTKmovie.jpg|thumb|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', winner of the 2003 Academy Award for Best Picture]] -->\nAs a cinematic genre, fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film.  Undoubtedly, the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the \"[[Peplum (film genre)|Sword and Sandal]]\" afflictions of inferior production values, over-the-top acting, and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film's low regard.\n\nSince the early 2000s, however, the genre has gained new respectability in a way, driven principally by the successful adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' and J.K. Rowling's ''Harry Potter'' series. Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is notable due to its ambitious scope, serious tone, and thematic complexity. These pictures achieved phenomenal commercial and critical success, and the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|third installment]] of the trilogy became the first fantasy film ever to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The ''Harry Potter'' series has been a tremendous financial success, has achieved critical acclaim for its design, thematic sophistication and emotional depth, grittier realism and darkness, narrative complexity, and characterization, and boasts an enormous and loyal fanbase.\n\nFollowing the success of these ventures, Hollywood studios have greenlighted additional big-budget productions in the genre.  These have included adaptations of the first, second, and third books in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series and the teen novel ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', as well as adaptations of [[Susan Cooper]]'s ''[[The Dark Is Rising (film)|The Dark Is Rising]]'', [[Cornelia Funke]]'s ''[[Inkheart]]'', [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[The Golden Compass]]'', [[Holly Black]]'s ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', Nickelodeon's TV show ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', and the ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' segment (along with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s original poem) ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]''\n\nFantasy movies in recent years, such as ''The Lord of the Rings'' films, the first and third ''Narnia'' adaptations, and the first, second, fourth and seventh ''Harry Potter'' adaptations have most often been released in November and December. This is in contrast to science fiction films, which are often released during the northern hemisphere summer (June\u2013August). All three installments of the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' fantasy films, however, were released in July 2003, July 2006, and May 2007 respectively, and the latest releases in the ''Harry Potter'' series were released in July 2007 and July 2009. The huge commercial success of these pictures may indicate a change in Hollywood's approach to big-budget fantasy film releases.\n\n==History==\n{{Fantasyfilmlist}}\n\nFantasy films have a history almost as old as the medium itself.  However, fantasy films were relatively few and far between until the 1980s, when high-tech filmmaking techniques and increased audience interest caused the genre to flourish.\n\nWhat follows are some notable Fantasy films. For a more complete list see: [[List of fantasy films]]\n\n===1900\u20131920s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films before 1930}}\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:TheWizardofOzDVDcover.jpg|thumb|''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939), a fantasy film classic]] -->\nIn the era of [[silent film]], the earliest fantasy films were those made by French film pioneer [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] from 1903. The most famous of these was 1902's ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. In the Golden Age of Silent film (1918\u20131926) the most outstanding fantasy films were [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924), and ''[[Der m\u00fcde Tod|Destiny]]'' (1921). Other notables in the genre were [[F.W. Murnau]]'s romantic ghost story ''[[Phantom (1922 film)|Phantom]]'', ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' starring [[Elmo Lincoln]], and [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Satan (film)|The Sorrows of Satan]]''.\n\n===1930s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1930s}}\nFollowing the advent of [[sound film]]s, audiences of all ages were introduced from 1937's ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' to 1939's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.  Also notable of the era, the iconic 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' borrows heavily from the [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] subgenre of fantasy fiction as does such films as the 1935 adaptation of H. Rider Haggard's novel ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'' about an African expedition that discovers an immortal queen known as Ayesha \"She who must be obeyed\". [[Frank Capra]]'s 1937 picture ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' transported audiences to the [[Himalaya]]n fantasy kingdom of [[Shangri-La]], where the residents magically never age. Other noteworthy fantasy films of the 30s include ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' in 1932 starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]] starting a successful series of talking pictures based on the fantasy-adventure novels by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and the [[G. W. Pabst]] directed ''[[The Mistress of Atlantis]]'' from 1932. 1932 saw the release of the [[Universal Studios]] monster movie ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' which combined horror with a romantic fantasy twist. more light-hearted and comedic affairs from the decade include films like 1934s romantic drama film [[Death Takes a Holiday]] where [[Fredric March]] plays Death who takes a human body to experience life for three days and 1937s ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' where a man is haunted by two fun-loving ghosts who try to make his life a little more exciting.\n\n===1940s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1940s}}\nThe 1940s then saw several full-color fantasy films produced by [[Alexander Korda]], including ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), a film on par with ''The Wizard of Oz'', and ''[[Jungle Book (1942 film)|Jungle Book]]'' (1942).  In 1946, [[Jean Cocteau]]'s classic adaptation of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' won praise for its [[Surrealism|surreal]] elements and for transcending the boundaries of the [[fairy tale]] genre.  ''[[Sinbad the Sailor (1947 film)|Sinbad the Sailor]]'' (1947), starring [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.]], has the feel of a fantasy film though it does not actually have any [[fantastic]] elements.\n\nSeveral other pictures featuring supernatural encounters and aspects of Bangsian fantasy were produced in the 1940s during [[World War II]].  These include ''[[Beyond Tomorrow (1940 film)|Beyond Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)|The Devil and Daniel Webster]]'', and ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', all from 1941, ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' the musical ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' (1943), the comedy ''[[The Horn Blows at Midnight]]'' and romances such as ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'' (1947), ''[[One Touch of Venus (film)|One Touch of Venus]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Jennie]]'', both 1948.\n\nAlthough it's not classified as a fantasy film, [[Gene Kelly]]'s ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]'' had a fantasy sequence called \"The King who Couldn't Dance\" in which Gene did a song and dance number with [[Jerry Mouse]] from [[Tom and Jerry]].\n\nBecause these movies do not feature elements common to high fantasy or [[sword and sorcery]] pictures, some modern critics do not consider them to be examples of the fantasy genre.\n\n===1950s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1950s}}\nIn the 1950s there were a few major fantasy films, including ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' and ''[[The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T]]'', the latter penned by [[Dr. Seuss]].  Jean Cocteau's [[Orph\u00e9e|Orphic Trilogy]], begun in 1930 and completed in 1959, is based on [[Greek mythology]] and could be classified either as fantasy or surrealist film, depending on how the boundaries between these genres are drawn. Russian fantasy director [[Aleksandr Ptushko]] created three mythological epics from Russian fairytales, ''[[Sadko]]'' (1953), ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sampo (film)|Sampo]]'' (1959). Japanese director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s 1953 film ''[[Ugetsu Monogatari (film)|Ugetsu Monogatari]]'' draws on Japanese classical ghost stories of love and betrayal.\n\nOther notable pictures from the 1950s that feature fantastic elements and are sometimes classified as fantasy are ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'' (1950), featuring a [[p\u00faca]] of [[Celtic mythology]]; ''[[Scrooge (1951 film)|Scrooge]]'', the 1951 adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''; and [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s 1957 masterpiece, ''[[The Seventh Seal]]''. Disney's 1951 animated film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' is also a fantasy classic.\n\nThere were also a number of lower budget fantasies produced in the 1950s, typically based on Greek or Arabian legend.  The most notable of these may be 1958's ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'', featuring special effects by [[Ray Harryhausen]] and music by [[Bernard Herrmann]].\n\n===1960s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1960s}}\nHarryhausen worked on a series of fantasy films in the 1960s, most importantly ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963). Many critics have identified this film as Harryhausen's masterwork for its [[stop-motion]] animated statues, skeletons, [[harpies]], [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], and other mythological creatures. Other Harryhausen fantasy and science fantasy collaborations from the decade include the 1961 adaptation of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', the critically panned ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' starring [[Raquel Welch]], and ''[[The Valley of Gwangi]]'' (1969).\n\nCapitalising on the success of the [[sword and sandal]] genre several Italian [[B-movie]]s based on classical myth were made, including the ''[[Maciste]]'' series. Otherwise, the 1960s were almost entirely devoid of fantasy films. The fantasy picture ''[[7 Faces of Dr. Lao]]'', in which [[Tony Randall]] portrayed several characters from Greek mythology, was released in 1964. But the 1967 adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' removed most of the fantasy elements from [[T. H. White]]'s classic ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', on which the musical had been based. The 1960s also saw a new adaption of Haggard's ''[[She (1965 film)|She]]'' in 1965 starring [[Ursula Andress]] as the immortal \"She who must be obeyed\" and was followed by a sequel in 1968 ''[[The Vengeance of She]]'' based loosely on the novel [[Ayesha: The Return of She]] both produced by [[Hammer Film Productions]], 1968 also saw the release of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (film)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' based on a story by [[Ian Fleming]] with a script from [[Roald Dahl]].\n\n===1970s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1970s}}\nFantasy elements of [[Arthurian legend]] were again featured, albeit absurdly, in 1975's ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''. Harryhausen also returned to the silver screen in the 1970s with two additional ''Sinbad'' fantasies, ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1974) and ''[[Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger]]'' (1977). The animated movie ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'' (1977) had limited success at the box office but achieved status as a [[cult film]]. There was also ''[[The Noah]]'' (1975) which was never released theatrically but became a [[cult favorite]] when it was finally released on DVD in 2006. Some would consider 1977's ''[[Oh, God! (film)|Oh God!]]'', starring [[George Burns]] to be a fantasy film, and ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' (1978) was a successful Bangsian fantasy remake of 1941's ''Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (not 1943's ''Heaven Can Wait'').\n\nA few low budget \"Lost World\" pictures were made in the 1970s, such as 1975's ''[[The Land That Time Forgot (1975 film)|The Land That Time Forgot]]''. Otherwise, the fantasy genre was largely absent from mainstream movies in this decade, although 1971's ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' and ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' were two fantasy pictures in the public eye the former being predominantly from the same team who did ''Mary Poppins'' the latter again being from Roald Dahl in both script and novel.\n\n===1980s===\n{{See also|List of fantasy films of the 1980s}}\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Ladyhawke ver1.jpg|200px|thumb|As fantasy film's box office draw increased, so did its star power. 1985's ''[[Ladyhawke]]'', for example, starred [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] and [[Rutger Hauer]].]] -->\n1980s fantasy films were initially characterised by directors finding a new spin on established mythologies. Ray Harryhausen brought the monsters of Greek legends to life in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' while Arthurian lore returned to the screen in [[John Boorman]]'s 1981 ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]''. Films such as [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1985 ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' and [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1981\u20131986 trilogy of fantasy epics (''[[Time Bandits]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'') explored a new artist-driven style featuring surrealist imagery and thought-provoking plots. The modern [[sword and sorcery]] boom began around the same time with 1982's ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' followed by ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'' and ''[[Fire and Ice (1983 film)|Fire and Ice]]'' in 1983, as well as a boom in [[fairy tale]]-like fantasy films such as ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' (1985), ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), and ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]'' (1988).\n\nThe 1980s also started a trend in mixing modern settings and [[action movie]] effects with exotic fantasy-like concepts. ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), directed by [[John Carpenter]] and starring [[Kurt Russell]], combined humor, martial arts and classic Chinese folklore in a modern Chinatown setting.

"text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''finite set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that has a [[wikt:finite|finite]] number of [[Element (mathematics)|element]]s.  Informally, a finite set is a set which one could in principle count and finish counting. For example,\n:<math>\\{2,4,6,8,10\\}</math>\nis a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a [[natural number]] (a [[non-negative]] [[integer]]) and is called the [[cardinality]] of the set. A set that is not finite is called '''[[infinite set|infinite]]'''. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:\n:<math>\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}.</math>\nFinite sets are particularly important in [[combinatorics]], the mathematical study of [[counting]]. Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the [[pigeonhole principle]], which states that there cannot exist an [[injective function]] from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.\n\n== Definition and terminology ==\n\nFormally, a set {{mvar|''S''}} is called '''finite''' if there exists a [[bijection]]\n:<math>f\\colon S\\rightarrow\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}</math>\nfor some natural number {{mvar|''n''}}.  The number {{mvar|''n''}} is the set's cardinality, denoted as |{{mvar|''S''}}|.  The [[empty set]] {} or \u00d8 is considered finite, with cardinality zero.<ref>{{harvtxt|Apostol|1974|p=38}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Cohn|1981|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Labarre|1968|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Rudin|1976|p=25}}</ref>\n\nIf a set is finite, its elements may be written \u2014 in many ways \u2014 in a [[sequence]]:\n:<math>x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n \\quad (x_i \\in S,  1 \\le i \\le n).</math>\nIn [[combinatorics]], a finite set with {{mvar|''n''}} elements is sometimes called an ''{{mvar|n}}-set'' and a subset with {{mvar|''k''}} elements is called a ''{{mvar|k}}-subset''.  For example, the set {5,6,7} is a 3-set&nbsp;\u2013 a finite set with three elements&nbsp;\u2013 and {6,7} is a 2-subset of it.\n\n(Those familiar with the definition of the natural numbers themselves as conventional in set theory, the so-called [[Natural number#Von Neumann construction|von Neumann construction]], may prefer to use the existence of the more elegant bijection <math>f\\colon S\\rightarrow n</math>, which is obviously equivalent.)\n\n== Basic properties ==\n\nAny proper [[subset]] of a finite set ''S'' is finite and has fewer elements than ''S'' itself.  As a consequence, there cannot exist a [[bijection]] between a finite set ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S''.  Any set with this property is called [[Dedekind-finite]].  Using the standard [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for [[set theory]], every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF (Zermelo Fraenkel axioms with the [[axiom of choice]] removed) alone.  \nThe [[axiom of countable choice]], a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.\n\nAny injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a [[surjective function]] (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.\n\nThe [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite sets is finite, with\n:<math>|S\\cup T| \\le |S| + |T|.</math>\nIn fact:\n:<math>|S\\cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S\\cap T|.</math>\nMore generally, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of any finite number of finite sets is finite.  The [[Cartesian product]] of finite sets is also finite, with:\n:<math>|S\\times T| = |S|\\times|T|.</math>\nSimilarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with ''n'' elements has 2{{sup|''n''}} distinct subsets.  That is, the\n[[power set]] of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2{{sup|''n''}}.\n\nAny subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.\n\nAll finite sets are [[countable]], but not all countable sets are finite. (Some authors, however, use \"countable\" to mean \"countably infinite\", so do not consider finite sets to be countable.)\n\nThe [[free semilattice]] over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the [[Join and meet|join operation]] being given by set union.\n\n== Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness ==\n\nIn [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF), the following conditions are all equivalent:{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n# ''S'' is a finite set. That is, ''S'' can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.\n# ([[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]) ''S'' has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time. (See [[#Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness|below]] for the set-theoretical formulation of Kuratowski finiteness.)\n# ([[Paul St\u00e4ckel]]) ''S'' can be given a total ordering which is [[well-order]]ed both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of ''S'' has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.\n# Every one-to-one function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) into itself is [[onto]]. That is, the [[powerset]] of the powerset of ''S'' is Dedekind-finite (see below).<ref>The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by {{harvnb|Whitehead|Russell|2009|p=288}}. This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=73\u201374}}.</ref>\n# Every surjective function from ''P''(''P''(''S'')) onto itself is one-to-one.\n# ([[Alfred Tarski]]) Every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[minimal element]] with respect to inclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=48\u201358}}, demonstrated that his definition (which is also known as I-finite) is equivalent to Kuratowski's set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920|pp=130\u2013131}}.</ref> (Equivalently, every non-empty family of subsets of ''S'' has a [[maximal element]] with respect to inclusion.)\n# ''S'' can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are [[order isomorphic]]. In other words, the well-orderings on ''S'' have exactly one [[order type]].\n\nIf the [[axiom of choice]] is also assumed (the [[axiom of countable choice]] is sufficient<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=kkQAXtqb534C&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=If+the+axiom+of+choice+is+also+assumed+(the+axiom+of+countable+choice+is+sufficient%5B&source=bl&ots=ClBSj8_AMl&sig=fkJDTRruKBg003olsDDh-Tf-nG0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNvJzjz8zYAhVL6Y8KHQosCjYQ6AEIYDAJ#v=onepage&q=If%20the%20axiom%20of%20choice%20is%20also%20assumed%20(the%20axiom%20of%20countable%20choice%20is%20sufficient%5B&f=false|title=Handbook of Differential Equations: Ordinary Differential Equations|last=Canada|first=A.|last2=Drabek|first2=P.|last3=Fonda|first3=A.|date=2005-09-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080461083|language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}), then the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n# ''S'' is a finite set.\n# ([[Richard Dedekind]]) Every one-to-one function from ''S'' into itself is onto.\n# Every surjective function from ''S'' onto itself is one-to-one.\n# ''S'' is empty or every [[partial order]]ing of ''S'' contains a [[maximal element]].\n\n== Foundational issues ==\n\n[[Georg Cantor]] initiated his theory of sets in order to provide a mathematical treatment of infinite sets. Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the [[Finitism|strict finitists]], reject the existence of infinite sets and thus recommend a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of [[hereditarily finite set]]s constitutes a model of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation.\n\nEven for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter.   The difficulty stems from [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]]. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within [[Peano arithmetic]] (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called [[non-standard models]] of both theories. A seeming paradox, non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets contain infinite sets --- but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models.  So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to describe finiteness approximately.\n\nMore generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of [[formal system]]s varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), [[Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory]] (NBG), [[Non-well-founded set theory]], [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Type theory]] and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and [[intuitionistic logic]].\n\nA [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] might see the meaning{{fact|date=April 2017}}<!--sure that formalists might attribute meanings to mathematical notions???--> of ''set'' varying from system to system. Some kinds of [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonist]]s might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.\n\n== Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness ==\n<!--Linked from [[#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness]] above-->\n\nIn contexts where the notion of [[natural number]] sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set ''S'' as finite if ''S'' admits a [[bijection]] to some set of [[natural numbers]] of the form <math>\\{x|x<n\\}</math>. Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in [[set theory]], for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite [[well-ordered]] sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.\n\nVarious properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to [[Richard Dedekind]], the other to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)\n\nA set ''S'' is called [[Dedekind infinite]] if there exists an injective, non-surjective function <math>f:S \\rightarrow S</math>. Such a function exhibits a bijection between ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S'', namely the image of ''f''.  Given a Dedekind infinite set ''S'', a function ''f'', and an element ''x'' that is not in the image of ''f'', we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of ''S'', namely <math>x,f(x),f(f(x)),...</math>. Conversely, given a sequence in ''S'' consisting of distinct elements <math>x_1, x_2, x_3, ...</math>, we can define a function ''f'' such that on elements in the sequence <math>f(x_i) = x_{i+1}</math> and ''f'' behaves like the identity function otherwise.  Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.\n\n{{anchor|Kuratowski finite}} Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set ''S'', the binary operation of union endows the [[powerset]] ''P''(''S'') with the structure of a [[semi-lattice]].  Writing ''K''(''S'') for the sub-semi-lattice generated by the [[empty set]] and the singletons, call set ''S'' Kuratowski finite if ''S'' itself belongs to ''K''(''S'').<ref>The original paper by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}} defined a set ''S'' to be finite when\n: ''P''(''S'')\u2216{\u2205} = \u22c2{''X'' \u2208 ''P''(''P''(''S'')\u2216{\u2205}); (\u2200''x''\u2208''S'', {''x''}\u2208''X'') and (\u2200''A'',''B''\u2208''X'', ''A''\u222a''B''\u2208''X'')}.\nIn other words, ''S'' is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of ''S'' is equal to the intersection of all classes ''X'' which satisfy:\n* all elements of ''X'' are non-empty subsets of ''S'',\n* the set {''x''} is an element of ''X'' for all ''x'' in ''S'',\n* ''X'' is closed under pairwise unions.\nKuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set.</ref> Intuitively, ''K''(''S'') consists of the finite subsets of ''S''. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define ''generated by'' since one may obtain ''K''(''S'') simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semi-lattices containing the empty set and the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]].\n\nReaders unfamiliar with semi-lattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means ''S'' lies in the set ''K''(''S''), constructed as follows. Write ''M'' for the set of all subsets ''X'' of ''P''(''S'') such that:\n* ''X'' contains the empty set;\n* For every set ''T'' in ''P''(''S''), if ''X'' contains ''T'' then ''X'' also contains the union of ''T'' with any singleton.\nThen ''K''(''S'') may be defined as the intersection of ''M''.\n\nIn ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.\n\n=== Other concepts of finiteness ===\n\nIn ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set ''S'' are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength. In other words, if a set ''S'' meets one of the criteria in this list, it meets all of the criteria which follow that one. In the absence of the axiom of choice, the reverse implications are all unprovable. If the axiom of choice is assumed, then all of these concepts are equivalent.<ref>This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|pp=278\u2013280}}, and {{harvnb|L\u00e9vy|1958|pp=2\u20133}}, although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts.</ref> (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first. They are all pure \"set-theoretic\" definitions in terms of the equality and element-of relations, not involving \u03c9.)\n\n* '''I-finite'''. Every non-empty set of subsets of ''S'' has a \u2286-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a \u2286-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)\n* '''Ia-finite'''. For every partition of ''S'' into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.\n* '''II-finite'''. Every non-empty \u2286-monotone set of subsets of ''S'' has a \u2286-maximal element.\n* '''III-finite'''. The power set ''P''(''S'') is Dedekind finite.\n* '''IV-finite'''.

R. R. Tolkien]] in 1937 and published in 1949. The story describes the encounters between Farmer Giles and a wily [[western dragon|dragon]] named [[#Chrysophylax Dives|Chrysophylax]], and how Giles manages to use these to rise from humble beginnings to rival the king of the land. It is cheerfully [[anachronistic]] and light-hearted, set in Britain in an imaginary period of the Dark Ages, and featuring mythical creatures, medieval knights, and primitive firearms. It is only tangentially connected with the author's [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]]:  both were originally intended as essays in \"English mythology\".\n\nThe book was originally illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]]. The story has appeared with other works by Tolkien in omnibus editions, including ''[[The Tolkien Reader]]'' and ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nFarmer Giles (''\u00c6gidius [[Ahenobarbus]] [[Julia (gens)|Julius]] Agricola de Hammo'', \"Giles Bronze-beard Julius Farmer of Ham\") is not a hero. He is fat and red-bearded and enjoys a slow, comfortable life. But a rather deaf and short-sighted [[giant (mythology)|giant]] blunders on to his land, and Giles manages to ward him away with a [[blunderbuss]] shot in his general direction. The people of the village cheer: Farmer Giles has become a hero. His reputation spreads across the kingdom, and he is rewarded by the King with a sword named [[#Caudimordax|Caudimordax]] (\"Tailbiter\")\u2014which turns out to be a powerful weapon against dragons.\n\nThe giant, on returning home, relates to his friends that there are no more knights in the Middle Kingdom, just stinging flies\u2014actually the scrap metal shot from the blunderbuss\u2014and this entices a dragon, Chrysophylax Dives, to investigate the area. The terrified neighbours all expect the accidental hero Farmer Giles to deal with him.\n\nThe story parodies the great dragon-slaying traditions. The knights sent by the King to pursue the dragon are useless fops, more intent on \"precedence and etiquette\" than on the huge dragon footprints littering the landscape. The only part of a 'dragon' they know is the annual celebratory dragon-tail cake. Giles by contrast clearly recognises the danger, and resents being sent with them to face it. But hapless farmers can be forced to become heroes, and Giles shrewdly makes the best of the situation.\n\nIt has been suggested that the Middle Kingdom is based on early [[Mercia]],<ref>Shippey, Prof. Tom (2003), ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (expanded edition), Houghton Mifflin, p. 98, {{ISBN|0-618-25760-8}}</ref> and that Giles's break-away realm (the Little Kingdom) is based on [[Frithuwold of Chertsey#Frithuwald's Surrey|Frithuwald's Surrey]].<ref>Patricia Reynolds (1991), 'Frithuwold and the Farmer', ''Mallorn'' (journal of [[the Tolkien Society]]), issue 28, pp. 7-10</ref>\n\n==Philological humour==\nTolkien, himself a philologist, sprinkled several philological jokes into the tale, including a variety of ingeniously fake etymologies. Almost all the place-names are supposed to occur relatively close to [[Oxford]], along the [[Thames]], or along the route to London. At the end of the story, Giles is made Lord of [[Thame|Tame]], and Count of [[Worminghall]]. The village of Oakley, burnt to the ground by the dragon early in the story, may also be named after [[Oakley, Buckinghamshire]], near to Thame.\n\nTolkien insists, tongue in cheek, that the village of Thame originally referred to the Tame Dragon housed in it, and that \"tame with an h is a folly without warrant.\" Another joke puts a question concerning the definition of [[blunderbuss]] to \"the four wise clerks of Oxenford\" (a reference to [[Chaucer]]'s [[The Clerk's Tale|Clerk]]; Tolkien had worked for [[Henry Bradley]], one of the four main editors of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''):\n<blockquote>\nA short gun with a large bore firing many balls or slugs, and capable of doing execution within a limited range without exact aim. (Now superseded, in civilised countries, by other firearms.)\n</blockquote>\nand then satirises it with application to the situation at hand:\n<blockquote>\nHowever, Farmer Giles's blunderbuss had a wide mouth that opened like a horn, and it did not fire balls or slugs, but anything that he could spare to stuff in. And it did not do execution, because he seldom loaded it, and never let it off. The sight of it was usually enough for his purpose. And this country was not yet civilised, for the blunderbuss was not superseded: it was indeed the only kind of gun that there was, and rare at that. \n</blockquote>\n\nAs [[Tom Shippey]] points out: \"Giles's blunderbuss ... defies the definition and works just the same.\" (Introduction to ''Tales from the Perilous Realm'').\n\n==Chrysophylax Dives==\n'''Chrysophylax Dives''' {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|k|r|\u026a|s|\u0259|\u02c8|f|a\u026a|l|\u0259|k|s|_|\u02c8|d|a\u026a|v|i\u02d0|z}} is a comically villainous dragon. He stands midway between [[Smaug]], evil and greedy, and [[The Reluctant Dragon (short story)|The Reluctant Dragon]], comical and timid. ''Chrysophylax'' (\u03a7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be) is Greek for \"gold-guard\" and ''d\u012bves'' is [[Latin]] for \"rich\". (The classical pronunciation is {{IPA-la|\u02c8di\u02d0w\u025bs|}}).\n\nChrysophylax comes across as a pompous aristocrat\u2014rich, vain, and arrogant, but capable of compromise if handled correctly. Farmer Giles learns that he can be bullied, but is smart enough not to push him to desperation.\n\n==Caudimordax==\n'''Caudimordax''' is the [[Latin]] name of \"'''Tailbiter'''\", the sword of Farmer Giles. The sword cannot be sheathed when a dragon comes within five miles of its bearer's presence. Four generations earlier, the sword belonged to Bellomarius, \"the greatest of all the dragon-slayers\" in the Middle Kingdom. Farmer Giles is granted this antiquated sword\u2014by then become unfashionable\u2014as a reward for driving off a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] from his fields with his [[blunderbuss]]. He later uses the sword to capture and control the dragon.\n\n==Garm==\n'''Garm''' is the talking dog.<ref Name=\"Drout\">{{cite book |title= J.R.R.

They are usually peaceful with most other fish species, although there are reports of some specimens being a little nippy, so long-finned tank-mates are best avoided. Will eagerly accept most aquarium foods offered: flake, micro-pellets, small frozen foods such as daphnia and cyclops.A conditioned pair should be added to a specially set up breeding aquarium which should contain soft water with a pH below 6.5 and plenty of live plants, including Java moss. Once the eggs have been released or fertilised, the parents should be removed. The eggs should hatch after 24 hours, and after five days the fry will become free-swimming.

The dorsal fin becomes shorter, the fish achieves a more cylindrical shape, and the color fades to a dark brown. The fish is not suitable for fish tanks because of the size it can grow to. The highfin cannot be housed with tropical fish due to their lower temperature preferences. The highfin prefers to be in a school, so more than one should be housed together. The \"shark\" is a peaceful fish, and will not openly attack others. Highfins are bottom dwellers and omnivorous.

On average, gars can attain a length of not less than 70&nbsp;cm in captivity. They are aggressive fish by nature, however, they are also frightened easily.\n\nThese fish are generally piscivorous in the wild, but will take a variety of meaty foods in captivity. Therefore, a strong filtration system must be ensured for a healthy gar tank. Housing a 6-inch gar may require at least a {{convert|50|USgal|L}} tank with width of 12 inches. As the gar grows, it must be moved to a larger tank. The tank length to house a sub-adult gar should be at least 72 inches, but longer is even better. The width of the tank should not be less than 36 inches. (otherwise, the gar may feel uncomfortable making turns while it swims) A minimum of 24 inches of water depth will suit the gar well. Gars are strong jumpers, hence the tank lid should be weighted down.\n\nGars are hardy fish. They have the ability to breathe atmosphere air by means of vascularised gas bladder that act as lung. They are generally peaceful, usually keeping to themselves and not disturbing others. Hence, if space allows, they can be kept in a group. Large gars are capable of inflicting a painful wound. If possible, try not to handle them with bare hands.

Some aquarium fish and invertebrates also eat live plants. Hobbyists use aquatic plants for [[aquascaping]], of several aesthetic styles.\n\nMost of these plant species are found either partially or fully submerged in their natural habitat. Although there are a handful of obligate aquatic plants that must be grown entirely underwater, most can grow fully emersed if the soil is moist. Though some are just living at the water margins, still, they can live in the completely submerged habitat.\n\n==By scientific name==\nThe [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] of most plant genera is not final.

The men's costume is similar to that worn in the district generally; the linen trousers are long and black gaiters are worn. The women wear a white chemise; over that a very small corselet, and over that a red jacket with blue and black velvet facings. The skirt is brown above and red below, with a blue band between the two colours; it is accordion-pleated. Two identical skirts are often worn, one above the other.

The fasces had its origin in the [[Etruscan civilization]] and was passed on to [[ancient Rome]], where it symbolized a [[magistrate]]'s [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[jurisdiction]]. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the [[Labrys]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|xld-Grek|\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2}}, ''{{lang|xld-Latn|l\u00e1brys}}'') the double-[[Axe#Parts of the axe|bitted]] [[axe]], originally from [[Crete]], is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a ''bipennis''.<ref>the term for a single-bladed axe being ''h\u0113mipelekys'' \"half-pelekys\", e.g. [[Iliad|Il]]. 23.883.</ref> Commonly, the symbol was associated with [[female deities]], from prehistoric through historic times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe image has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial or collective power, law and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. [[Mercury dime]] coin and behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; and it was the origin of the name of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Italy (from which the term ''[[fascism]]'' is derived).\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century both the fasces and the [[swastika]] (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the [[authoritarian]]/[[Fascism|fascist]] political movements of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].  During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process.\n\nThe fact that the fasces remained in use in many societies after [[World War II]] may have been due to the fact that prior to Mussolini the fasces had already been adopted and incorporated within the governmental iconography of many governments outside Italy. As such, its use persists as an accepted form of governmental and other iconography in various contexts. (The [[swastika]] remains in common usage in parts of Asia for religious purposes which are also unrelated to early 20th century European fascism.)\n\nThe fasces is sometimes confused with the related term ''[[fess]]'', which in [[French heraldry]] is called a ''fasce''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Origin and symbolism==\n[[File:Fasces in the Sheldonian Theatre.jpg|thumb|Ornamentation consisting of fasces held in the mouth of a lion inside the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] at Oxford University]]\nA few artifacts found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe point to a possible Etruscan origin for fasces, but little is known about the Etruscans themselves.<ref>Haynes, S. (2000). Etruscan civilization: A cultural history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.</ref> Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the [[labrys]], the [[Anatolia]]n, and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-headed axe, later incorporated into the [[praetor]]ial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence for precise claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the fasces had developed into a thicker bundle of [[Betula pubescens|birch]] rods, sometimes surrounding a single-headed axe and tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder. On certain special occasions, the fasces might be decorated with a [[laurel wreath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}</ref>\n\nThe symbolism of the fasces could suggest strength through unity (see [[Unity makes strength]]); a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is very difficult to break. This symbolism occurs in [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] \"[[The Old Man and his Sons]]\". A similar story is told about the [[Bulgar]] (pre-Bulgarian, proto-Bulgarian) Khan [[Kubrat]], giving rise to the Bulgarian national motto \"Union gives strength\" (\u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430). However, bundled birch twigs could also symbolise [[corporal punishment]] (see [[birching]]).\n\n==Republican Rome==\nThe ''fasces lictoriae'' (\"bundles of the lictors\") [[symbol]]ised power and authority (''[[imperium]]'') in ancient [[Rome]], beginning with the early [[Roman Kingdom]] and continuing through the republican and [[Roman Empire|imperial]] periods. By republican times, use of the fasces was surrounded with tradition and protocol. A corps of ''apparitores'' (subordinate officials) called [[lictors]] each carried fasces before a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]], in a number corresponding to his rank. Lictors preceded [[Roman consul|consul]]s (and [[proconsul]]s), [[praetor]]s (and [[propraetor]]s), [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s, curule [[aedile]]s, [[quaestor]]s, and the [[Flamen Dialis]] during [[Roman triumph]]s (public celebrations held in Rome after a military conquest).\n\nAccording to Livy, it is likely that the lictors were an Etruscan tradition, adopted by Rome.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8</ref> The highest magistrate, the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', was entitled to twenty-four lictors and fasces, the consul to twelve, the proconsul eleven, the praetor six (two within the ''[[pomerium]]''), the propraetor five, and the curule aediles two.\n\nAnother part of the symbolism developed in Republican Rome was the inclusion of just a single-headed axe in the fasces, with the blade projecting from the bundle. The axe indicated that the magistrate's judicial powers (''[[imperium]]'') included capital punishment. Fasces carried within the ''[[Pomerium]]''\u2014the boundary of the sacred inner city of Rome\u2014had their axe blades removed; within the city, the power of life and death rested with the people through their assemblies. During times of emergency, however, the Roman Republic might choose a dictator to lead for a limited time period, who was the only magistrate to be granted capital punishment authority within the Pomerium. Lictors attending the dictator kept the axes in their fasces even inside the Pomerium\u2014a sign that the dictator had the ultimate power in his own hands. There were exceptions to this rule: in 48 BC, guards holding bladed fasces guided [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BCE)|Vatia Isauricus]] to the tribunal of [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Marcus Caelius]], and Vatia Isauricus used one to destroy Caelius's magisterial chair (''[[Curule Chair|sella curulis]]'').{{Clear}}\n\nAn occasional variation on the fasces was the addition of a [[laurel wreath]], symbolizing victory. This occurred during the celebration of a ''[[Roman triumph|Triumph]]'' - essentially a victory parade through Rome by a returning victorious general. Previously, all Republican Roman commanding generals had held high office with imperium, and so, already were entitled to the lictors and fasces.\n\n==Usage==\nThe modern Italian word ''[[fascio]]'', used in the twentieth century to designate peasant cooperatives and industrial workers' unions, is related to ''fasces''.\n\nNumerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the ''fasces'' as a [[symbol]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] since the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to the old republic or its ideals.\n\n[[Coat of arms of Ecuador|The Ecuadorian coat of arms]] incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arm of [[Gran Colombia]] since 1821.\n\n[[Italian Fascism]], which derives its name from the ''fasces'', arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The [[British Union of Fascists]] also used it in the 1930s. The ''fasces'', as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with much of [[fascist symbolism]], and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.\n\n===France===\nA review of the images included in ''Les Grands Palais de France ''Fontainebleau'' ''<ref>''Les Grands Palais de France '''Fontainebleau''', I re S\u00e9rie, Styles Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch.

In 2012, a wholly owned subsidiary called FASA Games Inc. went into operation, using the name and logo under license from the parent company. FASA Games Inc. works alongside Ral Partha Europe, also a subsidiary of FASA Corporation, to bring out new editions of existing properties such as [[Earthdawn]] and [[Demonworld]], and to develop new properties within the FASA cosmology.\n\nFASA first appeared as a ''[[Traveller (role-playing game)|Traveller]]'' licensee, producing supplements for that [[Game Designers' Workshop]] [[role-playing game]], especially the work of the Keith Brothers. The company went on to establish itself as a major gaming company with the publication of the first licensed ''[[Star Trek]]'' RPG, then several successful original games. Noteworthy lines included ''[[BattleTech]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]''. Their ''Star Trek'' role-playing supplements and tactical ship game enjoyed popularity outside the wargaming community since, at the time, official descriptions of the ''Star Trek'' universe were not common, and the gaming supplements offered details fans craved.\n\nThe highly successful ''[[BattleTech]]'' line led to a series of [[video game]]s, some of the first [[virtual reality]] gaming suites, called Virtual World (created by a subdivision of the company known at the time of development as ESP, an acronym for \"Extremely Secret Project\") and a Saturday-morning [[BattleTech: The Animated Series|animated TV series]].\n\nOriginally the name FASA was an acronym for \"[[Freedonia]]n Aeronautics and Space Administration\", a joking allusion to the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]''. This tongue-in-cheek attitude was carried over in humorous self-references in its games. For example, in ''[[Shadowrun]]'', a tactical nuclear device was detonated near FASA's offices at 1026 W. Van Buren St in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Original FASA Logo.png|120px|thumb|FASA Corporation logo in 1983]]\n\nFASA Corporation was founded by [[Jordan Weisman]] and [[L. Ross Babcock III]] in 1980 with a starting capital of $350. The two were fellow gamers at the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]]. Mort Weisman, Jordan's father, joined the company in 1985 to lead the company's operational management having sold his book publishing business, [[Swallow Press]].<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Keefer|url=http://www.gamespy.com/articles/697/697083p18.html|title=GameSpy Retro: Developer Origins|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=March 31, 2006|accessdate=November 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609133145/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/697/697083p18.html|archivedate=June 9, 2007}}</ref>\n\nUnder the new commercial direction and with Mort's capital injection, the company diversified into books and miniature figures. After consulting their UK distributor, Chart Hobby Distributors, FASA licensed the manufacture of its ''BattleTech'' figurines to [[Miniature figure (gaming)|Miniature Figurines]] (also known as Minifigs). FASA would later acquire the U.S. figures manufacturer [[Ral Partha]], which was the US manufacturer of Minifigs. While Mort ran the paper and metal based sides of the business, the company's founders focused on the development of computer-based games. They were particularly interested in virtual reality (particularly the [[BattleTech Centers]] / Virtual World) but also developed desktop computer games.\n\nWhen [[Microsoft]] acquired the [[FASA Interactive]] subsidiary, Babcock went with that company. After the sale of Virtual World, Jordan turned his attention to the founding of a new games venture called [[WizKids]].\n\n==Current status and intellectual property==\nFASA unexpectedly ceased active operations on April 30, 2001,<ref>{{cite web |last=Walker|first=Trey|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/mechcommander2/news.html?sid=2679199|title=FASA shuts down|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=January 26, 2001|accessdate=November 23, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525150938/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/mechcommander2/news.html?sid=2679199|archivedate=May 25, 2011}}</ref> but still exists as a corporation holding [[intellectual property]] rights, which it licenses to other publishers. Contrary to popular belief, the company did not go bankrupt. Allegedly the owners decided to quit while the company was still financially sound in a market they perceived as going downhill. Mort Weisman had been talking of retirement for some years and his confidence in the future of the paper-based games business was low. He considered the intellectual property of FASA to be of high value but did not wish to continue working as he had been for the last decade or more. Unwilling to wrestle with the complexities of dividing up the going concern, the owners issued a press release on January 25, 2001 announcing the immediate closure of the business.\n\nThe ''[[BattleTech]]'' and ''[[Shadowrun]]'' properties were sold to [[WizKids]], who in turn licensed their publication to [[Fantasy Productions|FanPro LLC]] and then to [[Catalyst Game Labs]]. The ''[[Earthdawn]]'' license was sold to [[WizKids]], and then back to FASA. Living Room Games published ''[[Earthdawn]]'' (Second Edition), [[RedBrick Limited|RedBrick]] published ''[[Earthdawn]]'' (Classic and Third Editions), but the license has now returned to FASA Corporation, and FASA Games, Inc. is the current license holder for new material. ''[[Crimson Skies]]'' was originally developed by [[Zipper Interactive]] under the FASA Interactive brand in late 2000 and used under license by FASA; [[FASA Interactive]] had been purchased by Microsoft, so rights to ''Crimson Skies'' stayed with Microsoft. Rights to the [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature]]s game ''[[VOR: The Maelstrom]]'' reverted to the designer Mike \"Skuzzy\" Nielsen, but it has not been republished in any form due partly to legal difficulties. Microsoft officially closed the FASA team in the company's gaming division on September 12, 2007.\n\nOn December 6, 2007, FASA founder [[Jordan Weisman]] announced that his new venture, [[Smith & Tinker]], had licensed the electronic gaming rights to ''[[MechWarrior (role-playing game)|MechWarrior]]'', ''[[Shadowrun]]'', and ''[[Crimson Skies]]'' from Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergfeld|first=Carlos|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/50247/fasa-founder-regains-rights-to|title=FASA Founder Regains Rights to MechWarrior, Shadowrun, Crimson Skies from Microsoft|website=[[Shacknews]]|publisher=Gamerhub Content Network|date=December 6, 2007|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>\nOn April 28, 2008 Mike \"Skuzzy\" Nielsen announced plans to create ''[[VOR: The Maelstrom|Vor]] 2.0''.\nAt Gen Con 2012, FASA Games, Inc. was revealed, which includes FASA Corporation co-founder Ross Babcock on the Board of Directors.

It served as the principal [[air superiority fighter]] for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and became important in the [[attack aircraft|ground-attack]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]] roles late in the war.  During the Vietnam War, one [[U.S. Air Force]] pilot, two weapon systems officers (WSOs),<ref name=\"dorrp200-201\"/> one [[U.S. Navy]] pilot and one [[radar intercept officer]] (RIO) became aces by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft.<ref name=\"Dorrp188-189\" /> The F-4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] in the U.S. Air Force, the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat |F-14 Tomcat]] in the U.S. Navy, and the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet |F/A-18 Hornet]] in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nThe F-4 Phantom II remained in use by the U.S. in the reconnaissance and [[Wild Weasel]] ([[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]]) roles in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], finally leaving service in 1996.<ref name= \"gulfp26\">Donald Spring 1991, p. 26.</ref><ref name= \"gulfvictoryp22\">Donald Summer 1991, p. 22.</ref>  It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the USAF [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds |Thunderbirds]] (F-4E) and the US Navy [[Blue Angels]] (F-4J).<ref name=\"Phab40th\"/><ref name= \"Lake 1992, p. 190\">Lake 1992, p. 190.</ref><ref>Lake 1992, p. 203.</ref> The F-4 was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations.

The company developed several projects including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name= \"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''.  Boeing.  Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular\u2014it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\n\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n[[File:North American XB-70A Valkyrie in formation 061122-F-1234P-035.jpg|right|thumb|A production F-4 taking part in a photoshoot with a [[Northrop F-5|F-5 Freedom Fighter]], [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 Talon]], [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighter]] and the second [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB-70 Valkyrie]] prototype, 8 June 1966.

After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the navy's focus on interception, the USAF emphasized a fighter-bomber role. With McNamara's unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]], yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.<ref name=\"Higham 1978\">Higham and Williams 1978</ref>\n\n===Costs===\n<!-- Approximately a five-fold increase from 1965 to 2005 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!||F-4C||RF-4C||F-4D||F-4E\n|-\n|Unit [[Research and development|R&D]] cost|| \u2013 || 61,200 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|61200|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || \u2013 || 22,700 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|22700|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Airframe|| 1,388,725 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1388725|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,679,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1679000|1965}}}} (Current) || 1,018,682 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1018682|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,662,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1662000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Engines|| 317,647 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|317647|1965}}}} (Current) || 276,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|276000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 260,563 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260563|1965}}}} (Current) || 393,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|393000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Electronics|| 52,287 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|52287|1965}}}} (Current)|| 293,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|293000|1965}}}} (Current) || 262,101 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|262101|1965}}}} (Current) || 299,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|299000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Armament|| 139,706 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|139706|1965}}}} (Current)|| 73,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|73000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 133,430 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|133430|1965}}}} (Current) || 111,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|111000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Ordnance|| \u2013 || \u2013 || 6,817 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6817|1965}}}} (Current)|| 8,000 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Flyaway cost|| 1.9&nbsp;million (1965)<br /> {{Inflation|US|1.9|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 2.3&nbsp;million (1965)<br /> {{Inflation|US|2.3|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 1.7&nbsp;million (1965)<br /> {{Inflation|US|1.7|1965|r=1}} million (Current) || 2.4&nbsp;million (1965)<br /> {{Inflation|US|2.4|1965|r=1}} million (Current)\n|-\n|Modification costs|| 116,289 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|116289|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973|| 55,217 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55217|1965}}}} (2008) by 1973 || 233,458 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|233458|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || 7,995 (1965) by 1973<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7995|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Cost per flying hour|| 924 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|924|1965}}}} (2008)|| 867 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)|| 896 (1965)<br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)|| 867 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Maintenance cost per flying hour || colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 545 (1965)<br /> {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|545|1965}}}} (Current)\n|}\nNote: Original amounts were in 1965 U.S. dollars.<ref name=\"knaack\">Knaack 1978</ref> The figures in these tables have been adjusted for inflation.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{See also|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II U.S. operators}}\n\n===United States Air Force===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n|+ USAF F-4 Summary for Vietnam War action\n|-\n!

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the \"Rivet Haste\" program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 \"Dogfight Sparrow\" had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots.

The Phantom was the first purely jet-powered aircraft to land on an American [[aircraft carrier]]<ref name=\"Angel p298\"/>{{#tag:ref|The first aircraft to land on an American carrier under jet power was the unconventional composite propeller-jet [[Ryan Aeronautical Company|Ryan]] [[FR Fireball]], designed to utilize its [[Reciprocating engine|piston engine]] during takeoff and landing. On 6 November 1945, the piston engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach; the pilot started the jet engine and landed, thereby performing the first jet-powered carrier landing, albeit unintentionally.<ref>\"First Jet Landing\".

Although with the end of the war, only 62 FH-1s were built, it helped prove the viability of [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-based]] jet fighters. As McDonnell's first successful fighter, leading to the development of the follow-on [[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H Banshee]], which was one of the two most important naval jet fighters of the [[Korean War]], it would also establish McDonnell as an important supplier of navy aircraft.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jjd-pkdRR0C&pg=PA10 ''USN F-4 Phantom II vs VPAF MiG-17/19: Vietnam 1965\u201373'']. Osprey Publishing.</ref> When McDonnell chose to bring the name back with the Mach 2\u2013class  [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]], it launched what would become the most versatile and widely used western combat aircraft of the Vietnam War era, adopted by the USAF and the US Navy.<ref>[http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/221514/usaf-mcdonnell-douglas-f-4-phantom-ii-by-peter-davies/ USAF McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II Penguin Random House Books]</ref>\n\nThe FH Phantom was originally designated the '''FD Phantom''', but the designation was changed as the aircraft entered production.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn early 1943, aviation officials at the United States Navy were impressed with McDonnell's audacious [[XP-67 Bat]] project. McDonnell was invited by the navy to cooperate in the development of a shipboard jet fighter, using an engine from the turbojets under development by [[Westinghouse Aviation Gas Turbine Division|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. Three prototypes were ordered on 30 August 1943 and the designation XFD-1 was assigned. Under the [[1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system]], the letter \"D\" before the dash designated the aircraft's manufacturer. The [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] had previously been assigned this letter, but the USN elected to reassign it to McDonnell because Douglas had not provided any fighters for navy service in years.<ref name=\"Mesko7\">Mesko 2002, p. 7.</ref>\n\nMcDonnell engineers evaluated a number of engine combinations, varying from eight 9.5&nbsp;in (24&nbsp;cm) diameter engines down to two engines of 19&nbsp;inch (48&nbsp;cm) diameter. The final design used the two 19&nbsp;in (48&nbsp;cm) engines after it was found to be the lightest and simplest configuration.<ref name=\"AI Nov87 p233\">''Air International'' November 1987, p. 233.</ref> The engines were buried in the wing root to keep intake and exhaust ducts short, offering greater aerodynamic efficiency than underwing [[nacelle]]s,<ref name=\"AI Nov87 p234\">''Air International'' November 1987, p. 234.</ref> and the engines were angled slightly outwards to protect the [[fuselage]] from the hot exhaust blast.<ref name=\"Mesko7\"/> Placement of the engines in the middle of the airframe allowed the [[cockpit]] with its bubble-style canopy to be placed ahead of the wing, granting the pilot excellent visibility in all directions. This engine location also freed up space under the nose, allowing designers to use [[tricycle gear]], thereby elevating the engine exhaust path and reducing the risk that the hot blast would damage the aircraft carrier deck.<ref name=\"Mesko p5\">Mesko 2002, p. 5.</ref> The construction methods and aerodynamic design of the Phantom were fairly conventional for the time; the aircraft had unswept wings, a conventional [[empennage]], and an [[aluminum]] [[monocoque]] structure with [[flush rivet]]ed aluminum skin. [[Folding wing]]s were used to reduce the width of the aircraft in storage configuration. Provisions for four [[.50 BMG|.50-caliber (12.7 mm)]] [[machine gun]]s were made in the nose, while racks for eight 5 in (127&nbsp;mm) [[High Velocity Aircraft Rocket]]s could be fitted under the wings, although these were seldom used in service.<ref name=\"Mesko7\"/> Adapting a jet to carrier use was a much greater challenge than producing a land-based fighter because of slower landing and takeoff speeds required on a small carrier deck. The Phantom used [[Flap (aircraft)|split flaps]] on both the folding and fixed wing sections to enhance low-speed landing performance,<ref name=\"AI Nov87 p234-5\">''Air International'' November 1987, pp. 234\u2013235.</ref> but no other [[high-lift device]]s were used. Provisions were also made for [[JATO|Rocket Assisted Take Off (RATO)]] bottles to improve takeoff performance.<ref name=\"Mesko7\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell FH-1 Phantom of VF-17A on USS Saipan (CVL-48) in May 1948.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Navy FH-1 of [[VF-171|VF-17A]] ''Phantom Fighters'' taxies to the catapult during carrier qualifications on the light aircraft carrier {{USS|Saipan|CVL-48|2}}, in May 1948]]\n\nWhen the first XFD-1, [[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''48235'', was completed in January 1945, only one Westinghouse 19XB-2B engine was available for installation. Ground runs and taxi tests were conducted with the single engine, and such was the confidence in the aircraft that the first flight on 26 January 1945 was made with only the one turbojet engine.<ref name=\"Franc mdd p382\">Francillon 1979, p. 382.</ref>{{#tag:ref|McDonnell assistant Chief Engineer Kendall Perkins has stated that this \"first flight\" was no more than a \"hop\", and that the real first flight would wait until a second engine was fitted a few days later.<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p258\"/>|group=N}} During flight tests, the Phantom became the first naval aircraft to exceed 500&nbsp;mph (434 kn, 805 kph).<ref name=\"Mills\"/> With successful completion of tests, a production contract was awarded on 7 March 1945 for 100 FD-1 aircraft. With the end of the war, the Phantom production contract was reduced to 30 aircraft, but was soon increased back to 60.<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p258\">''Air International'' November 1987, p. 258.</ref>\n\nThe first prototype was lost in a fatal crash on 1 November 1945,<ref name=\"Angel p297-8\">Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 297\u2013298.</ref> but the second and final Phantom prototype ([[United States military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''48236'') was completed early the next year and became the first purely jet-powered aircraft to operate from an American [[aircraft carrier]], completing four successful takeoffs and landings on 21 July 1946, from {{USS|Franklin D. Roosevelt|CV-42|2}} near [[Norfolk, Virginia]].<ref name=\"Mills\"/> At the time, she was the largest carrier serving with the U.S. Navy, allowing the aircraft to take off without assistance from a [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]].<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p258\"/> The second prototype crashed on 26 August 1946.<ref name=\"ASN236\">{{ASN accident|id=82095}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nProduction Phantoms incorporated a number of design improvements. These included provisions for a flush-fitting centerline [[drop tank]], an improved gunsight, and the addition of [[Air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]]. Production models used [[Westinghouse J30]]-WE-20 engines with 1,600&nbsp;lbf (7.1&nbsp;kN) of thrust per engine. The top of the vertical tail had a more square shape than the rounder tail used on the prototypes, and a smaller [[rudder]] was used to resolve problems with [[Flight control surfaces|control surface]] clearance discovered during test flights. The horizontal tail surfaces were shortened slightly, while the fuselage was stretched by 19&nbsp;in (48&nbsp;cm). The amount of framing in the windshield was reduced to enhance pilot visibility.<ref name=\"Mesko7\"/><ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p258\"/>\n\nHalfway through the production run, the navy reassigned the designation letter \"D\" back to Douglas, with the Phantom being redesignated FH-1.<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p258\"/> Including the two prototypes, a total of 62 Phantoms were finally produced, with the last FH-1 rolling off the assembly line in May 1948.<ref>Wagner 1982, p. 503.</ref>\n\nRealizing that the production of more powerful jet engines was imminent, McDonnell engineers proposed a more powerful variant of the Phantom while the original aircraft was still under development&nbsp;\u2013 a proposal that would lead to the design of the Phantom's replacement, the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee|F2H Banshee]]. Although the new aircraft was originally envisioned as a modified Phantom, the need for heavier armament, greater internal fuel capacity, and other improvements eventually led to a substantially heavier and bulkier aircraft that shared few parts with its agile predecessor.<ref name=\"Mesko10\">Mesko 2002, p. 10.</ref> Despite this, the two aircraft were similar enough that McDonnell was able to complete its first '''F2H-1''' in August 1948, a mere three months after the last '''FH-1''' had rolled off the assembly line.<ref>Wagner 1982, p. 504.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:FH-1s NAN11-49.jpg|thumb|right|Three FH-1 Phantoms of VMF-122 in 1949]]\n[[File:Minneapolis Navy Reserve FH F4U SNJ NAN10-51.jpg|thumb|right|Three aircraft of the Minneapolis U.S. Naval Air Reserve (front to back): an FH-1 Phantom, an F4U-1 Corsair, and an SNJ Texan in 1951.]]\n\nThe first Phantoms were delivered to USN fighter squadron [[VF-171|VF-17A]] (later redesignated [[VF-171]]) in August 1947;<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p259\">''Air International'' November 1987, p. 259.</ref> the squadron received a full complement of 24 aircraft on 29 May 1948.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Beginning in November 1947, Phantoms were delivered to [[United States Marine Corps]] squadron [[VMFA-122|VMF-122]], making it the first USMC combat squadron to deploy jets.<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p259\"/> VF-17A became the USN's first fully operational jet carrier squadron when it deployed aboard {{USS|Saipan|CVL-48|6}} on 5 May 1948.<ref name=\"Grossnick p171\">Grossnick 1997, p. 171.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Squadron [[VF-51|VF-5A]], flying the [[North American FJ-1 Fury]], had conducted the navy's first all-jet aircraft carrier operations at sea on 10 March 1948 aboard {{USS|Boxer|CV-21|2}}, but the entire squadron was not considered operational at the time.|group=N}}\n\nThe Phantom was one of the first jets used by the U.S. military for exhibition flying. Three Phantoms used by the [[Naval Air Test Center]] were used by a unique demonstration team called the [[Gray Angels]], whose members consisted entirely of naval aviators holding the rank of [[rear admiral]] ([[Daniel V. Gallery]], [[Apollo Soucek]] and [[Edgar A. Cruise]].)<ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p259\"/><ref name=\"goebel\">Goebel, Greg.

Retrieved: 10 May 2011.</ref> The team's name was an obvious play on the name of the recently formed U.S. Navy [[Blue Angels]], who were still flying propeller-powered [[Grumman F8F Bearcat]]s at the time. The \"Grays\" flew in various [[air show]]s during the summer of 1947, but the team was abruptly disbanded after their poorly timed arrival at a September air show in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], nearly caused a head-on low-altitude collision with a large formation of other aircraft; their Phantoms were turned over to test squadron [[VX-3 (US Navy squadron)|VX-3]].<ref name=\"Mills\"/> The VMF-122 Phantoms were later used for air show demonstrations until they were taken out of service in 1949, with the team being known alternately as the [[Marine Phantoms]] or the [[Flying Leathernecks (aerobatic team)|Flying Leathernecks]].<ref name=\"Mills\"/><ref name=\"AI Nov 87 p259\"/>\n\nThe Phantom's service as a frontline fighter would be short-lived. Its limited range and light armament&nbsp;\u2013 notably, its inability to carry [[bombs]]&nbsp;\u2013 made it best suited for duty as a [[point-defence]] [[interceptor aircraft]]. However, its speed and rate of climb were only slightly better than existing propeller-powered fighters and fell short of other contemporary jets, such as the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]], prompting concerns that the Phantom would be outmatched by future enemy jets it might soon face. Moreover, recent experience in World War II had demonstrated the value of naval fighters that could double as [[Ground attack aircraft|fighter-bomber]]s, a capability the Phantom lacked. Finally, the aircraft exhibited some design deficiencies&nbsp;\u2013 its navigational [[avionics]] were poor, it could not accommodate newly developed [[ejection seat]]s,<ref name=\"Mills\"/> and the location of the machine guns in the upper nose caused pilots to be dazzled by [[muzzle flash]].<ref name=\"Mesko10\"/>\n\nThe F2H Banshee and [[Grumman F9F Panther]], both of which began flight tests around the time of the Phantom's entry into service, better satisfied the navy's desire for a versatile, long-range, high-performance jet. Consequently, the FH-1 saw little weapons training, and was primarily used for carrier qualifications to transition pilots from propeller-powered fighters to jets in preparation for flying the Panther or Banshee. In June 1949, VF-171 (VF-17A) re-equipped with the Banshee, and their Phantoms were turned over to [[VF-172]]; this squadron, along with the NATC, VX-3, and VMF-122, turned over their Phantoms to the [[United States Naval Reserve]] by late 1949 after receiving F2H-1 Banshees. The FH-1 would see training duty with the USNR until being replaced by the F9F Panther in July 1954; none ever saw combat,<ref name=\"Mills\"/> having been retired from frontline service prior to the outbreak of the [[Korean War]].\n\n===Civilian use===\nIn 1964, [[Progressive Aero, Incorporated]] of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] purchased three surplus Phantoms, intending to use them to teach civilians how to fly jets. A pair were stripped of military equipment and restored to flying condition, but the venture was unsuccessful, and the aircraft were soon retired once again.<ref name=\"Mesko8\">Mesko, 2002 p. 8.</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n;XFD-1\n: Prototype aircraft powered by {{convert|1165|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} Westinghouse 19XB-2B engines (J-30).

These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of {{IPA|[f]}}; the back of the tongue against the [[soft palate]], in the case of [[German language|German]] {{IPA|[x]}} (the final consonant of ''[[Bach]]''); or the side of the tongue against the [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, in the case of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{IPA|[\u026c]}} (appearing twice in the name ''[[Llanelli]]''). This turbulent airflow is called '''frication'''.  A particular subset of fricatives are the '''[[sibilant]]s'''. When forming a sibilant, one still is forcing air through a narrow channel, but in addition, the tongue is curled lengthwise to direct the air over the edge of the teeth.  English {{IPA|[s]}}, {{IPA|[z]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0292]}} are examples of sibilants.\n\nThe usage of two other terms is less standardized: \"'''Spirant'''\" can be a synonym of \"fricative\", or (as in e.g. [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] linguistics) refer to non-sibilant fricatives only. \"'''Strident'''\" could mean just \"sibilant\", but some authors include also [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]] and [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] fricatives in the class.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Sibilants===\n* {{IPA|[s]}} [[voiceless alveolar fricative|voiceless coronal sibilant]], as in English ''s''ip\n* {{IPA|[z]}} [[voiced alveolar fricative|voiced coronal sibilant]], as in English ''z''ip\n* {{IPA|[s\u032a]}} [[voiceless dental sibilant]]\n* {{IPA|[z\u032a]}} [[voiced dental sibilant]]\n* {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} [[voiceless apicoalveolar fricative|voiceless apical sibilant]]\n* {{IPA|[z\u033a]}} [[voiced apicoalveolar fricative|voiced apical sibilant]]\n* {{IPA|[s\u0320]}} [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless postalveolar sibilant]] ([[laminal consonant|laminal]])\n* {{IPA|[z\u0320]}} [[voiced postalveolar fricative|voiced postalveolar sibilant]] (laminal)\n* {{IPA|[\u0283]}} [[voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant]] ([[domed consonant|domed]], partially palatalized), as in English ''sh''ip\n* {{IPA|[\u0292]}} [[voiced postalveolar fricative|voiced palato-alveolar sibilant]] (domed, partially palatalized), as the ''si'' in English vi''si''on\n* {{IPA|[\u0255]}} [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative|voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant]] (laminal, palatalized)\n* {{IPA|[\u0291]}} [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative|voiced alveolo-palatal sibilant]] (laminal, palatalized)\n* {{IPA|[\u0282]}} [[voiceless retroflex fricative|voiceless retroflex sibilant]] ([[apical consonant|apical]] or [[subapical consonant|subapical]])\n* {{IPA|[\u0290]}} [[voiced retroflex fricative|voiced retroflex sibilant]] (apical or subapical)\n\nAll [[sibilants]] are [[coronal consonant|coronal]], but may be [[dental consonant|dental]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]], or [[palatal consonant|palatal]] ([[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]) within that range.

This number actually outstrips the number of all consonants in English (which has 24 consonants). By contrast, approximately 8.7% of the world's languages have no phonemic fricatives at all.<ref>Maddieson, Ian. 2008. \"[http://wals.info/feature/18 Absence of Common Consonants]\". In: Haspelmath, Martin & Dryer, Matthew S. & Gil, David & Comrie, Bernard (eds.) ''The World Atlas of Language Structures Online''. Munich: Max Planck Digital Library, chapter 18. Accessed on 2008-09-15.</ref> This is a typical feature of [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], where the few fricatives that exist result from changes to [[Plosive consonant|plosive]]s or [[approximant consonant|approximant]]s, but also occurs in some indigenous languages of [[Papuan languages|New Guinea]] and South America that have especially small numbers of consonants. However, whereas {{IPA|[h]}} is ''entirely'' unknown in indigenous Australian languages, most of the other languages without true fricatives do have {{IPA|[h]}} in their consonant inventory.\n\nVoicing contrasts in fricatives are largely confined to Europe, Africa, and Western Asia. Languages of South and East Asia, such as [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], the [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Austronesian languages]], typically do not have such voiced fricatives as {{IPA|[z]}} and {{IPA|[v]}}, which are familiar to many European speakers. These voiced fricatives are also relatively rare in indigenous languages of the Americas. Overall, voicing contrasts in fricatives are much rarer than in plosives, being found only in about a third of the world's languages as compared to 60 percent for plosive voicing contrasts.<ref>Maddieson, Ian. \"Voicing in Plosives and Fricatives\", in Martin Haspelmath et al. (eds.) ''The World Atlas of Language Structures'', pp. 26\u201329. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-925591-1}}.</ref>\n\nAbout 15 percent of the world's languages, however, have ''unpaired voiced fricatives'', i.e. a voiced fricative without a voiceless counterpart. Two-thirds of these, or 10 percent of all languages, have unpaired voiced fricatives but no voicing contrast between any fricative pair.<ref>Maddieson, Ian. ''Patterns of Sounds''. Cambridge University Press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-521-26536-3}}.</ref>\n\nThis phenomenon occurs because voiced fricatives have developed from [[lenition]] of plosives or [[fortition]] of approximants.

The tissue damage resulting from this process is known as \"frost damage\". [[Farmer]]s in those regions where frost damage is known to affect their crops often invest in substantial means to protect their crops from such damage.\n\n==Introduction==\nFrost forms when the temperature of a solid surface in the open cools to below the freezing point of water and for the most clearly crystalline forms of frost in particular, below the [[dew point#Frost point|frost point]] in still air.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_frost.htm |title=What causes frost? |accessdate=2007-12-05 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210230539/http://www.weatherquestions.com/What_causes_frost.htm |archivedate=2007-12-10 |df=}}</ref> In most temperate countries such temperatures usually are the result of heat loss by radiation at night, so those types of frost sometimes are called '''radiation frost'''.\n\n[[#Types|Types]] of frost include crystalline '''[[#Hoar frost|hoar frost]]''' from [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]] of [[water vapor]] from air of low humidity, '''[[#White frost|white frost]]''' in humid conditions, '''[[#Window frost|window frost]]''' on glass surfaces, '''[[#Advection frost|advection frost]]''' from cold wind over cold surfaces, '''[[#Black frost|black frost]]''' without visible ice at low temperatures and very low humidity, and '''[[#Rime|rime]]''' under supercooled wet conditions.<ref name=\"Oliver2005\"/>\n\nThe size of frost crystals varies depending on the time they have been building up and the amount of water vapor available. Frost crystals may be clear or [[translucent]], but, like snow, a mass of frost crystals will scatter light in all directions, so that a coating of frost appears white.\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Nevada-Apartadero-Merida-Venezuela.jpg|thumb|Frost in the [[list of highest towns by country|highest town in Venezuela]], [[Apartaderos]]. Because of its location in an [[alpine tundra]] [[ecosystem]] called [[p\u00e1ramo]], there exists a daily freeze-and-thaw cycle, sometimes described as \"summer every day and winter every night.\"]]\nIf a solid surface is chilled below the [[dew point]] of the surrounding humid air and the surface itself is colder than freezing, ice will form on it. If the water deposits as a liquid that then freezes, it forms a coating that may look glassy, opaque, or crystalline, depending on its [[#Types|type]]. Depending on context, that process also may be called [[atmospheric icing]]. The ice it produces differs in some ways from crystalline frost, which consists of spicules of [[ice]] that typically project from the solid surface on which they grow.\n\nThe main difference between the ice coatings and frost spicules arises from the fact that the crystalline spicules grow directly from [[deposition (phase transition)|desublimation]] of water vapour from air, and desublimation is not a factor in icing of freezing surfaces. For desublimation to proceed the surface must be below the [[dew point#Frost point|frost point]] of the air, meaning that it is sufficiently cold for ice to form without passing through the [[liquid|liquid phase]]. The air must be humid, but not sufficiently humid to permit the condensation of liquid water, or icing will result instead of desublimation. The size of the [[crystal]]s depends largely on the temperature, the amount of [[water vapor]] available, and how long they have been growing undisturbed.\n\nAs a rule, except in conditions where [[supercooling|supercooled]] droplets are present in the air, frost will form only if the deposition surface is colder than the surrounding air. For instance frost may be observed around cracks in cold wooden sidewalks when humid air escapes from the warmer ground beneath. Other objects on which frost commonly forms are those with low [[specific heat]] or high [[thermal emissivity]], such as blackened metals; hence the accumulation of frost on the heads of rusty nails.\n\nThe apparently erratic occurrence of frost in adjacent localities is due partly to differences of elevation, the lower areas becoming colder on calm nights. Where static air settles above an area of ground in the absence of wind, the [[molar absorptivity|absorptivity]] and specific heat of the ground strongly influence the temperature that the trapped air attains.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Hoar frost===\n[[File:Frostweb.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[spider web]] covered in air hoar frost]]\n[[File:HoarFrost.jpg|thumb|Hoar frost on the snow]]\n[[File:LightLTSEM.jpg|thumb|Depth hoar, [[micrograph|imaged]] with [[optical microscope|optical]] (left) and [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron]] (right) [[microscopy]]]]\n\n'''Hoar frost''' (also '''hoarfrost''', '''radiation frost''', or '''pruina''') refers to white [[ice crystals]] deposited on the ground or loosely attached to exposed objects, such as wires or leaves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoar%20frost|title=Hoarfrost \u2013 Definition of hoarfrost by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219065328/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoar%20frost|archivedate=2015-02-19|df=}}</ref> They form on cold, clear nights when conditions are such that [[radiative cooling#Nocturnal surface cooling|heat radiates]] out to the open air faster than it can be replaced from nearby sources, such as wind or warm objects.

Hoar frost may freeze in such low-lying cold air even when the air temperature a few feet above ground is well above freezing.\n\nThe word ''hoar'' comes from an [[Old English]] adjective that means \"showing signs of old age\". In this context, it refers to the frost that makes trees and bushes look like white hair. <!-- Please leave out the following bit of folk etymology: \"may also have association with hawthorn when covered in ... white spring blossom\". The speculation is wrong. See OED! -->\n\nHoar frost may have different names depending on where it forms:\n*'''Air hoar''' is a deposit of hoar frost on objects above the surface, such as tree branches, plant stems, and wires.\n*'''Surface hoar''' refers to fern-like ice crystals directly deposited on snow, ice or already frozen surfaces.\n*'''Crevasse hoar''' consists of crystals that form in glacial crevasses where water vapour can accumulate under calm weather conditions.\n*'''[[Depth hoar]]''' refers to faceted crystals that have slowly grown large within cavities beneath the surface of banks of dry snow. Depth hoar crystals grow continuously at the expense of neighbouring smaller crystals, so typically are visibly stepped and have faceted hollows.\n\nWhen surface hoar covers sloping snowbanks, the layer of frost crystals may create an [[avalanche]] risk; when heavy layers of new snow cover the frosty surface, furry crystals standing out from the old snow hold off the falling flakes, forming a layer of voids that prevent the new snow layers from bonding strongly to the old snow beneath. Ideal conditions for hoarfrost to form on snow are cold clear nights, with very light, cold air currents conveying humidity at the right rate for growth of frost crystals. Wind that is too strong or warm destroys the furry crystals, and thereby may permit a stronger bond between the old and new snow layers. However, if the winds are strong enough and cold enough to lay the crystals flat and dry, carpeting the snow with cold, loose crystals without removing or destroying them or letting them warm up and become sticky, then the frost interface between the snow layers may still present an avalanche danger, because the texture of the frost crystals differs from the snow texture and the dry crystals will not stick to fresh snow. Such conditions still prevent a strong bond between the snow layers.<ref name=\"McClungSchaerer2006\">{{cite book|author1=David McClung|author2=Peter A.

The ice dust then may form [[yukimarimo]], as has been observed in parts of Antarctica, in a process similar to the formation of [[dust bunny|dust bunnies]] and similar structures.\n\nHoar frost and [[#White frost|white frost]] also occurs in man-made environments such as in freezers or industrial [[refrigeration|cold storage]] facilities. If such cold spaces or the pipes serving them are not well insulated and are exposed to ambient [[humidity]], the moisture will freeze instantly depending on the [[freezer]] [[temperature]]. The frost may coat pipes thickly, partly insulating them, but such inefficient insulation still is a source of heat loss.\n\n===Advection frost===\n[[File:Frosted Flower.jpg|alt=A photo of a flower with advection frost on the tips of its petals.|thumb|A flower with advection frost on the edges of its petals]]\n\n'''Advection frost''' (also called '''wind frost''') refers to tiny ice spikes that form when very cold [[wind]] is blowing over tree branches, poles, and other surfaces. It looks like rimming on the edges of flowers and leaves and usually forms against the [[windward and leeward|direction of the wind]]. It can occur at any hour, day or night.\n\n===Window frost===\n'''Window frost''' (also called '''fern frost''' or '''ice flowers''') forms when a glass pane is exposed to very cold air on the outside and warmer, moderately moist air on the inside. If the pane is not a good [[thermal insulation|insulator]] (for example, if it is a single pane window), water vapour condenses on the glass forming frost patterns. With very low temperatures outside, frost can appear on the bottom of the window even with double pane energy efficient windows because the air convection between two panes of glass ensures that the bottom part of the glazing unit is colder than the top part. On unheated motor vehicles the frost will usually form on the outside surface of the glass first. The glass surface influences the shape of crystals, so imperfections, scratches, or dust can modify the way ice [[nucleation|nucleates]]. The patterns in window frost form a [[fractal]] with a [[fractal dimension]] greater than one but less than two. This is a consequence of the nucleation process being constrained to unfold in two dimensions, unlike a snowflake which is shaped by a similar process but forms in three dimensions and has a fractal dimension greater than two.<ref>{{cite book|last=West|first=Bruce|author2=Mauro Bologna|others=Paolo Grigolini|title=Physics of Fractal Operators|publisher=Springer|date=2003|pages=46|isbn=0-387-95554-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EgyTpQZOga0C&pg=PA46&dq=frost+fractals&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R0ypVLHxGtDKaLfogKAM&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=frost%20fractals&f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171213143059/https://books.google.com/books?id=EgyTpQZOga0C&pg=PA46&dq=frost+fractals&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R0ypVLHxGtDKaLfogKAM&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=frost%20fractals&f=false|archivedate=2017-12-13|df=}}</ref>\n\nIf the indoor air is very [[relative humidity|humid]], rather than moderately so, water will first [[condensation|condense]] in small droplets and then freeze into [[clear ice]].\n\nSimilar patterns of freezing may occur on other smooth vertical surfaces, but they seldom are as obvious or spectacular as on clear glass.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Frost patterns 1.jpg\nFile:Frost patterns 2.jpg\nFile:Frost patterns 3.jpg\nFile:Frost patterns 4.jpg\nFile:Frost patterns 5.jpg\nFile:Frost patterns 25.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n===White frost===\n'''White frost''' is a solid [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]] of ice that forms directly from [[water vapor|water vapour]] contained in [[air]].\n\nWhite frost forms when there is a [[relative humidity]] above 90% and a temperature below \u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C (18&nbsp;\u00b0F) and it grows against the [[wind]] direction, since air arriving from [[windward and leeward|windward]] has a higher humidity than leeward air, but the wind must not be strong or it damages the delicate icy structures as they begin to form. White frost resembles a heavy coating of hoar frost with big, interlocking crystals, usually needle-shaped.\n\n===Rime===\n{{Main|Soft rime|Hard rime}}\n\n'''Rime''' is a type of ice [[deposition (phase transition)|deposition]] that occurs quickly, often under heavily humid and windy conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rime|title=Rime \u2013 Definition of rime by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501193835/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rime|archivedate=2015-05-01|df=}}</ref> Technically speaking, it is not a type of frost, since usually [[supercooling|supercooled]] water drops are involved, in contrast to the formation of hoar frost, in which water vapour desublimates slowly and directly. Ships travelling through Arctic seas may accumulate large quantities of rime on the rigging. Unlike hoar frost, which has a feathery appearance, rime generally has an icy, solid appearance.\n\n===Black frost===\n'''Black frost''' (or \"killing frost\") is not strictly speaking frost at all, because it is the condition seen in crops when the humidity is too low for frost to form, but the temperature falls so low that plant tissues freeze and die, becoming blackened, hence the term \"black frost\". Black frost often is called \"killing frost\" because white frost tends to be less cold, partly because the [[latent heat]] of freezing of the water reduces the temperature drop.\n\n==Effect on plants==\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Feuilles-avec-glace-leaves-with-ice-1.jpg|right|thumb|Frost on the grass of a public park in January.]]\nMany plants can be damaged or killed by freezing temperatures or frost.

[[Frost crack]] is a bark defect caused by a combination of low temperatures and heat from the winter sun.\n\nVegetation is not necessarily damaged when leaf temperatures drop below the freezing point of their cell contents.

His father was half Hungarian and his mother entirely Hungarian.<ref name=\"autogenerated1939\"/> He was a Roman Catholic.<ref name=\"autogenerated1939\"/>\n\nHis earliest teacher was his mother, M\u00e1ria Ravasz, an accomplished pianist, who gave him a systematic instruction in the keyboard works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]. He received a thorough foundation in theory from Brother [[Felizian Moczik]], the outstanding organist at the Franciscan church in Pressburg.<ref>Biographical note in insert to Amadeo recording AVRS 5004-5005.</ref> He studied [[piano]] briefly with [[Theodor Leschetizky]], with whom he clashed. He moved to [[Vienna]] with his family in 1888, and studied at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]] (composition with [[Robert Fuchs]], [[cello]] with [[Ferdinand Hellmesberger]] and theory (the counterpoint class) with [[Anton Bruckner]]), graduating \"with excellence\" in 1896.\n\nHe beat 13 other applicants and obtained a post as cellist with the Vienna Court Opera Orchestra, where he played until 1914, often under [[Gustav Mahler]]. Mahler habitually had Schmidt play all the cello solos, even though [[Friedrich Buxbaum]] was the principal cellist. Schmidt was also in demand as a chamber musician. Schmidt and Arnold Schoenberg maintained cordial relations despite their vast differences in style. Also a brilliant pianist, in 1914 Schmidt took up a professorship in piano at the Vienna Conservatory, which had been recently renamed [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts]]. (Apparently, when asked who the greatest living pianist was, [[Leopold Godowsky]] replied, \"The other one is Franz Schmidt.\") In 1925 he became Director of the Academy, and from 1927 to 1931 its Rector.\n\nAs teacher of piano, cello and counterpoint and composition at the Academy, Schmidt trained numerous musicians, conductors and composers who later achieved fame. Among his best-known students were the pianist [[Friedrich W\u00fchrer]] and [[Alfred Ros\u00e9]] (son of [[Arnold Ros\u00e9]], the legendary founder of the Ros\u00e9 Quartet, Konzertmeister of the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] and brother-in-law of [[Gustav Mahler]]). Among the composers were [[Theodor Berger]], [[Marcel Rubin]] and [[Alfred Uhl]]. He received many tokens of the high esteem in which he was held, notably the [[Franz-Josef Order]], and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Vienna.<ref>This paragraph taken from German Wikipedia.</ref>\n\nSchmidt's private life was in stark contrast to the success of his distinguished professional career, and was overshadowed by tragedy. His first wife Karoline Perssin (c1880-1943) was confined in the Vienna mental hospital [[Steinhof (Vienna)|Am Steinhof]] in 1919, and three years after his death was murdered under the [[Aktion T4|Nazi euthanasia program]]. Their daughter Emma Schmidt Holzschuh (1902\u20131932, married 1929) died unexpectedly after the birth of her first child. Schmidt experienced a spiritual and physical breakdown after this,  achieved an artistic revival and resolution in his Fourth Symphony of 1933 (which he inscribed as \"Requiem for my Daughter\") and, especially, in his oratorio The Book With Seven Seals. His second marriage in 1923, to a successful young piano student Margarethe Jirasek (1891\u20131964), for the first time brought some desperately needed stability into the private life of the artist, who was plagued by many serious health problems.<ref>This paragraph re-worked from German Wikipedia.</ref>\n  \nSchmidt's worsening health forced his retirement from the Academy in early 1937. In the last year of his life Austria was brought into the [[German Reich]] by the [[Anschluss]], and Schmidt was f\u00eated by the Nazi authorities as the greatest living composer of the so-called [[Ostmark\u3000(Austria)|Ostmark]]. He was given a commission to write a cantata entitled \"The German Resurrection\", which, after 1945, was taken by many as a reason to brand him as having been tainted by Nazi sympathy. However, Schmidt left this composition unfinished, and in the summer and autumn of 1938, a few months before his death, set it aside to devote himself to two other commissioned works for the one-armed pianist [[Paul Wittgenstein]]: the Quintet in A major for piano left-hand, clarinet, and string trio; and the Toccata in D minor for solo piano.\nSchmidt died on 11 February 1939.<ref>This paragraph from German Wikipedia.</ref>\n\n== Musical works ==\nAs a composer, Schmidt was slow to develop, but his reputation, at least in Austria, saw a steady growth from the late 1890s until his death in 1939. In his music, Schmidt continued to develop the Viennese classic-romantic traditions he inherited from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and his own master, Bruckner. He also takes forward the exotic \"gypsy\" style of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] and Brahms. His works are monumental in form and firmly tonal in language, though quite often innovative in their designs and clearly open to some of the new developments in musical syntax initiated by Mahler and Schoenberg. Although Schmidt did not write a lot of chamber music, what he did write, in the opinion of such critics as Wilhelm Altmann, was important and of high quality. Although Schmidt's organ works may resemble others of the era in terms of length, complexity, and difficulty, they are forward-looking in being conceived for the smaller, clearer, classical-style instruments of the ''Orgelbewegung'', which he advocated. Schmidt worked mainly in large forms, including four [[symphony|symphonies]] (1899, 1913, 1928 and 1933) and two [[opera]]s: ''Notre Dame'' (1904\u20136) and ''Fredigundis'' (1916\u201321). A CD recording of ''Notre Dame'' has been available for many years, starring Dame [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] and [[James King (tenor)|James King]].\n\n===''Fredigundis''===\n\nNo really adequate recording has been made of Schmidt's second and last opera ''Fredigundis'', of which there has been but one \"unauthorized\" release in the early 1980s on the Voce label of an Austrian Radio broadcast of a 1979 Vienna performance under the direction of [[Ernst M\u00e4rzendorfer]]. Aside from numerous \"royal fanfares\" (Fredigundis held the French throne in the sixth century) the score contains some fine examples of Schmidt's later style. ''New Grove'' encyclopaedia states that ''Fredigundis'' was a critical and popular failure, which may be partly attributable to the fact that Fredigundis ([[Fredegund]], the widow of [[Chilperic I]]), is presented as a murderous and sadistic feminine monster. Add to this some structural problems with the libretto, and the opera's failure to make headway \u2013 despite an admirable and impressive score \u2013 becomes comprehensible.\n\n===''The Book with Seven Seals''===\n{{main article|The Book with Seven Seals}}\nSchmidt's crowning achievement was the [[oratorio]] ''Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln'' (1935\u201337), a setting of passages from the [[Book of Revelation]]. His choice of subject was prophetic: with hindsight the work appears to foretell, in the most powerful terms, the disasters that were shortly to be visited upon Europe in the Second World War. Here his invention rises to a sustained pitch of genius. A narrative upon the text of the oratorio was provided by the composer.<ref>F.

Recorded Stephaniesaal, Graz, January 1962.</ref>\n\nSchmidt's oratorio stands in the Austro-German tradition stretching back to the time of J. S. Bach and [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]].  He was one of relatively few composers to write an oratorio fully on the subject of the [[Book of Revelation]] (earlier works include Telemann: Der Tag des Gerichts, Schneider: Das Weltgericht, Spohr: Die letzten Dinge, Raff: Weltende, and Vaughan Williams: Sancta Civitas). Far from glorifying its subject, it is a mystical contemplation, a horrified warning, and a prayer for salvation. The premiere was held in Vienna on 15 June 1938, with the [[Vienna Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Oswald Kabasta]]: the soloists were Rudolf Gerlach (John), Erika Rokyta, Enid Szantho, [[Anton Dermota]], Josef von Manowarda and with Franz Sch\u00fctz at the organ.\n\n===Symphonies===\nSchmidt is generally, if erroneously, regarded as a conservative composer (such labels rest upon yet-to-be-resolved aesthetic/stylistic arguments), but the [[rhythmic]] subtlety and [[harmony|harmonic]] complexity of much of his music belie this. His music is modern without being modernist, combining a reverence for the great Austro-German lineage of composers with very personal innovations in harmony and [[orchestration]] (showing an awareness of the output of composers such as [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], whose piano music he greatly admired, along with a knowledge of more recent composers in his own German-speaking realm, such as Schoenberg, [[Alban Berg|Berg]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], etc.). The considerable technical accomplishment of his music ought to compel respect, but he seems to have fallen between two stools: his works are too complex for the conservatively minded, yet too obviously traditional for the avant-garde (they are also notoriously difficult to perform). Since the 1970s his music has enjoyed a modest revival which looks set to continue as it is rediscovered and re-evaluated.\n\n*'''Symphony No. 1 in E major'''. <br />Written in 1896 at age 22. The scherzo (which shows a mature absorption of Bruckner and [[Richard Strauss]]) is especially noteworthy, while Schmidt demonstrates his contrapuntal skills in the Finale.\n*'''Symphony No. 2 in E flat major'''. <br />Written in 1913 in a style reminiscent of Strauss and [[Max Reger|Reger]], with homage to the grandiosity of Bruckner. This is Schmidt's longest symphony and it employs a huge [[orchestra]]. The central movement (of three) is an ingenious set of variations, which are grouped to suggest the characters of slow movement and scherzo. The complex scoring renders it a considerable challenge for most orchestras.\n*'''Symphony No. 3 in A major'''. <br />A sunny, melodic work in the Schubert vein (although its lyricism and superb orchestration do much to conceal the fact that it is one of the composer's most harmonically advanced works). Winner of the Austrian section of the [[1928 International Columbia Graphophone Competition]] (the overall winner was Swedish composer [[Kurt Atterberg]] with his 6th Symphony), it enjoyed some popularity at the time (1928).\n*'''Symphony No. 4 in C major'''.<br />Written in 1933, this is the best-known work of his entire oeuvre. The composer called it \"A requiem for my daughter\". It begins with a long 23-bar melody on an unaccompanied solo trumpet (which returns at the symphony's close, \"transfigured\" by all that has intervened). The Adagio is an immense ABA ternary structure. The first A is an expansive threnody on solo cello (Schmidt's own instrument) whose seamless lyricism predates Strauss's ''[[Metamorphosen]]'' by more than a decade (its theme is later adjusted to form the scherzo of the symphony); the B section is an equally expansive funeral march (perhaps referencing [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'' in its texture) whose dramatic climax is marked by an orchestral crescendo culminating in a gong and cymbal crash (again, a clear allusion to similar climaxes in the later symphonies of Bruckner, and followed by what [[Harold Truscott]] has brilliantly described as a \"reverse climax\", leading back to a repeat of the A section).\n\n==Schmidt and Nazism==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2013}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nSchmidt's premiere of ''Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln'' was made much of by the Nazis (who had annexed Austria shortly before in the [[Anschluss]]), and Schmidt was seen (according to a report by [[Georg Tintner]], who revered Schmidt and intended to record his symphonies until prevented by his own death) to give the Nazi salute. His conductor [[Oswald Kabasta]] was apparently an enthusiastic Nazi who, being prohibited from conducting in 1946 during de-nazification, committed suicide. These facts long placed Schmidt's posthumous reputation under a cloud. His lifelong friend and colleague [[Oskar Adler]], who fled the Nazis in 1938, wrote afterwards that Schmidt was never a Nazi and never antisemitic but was extremely na\u00efve about politics. [[Hans Keller]] gave similar endorsement. Regarding Schmidt's political naivety, [[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Michael Steinberg]], in his book ''The Symphony'', tells of Schmidt's recommending ''Variations on a Hebrew Theme'' by his student Israel Brandmann to a musical group associated with the proto-Nazi German National Party. Most of Schmidt's principal musical friends were Jews, and they benefited from his generosity.\n\nSchmidt's last listed work, the cantata ''German Resurrection'', was composed to a Nazi text. As one of the most famous living Austrian composers, Schmidt was well-known to Hitler and received this commission after the Anschluss. He left it unfinished, to be completed later by Robert Wagner. Already seriously ill, Schmidt worked instead on other compositions such as the Quintet in A major for piano (left hand), clarinet and string trio, intended for [[Paul Wittgenstein]] and incorporating a variation set based on a theme by Wittgenstein's old teacher, [[Josef Labor]]. His failure to complete the cantata is likely to be a further indication that he was not committed to the Nazi cause; such, at any rate, was the opinion of his friend Oskar Adler.\n\n== Listing of works ==\n\n'''Operas'''\n*''[[Notre Dame (opera)|Notre Dame]]'', romantic Opera in two acts, text after [[Victor Hugo]] by Franz Schmidt and Leopold Wilk; comp. 1902-4, premiered Vienna 1914\n*''Fredigundis'', Opera in three acts, text after [[Felix Dahn]] by {{ill|Bruno Hardt-Warden|de}} and {{ill|Ignaz Michael Welleminsky|de}}; comp. 1916\u201321, premiered Berlin 1922\n\n'''Oratorio'''\n* ''[[The Book with Seven Seals|Das Buch mit sieben Siegeln]]'' (''The Book with Seven Seals'') for Soli, Chorus, Organ and Orchestra, Text after the Revelation of St John; comp. 1935\u201337; premiered Vienna, 1938\n\n'''Cantata'''\n*''Deutsche Auferstehung'' a Festival Song for Soli, Chorus, Organ and Orchestra, Text by [[Oskar Dietrich]]; comp. 1938\u201339, unfinished, prepared for performance by Dr. Robert Wagner; premiered Vienna, 1940\n\n'''Symphonies'''\n*Symphony No. 1 in E major; comp. 1896\u201399, premiered Vienna 1902\n*Symphony No. 2 in E flat major; comp. 1911\u201313, premiered Vienna 1913\n*Symphony No. 3 in A major; comp. 1927\u201328, premiered Vienna 1928\n*Symphony No. 4 in C major; comp. 1932\u201333, premiered Vienna 1934\n\n'''Piano Concerti'''\n*Concertante Variations on a Theme of Beethoven for Piano (left hand alone) with orchestral accompaniment; comp. 1923, premiered Vienna 1924; Two-handed arrangement by Friedrich W\u00fchrer (1952)\n*Piano concerto in E flat major (for left hand alone); comp. 1934, premiered: Vienna 1935; Two-handed version by Friedrich W\u00fchrer (1952)\n\n'''Various Orchestral Works'''\n*Carnival music and Intermezzo from the Opera ''Notre Dame''; comp. 1902\u201303; premiered Vienna 1903\n*Variations on a Hussar Song for orchestra; comp. 1930\u201331; premiered Vienna 1931\n*Chaconne in D minor; transcribed from the Chaconne in C sharp minor from 1925; completed 1931; Manuscript\n\n'''Chamber music'''\n*Four little Fantasy pieces after Hungarian national melodies, for cello with piano accompaniment; comp. 1892; premiered Vienna 1926 (three pieces)\n*String Quartet in A major; comp. 1925; premiered Vienna 1925\n*String Quartet in G major; comp. 1929; premiered Vienna 1930\n*Quintet for piano (left hand alone), two violins, viola and cello in G major; comp. 1926; premiered Stuttgart 1931; two-handed arrangement by Friedrich W\u00fchrer (1954)\n*Quintet for clarinet, piano (for left hand alone), violin, viola and cello in B flat major; comp. 1932; premiered Vienna 1933\n*Quintet for clarinet, piano (for left hand alone), violin, viola and cello in A major; comp. 1938; premiered Vienna 1939; two-handed arrangement by Friedrich W\u00fchrer (1952)\n\n'''Music for Trumpets'''\n*Variations and Fugue on an original Theme in D major (King's Fanfare from ''Fredigundis''); 3.

The clashes took place in the context of [[Aftermath of World War I|the national, political, and social turmoil]] caused by [[World War I]] ([[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]) in [[Europe]]. The civil war was fought between the ''Reds'', led by a section of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]], and the ''Whites'', conducted by the [[conservatism|conservative]]-based [[Senate of Finland|Senate]]. The [[paramilitary]] [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]], composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centres of southern Finland. The paramilitary [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]], composed of farmers, along with middle-class and upper-class social strata, controlled rural central and northern Finland.\n\nIn the years before the conflict, Finnish society had experienced rapid population growth, [[industrialisation]], pre-urbanisation and the rise of a comprehensive [[labour movement]]. The country's political and governmental systems were in an unstable phase of [[democratisation]] and modernisation. The socio-economic condition and education of the population had gradually improved, as well as national thinking and cultural life had awakened.\n\nWorld War I led to the collapse of the Russian Empire causing a [[power vacuum]] in Finland, and a subsequent struggle for dominance leading to militarisation and escalating crisis between the left-leaning labour movement and the conservatives. The Reds carried out an unsuccessful general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by [[Soviet Russia]]. A counteroffensive by the Whites began in March, reinforced by the [[German Empire]]'s military detachments in April. The decisive engagements were the [[Battle of Tampere|Battles of Tampere]] and [[Battle of Vyborg|Vyborg]] ({{Lang-fi|Viipuri}}; {{Lang-sv|Viborg}}), won by the Whites, and the [[Battle of Helsinki|Battles of Helsinki]] and [[Battle of Lahti|Lahti]], won by German troops, leading to overall victory for the Whites and the German forces. [[Political violence]] became a part of this warfare. Around 12,500 Red [[prisoners of war]] died of malnutrition and disease in [[Finnish Civil War prison camps|camps]]. About 39,000 people, of whom 36,000 were Finns, perished in the conflict.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Finns passed from Russian governance to the German [[sphere of influence]] with a plan to establish a German-led [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|Finnish monarchy]]. The scheme was cancelled with the defeat of [[Germany]] in World War I and Finland instead emerged as an independent, democratic republic. The Civil War divided the nation for decades. Finnish society was reunited through social compromises based on a long-term culture of moderate politics and religion and the post-war economic recovery.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:General Map of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

The map has several creases from folding. Place names and legend are written in Russian cyrillic script and Swedish.|left|thumb|A map of Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland from 1825. The map texts are in Russian and Swedish.]]\n\n=== International politics ===\nThe main factor behind the Finnish Civil War was a political crisis arising out of World War I. Under the pressures of the Great War, the Russian Empire collapsed, leading to the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s in 1917. This breakdown caused a [[power vacuum]] and a subsequent struggle for power in [[Eastern Europe]]. Russia's Grand Duchy of Finland (1809-1917), became embroiled in the turmoil. [[Geopolitically]] less important than the continental [[Moscow]]\u2013[[Warsaw]] gateway, Finland, isolated by the [[Baltic sea|Baltic Sea]] was a peaceful side front until early 1918. The war between the German Empire and Russia had only indirect effects on the [[Finns]]. Since the end of the 19th century, the Grand Duchy had become a vital source of [[raw materials]], industrial products, food and labour for the growing Imperial Russian capital [[Petrograd]] (modern Saint Petersburg), and World War I emphasised that role. Strategically, the Finnish territory was the less important northern section of the Estonian\u2013Finnish gateway and a buffer zone to and from Petrograd through the [[Narva]] area, the [[Gulf of Finland]] and the [[Karelian Isthmus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=62\u2013144}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11\u201313, 152\u2013156}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483\u2013524}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7\u201347}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe German Empire saw Eastern Europe\u2014primarily Russia\u2014as a major source of vital products and raw materials, both during World War I and for the future. Her resources overstretched by the two-front war, Germany attempted to divide Russia by providing financial support to revolutionary groups, such as the [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], and to radical, separatist factions, such as the Finnish national activist movement leaning toward [[Pan-Germanism|Germanism]]. Between 30 and 40 million [[German Papiermark|marks]] were spent on this endeavour. Controlling the Finnish area would allow the [[Imperial German Army]] to penetrate Petrograd and the [[Kola Peninsula]], an area rich in raw materials for the mining industry. Finland possessed large ore reserves and a well-developed forest industry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=62\u2013144}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11\u201313, 152\u2013156}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=113\u2013149}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483\u2013524}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|pp=54\u201364}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48\u201357}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2012|pp=7\u201347}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}, {{Harvnb|Hentil\u00e4|Hentil\u00e4|2016|pp=15\u201340}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1809 to 1898, a period called ''Pax Russica'', the peripheral authority of the Finns gradually increased, and Russo-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful in comparison with other parts of the Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the [[Crimean War]] in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernisation of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the Grand Duchy of Finland, including an improvement in the status of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the [[Fennoman movement]], which bound the Finns to the domestic administration and led to the idea that the Grand Duchy was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=13\u201315, 30\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=110\u2013114, 150\u2013196}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49\u201373}},  {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|p=397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=81\u2013148, 264\u2013282}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=108\u2013165}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nIn 1899, the Russian Empire initiated a policy of integration through the [[Russification of Finland]]. The strengthened, [[Pan-Slavism|pan-slavist]] central power tried to unite the \"Russian Multinational Dynastic Union\" as the military and strategic situation of Russia became more perilous due to the rise of Germany and [[Japan]]. Finns called the increased military and [[Administration (government)|administrative]] control, \"the First Period of Oppression\", and for the first time Finnish politicians drew up plans for disengagement from Russia or sovereignty for Finland. In the struggle against integration, activists drawn from sections of the working class and the Swedish-speaking intelligentsia carried out terrorist acts. During World War I and the rise of Germanism, the pro-Swedish [[Svecoman movement|Svecomans]] began their covert collaboration with Imperial Germany and, from 1915 to 1917, a [[J\u00e4ger Movement|J\u00e4ger]] ({{Lang-fi|j\u00e4\u00e4k\u00e4ri}}; {{Lang-sv|j\u00e4gar}}) battalion consisting of 1,900 Finnish volunteers was trained in Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483\u2013524}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil\u00e4|Nevakivi|1999|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2000|pp=13\u201385}}, {{Harvnb|Jutikkala|Pirinen|2003|pp=397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=81\u2013150, 264\u2013282}}, {{Harvnb|Soikkanen|2008|pp=45\u201394}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48\u201357}}, {{Harvnb|Ahlb\u00e4ck|2014|pp=254\u2013293}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216\u2013250}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics===\nThe major reasons for rising political tensions among Finns were the autocratic rule of the Russian [[czar]] and the undemocratic class system of the [[estates of the realm]]. The latter system originated in the regime of the [[Swedish Empire]] that preceded Russian governance and divided the Finnish people economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the nineteenth century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of agrarian and industrial workers, as well as [[croft (land)|crofters]] emerged over the period. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was rapid in Finland, though it started later than in the rest of [[Western Europe]]. Industrialisation was financed by the state and some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished by the administration's actions. Among urban workers, socio-economic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers worsened after the end of the nineteenth century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the development of industry was not vigorous enough to fully utilise the rapid population growth of the countryside.<ref>For centuries, the geographical area of the Finns had been a firm part of Sweden's development to a major Nordic Empire. With the exception of language (the Finnish ground became bilingual), the culture of the people did not differ substantially between the western and eastern part of Sweden, dominated by the Swedish administration and the common Lutheran Church, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=29\u201335, 40\u201351}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49\u201369, 90\u201397}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15\u201330}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31\u201344}}, {{Harvnb|Engman|2009|pp=9\u201343}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe difference between Scandinavian-Finnish ([[Finno-Ugric peoples]]) and Russian-[[Slavic people|Slavic]] culture affected the nature of Finnish national integration. The upper social strata took the lead and gained domestic authority from the Russian czar in 1809. The estates planned to build up an increasingly autonomous Finnish state, led by the elite and the intelligentsia. The Fennoman movement aimed to include the common people in a non-political role; the labour movement, youth associations and the temperance movement were initially led \"from above\".<ref>In contrast to developments in Central Europe and mainland Russia, the policies of the Swedish regime did not result in the economic, political and social authority of the upper-class being based on feudal land property and capital. The peasantry existed in relative freedom, with no tradition of serfdom, and the might of the pre-eminent estates was bound up with an interaction between state formation and industrialisation. Forest industry was a vital sector for Finland and peasants owned a major part of the forest land. These economic considerations gave rise to the birth of Fennomania among a Swedish-speaking upper-class social layer. {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=19\u201339, 85\u2013100}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=40\u201346}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15\u201330}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31\u201344}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1870 and 1916 industrialisation gradually improved social conditions and the self-confidence of workers, but while the standard of living of the common people rose in absolute terms, the rift between rich and poor deepened markedly.

From 1899 to 1906, the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the paternalistic thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism was directed both toward opposing [[Russification]] and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for [[democracy]]. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-[[bourgeoisie]] and the labour movement concerning voting rights for the common people.<ref>The power struggle for voting rights was two-fold. There was a dispute over Swedish or Finnish language dominance between a peasant-clergy alliance and nobility-burghers, and a struggle for parliamentary democracy between the labour movement and the elite. The peasant-clergy had supported voting rights for the common people in the class system, in order to increase the political power of the Finnish-speaking population within the estates, but the nobility-burghers had stalled the plan, {{Harvnb|Upton|1980b|pp=3\u201325}}, {{Harvnb|Apunen|1987|pp=242\u2013250}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=85\u2013127, 150\u2013151}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1992|pp=227\u2013249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=218\u2013225}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=289\u2013309, 416\u2013449}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38\u201355}}, {{Harvnb|Olkkonen|2003|pp=517\u2013521}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15\u201330}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008b|pp=31\u201344}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2009|pp=12\u201375}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72\u201384}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}.</ref>\nDespite their obligations as obedient, peaceful and non-political inhabitants of the Grand Duchy (who had, only a few decades earlier, accepted the class system as the natural order of their life), the commoners began to demand their [[civil rights]] and [[citizenship]] in Finnish society.

The number of voters increased from 126,000 to 1,273,000, including female citizens. The reform led to the social democrats obtaining about fifty percent of the popular vote, but the Czar regained his authority after the crisis of 1905. Subsequently, during the more severe programme of Russification, called \"the Second Period of Oppression\" by the Finns, the Czar neutralised the power of the Finnish Parliament between 1908 and 1917.

Another conflict festered as employers denied [[collective bargaining]] and the right of the labour unions to represent workers. The parliamentary process disappointed the labour movement, but as dominance in the Parliament and legislation was the workers' most likely way to obtain a more balanced society, they identified themselves with the state.

The collapse of Russia was caused by military defeats, [[war-weariness]] against the duration and hardships of the Great War, and the collision between the most conservative regime in Europe and a Russian people desiring modernisation. The Czar's power was transferred to the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] (Russian Parliament) and the right-wing [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but this new authority was challenged by the [[Petrograd Soviet]] (city council), leading to [[dual power]] in the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=51\u201354}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=75\u201397}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=230\u2013243}}</ref>\n\nThe autonomous status of 1809\u20131899 was returned to the Finns by the March 1917 manifesto of the Russian Provisional Government. For the first time in history, ''de facto'' political power existed in the Parliament of Finland. The political left, consisting mainly of social democrats, covered a wide spectrum from moderate to revolutionary socialists. The political right was even more diverse, ranging from social liberals and moderate conservatives to rightist conservative elements. The four main parties were:\n* The conservative [[Finnish Party]];\n* the [[Young Finnish Party]], which included both [[liberalism|liberals]] and conservatives, with the liberals divided between [[social liberals]] and [[economic liberals]];\n* the social reformist, centrist [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], which drew its support mainly from peasants with small or middle-sized farms; and\n* the conservative [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]], which sought to retain the rights of the former nobility and the [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Swedish-speaking minority of Finland]].<ref>There were few [[Bolsheviks]] in Finland. Bolshevism became more popular among Finnish industrial workers who emigrated to [[Petrograd]] at the end of the nineteenth century.

The collapse of Russia induced a chain reaction of disintegration, starting from the government, military and economy, and spreading to all fields of society, such as local administration, workplaces and to individual citizens. The social democrats wanted to retain the civil rights already achieved and to increase the socialists' power over society. The conservatives feared the loss of their long-held socio-economic dominance. Both factions collaborated with their equivalents in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=109, 195\u2013263}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=143\u2013149}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=11\u201314}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255\u2013261}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72\u201384}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe Social Democratic Party gained an [[absolute majority]] in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 1916|parliamentary elections of 1916]]. A new Senate was formed in March 1917 by [[Oskari Tokoi]], but it did not reflect the socialists' large parliamentary majority: it comprised six social democrats and six non-socialists. In theory, the Senate consisted of a broad national coalition, but in practice (with the main political groups unwilling to [[compromise]] and top politicians remaining outside of it), it proved unable to solve any major Finnish problem. After the February Revolution, political authority descended to the street level: mass meetings, strike organisations and worker-soldier councils on the left and to active organisations of employers on the right, all serving to undermine the authority of the state.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=221, 232\u2013235}}, {{Harvnb|Kirby|2006|p=150}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255\u2013261}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe February Revolution halted the Finnish economic boom caused by the Russian war-economy. The collapse in business led to unemployment and high [[inflation]], but the employed workers gained an opportunity to resolve workplace problems. The commoners' call for the [[eight-hour day|eight-hour working day]], better working conditions and higher wages led to demonstrations and large-scale strikes in industry and agriculture.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=95\u201398, 109\u2013114}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=155\u2013159, 197, 203\u2013225}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Finns had specialised in [[milk]] and [[butter]] production, the bulk of the food supply for the country depended on cereals produced in southern Russia. The cessation of cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing [[rationing]] and [[price controls]]. The farmers resisted the state control and a [[black market]], accompanied by sharply rising food prices formed and export to the free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices and, in the end, the fear of [[starvation]] became emotional political issues between farmers and urban workers, especially those who were unemployed. Common people, their fears exploited by politicians and an incendiary, polarised political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no actual large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.<ref>In 1917\u20131918, Finns were still under the shadow of the trauma of the 1867\u20131868 famine, in which around 200,000 people had died due to malnutrition and epidemic diseases, caused by a sudden climate change with decreased air temperatures during the growing season. {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=95\u201398, 109\u2013114}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1986|pp=163\u2013172}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=163\u2013164, 192}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=155\u2013159, 203\u2013225}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}, {{Harvnb|H\u00e4ggman|2017|pp=157\u2013217}}, {{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2017|pp=13\u201374}}, {{Harvnb|Voutilainen|2017|pp=25\u201344}}</ref>\n\n====Contest for leadership====\n[[File:Russian sailors celebrating February Revolution in Helsinki.jpg|thumb|Russian soldiers in Helsinki.

The fall of the Russian Empire opened the question of who would hold sovereign political authority in the former Grand Duchy. After decades of political disappointment, the February Revolution offered the Finnish social democrats an opportunity to govern; they held the absolute majority in Parliament.

They insisted upon a return to the political status before the dissolution of Parliament in July 1917, disbandment of the Civil Guards and elections to establish a Finnish Constituent Assembly.

In this phase, Lenin and [[Joseph Stalin]], under threat in Petrograd, urged the social democrats to take power in Finland. The majority of Finnish socialists were moderate and preferred parliamentary methods, prompting the Bolsheviks to label them \"reluctant revolutionaries\". The reluctance diminished as the general strike appeared to offer a major channel of influence for the workers in southern Finland. The strike leadership voted by a narrow majority to start a revolution on 16 November, but the uprising had to be called off the same day due to the lack of active revolutionaries to execute it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264\u2013342}}, {{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368\u2013384}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|pp=64}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=152\u2013156}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51\u201389}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tampereen punakaartin komppania rintamalla (26936605946).jpg|thumb|Troops of the paramilitary [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red Guard]]'s Tampere company pictured in 1918|alt=Around 40 troops of the paramilitary Red Guard pose to the camera next to a farmer's house on a field.

The Finnish labour movement wanted to sustain a military force of its own and to keep the revolutionary road open too. The wavering Finnish socialists disappointed V. I. Lenin and in turn, he began to encourage the Finnish Bolsheviks in Petrograd.<ref>At the beginning of the October revolt, the Russian District Committee in Finland had been the first to reject the authority of the Provisional Government. Lenin's pessimistic comment on 27 January 1918 to Finnish Bolshevik Eino Rahja is well known: \"No comrade Rahja, this time you will not win your campaign, because you have the power of the Finnish Social Democrats in Finland.\" {{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=264\u2013342}}, {{Harvnb|Ketola|1987|pp=368\u2013384}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1989|pp=83\u2013161}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|p=70}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51\u201389}}</ref>\n\nAmong the labour movement, a more marked consequence of the events of 1917 was the rise of the Workers' Order Guards. There were 20\u201360 separate guards between 31 August and 30 September 1917, but on 20 October, after defeat in parliamentary elections, the Finnish labour movement proclaimed the need to establish more worker units. The announcement led to a rush of recruits: on 31 October the number of guards was 100\u2013150; 342 on 30 November 1917 and 375 on 26 January 1918. Since May 1917, the paramilitary organisations of the left had grown in two phases, the majority of them as Workers' Order Guards. The minority were Red Guards, these were partly underground groups formed in industrialised towns and industrial centres, such as [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]] and Tampere, based on the original Red Guards that had been built up during 1905\u20131906 in Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993a|pp=324\u2013343}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen*|1993b|pp=393\u2013395}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=282\u2013291}}</ref>\n\nThe presence of the two opposing armed forces created a state of dual power and divided sovereignty on Finnish society. The decisive rift between the guards broke out during the general strike: the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds took place. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to an [[arms race]] and an [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] towards civil war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=317\u2013342}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=15\u201365}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=151\u2013171}}</ref>\n\n===Independence of Finland===\nThe disintegration of Russia offered Finns an historic opportunity to gain national independence. After the October Revolution, the conservatives were eager for secession from Russia in order to control the left and minimise the influence of the Bolsheviks. The socialists were skeptical about sovereignty under conservative rule, but they feared a loss of support among nationalistic workers, particularly after having promised increased national liberty through the \"Law of Supreme Power\". Eventually, both political factions supported an independent Finland, despite strong disagreement over the composition of the nation's leadership.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|pp=67, 70}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=235\u2013237}}</ref>\n\nNationalism had become a \"civic religion\" in Finland by the end of nineteenth century, but the goal during the general strike of 1905 was a return to the autonomy of 1809\u20131898, not full independence. In comparison to the unitary Swedish regime, the domestic power of Finns had increased under the less uniform Russian rule. Economically, the Grand Duchy of Finland benefited from having an independent domestic state budget, a central bank with national currency, the [[Finnish markka|markka]] (deployed 1860), and customs organisation and the industrial progress of 1860\u20131916. The economy was dependent on the huge Russian market and separation would disrupt the profitable Finnish financial zone. The economic collapse of Russia and the power struggle of the Finnish state in 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland.<ref>The activists aimed also at a Finnish Grand Duchy ruled either by Germany or Sweden. Until 1914, Finland exported refined forest and metal products to Russia and sawmill and bulk wood products to Western Europe. World War I cut off the exports to the West and directed most of the beneficial war trade to Russia. In 1917, exports to Russia collapsed and, after 1919, Finns reorientated to the western market due to the high demand for products following the Great War. {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=89\u2013100}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=49\u201373, 156\u2013159, 243\u2013245}}, {{Harvnb|Klinge|1997|pp=483\u2013524}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=9\u201310, 181\u2013182, 203\u2013204, 264\u2013276}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008a|pp=15\u201330}}, {{Harvnb|Kuisma|2010|pp=13\u201381}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=108\u2013173}}, {{Harvnb|Ahlb\u00e4ck|2014|pp=254\u2013293}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2014|pp=216\u2013250}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51\u201389}}, {{Harvnb|Hentil\u00e4|Hentil\u00e4|2016|pp=15\u201340}}, {{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2017|pp=13\u201374}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ven tunnustaa Suomen itsenisyyden.png|thumb|The [[Bolshevik government|Bolshevik]]<nowiki/>s' recognition of Finnish independence.

Lenin calculated that the Bolsheviks could fight for central parts of Russia but had to give up some peripheral territories, including Finland in the geopolitically less important north-western corner.

Both sides justified their activities as defensive measures, particularly to their own supporters. On the left, the vanguard of the movement was the urban Red Guards from [[Helsinki]], [[Kotka]] and [[Turku]]; they led the rural Reds and convinced the socialist leaders who wavered between peace and war to support the revolution. On the right, the vanguard was the J\u00e4gers, who had transferred to Finland, and the volunteer Civil Guards of southwestern Finland, southern [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]] and [[Viipuri province|Vyborg province]] in the southeastern corner of Finland.

The Senate appointed the Guards, henceforth called the White Guards, as the White Army of Finland. Mannerheim placed his [[Defence Command (Finland)|Headquarters of the White Army]] in the [[Vaasa]]\u2013[[Sein\u00e4joki]] area. The White Order to engage was issued on 25 January.

Aaltonen installed his headquarters in Helsinki and nicknamed it [[Smolna, Helsinki|Smolna]] echoing the [[Smolny Institute]], the Bolsheviks' headquarters in Petrograd. The Red Order of Revolution was issued on 26 January, and a red lantern, a symbolic indicator of the uprising, was lit in the tower of the [[Paasitorni|Helsinki Workers' House]]. A large-scale mobilisation of the Reds began late in the evening of 27 January, with the Helsinki Red Guard and some of the Guards located along the Vyborg-Tampere railway having been activated between 23 and 26 January, in order to safeguard vital positions and escort a heavy railroad shipment of Bolshevik weapons from Petrograd to Finland.

The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian and contained small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers. The number of crofters was lower and they held a better social status than those in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed on both sides of the front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of [[Varkaus]], [[Kuopio]], [[Oulu]], [[Raahe]], [[Kemi]] and [[Tornio]]; within the Red area lay Porvoo, [[Kirkkonummi]] and [[Uusikaupunki]].

The delegation sought democratic socialism based on the Finnish Social Democratic Party's ethos; their visions differed from Lenin's [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. [[Otto Ville Kuusinen]] formulated a proposal for a new constitution, influenced by those of Switzerland and the United States. With it, political power was to be concentrated to Parliament, with a lesser role for a government. The proposal included a multi-party system; freedom of assembly, speech and press; and the use of [[referenda]] in political decision-making. In order to ensure the authority of the labour movement, the common people would have a right to [[permanent revolution]].

The Red Finns did not simply accept an alliance with the Bolsheviks and major disputes appeared, for example, over the demarcation of the border between Red Finland and Soviet Russia.

In domestic policy, the White Senate's main goal was to return the political right to power in Finland. The conservatives planned a monarchist political system, with a lesser role for Parliament. A section of the conservatives had always supported [[monarchy]] and opposed democracy; others had approved of [[parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]] since the revolutionary reform of 1906, but after the crisis of 1917\u20131918, concluded that empowering the common people would not work.

Their objective was to defeat the Finnish Reds; end the influence of Bolshevist Russia in Finland and expand Finnish territory to [[East Karelia]], a geopolitically significant home to people speaking [[Finno-Ugric languages]]. The weakness of Russia inspired an idea of [[Greater Finland]] among the expansionist factions of both the right and left: the Reds had claims concerning the same areas. General Mannerheim agreed on the need to take over East Karelia and to request German weapons, but opposed actual German intervention in Finland. Mannerheim recognised the Red Guards' lack of combat skill and trusted in the abilities of the German-trained Finnish J\u00e4gers. As a former Russian army officer, Mannerheim was well aware of the demoralisation of the Russian army. He co-operated with White-aligned Russian officers in Finland and Russia.<ref>The fall of the Russian Empire, the October revolt and Finnish Germanism had placed Gustaf Mannerheim in a controversial position.

The military [[Command hierarchy|chain of command]] functioned relatively well at company and platoon level, but leadership and authority remained weak as most of the field commanders were chosen by the vote of the troops.

The last commander-in-chief of the Red Guard was Kullervo Manner, from 10 April until the last period of the war when the Reds no longer had a named leader. Some talented local commanders, such as [[Hugo Salmela]] in the Battle of Tampere, provided successful leadership, but could not change the course of the war.

The majority of the troops returned to Russia by the end of March 1918. In total, 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian soldiers supported the Finnish Reds, but only around 3,000, in separate, smaller units of 100\u20131,000 soldiers, could be persuaded to fight in the front line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980b|pp=415\u2013422}}, {{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981a|pp=154\u2013176}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=265\u2013278}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|p=89}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Westerlund|2004b|pp=175\u2013188}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=276\u2013291}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2009b|pp=112\u2013143}},{{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\nThe revolutions in Russia divided the Soviet army officers politically and their attitude towards the Finnish Civil War varied. [[Mikhail Svechnikov]] led Finnish Red troops in western Finland in February and [[Konstantin Yeremejev]] Soviet forces on the Karelian Isthmus, while other officers were mistrustful of their revolutionary peers and instead co-operated with General Mannerheim, in disarming Soviet garrisons in Finland. On 30 January 1918, Mannerheim proclaimed to Russian soldiers in Finland that the White Army did not fight against Russia, but that the objective of the White campaign was to beat the Finnish Reds and the Soviet troops supporting them.<ref>Mannerheim promised those officers who co-operated their personal freedom, while many of those opposing the Whites were executed.

The soldiers were similar to those of the Reds, having brief and inadequate training. At the beginning of the war, the White Guards' top leadership had little authority over volunteer White units, which obeyed only their local leaders. At the end of February, the J\u00e4gers started a rapid training of six conscript regiments.<ref name=\"Upton 1981 62\u2013144\" />\n\nThe J\u00e4ger battalion was politically divided, too. Four-hundred-and-fifty \u2013mostly socialist\u2013 J\u00e4gers remained stationed in Germany, as it was feared they were likely to side with the Reds. White Guard leaders faced a similar problem when drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labour movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troops drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough motivation to fight the Finnish Reds. The Whites' propaganda promoted the idea that they were fighting a defensive war against [[Bolshevist]] Russians, and belittled the role of the Red Finns among their enemies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=9\u201350}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=40\u201351, 74\u201377}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1993|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993b|pp=}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=90\u201392}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=264\u2013291}}, {{Harvnb|Lackman|2009|pp=48\u201357}}</ref> Social divisions appeared both between southern and northern Finland and within rural Finland.

Although seizing Vyborg offered many advantages, his army's lack of combat skills and the potential for a major counterattack by the Reds in the area or in the south-west made it too risky.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180\u2013445}}</ref>\n\nMannerheim decided to strike first at Tampere. He launched the main assault on 16 March 1918, at [[L\u00e4ngelm\u00e4ki]]  {{Convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of the town, through the right flank of the Reds' defence. At the same time, the Whites attacked through the north-western frontline [[Vilppula]]\u2013[[Kuru, Finland|Kuru]]\u2013Kyr\u00f6skoski\u2013[[Suodenniemi]]. Although the Whites were unaccustomed to offensive warfare, some Red Guard units collapsed and retreated in panic under the weight of the offensive, while other Red detachments defended their posts to the last and were able to slow the advance of the White troops. Eventually, the Whites lay siege to Tampere. They cut off the Reds' southward connection at [[Lemp\u00e4\u00e4l\u00e4]] on 24 March and westward ones at Siuro, [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], and [[Yl\u00f6j\u00e4rvi]] on 25 March.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180\u2013445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103\u2013295, 429\u2013443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=92\u201397}}</ref>\n\nThe Battle for Tampere was fought between 16,000 White and 14,000 Red soldiers. It was Finland's first large-scale [[urban warfare|urban battle]] and one of the four most decisive military engagements of the war. The fight for the area of Tampere began on 28 March, on the eve of Easter 1918, later called \"Bloody [[Maundy Thursday]]\", in the Kalevankangas cemetery. The White Army did not achieve a decisive victory in the fierce combat, suffering more than 50 percent losses in some of their units. The Whites had to re-organise their troops and battle plans, managing to raid the town centre in the early hours of 3 April.<ref name=\"Ahto 1993 180\u2013445\">{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=144\u2013148, 156\u2013170}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180\u2013445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103\u2013295, 429\u2013443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=92\u201397}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2008b|pp=96\u2013161}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\nAfter a heavy, concentrated [[Barrage (artillery)|artillery barrage]], the White Guards advanced from house to house and street to street, as the Red Guards retreated. In the late evening of 3 April, the Whites reached the eastern banks of the [[Tammerkoski]] rapids. The Reds' attempts to break the siege of Tampere from the outside along the Helsinki-Tampere railway failed. The Red Guards lost the western parts of the town between 4 and 5 April. The [[Tampere City Hall]] was among the last strongholds of the Reds. The battle ended 6 April 1918 with the surrender of Red forces in the [[Pyynikki]] and [[Pispala]] sections of Tampere.<ref name=\"Ahto 1993 180\u2013445\"/>\n\nThe Reds, now on the defensive, showed increased motivation to fight during the battle. General Mannerheim was compelled to deploy some of the best-trained J\u00e4ger detachments, initially meant to be conserved for later use in the Vyborg area. The Battle of Tampere was the bloodiest action of the Civil War. The White Army lost 700\u2013900 men, including 50 J\u00e4gers, the highest number of deaths the J\u00e4ger battalion suffered in a single battle of the 1918 war. The Red Guards lost 1,000\u20131,500 soldiers, with a further 11,000\u201312,000 captured. 71 civilians died, mainly due to artillery fire. The eastern parts of the city, consisting mostly of wooden buildings, were completely destroyed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=317\u2013368}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=180\u2013445}}, {{Harvnb|Ylikangas|1993a|pp=103\u2013295, 429\u2013443}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=92\u201397}},  {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2008b|pp=96\u2013161}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Helsinki====\n{{Main article|Battle of Helsinki}}\nAfter peace talks between Germans and the Finnish Reds were broken off on 11 April 1918, the battle for the capital of Finland began. At 05:00 on 12 April, around 2,000\u20133,000 German Baltic Sea Division soldiers, led by Colonel Hans von Tschirsky und von B\u00f6gendorff, attacked the city from the north-west, supported via the [[Rantarata|Helsinki-Turku railway]]. The Germans broke through the area between [[Munkkiniemi]] and [[Pasila]], and advanced on the central-western parts of the town. The German naval squadron led by Vice Admiral [[Hugo Meurer]] blocked the city harbour, bombarded the southern town area, and landed ''[[Seebataillon]]'' marines at [[Katajanokka]].<ref>The Russian Navy in Helsinki harbour remained neutral during the battle and the fleet sailed to Kronstadt during 10\u201313 April as a consequence of 5 April German-Russian Hanko agreement.

The main strongholds of the Red defence were the [[Helsinki Workers' Hall|Workers' Hall]], the [[Helsinki railway station]], the Red Headquarters at [[Smolna, Helsinki|Smolna]], the [[Government Palace (Finland)|Senate Palace]]\u2013[[Helsinki University]] area and the former Russian garrisons. By the late evening of 12 April, most of the southern parts and all of the western area of the city had been occupied by the Germans. Local Helsinki White Guards, having hidden in the city during the war, joined the battle as the Germans advanced through the town.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=174\u2013184}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=44\u201361}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=384\u2013399}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=100\u2013102}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2013|pp=124\u2013392}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 April, German troops took over the [[Market Square, Helsinki|Market Square]], the Smolna, the Presidential Palace and the Senate-[[Ritarihuone]] area. Toward the end, a German brigade with 2,000\u20133,000 soldiers, led by Colonel Kondrad Wolf joined the battle. The unit rushed from north to the eastern parts of Helsinki, pushing into the working-class neighborhoods of [[Hermanni (Helsinki)|Hermanni]], [[Kallio]] and [[S\u00f6rn\u00e4inen]]. German artillery bombarded and destroyed the Workers' Hall and put out the red lantern of the Finnish revolution. The eastern parts of the town surrendered around 14:00 on 13 April, when a white flag was raised in the tower of the [[Kallio Church]]. Sporadic fighting lasted until the evening. In total, 60 Germans, 300\u2013400 Reds and 23 White Guard troopers were killed in the battle. Around 7,000 Reds were captured. The German army celebrated the victory with a military parade in the centre of Helsinki on 14 April 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=174\u2013184}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=44\u201361}},{{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=384\u2013399}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=100\u2013102}}, {{Harvnb|Kolbe|Nystr\u00f6m|2008|pp=76\u201394}}, {{Harvnb|Hoppu|2013|pp=124\u2013392}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Lahti====\n{{Main article|Battle of Lahti}}\nOn 19 April 1918, Detachment Brandenstein took over the town of Lahti. The German troops advanced from the east-southeast via [[Nastola]], through the Mustankallio graveyard in [[Salpausselk\u00e4]] and the Russian garrisons at [[Hennala]]. The battle was minor but strategically important as it cut the connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Local engagements broke out in the town and the surrounding area between 22 April and 1 May 1918 as several thousand western Red Guards and Red civilian refugees tried to push through on their way to Russia. The German troops were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. In total, 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished, and 30,000 Reds were captured in and around Lahti.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lappalainen|1981b|pp=194\u2013201}}, {{Harvnb|Arimo|1991|pp=61\u201370}}, {{Harvnb|Ahto|1993|pp=399\u2013410}}, {{Harvnb|Aunesluoma|H\u00e4iki\u00f6|1995|pp=104\u2013105}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2004|pp=165\u2013176}}, {{Harvnb|Roselius|2006|pp=89\u201391}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Vyborg====\n{{Main article|Battle of Vyborg}}\nAfter the defeat in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the military focus to Vyborg area, where 18,500 Whites advanced against 15,000 defending Reds. General Mannerheim's war plan had been revised as a result of the Battle for Tampere, a civilian, industrial town. He aimed to avoid new, complex city combat in Vyborg, an old military fortress. The J\u00e4ger detachments tried to tie down and destroy the Red force outside the town. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops on the Karelian Isthmus on 20\u201326 April, but the decisive blow remained to be dealt in Vyborg. The final attack began on late 27 April with a heavy J\u00e4ger artillery barrage. The Reds' defence collapsed gradually, and eventually the Whites conquered [[Patterinm\u00e4ki]]\u2014the Reds' symbolic last stand of the 1918 uprising\u2014in the early hours of 29 April 1918.

The threshold of political violence had already been crossed by the Finnish activists during the First Period of Russification. Large-scale terror operations were born and bred in Europe during World War I, the first [[total war]]. The February and October Revolutions initiated similar violence in Finland: at first by Russian army troops executing their officers, later between the Finnish Reds and Whites.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1980|pp=219\u2013243}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|p=52}}, {{Harvnb|Uola|1998|pp=11\u201330}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72\u201384}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\nThe terror consisted of a calculated aspect of general warfare and, on the other hand, the local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the commanding staff planned and organised the actions and gave orders to the lower ranks. At least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. In February 1918, a ''Desk of Securing Occupied Areas'' was implemented by the highest-ranking White staff, and the White troops were given ''Instructions for Wartime Judicature'', later called the [[Shoot on the Spot Declaration]]. This order authorised field commanders to execute essentially anyone they saw fit. No order by the less-organised, highest Red Guard leadership authorising Red Terror has been found. The paper was \"burned\" or the command was oral.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=69\u2013138}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\nThe main goals of the terror were to destroy the command structure of the enemy; to clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by armies; and to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. Additionally, the common troops' paramilitary nature and their lack of combat skills drove them to use political violence as a military weapon. Most of the executions were carried out by cavalry units called Flying Patrols, consisting of 10 to 80 soldiers aged 15 to 20 and led by an experienced, adult leader with absolute authority. The patrols, specialised in [[search and destroy]] operations and [[Death Squad|death squad]] tactics, were similar to German Sturmbattalions and Russian Assault units organized during World War I. The terror achieved some of its objectives but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. Both Red and White propaganda made effective use of their opponents' actions, increasing the spiral of revenge.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=19\u201338, 69\u2013138, 141\u2013158}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|Tikka|2013|pp=72\u201384}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2014|pp=90\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Viipurin l\u00e4\u00e4ninvankila 1918.jpg|thumb|Red Terror in April 1918: the Vyborg county jail massacre, where 30 White prisoners were killed<ref>{{Harvnb|Keskisarja|2013|pp=290\u2013301}}</ref>|alt=Around eight bodies are lying around a hallway after the Vyborg county jail massacre, an example of Red Terror.

Ten priests of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran Church]] and 90 moderate socialists were killed. The number of executions varied over the war months, peaking in February as the Reds secured power, but March saw low counts because the Reds could not seize new areas outside of the original frontlines. The numbers rose again in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland.

The numbers varied over the months as the Whites conquered southern Finland. Comprehensive White Terror started with their general offensive in March 1918 and increased constantly. It peaked at the end of the war and declined and ceased after the enemy troops had been transferred to prison camps. During the high point of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. White Terror was decisive against Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds, and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the [[Vyborg massacre]], the aftermath of the Battle of Vyborg.<ref>Around 350 Red women \u2013 mainly troops \u2013 were executed, 200 of them in Lahti.

The mortality rate was highest in the [[Tammisaari prison camp|Tammisaari camp]] at 34 percent, while the rate varied between 5 percent and 20 percent in the others. In total, around 12,500 Finns perished (3,000\u20134,000 due to the Spanish flu) while detained. The dead were buried in [[mass graves]] near the camps.

In 1927, the Social Democratic Party government led by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]] pardoned the last 50 prisoners.

The rightward shift of power caused a dispute between conservatives and liberals on the best system of government for Finland to adopt: the former demanded monarchy and restricted parliamentarianism; the latter demanded a democratic republic. Both sides justified their views on political and legal grounds. The monarchists leaned on the Swedish regime's 1772 monarchist constitution (accepted by Russia in 1809), belittled the Declaration of Independence of 1917, and proposed a modernised, monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law lost validity in the February Revolution, that the authority of the Russian czar was assumed by the Finnish Parliament on 15 November 1917, and that the Republic of Finland had been adopted on 6 December that year. The republicans were able to halt the passage of the monarchists' proposal in Parliament. The royalists responded by applying the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country without reference to Parliament.<ref>{{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=38\u2013115, 199\u2013261}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376\u2013394}}</ref>\n\nThe Finnish labour movement was divided into three parts: moderate social democrats in Finland; radical socialists in Finland; and communists in Soviet Russia. The Social Democratic Party had its first official party meeting after the Civil War on 25 December 1918, at which the party proclaimed a commitment to parliamentary means and disavowed Bolshevism and communism. The leaders of Red Finland, who had fled to Russia, established the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in Moscow on 29 August 1918. After the power struggle of 1917 and the bloody civil war, the former Fennomans and the social democrats who had supported \"ultra-democratic\" means in Red Finland declared a commitment to revolutionary Bolshevism\u2013communism and to the dictatorship of the proletariat, under the control of Lenin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1973|pp=105\u2013142}}, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=447\u2013481}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|pp=136, 149, 152, 159}}, {{Harvnb|Saarela|2014|pp=331\u2013363}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rump Parliament.jpg|thumb|The [[Rump legislature|Rump Parliament]] of Finland, Helsinki 1918.

General Mannerheim resigned his post on 25 May after disagreements with the Senate about German hegemony over Finland, and about his planned attack on Petrograd to repulse the Bolsheviks and capture Russian Karelia. The Germans opposed these plans due to their peace treaties with Lenin. The Civil War weakened the Finnish Parliament; it became a Rump Parliament that included only three socialist representatives.<ref>An additional German\u2013Russian treaty was signed on 27 August 1918: the Germans promised to keep the Finnish troops out of Petrograd and Russian Karelia but planned an attack of a joint Bolshevik-White Finnish military formation against the British troops.

The German leadership was able to utilise the breakdown of Russia for the geopolitical benefit of the German Empire in Fennoscandia also.

The most acute crisis was in food supply, already deficient in 1917, though large-scale starvation had been avoided that year. The Civil War caused marked starvation in southern Finland. Late in 1918, Finnish politician [[Rudolf Holsti]] appealed for relief to [[Herbert Hoover]], the American chairman of the [[Committee for Relief in Belgium]]. Hoover arranged for the delivery of food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the [[Baltic Sea]], which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, and to allow food into the country.<ref>The Finnish economy grew exceptionally fast between 1924 and 1939 despite a slow-down during the depression of 1929\u20131931, substantially enhancing the standard of living of the majority of Finns, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|p=157}}, {{Harvnb|Pieti\u00e4inen|1992|pp=252\u2013403}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=9\u201313, 212\u2013217}}, {{Harvnb|Saarikoski|2008|pp=115\u2013131}}, {{Harvnb|Siltala|2014|pp=51\u201389}}</ref>\n\n===Compromise===\nOn 15 March 1917, the fate of Finns had been decided outside Finland, in Petrograd.  On 11 November 1918, the future of the nation was determined in Berlin, as a result of Germany's surrender to end World War I. The German Empire collapsed in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], caused by lack of food, war-weariness and defeat in the battles of the Western Front. General R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz and his division left Helsinki on 16 December 1918, and Prince Friedrich Karl, who had not yet been crowned, abandoned his role four days later. Finland's status shifted from a monarchist protectorate of the German Empire to an independent republic.

The United States and the United Kingdom recognised Finnish sovereignty on 6\u20137 May 1919. The Western powers demanded the establishment of democratic republics in post-war Europe, to lure the masses away from widespread revolutionary movements. The Finno\u2013Russian [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian-Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed on 14 October 1920, with the aim of stabilizing political relations between Finland and Russia and settling the border question.<ref>From the 1920s onwards, Finland gradually became a subject in international politics, instead of merely being an object. {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|Tiainen|Ahola|Ahola|1992|pp=154, 171}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=243\u2013256}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008c|pp=95\u2013109}}, {{Harvnb|Kuisma|2010|pp=231\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1918, the leading Finnish social liberal and the eventual first President of Finland, [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]] wrote: \"It is urgent to get the life and development in this country back on the path that we had already reached in 1906 and which the turmoil of war turned us away from.\" Moderate social democrat [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Voionmaa]] agonised in 1919: \"Those who still trust in the future of this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith.

We have to establish a democratic Finnish republic, where all the Finns can feel that we are true citizens and members of this society.\" In the end, many of the moderate Finnish conservatives followed the thinking of National Coalition Party member [[Lauri Ingman]], who wrote in early 1918: \"A political turn more to the right will not help us now, instead it would strengthen the support of socialism in this country.\"<ref>St\u00e5hlberg, Ingman, Tokoi and [[Heikki Ritavuori]] as well as [[Miina Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]], along with other moderate female politicians, had tried to avoid civil war in January 1918, with a proposal for a new Senate, including both non-socialist and socialist members, but were overruled. {{Harvnb|Hokkanen|1986}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=121\u2013141}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=223\u2013225, 243, 249}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|1998|pp=58, 96\u201399}}, {{Harvnb|Korppi-Tommola|2016|pp=99\u2013102}}</ref>\n\nTogether with other broad-minded Finns, the new partnership constructed a Finnish compromise which eventually delivered a stable and broad parliamentary democracy. The compromise was based both on the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War and the fact that most of the Whites' political goals had not been achieved. After foreign forces left Finland, the militant factions of the Reds and the Whites lost their backing, while the pre-1918 cultural and national integrity and the legacy of Fennomania stood out among the Finns.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=480\u2013481}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1992|pp=228\u2013249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=97\u201399, 243\u2013256}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255\u2013261}},{{Harvnb|Haapala|2009a|pp=395\u2013404}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009b|pp=17\u201323}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376\u2013394}}, {{Harvnb|Meinander|2010|pp=174\u2013182}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\nThe weakness of both Germany and Russia after World War I empowered Finland and made a peaceful, domestic Finnish social and political settlement possible. A reconciliation process led to a slow and painful, but steady, national unification. In the end, the power vacuum and [[interregnum]] of 1917\u20131919 gave way to the Finnish compromise. From 1919 to 1991, the democracy and sovereignty of the Finns withstood challenges from right-wing and left-wing political radicalism, the crisis of World War II and [[Finlandization|pressure from the Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]].<ref>The Civil War slowed down and interfered with the Finnish modernisation process, which had been ongoing since the end of the nineteenth century as an interaction between industrialisation, [[constitutional state]] formation and democratisation, as well as in the formation of civil society and national independence. The process did not follow any long-term grand plan made by the Finns. Instead, it was the result of reactions and short-term solutions to domestic and international economic, political and social questions and problems, in the context of the long-term history, structure and the way of life of the northern society formed between western and eastern Europe. {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1992|pp=228\u2013249}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|1995|pp=97\u201399, 243\u2013256}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2008|pp=255\u2013261}}, {{Harvnb|Saarikoski|2008|pp=115\u2013131}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009a|pp=395\u2013404}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2009b|pp=17\u201323}}, {{Harvnb|Vares|2009|pp=376\u2013394}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Pohjois-Haagan veljeshauta.jpg|thumb|A mass grave for Red soldiers and civilians in [[Pohjois-Haaga|North Haaga]], Helsinki<ref>According to a tale that is probably incorrect, Estonian Vice-Prime Minister [[J\u00fcri Vilms]] was executed by the Germans in Helsinki and buried in the tomb. {{Harvnb|Kuusela|2015|pp=42\u201343}}</ref>|alt=A modest tombstone, with flowers in front of it and an iron fence surrounding it is the gravesite for Red soldiers and civilians in Helsinki.]]\nBetween 1918 and the 1950s, mainstream literature and poetry presented the 1918 war from the White victors' point of view, with works such as the \"Psalm of the Cannons\" ({{lang-fi|Tykkien virsi}}) by [[Arvi J\u00e4rventaus]] in 1918.

For example, the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] (WISC), originally developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, in 1991, 2003 and again in 2014. The revised versions are [[standardized]] based on the performance of test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in [[NATO]] countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every ability level, and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily at the same rate as in the United States. The increase was continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Neisser97\">{{cite journal |author=Neisser U |title=Rising Scores on Intelligence Tests |journal=American Scientist |volume=85 |issue=5 |pages=440\u20137 |year=1997 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104214157/http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/rising-scores-on-intelligence-tests/99999 |archivedate=November 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all |bibcode=1997AmSci..85..440N }}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2017}} Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]].<ref name=\"R\u00f6nnlund\"/>\n\n[[Ulric Neisser]] estimated that using the IQ values of 1997, the average IQ of the United States in 1932, according to the first [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]] standardization sample, was 80.

Because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school-related material, one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content-related tests as [[vocabulary]], [[arithmetic]] or general information. Just the opposite is the case: abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years. Meta-analytic findings indicate that Flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities. For example, Dutch conscripts gained 21 points during only 30 years, or 7 points per decade, between 1952 and 1982.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> But this rise in IQ test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence.

One problem with this explanation is that if in the US comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels, then the IQ gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nMany studies find that children who do not attend school score drastically lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers. During the 1960s, when some [[Virginia]] counties [[Massive resistance|closed their public schools to avoid racial integration]], compensatory private schooling was available only for Caucasian children. On average, the scores of African-American children who received no formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six IQ points per year.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nAnother explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing. For example, children who take the very same IQ test a second time usually gain five or six points. However, this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication. One problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is that in the US, the groups with greater test familiarity show smaller IQ increases.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\n[[Early intervention]] programs have shown mixed results. Some preschool (ages 3\u20134) intervention programs like \"[[Head Start Program|Head Start]]\" do not produce lasting changes of IQ, although they may confer other benefits.{{which|date=July 2014}} The \"[[Abecedarian Early Intervention Project]]\", an all-day program that provided various forms of [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|environmental enrichment]] to children from infancy onward, showed IQ gains that did not diminish over time. The IQ difference between the groups, although only five points, was still present at age 12. Not all such projects have been successful.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/> Also, such IQ gains can diminish until age 18.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Plomin R. |author2=DeFries J.C. |author3=Craig I.W. |author4=McGuffin P. |title=Behavioral genetics in the postgenomic era |year=2003 |edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nCiting a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in IQ, [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] has argued that the Flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2466/pr0.106.3.643-664 |author=David F Marks|title=IQ variations across time, race, and nationality:an artifact of differences in literacy skills|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=106 |issue=3|pages=643\u2013664|year=2010 |pmid=20712152}}</ref>\n\n===Generally more stimulating environment===\nStill another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating. One of the most striking 20th century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of [[visual media]]. From pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers, each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis. This would explain why visual tests like the Raven's have shown the greatest increases. An increase only of particular form(s) of intelligence would explain why the Flynn effect has not caused a \"cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked.\"<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Dickens and Flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding IQ. They argue that the measure \"[[heritability]]\" includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], thereby affecting IQ. That is, those with a greater IQ tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase IQ. These reciprocal effects result in [[gene environment correlation]]. The direct effect could initially have been very small, but [[feedback]] can create large differences of IQ. In their model, an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on IQ, even for adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition during early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that any program designed to increase IQ may produce long-term IQ gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains outside the program. To maximize lifetime IQ, the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program.<ref name=Dickens01>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346 |vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u2013369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/files/u81/Dickens_and_Flynn__2001_.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dickens WT, Flynn JR |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u2013771 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nFlynn in his 2007 book ''[[What Is Intelligence?]]'' further expanded on this theory. Environmental changes resulting from modernization&nbsp;\u2014 such as more intellectually demanding work, greater use of technology and smaller families&nbsp;\u2014 have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago. Substantial portions of IQ tests deal with these abilities. Flynn gives, as an example, the question 'What do a dog and a rabbit have in common?' A modern respondent might say they are both mammals (an abstract, or ''a priori'' answer, which depends only on the meanings of the words 'dog' and 'rabbit' ), whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs (a concrete, or ''a posteriori'' answer, which depended on what happened to be the case at that time).\n\n===Nutrition===\nImproved nutrition is another possible explanation. Today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago. That increase of stature, likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health, has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade. Available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size, and by an increase in the average size of the brain.<ref name=\"Neisser97\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Jantz |first=R. |last2=Meadows Jantz |first2=L. |year=2000 |title=Secular change in craniofacial morphology |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |volume=12 |issue= 3|pages=327\u2013338 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6300(200005/06)12:3<327::AID-AJHB3>3.0.CO;2-1 |pmid=11534023}}</ref> This argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size (e.g. women, or people of Asian ancestry) do not have lower average IQs.<ref name=TO1987/> [[Richard Lynn]], however, claims that while people of East Asian origin may often have smaller bodies, they tend to have larger brains and higher IQs than average whites.<ref name=Lynn>Lynn, Richard (2006).

Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between [[fertility and intelligence]] although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two.

The tip is cooled to cryogenic temperatures (20\u2013100 K). A positive [[voltage]] of 5 to 10 kilo[[volt]]s is applied to the tip.  Gas atoms [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the tip are ionized by the strong [[electric field]] in the vicinity of the tip (thus, \"field ionization\"), becoming positively charged and being repelled from the tip.  The curvature of the surface near the tip causes a natural magnification \u2014 [[ion]]s are repelled in a direction roughly perpendicular to the surface (a \"point projection\" effect).  A detector is placed so as to collect these repelled ions; the image formed from all the collected ions can be of sufficient resolution to image individual atoms on the tip surface.\n\nUnlike conventional microscopes, where the spatial resolution is limited by the wavelength of the particles which are used for imaging, the FIM is a projection type microscope with atomic resolution and an approximate magnification of a few million times.\n\n==Design, limitations and applications==\n\nFIM like [[Field emission microscopy|Field Emission Microscopy]] (FEM) consists of a sharp sample tip and a fluorescent screen (now replaced by a [[Microchannel plate detector|multichannel plate]]) as the key elements. However, there are some essential differences as follows:\n#The tip potential is positive.\n#The chamber is filled with an imaging gas (typically, He or Ne at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> to 10<sup>\u22123</sup> Torr).\n#The tip is cooled to low temperatures (~20-80K).\nLike FEM, the field strength at the tip apex is typically a few V/[[Angstrom|\u00c5]]. The experimental set-up and image formation in FIM is illustrated in the accompanying figures.\n\n[[Image:FIM experimental set up.jpg|thumb|right|FIM experimental set-up.]]\n\n[[Image:FIMtip.JPG|thumb|right|FIM image formation process.]]\n\nIn FIM the presence of a strong field is critical. The imaging gas atoms (He, Ne) near the tip are polarized by the field and since the field is non-uniform the polarized atoms are attracted towards the tip surface. The imaging atoms then lose their [[kinetic energy]] performing a series of hops and accommodate to the tip temperature. Eventually, the imaging atoms are ionized by tunneling electrons into the surface and the resulting positive ions are accelerated along the [[field line]]s to the screen to form a highly magnified image of the sample tip.\n\nIn FIM, the [[ionization]] takes place close to the tip, where the field is strongest. The electron that tunnels from the atom is picked up by the tip. There is a critical distance, xc, at which the tunneling probability is a maximum. This distance is typically about 0.4&nbsp;nm. The very high spatial resolution and high contrast for features on the atomic scale arises from the fact that the electric field is enhanced in the vicinity of the surface atoms because of the higher local curvature. The resolution of FIM is limited by the thermal velocity of the imaging ion. Resolution of the order of 1\u00c5 (atomic resolution) can be achieved by effective cooling of the tip.\n\nApplication of FIM, like FEM, is limited by the materials which can be fabricated in the shape of a sharp tip, can be used in an ultra high vacuum (UHV) environment, and can tolerate the high [[electrostatic fields]]. For these reasons, [[refractory metals]] with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FIM experiments. Metal tips for FEM and FIM are prepared by [[electropolishing]] (electrochemical polishing) of thin wires. However, these tips usually contain many [[Asperity (materials science)|asperities]].  The final preparation procedure involves the in situ removal of these asperities by field evaporation just by raising the tip voltage. Field evaporation is a field induced process which involves the removal of atoms from the surface itself at very high field strengths and typically occurs in the range 2-5 V/\u00c5. The effect of the field in this case is to reduce the effective binding energy of the atom to the surface and to give, in effect, a greatly increased evaporation rate relative to that expected at that temperature at zero fields. This process is self-regulating since the atoms that are at positions of high local curvature, such as adatoms or ledge atoms, are removed preferentially. The tips used in FIM is sharper (tip radius is 100~300 \u00c5) compared to those used in FEM experiments (tip radius ~1000 \u00c5).\n\nFIM has been used to study dynamical behavior of surfaces and the behavior of [[adatoms]] on surfaces. The problems studied include [[adsorption]]-[[desorption]] phenomena, [[surface diffusion]] of adatoms and clusters, adatom-adatom interactions, step motion, equilibrium crystal shape, etc. However, there is the possibility of the results being affected by the limited surface area (i.e. edge effects) and by the presence of large electric field.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Atom probe]]\n*[[Electron microscope]]\n*[[Field emission microscopy]]\n*[[List of surface analysis methods]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n* K.Oura, V.G.Lifshits, A.ASaranin, A.V.Zotov and M.Katayama, Surface Science \u2013 An Introduction, (Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003).\n* John B.

Axis positions near [[El Alamein]], only {{convert|66|mi|km|abbr=on}} from [[Alexandria]], were dangerously close to the ports and cities of Egypt, the base facilities of the Commonwealth forces and the [[Suez Canal]]. However, the Axis forces were too far from their base at [[Tripoli]] in Libya to remain at El Alamein indefinitely, which led both sides to accumulate supplies for more offensives, against the constraints of time and distance.\n\n==Background==\n===Retreat from Gazala===\n[[File:Advance of the Panzerjager-Abteilung 39-AC1942.jpg|left|thumb|[[Afrika Korps]] tank hunters with an [[SdKfz 232#Sd.Kfz. 232 2|Sd.Kfz. 232]] armoured car in front.]]\n\nFollowing their defeat at the [[Battle of Gazala]] in Eastern [[Libya]] in June 1942, the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]], had retreated east from the Gazala line into north-western [[Egypt]] as far as [[Mersa Matruh]], roughly {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} inside the border. Ritchie had decided not to hold the defences on the Egyptian border, because the defensive plan there relied on his infantry holding defended localities, while a strong armoured force was held back in reserve to foil any attempts to penetrate or outflank the fixed defences. Since General Ritchie had virtually no armoured units left fit to fight, the infantry positions would be defeated in detail. The Mersa defence plan also included an armoured reserve but in its absence Ritchie believed he could organise his infantry to cover the minefields between the defended localities to prevent [[Axis powers|Axis]] engineers from having undisturbed access.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 279</ref>\n\nTo defend the Matruh line, Ritchie placed [[10th Indian Infantry Division]] (in Matruh itself) and [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] (some {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} down the coast at Gerawla) under [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] HQ, newly arrived from Syria.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 281''n'' and 283</ref> Inland from X Corps would be [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] with [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] (with only one infantry brigade, [[29th Indian Infantry Brigade|29th Indian]], and two artillery regiments) around Sidi Hamza about {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, and the newly arrived [[2nd New Zealand Division]] (short one brigade, the [[6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|6th]], which had been left out of combat in case the division was captured and it would be needed to serve as the nucleus of a new division) at Minqar Qaim (on the escarpment {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland) and [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] in the open desert to the south.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 284\u2013285</ref> The 1st Armoured Division had taken over [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th]] and [[22nd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|22nd Armoured Brigades]] from [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] which by this time had only three tank regiments (battalions) between them.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 281</ref>\n\n[[File:WesternDesertBattle Area1941 en.svg|thumb|Area of Western Desert Campaign 1941\u20131942 (Click to enlarge).]]\nOn 25 June, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]]\u2014Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) [[Middle East Command]]\u2014relieved Ritchie and assumed direct command of the Eighth Army himself.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 285</ref> He decided not to seek a decisive confrontation at the Mersa Matruh position. He concluded that his inferiority in armour after the Gazala defeat, meant he would be unable to prevent Rommel either breaking through his centre or enveloping his open left flank to the south in the same way he had at Gazala.{{efn|GHQ Cairo estimated that the Axis could have as many as 519 serviceable tanks on 30 June although 339 was a more probable figure. In fact the actual number on 26 June was 104 compared with 155 tanks in Eighth Army<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=390}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} He decided instead to employ delaying tactics while withdrawing a further {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} or more east to a more defensible position near [[El Alamein]] on the [[Mediterranean]] coast. Only {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south of El Alamein, the steep slopes of the [[Qattara Depression#WWII|Qattara Depression]] ruled out the possibility of Axis armour moving around the southern flank of his defences and limited the width of the front he had to defend.\n\n===Battle of Mersa Matruh===\n{{Main|Battle of Mersa Matruh}}\n\n[[File:Italian anti-aircraft battery at Marsa Matrouh in the summer of 1942.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian anti-aircraft battery at Marsa Matrouh in June of 1942}}]]\nWhile preparing the Alamein positions, Auchinleck fought strong delaying actions, first at Mersa Matruh on 26\u201327 June and then Fuka on 28 June. The late change of orders resulted in some confusion in the forward formations (X Corps and XIII Corps) between the desire to inflict damage on the enemy and the intention not to get trapped in the Matruh position but retreat in good order. The result was poor co-ordination between the two forward Corps and units within them. Late on 26 June, the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light]] and [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st ''Panzer'' Divisions]] managed to find their way through the minefields in the centre of the front. Early on 27 June, resuming its advance, the 90th Light was checked by British 50th Division's artillery. Meanwhile, the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th]] and 21st ''Panzer'' Divisions advanced east above and below the escarpment. The 15th ''Panzer'' were blocked by 4th Armoured and [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Motor Brigades]], but the 21st ''Panzer'' were ordered on to attack Minqar Qaim. Rommel ordered 90th Light to resume its advance, requiring it to cut the coast road behind 50th Division by the evening.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 290</ref> As the 21st ''Panzer'' moved on Minqar Qaim, the 2nd New Zealand Division found itself surrounded but broke out on the night of 27/28 June without serious losses and withdrew east.<ref name=\"NZ88\">[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c10.html#n81 Scoullar (1955), Chapters 10, 11 and 12]</ref>\n \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-786-0327-19, Nordafrika, Erwin Rommel mit Offizieren.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] in North Africa (June 1942).]]\nAuchinleck had planned a second delaying position at [[Fukah|Fuka]], some {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Matruh, and at 21:20 he issued the orders for a withdrawal to Fuka. Confusion in communication led the division withdrawing immediately to the El Alamein position.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 292\u2013293</ref> X Corps, having made an unsuccessful attempt to secure a position on the escarpment, were out of touch with Eighth Army from 19:30 until 04:30 the next morning. Only then did they discover that the withdrawal order had been given. The withdrawal of XIII Corps had left the southern flank of X Corps on the coast at Matruh exposed and their line of retreat compromised by the cutting of the coastal road {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Matruh. They were ordered to break out southwards into the desert and then make their way east. Auchinleck ordered XIII Corps to provide support but they were in no position to do so. At 21:00 on 28 June, X Corps\u2014organised into brigade groups\u2014headed south. In the darkness, there was considerable confusion as they came across enemy units laagered for the night. In the process, 5th Indian Division in particular sustained heavy casualties, including the destruction of the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade at Fuka.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 294\u2013295</ref> Axis forces captured more than 6,000 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]], in addition to 40 tanks and an enormous quantity of supplies.<ref>Panzer Army Africa Battle Report dated 29 June 1942 K.T.B. 812 [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Battle_report_of_Panzerarmeeafrika_for_28_June_1942.jpg page 1] and [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Battle_report_of_Panzerarmeeafrika_for_29_June_1942.jpg page 2]</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Defences at El Alamein===\n[[File:Alamein1st1942 07.svg|thumb|The Western Desert Battle Area, July 1942.]]\nAlamein itself was an inconsequential railway station on the coast. Some {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south lay the [[Ruweisat Ridge]], a low stony prominence that gave excellent observation for many miles over the surrounding desert; {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the south was the Qattara Depression. The line the British chose to defend stretched between the sea and the Depression, which meant that Rommel could outflank it only by taking a significant detour to the south and crossing the [[Sahara Desert]]. The British Army in Egypt recognised this before the war and had the Eighth Army begin construction of several \"boxes\" (localities with dug-outs and surrounded by minefields and barbed wire) the most developed being around the railway station at Alamein.<ref>{{harvnb|Latimer|2002|p=58}}</ref> Most of the \"line\" was open, empty desert.<ref name=\"Playfair332\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 332</ref> Lieutenant-General [[Willoughby Norrie, 1st Baron Norrie|William Norrie]] ([[General officer commanding]] [GOC] [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]) organised the position and started to construct three defended \"boxes\". The first and strongest, at El Alamein on the coast, had been partly wired and mined by [[1st Infantry Division (South Africa)|1st South African Division]]. The Bab el Qattara box\u2014some {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the coast and {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of the Ruweisat Ridge\u2014had been dug but had not been wired or mined, while at the Naq Abu Dweis box (on the edge of the Qattara Depression), {{convert|34|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the coast, very little work had been done.<ref name= \"Playfair332\"/>\n\nThe British position in Egypt was desperate, the rout from Mersa Matruh had created a panic in the British headquarters at Cairo, something later called \"the Flap\". On what came to be referred to as \"Ash Wednesday\", at British headquarters, rear echelon units and the British Embassy, papers were hurriedly burned in anticipation of the fall of the city. Auchinleck\u2014although believing he could stop [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] at Alamein\u2014felt he could not ignore the possibility that he might once more be outmanoeuvred or outfought. To maintain his army, plans must be made for the possibility of a further retreat whilst maintaining morale and retaining the support and co-operation of the Egyptians. Defensive positions were constructed west of Alexandria and on the approaches to Cairo while considerable areas in the Nile delta were flooded.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 333\u2013334</ref> The Axis, too, believed that the capture of Egypt was imminent; Italian leader [[Benito Mussolini]]\u2014sensing a historic moment\u2014flew to Libya to prepare for his triumphal entry into Cairo.<ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|p=69}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:2-8 Field Regt.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|25 pdr]] guns of the 28th Field Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]] at El Alamein, 12 July 1942.]]\n\nThe scattering of X Corps at Mersa Matruh disrupted Auchinleck's plan for occupying the Alamein defences. On 29 June, he ordered XXX Corps\u2014the 1st South African, 5th and 10th Indian  divisions\u2014to take the coastal sector on the right of the front and XIII Corps\u2014the 2nd New Zealand Division and 4th Indian divisions\u2014to be on the left. The remains of the 1st Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division were to be held as a mobile army reserve.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 295</ref> His intention was for the fixed defensive positions to channel and disorganise the enemy's advance while mobile units would attack their flanks and rear.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 332\u2013333</ref>\n\nOn 30 June, Rommel's [[Panzer Army Africa|''Panzerarmee Afrika'']] approached the Alamein position. The Axis forces were exhausted and understrength. Rommel had driven them forward ruthlessly, being confident that, provided he struck quickly before Eighth Army had time to settle, his momentum would take him through the Alamein position and he could then advance to the Nile with little further opposition. Supplies remained a problem because the Axis staff had originally expected a pause of six weeks after the capture of Tobruk. German air units were also exhausted and providing little help against the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s all-out attack on the Axis supply lines which, with the arrival of [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) heavy bombers, could reach as far as Benghazi.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=392}}</ref> Although captured supplies proved useful, water and ammunition were constantly in short supply, while a shortage of transport impeded the distribution of the supplies that the Axis forces did have.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 331</ref>\n\n===Axis plan of attack===\nRommel's plan was for the 90th Light Division and the 15th and 21st ''Panzer'' divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' to penetrate the Eighth Army lines between the Alamein box and Deir el Abyad (which he believed was defended). The 90th Light Division was then to veer north to cut the coastal road and trap the defenders of the Alamein box (which Rommel thought was occupied by the remains of the 50th Infantry Division) and the ''Afrika Korps'' would veer right to attack the rear of XIII Corps.\n\n==Battle==\nAn Italian division was to attack the Alamein box from the west and another was to follow the 90th Light Division. The Italian XX Corps was to follow the ''Afrika Korps'' and deal with the Qattara box while the [[133 Armoured Division Littorio|133rd Armoured Division ''Littorio'']] and German reconnaissance units would protect the right flank.<ref name= \"Playfair3498\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 340</ref> Rommel had planned to attack on 30 June but supply and transport difficulties had resulted in a day's delay, vital to the defending forces reorganising on the Alamein line. On 30 June, the 90th Light Division was still {{convert|15|mi|km}} short of its start line, 21st ''Panzer'' Division was immobilised through lack of fuel and the promised air support had yet to move into its advanced airfields.<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=392\u2014393}}</ref>\n\n===Panzer Army Africa attacks===\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0110-12, Nordafrika, Panzer II, Kraftfahrzeuge.jpg|thumb|A [[Panzer II]] of the ''Afrika Korps''.]]\nAt 03:00 on 1 July, 90th Light Infantry Division advanced east but strayed too far north and ran into the 1st South African Division's defences and became pinned down.<ref name=\"Playfair3498\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|p=81}}</ref> The 15th and 21st ''Panzer'' Divisions of the ''Afrika Korps'' were delayed by a sandstorm and then a heavy air attack.

It came under artillery fire from the three South African brigade groups and was forced to dig in.<ref name=\"Playfair341\"/>\n\nOn 2 July, Rommel ordered the resumption of the offensive. Once again, 90th Light failed to make progress so Rommel called the ''Afrika Korps'' to abandon its planned sweep southward and instead join the effort to break through to the coast road by attacking east toward Ruweisat Ridge. The British defence of Ruweisat Ridge relied on an improvised formation called \"Robcol\", comprising a regiment each of field artillery and light anti-aircraft artillery and a company of infantry. Robcol\u2014in line with normal British Army practice for ''ad hoc'' formations\u2014was named after its commander, Brigadier Robert Waller, the Commander Royal Artillery of the 10th Indian Infantry Division.<ref name=\"Mac582\">{{harvnb|Mackenzie|1951|p=582}}</ref> Robcol was able to buy time, and by late afternoon the two British armoured brigades joined the battle with 4th Armoured Brigade engaging 15th ''Panzer'' and 22nd Armoured Brigade 21st ''Panzer'' respectively.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, pp. 342\u2013343</ref> They drove back repeated attacks by the Axis armour, who then withdrew before dusk.

[[Italian X Corps]], meanwhile were to hold El Mreir. By this stage the ''Afrika Korps'' had only 26 operational tanks.<ref name=\"Playfair343\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 343</ref> There was a sharp armoured exchange south of Ruweisat ridge during the morning and the main Axis advance was held.<ref name=\"Playfair343\"/> On 3 July, the RAF flew 780 sorties.{{efn|During the period 1 to 27 June the Desert Air Force flew nearly 15,400 sorties.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 335</ref> Auchinleck later wrote in his official despatches \"...Our air forces could not have done more than they did to help and sustain the Eighth Army in its struggle.

The plan was that the New Zealand 2nd Division\u2014with the remains of Indian 5th Division and 7th Motor Brigade under its command\u2014would swing north to threaten the Axis flank and rear.<ref name=\"Mac582\"/> This force encountered the [[132 Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Armoured Division]]'s artillery, which was driving on the southern flank of the division as it attacked Ruweisat. The Italian commander ordered his battalions to fight their way out independently but the ''Ariete'' lost 531 men (about 350 were prisoners), 36 pieces of artillery, six (or eight?) tanks, and 55 trucks.<ref name=\"Mitcham113\">{{harvnb|Mitcham|2007|p=113}}</ref> By the end of the day, the ''Ariete'' Division had only five tanks.<ref>Walker.I, (2003), p.141</ref> The day ended once again with the ''Afrika Korps'' and ''Ariete'' coming off second best to the superior numbers of the British 22nd Armoured and 4th Armoured Brigades,{{efn|The two British armoured brigades started on 3 July with a total strength of 119 tanks<ref name= \"Playfair343\"/>}} frustrating Rommel's attempts to resume his advance.<ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|p=92}}</ref> The RAF once again played its part, flying 900 sorties during the day.<ref name= \"Playfair343\"/>\n\nTo the south, on 5 July the New Zealand group resumed its advance northwards towards El Mreir intending to cut the rear of the ''Ariete'' Division. Heavy fire from the [[27 Motorised Division Brescia|Italian ''Brescia'' Motorised Division]] at El Mreir, however, {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the Qattara box, checked their progress and led XIII Corps to call off its attack.<ref name=\"Mitcham113\"/>\n\n===Rommel digs in===\n[[File:Rommel with his aides.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, with his aides during the desert campaign, 1942.]]\n\nAt this point, Rommel decided his exhausted forces could make no further headway without resting and regrouping. He reported to the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] that his three German divisions numbered just 1,200\u20131,500 men each and resupply was proving highly problematic because of enemy interference from the air. He expected to have to remain on the defensive for at least two weeks.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 344/</ref>\n\nRommel was by this time suffering from the extended length of his supply lines. The Allied [[Desert Air Force]] (DAF) was concentrating fiercely on his fragile and elongated supply routes while British mobile columns moving west and striking from the south were causing havoc in the Axis rear echelons.<ref>Clifford (1943), p.285</ref> Rommel could afford these losses even less since shipments from Italy had been substantially reduced (in June, he received {{convert|5000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of supplies compared with {{convert|34000|ST|t|abbr=on}} in May and 400 vehicles (compared with 2,000 in May).<ref name=\"NZ79\">[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Egyp-c9.html#n79 Scoullar (1955), p. 79]</ref> Meanwhile, the Eighth Army was reorganising and rebuilding, benefiting from its short lines of communication.

His policy was to \"...hit the Italians wherever possible in view of their low morale and because the Germans cannot hold extended fronts without them.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hinsley||p=404}}</ref>\n\nThe intention was for the 4th New Zealand Brigade and 5th New Zealand Brigade (on 4th Brigade's right) to attack north-west to seize the western part of the ridge and on their right the Indian 5th Infantry Brigade to capture the eastern part of the ridge in a night attack. Then 2nd Armoured Brigade would pass through the centre of the infantry objectives to exploit toward Deir el Shein and the Miteirya Ridge. On the left, the 22nd Armoured Brigade would be ready to move forward to protect the infantry as they consolidated on the ridge.<ref>Playfair Vol. III, p. 348</ref>\n\nThe attack commenced at 23:00 on 14 July. The two New Zealand brigades shortly before dawn on 15 July took their objectives, but minefields and pockets of resistance created disarray among the attackers. A number of pockets of resistance were left behind the forward troops' advance which impeded the move forward of reserves, artillery, and support arms. As a result, the New Zealand brigades occupied exposed positions on the ridge without support weapons except for a few anti-tank guns.<ref name=\"Playfair349\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 349</ref> More significantly, communications with the two British armoured brigades failed, and the British armour did not move forwards to protect the infantry. At first light, a detachment from 15th ''Panzer'' division's 8th ''Panzer'' Regiment launched a counter-attack against New Zealand 4th Brigade's 22nd Battalion. A sharp exchange knocked out their anti-tank guns and the infantry found themselves exposed in the open with no alternative but to surrender. About 350 New Zealanders were taken prisoner.<ref name= \"Playfair349\"/>\n\nWhile the 2nd New Zealand Division attacked the western slopes of [[Ruweisat Ridge]], the Indian 5th Brigade made small gains on Ruweisat ridge to the east. By 07:00, word was finally got to 2nd Armoured Brigade which started to move north west. Two regiments became embroiled in a minefield but the third was able to join Indian 5th Infantry 5th Brigade as it renewed its attack. With the help of the armour and artillery, the Indians were able to take their objectives by early afternoon.<ref name=\"Playfair349\"/> Meanwhile, the 22nd Armoured Brigade had been engaged at Alam Nayil by 90th Light Division and the ''Ariete'' Armoured Division, advancing from the south. While\u2014with help from mobile infantry and artillery columns from 7th Armoured Division\u2014they pushed back the Axis probe with ease, they were prevented from advancing north to protect the New Zealand flank.<ref name=\"Playfair351\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 351</ref>\n\nSeeing the ''Brescia'' and ''Pavia'' under pressure, Rommel rushed German troops to Ruweisat. By 15:00, the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment and part of 21st ''Panzer'' Division from the north and 33rd Reconnaissance Regiment and the Baade Group comprising elements from 15th ''Panzer'' Division from the south were in place under Lieutenant-General (''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'') [[Walther Nehring]].<ref name=\"Playfair350\">Playfair Vol. III, p. 350</ref> At 17:00, Nehring launched his counter-attack. 4th New Zealand Brigade were still short of support weapons and also, by this time, ammunition. Once again, the anti-tank defences were overwhelmed and about 380 New Zealanders were taken prisoner including Captain [[Charles Upham]]<ref name=\"Playfair350\"/> who gained a second [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions including destroying a German tank and several guns and vehicles with grenades despite being shot through the elbow by a machine gun bullet and having his arm broken. At about 18:00, the brigade HQ was overrun. At about 18:15, 2nd Armoured Brigade engaged the German armour and halted the Axis eastward advance. At dusk, Nehring broke off the action.<ref name=\"Playfair350\"/>\n\nEarly on 16 July, Nehring renewed his attack. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade pushed them back but it was clear from intercepted radio traffic that a further attempt would be made. Strenuous preparations to dig in anti-tank guns were made, artillery fire plans organised and a regiment from the 22nd Armoured Brigade was sent to reinforce the 2nd Armoured Brigade.<ref name= \"Playfair351\"/> When the attack resumed late in the afternoon, it was repulsed. After the battle, the Indians counted 24 knocked out tanks, as well as armoured cars and numerous anti-tank guns left on the battlefield.<ref>Bharucha and Prasad (1956), p. 422</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|pp=143\u2013146}}</ref>\n\nIn three days' fighting, the Allies took more than 2,000 Axis prisoners, mostly from the Italian ''Brescia'' and ''Pavia'' Divisions; the New Zealand division suffered 1,405 casualties.<ref>{{harvnb|Barr|2005|pp=118\u2013142}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scoullar|1955|pp=232\u2013298}}</ref> The fighting at Tel el Eisa and Ruweisat had caused the destruction of three Italian divisions, forced Rommel to redeploy his armour from the south, made it necessary to lay minefields in front of the remaining Italian divisions and stiffen them with detachments of German troops.<ref name=\"Hinsley405\"/>\n\n===Miteirya Ridge (Ruin Ridge)===\nTo relieve pressure on Ruweisat ridge, Auchinleck ordered the Australian 9th Division to make another attack from the north. In the early hours of 27 July, the Australian 24th Brigade\u2014supported by 44th [[Royal Tank Regiment]] (RTR) and strong fighter cover from the air\u2014assaulted Miteirya ridge<ref name= \"Playfair351\"/> (known as \"Ruin ridge\" to the Australians). The initial night attack went well, with 736 prisoners taken, mostly from the Italian ''[[102 Motorised Division Trento|Trento]]'' and ''[[101 Motorised Division Trieste|Trieste]]'' motorised divisions.

At daybreak on 22 July, the British armoured brigades again failed to advance.

On the left, the initial attempt to clear the western end of Ruweisat failed but at 08:00 a renewed attack by the reserve battalion succeeded. On the right, the attacking battalion broke into the Deir el Shein position but was driven back in hand-to-hand fighting.<ref name=\"Playfair355\"/>\n\nCompounding the disaster at El Mreir, at 08:00 the commander of 23rd Armoured Brigade ordered his brigade forward, intent on following his orders to the letter.

However, the supporting anti-tank units became lost in the darkness or delayed by minefields, leaving the attackers isolated and exposed when daylight came.

The Italian was willing, unselfish and a good comrade, and, considering the conditions under which he served, had always given better than average. There is no doubt that the achievement of every Italian unit, especially of the motorised forces, far surpassed anything that the Italian Army had done for a hundred years. Many Italian generals and officers won our admiration both as men and as soldiers. The cause of the Italian defeat had its roots in the whole Italian military state and system, in their poor armament and in the general lack of interest in the war by many Italians, both officers and statesmen.

Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria-Hungary.

Italian defeat came about after the [[Battle of Adwa]], where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. The Italians suffered about 7,000 killed with 3,000 taken prisoner (in addition, 1,200 [[Eritrean Ascari]] were killed while 800 were captured and later mutilated by the Ethiopians<ref>[https://journals.openedition.org/etudesafricaines/docannexe/image/14887/img-12.jpg Photo of some of the Eritrean Ascari mutilated]</ref>); Ethiopian losses have been estimated around 4,000 killed. \n\nThis was not the first African victory over Western colonizers, but it was the first time such an indigenous African army put a definitive stop to a colonizing nation's efforts.

After Egypt's bankruptcy in 1876 followed by the ''Ansar'' revolt under the leadership of the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]] in 1881, the Egyptian position in Eritrea was hopeless with the Egyptian forces cut off and unpaid for years. By 1884 the Egyptians began to pull out of both Sudan and Eritrea.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/>\n\nEgypt had been very much in the French sphere of influence until 1882 when Britain occupied Egypt. A major goal of French foreign policy until 1904 was to diminish British power in Egypt and restore it to its place in the French sphere of influence, and in 1883 the French created the colony of [[French Somaliland]] which allowed for the establishment of a French naval base at Djibouti on the Red Sea.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/> The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 had turned the Horn of Africa into a very strategic region as a navy based in the Horn could interdict any shipping going up and down the Red Sea. By building naval bases on the Red Sea that could intercept British shipping in the Red Sea, the French hoped to reduce the value of the Suez Canal for the British, and thus lever them out of Egypt. A French historian in 1900 wrote: \"The importance of Djibouti lies almost solely in the uniqueness of its geographic position, which makes it a port of transit and natural entrep\u00f4t for areas more infinitely more populated than its own territory...the rich provinces of central Ethiopia.\"<ref>Marcus, Harold \"A Background to Direct British Diplomatic Involvement in Ethiopia, 1894-1896\" pg. 121-132 from ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 2 July 1963 page 123.</ref> The British historian Harold Marcus noted that for the French \"Ethiopia represented the entrance to the Nile valley; if she could obtain hegemony over Ethiopia, her dream of a west to east French African empire would be closer to reality\".<ref>Marcus, Harold \"A Background to Direct British Diplomatic Involvement in Ethiopia, 1894-1896\" pg. 121-132 from ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 2 July 1963 page 123.</ref> In response, Britain consistently supported Italian ambitions in the Horn of Africa as the best way of keeping the French out.<ref>Marcus, Harold \"A Background to Direct British Diplomatic Involvement in Ethiopia, 1894-1896\" pg. 121-132 from ''Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', Vol. 1, No. 2 July 1963 page 122.</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\n\nOn 3 June 1884, a treaty was signed between Britain, Egypt and Ethiopia that allowed the Ethiopians to occupy parts of Eritrea and allowed the Ethiopian goods to pass in and out of [[Massawa]] duty-free.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/> From the viewpoint of Britain, it was highly undesirable that the French replace the Egyptians in Eritrea as that would allow the French to have more naval bases on the Red Sea that could interfere with British shipping using the Suez Canal, and as the British did not want the financial burden of ruling Eritrea, they looked for another power to replace the Egyptians.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/>  After initially encouraging the Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] to move into Eritrea to replace the Egyptians, London decided to have the Italians move into Eritrea.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/> After the French had unexpectedly made Tunis into their [[French protectorate of Tunisia|protectorate]] in 1881, outraging opinion in Italy over the so-called \"''Schiaffo di Tunisi''\" (the \"slap of Tunis\"), Italian foreign policy had been extremely anti-French, and from the British viewpoint the best way of ensuring the Eritrean ports on Red Sea stayed out of French hands was by having the staunchly anti-French Italians move in. In 1882, Italy had joined the Triple Alliance, allying herself with Austria and Germany against France.\n\nOn 5 February 1885 Italian troops landed at Massawa to replace the Egyptians.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/> The Italian government for its part was more than happy to embark upon an imperialist policy to distract its people from the failings in post ''Risorgimento'' Italy.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 196\"/> In 1861, the unification of Italy was supposed to mark the beginning of a glorious new era in Italian life, and many Italians were gravely disappointed to find that not much had changed in the new Kingdom of Italy with the vast majority of Italians still living in abject poverty.

The Italians expected disaffected potentates like Negus [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]], [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes]], and the [[Aussa Sultanate|Sultan of Aussa]] to join them; instead, all of the ethnic Tigrayan or Amharic peoples flocked to the Emperor Menelik's side in a display of both nationalism and anti-Italian feeling, while other peoples of dubious loyalty (e.g. the Sultan of Aussa) were watched by Imperial garrisons.<ref>{{cite book|first=Chris|last=Prouty|title=Empress Taytu and Menilek II: Ethiopia 1883\u20131910|location=Trenton|publisher=The Red Sea Press|year=1986|page=143}}</ref> In June 1894, ''Ras'' Mengesha and his generals had appeared in Addis Ababa carrying large stones which they dropped before the Emperor Menelik (a gesture that is a symbol of submission in Ethiopian culture).<ref name=\"Perry, James page 201\"/> In Ethiopia, the popular saying at the time was: \"Of a black snake's bite, you may be cured, but from the bite of a white snake, you will never recover.\"<ref name=\"Perry, James page 201\"/> There was an overwhelming national unity in Ethiopia as various feuding noblemen rallied behind the emperor who insisted that Ethiopia, unlike the other African nations, would retain its freedom and not be subjected to Italy.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 201\"/> The ethnic rivalries between the Tigrians and the Amhara that the Italians were counting upon did not prove to be a factor as Menelik pointed out that the Italians held all black people, regardless of their ethnicity in contempt, noting the segregation policies in Eritrea applied to all black people.<ref name=\"Perry, James page 201\"/>  Further, Menelik had spent much of the previous four years building up a supply of modern weapons and ammunition, acquired from the French, British, and the Italians themselves, as the European colonial powers sought to keep each other's North African aspirations in check.

However, Baratieri also never knew about the true numerical strength of the Ethiopian army that was to face his army, so he rather further fortified his positions in the Tigray. But the Italian government of [[Francesco Crispi]] was unable to accept being stymied by non-Europeans. The prime minister specifically ordered Baratieri to advance deep into enemy territory and bring about a battle.\n\n==Battle of Adwa==\n{{main|Battle of Adwa}}\n\nThe decisive battle of the war was the [[Battle of Adwa]] on March 1, 1896, which took place in mountainous country north of the actual town of [[Adwa]] (or Adowa). The Italian army comprised four brigades totalling approximately 17,700 men, with fifty-six artillery pieces; the Ethiopian army comprised several brigades numbering between 73,000 and 120,000 men (80\u2013100,000 with firearms: according to [[Richard K. P. Pankhurst|Pankhurst]], the Ethiopians were armed with approximately 100,000 rifles of which about half were [[Quick-firing gun|quick-firing]]),<ref name=\"p190\"/> with almost fifty artillery pieces.\n\nGeneral Baratieri planned to surprise the larger Ethiopian force with an early morning attack, expecting his enemy to be asleep. However, the Ethiopians had risen early for [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Church]] services and, upon learning of the Italian advance, promptly attacked. The Italian forces were hit by wave after wave of attacks, until Menelik released his reserve of 25,000 men, destroying an Italian brigade. Another brigade was cut off, and destroyed by a cavalry charge. The last two brigades were destroyed piecemeal. By noon, the Italian survivors were in full retreat.\n\nWhile Menelik's victory was in a large part due to sheer force of numbers, his troops were well-armed because of his careful preparations. The Ethiopian army only had a feudal system of organization, but proved capable of properly executing the strategic plan drawn up in Menelik's headquarters. However, the Ethiopian army also had its problems. The first was the quality of its arms, as the Italian and British colonial authorities could sabotage the transportation of 30,000\u201360,000 modern [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] rifles and [[Berdan rifles]] from Russia into landlocked Ethiopia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Secondly, the Ethiopian army's feudal organization meant that nearly the entire force was composed of peasant militia.  Russian military experts advising Menelik II suggested a full contact battle with Italians, to neutralize the Italian fire superiority, instead of engaging in a campaign of harassment designed to nullify problems with arms, training, and organization.<ref name=\"abai\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvoros.ru/proza/kazaki-u-imperatora-menelika-vtorogo.html|title=Cossacks of the emperor Menelik II|work=tvoros.ru|accessdate=3 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716233744/http://www.tvoros.ru/proza/kazaki-u-imperatora-menelika-vtorogo.html|archive-date=2015-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n[[File:Italian prisoners Ethiopia 1897.jpg|thumb|Italian prisoners of war waiting for repatriation]]\nSome Russian councilors of Menelik II and a team of fifty Russian volunteers participated in the battle, among them [[Nikolay Leontiev]], an officer of the Kuban Cossack army.<ref>[http://www.sworld.com.ua/index.php/ru/history/world-history-and-the-history-of-ukraine/768-vinogradova-kv The activities of the officer the Kuban Cossack army N.

Menelik brought together warriors not only from the far reaches of the empire, but also from warring peoples, like the [[Amharas|Amhara]] and the [[Oromo people|Oromo,]] different religions, and cultures. At the deciding battle of the war, the [[Battle of Adwa]], the army consisted of many different tribes and religions, united for a common purpose. The many factions were able to put away their differences and united to protect their empire. Even the son of [[Emperor Yohannes IV]], who Menelik II took the throne from, fought under Menelik for the benefit of the Empire. Menelik did many important things to foster Ethiopian pride.\n\nMenelik was a well respected ruler whose lineage could be traced back to [[Solomon|King Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]]. He used that status and its power to peacefully create alliances and to conquer those who opposed him. He was such a skillful negotiator that he was able to unify almost all of the Northern, Western, and Central territories peacefully. He made [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes]], the prince of Tigray and along with the threat of the Italians, convinced him to join him. Melenik not only conquered large groups of people like the Oromo, Guarage, and Wolayta, he also managed to incorporate leaders from those groups into his own government, and war council. Whether conquered peacefully or militarily, almost all groups had a voice under Melenik.\n\nFrom 1888-1892, one third of the Ethiopian population died from what would become known as [[Famines in Ethiopia|The Great Famine]]. On the heels of this disaster, Menelik used his relationship with the Europeans to help modernize Ethiopia. The Europeans soon flooded the Ethiopian economy looking for business opportunities. Meanwhile, Menelik established the first national bank, a national currency, a postal system, railroads, modern roads, and electricity. The bank and currency unified the people economically and helped establish economic stability. The railways, roads, and postal system connected the people and tribes as a national as well as physically. Possibly his greatest achievement in creating a national identity was through the creation of [[Addis Ababa]]. This was an important psychological component in the establishment of a nation. It provided a metaphorical \u2018head\u2019 for the nation. It became permanent location for the entire country to look upon for support and for guidance.\n\n==Outcome and consequences==\nMenelik retired in good order to his capital, [[Addis Ababa]], and waited for the fallout of the victory to hit Italy. Riots broke out in several Italian cities, and within two weeks, the Crispi government collapsed amidst Italian disenchantment with \"foreign adventures\".<ref name=vand4>Vandervort, Bruce. ''Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa, 1830\u20131914''. 1998, page 164.</ref>\n\nMenelik secured the [[Treaty of Addis Ababa]] in October, which delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the independence of Ethiopia. Delegations from the United Kingdom and France\u2014whose colonial possessions lay next to Ethiopia\u2014soon arrived in the Ethiopian capital to negotiate their own treaties with this newly proven power. Owing to Russia's diplomatic support of her fellow Orthodox nation, Russia's prestige greatly increased in Ethiopia. The adventuresome Seljan brothers, Mirko and Stjepan, who were actually Catholic Croats, were warmly welcomed when they arrived in Ethiopia in 1899 when they misinformed their hosts by saying they were Russians.<ref>Molvaer, Reidulf \"The Seljan Brothers and the Expansionist Policies of Emperor Min\u00eflik II of Ethiopia\" pg. 79-91 from ''International Journal of Ethiopian Studies'', Vol. 5,

He went to school at [[Eastbourne College]], before going on to study at [[Aberystwyth University|University College of Wales at Aberystwyth]] and at [[Merton College, Oxford]], where he graduated in 1898 with first class honors in chemistry.<ref name=Nobel>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1921 \u2013 Frederick Soddy Biographical|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref> He was a researcher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] from 1898 to 1900.\n\n=== Scientific career ===\nIn 1900 he became a demonstrator in [[chemistry]] at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], where he worked with [[Ernest Rutherford]] on [[radioactivity]].<ref>{{cite book | title=13.8: The Quest to Find the True Age of the Universe and the Theory of Everything | author=John Gribbin | publisher=Icon Books | place=London | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-84831-918-9}}</ref><ref name=Nobel/>\nHe and Rutherford realized that the anomalous behaviour of radioactive elements was because they [[radioactive decay|decayed]] into other elements.\nThis decay also produced [[alpha ray|alpha]], [[beta ray|beta]], and [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. When radioactivity was first discovered, no one was sure what the cause was. It needed careful work by Soddy and Rutherford to prove that atomic [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] was in fact occurring.\n\nIn 1903, with Sir [[William Ramsay]] at [[University College London]], Soddy showed that the decay of [[radium]] produced [[helium]] gas.<ref name=Nobel/> In the experiment a sample of radium was enclosed in a thin-walled glass envelope sited within an evacuated glass bulb. After leaving the experiment running for a long period of time, a spectral analysis of the contents of the former evacuated space revealed the presence of helium.<ref>[http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/72/477-486/204.full.pdf+html William Ramsay, Frederick Soddy (1903). \"Experiments in Radioactivity, and the Production of Helium from Radium\".

The word 'isotope' was initially suggested to him by [[Margaret Todd (doctor)|Margaret Todd]]. Later, [[J. J. Thomson]] showed that non-radioactive elements can also have multiple isotopes.\n\nIn 1913, Soddy also showed that an atom moves lower in [[atomic number]] by two places on alpha emission, higher by one place on beta emission. This was discovered at about the same time by [[Kazimierz Fajans]], and is known as the [[radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy]], a fundamental step toward understanding the relationships among families of radioactive elements. Soddy published [https://archive.org/details/interpretationof00sodd ''The Interpretation of Radium''] (1909) and ''Atomic Transmutation'' (1953).\n\nIn 1918 he announced discovery of a stable isotope of [[Protactinium]], working with [[John Arnold Cranston]]. This slightly post-dated its discovery by German counterparts; however, it is said their discovery was actually made in 1915 but its announcement was delayed due to Cranston's notes being locked away whilst on active service in the [[First World War]].<ref>http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH3023&type=P</ref>\n\nIn 1919 he moved to the University of Oxford as Dr Lee's Professor of Chemistry, where, in the period up till 1936, he reorganized the laboratories and the syllabus in chemistry.  He received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] for his research in radioactive decay and particularly for his formulation of the theory of isotopes.\n\nHis work and essays popularising the new understanding of radioactivity was the main inspiration for [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914), which features atomic bombs dropped from biplanes in a war set many years in the future. Wells's novel is also known as ''The Last War'' and imagines a peaceful world emerging from the chaos. In ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' Soddy praises Wells\u2019s ''The World Set Free''. He also says that radioactive processes probably power the stars.\n\n=== Economics ===\n{{Ecological economics|People}}\nIn four books written from 1921 to 1934, Soddy carried on a \"campaign for a radical restructuring of global monetary relationships\",<ref name=\"zencey\">{{cite news|last1=Zencey|first1=Eric|title=Mr. Soddy\u2019s Ecological Economy| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html?_r=1&ref=opinion|accessdate=22 December 2017|work=The New York Times|date=12 April 2009|format=Opinion}}</ref>  offering a perspective on economics rooted in physics \u2013 the [[laws of thermodynamics]], in particular \u2013 and was \"roundly dismissed as a crank\".<ref name=\"zencey\"/> While most of his proposals \u2013 \"to abandon the [[gold standard]], let international [[exchange rate]]s float, use federal [[deficit spending|surpluses and deficits]] as [[Macroeconomic policy instruments|macroeconomic policy tools]] that could counter [[Business cycle|cyclical trends]], and establish bureaus of [[economic statistics]] (including a [[consumer price index]]) in order to facilitate this effort\" \u2013 are now conventional practice, his critique of [[fractional-reserve banking]] still \"remains outside the bounds of conventional wisdom\" although a recent paper by the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] reinvigorated his proposals.<ref name=\"zencey\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bene\u0161|first1=Jarom\u00edr|last2=Kumhof|first2= Michael|title=The Chicago Plan Revisited|ssrn=2169748}}</ref> Soddy wrote that financial debts grew exponentially at compound interest but the real economy was based on exhaustible stocks of [[fossil fuels]]. Energy obtained from the fossil fuels could not be used again. This criticism of [[economic growth]] is echoed by his intellectual heirs in the now emergent field of [[ecological economics]].<ref name=\"zencey\"/>\n\n=== Antisemitic views ===\n\nIn ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' Soddy cited the (fraudulent) [[Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]] as evidence for the belief, which was relatively widespread at the time, of a \"financial conspiracy to enslave the world\". He used the imagery of a Jewish conspiracy to buttress his claim that \"A corrupt monetary system strikes at the very life of the nation.\"   In the same document, he made reference to \"the semi-Oriental\" who is \"supreme\" in \"high finance\" and to an \"iridescent bubble of beliefs blown around the world by the Hebraic hierarchy\".  Later in life he published a pamphlet ''Abolish Private Money, or Drown in Debt'' (1939) with a noted publisher of anti-Semitic texts.<ref>[http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2012/07/frederick-soddys-economics-and-the-protocols-of-the-elders-of-zion-1939-.html Frederick Soddy's Economics and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (1939)]</ref>  The influence of his writing can be gauged, for example, in this quote from [[Ezra Pound]]:\n<blockquote>\"Professor Frederick Soddy states that the Gold Standard monetary system has wrecked a scientific age!  ... The world's bankers ... have not been content to take their share of modern wealth production \u2013 great as it has been \u2013 but they have refused to allow the masses of mankind to receive theirs.\"<ref>{{cite book \n|title=Pound in Purgatory: From Economic Radicalism to Anti-Semitism\n|last=Surette\n|first=Leon\n|year=1999\n|publisher=University of Illinois Press\n|page=218\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Descartes' theorem ===\nHe rediscovered the [[Descartes' theorem]] in 1936 and published it as a poem, \"The Kiss Precise\", quoted at [[Problem of Apollonius#kiss precise|Problem of Apollonius]]. The [[kissing circles]] in this problem are sometimes known as '''Soddy circles'''.\n\n== Honours and awards ==\nHe received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1921 and the same year he was elected member of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Atomic Weights Committee]]. A small [[Soddy (crater)|crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] as well as the radioactive Uranium mineral [[Soddyite]] are named after him.<ref>[http://webmineral.com/data/Soddyite.shtml Soddyite Mineral Data]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSoddy married Winifred Beilby, the daughter of Sir [[George Beilby]], in 1908.

They are much more closely related to [[sea lion]]s than [[Earless seal|true seals]], and share with them external ears  ([[pinnae]]), relatively long and muscular foreflippers, and the ability to walk on all fours.  They are marked by their dense [[pelage|underfur]], which made them a long-time object of commercial [[Seal hunting|hunting]]. Eight species belong to the genus ''[[Arctocephalus]]'' and are found primarily in the Southern Hemisphere, while a ninth species also sometimes called fur seal, the [[northern fur seal]] (''Callorhinus ursinus''), belongs to a different genus and inhabits the North Pacific.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n* '''Subfamily''' [[Arctocephalinae]]\n** Genus ''[[Arctocephalus]]''\n*** [[Antarctic fur seal]], ''A. gazella''\n*** [[Brown fur seal]], ''A. pusillus''\n****South African fur seal, ''A. pusillus pusillus''\n****Australian fur seal, ''A. pusillus doriferus''\n*** [[Gal\u00e1pagos fur seal]], ''A. galapagoensis''\n*** [[Guadalupe fur seal]], ''A. townsendi''\n*** [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal]], ''A. philippii''\n*** [[New Zealand fur seal]] or southern fur seal, ''[[Arctocephalus forsteri|A. forsteri]]''\n*** [[South American fur seal]], ''A. australis''\n*** [[Subantarctic fur seal]], ''A. tropicalis''\n** Genus ''Callorhinus''\n*** [[Northern fur seal]], ''C. ursinus''\n\n[[File:Arctocephalinae.png|left|thumb|Fur seal ranges]]\nFur seals and sea lions make up the family Otariidae.  Along with Phocidae and Odobodenidae, ottariids are pinnipeds descending from a common ancestor most closely related to modern bears.  The name pinniped refers to mammals with front and rear flippers. Otariids arose about 15-17 million years ago in the Miocene, and were originally land mammals that rapidly diversified and adapted to a marine environment, giving rise to the semi-aquatic marine mammals that thrive today. Fur seals and sea lions are closely related and commonly known together as the \"eared seals\".   \nUntil recently, fur seals were all grouped under a single subfamily of Pinnipedia, called Arctocephalinae, to contrast them with Otariinae \u2013 the sea lions \u2013 based on the most prominent common feature, namely the coat of dense underfur intermixed with guard hairs.  Recent genetic evidence, however, suggests ''Callorhinus'' is more closely related to some sea lion species, and the fur seal/sea lion subfamily distinction has been eliminated from many [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]].  Nonetheless, all fur seals have certain features in common: the fur, generally smaller sizes, farther and longer foraging trips, smaller and more abundant prey items and greater [[sexual dimorphism]].  For these reasons, the distinction remains useful. Fur seals comprise two genera: ''Callorhinus'', and ''Arctocephalus''. ''Callorhinus'' is represented by just one species in the northern hemisphere, the northern fur seal (''Callorhinus ursinus''), and ''Arctocephalus'' is represented by eight species in the southern hemisphere.  The southern fur seals comprising the genus ''Arctocephalus'' include: Antarctic fur seals, Galapagos fur seals, Juan Fernandez fur seals, New Zealand fur seals, brown fur seals, South American fur seals, and Subantarctic fur seals.\n\n==Physical appearance==\n[[File:Fur seal pups from St. Paul Island by USFWS.jpg|thumb|Pups on [[St. Paul Island, Alaska]]]]\nAlong with the previously mentioned thick underfur, fur seals are distinguished from sea lions by their smaller body structure, greater sexual dimorphism, smaller prey, and longer foraging trips during the feeding cycle.  The physical appearance of fur seals varies with individual species but the main characteristics remain constant.  Fur seals are characterized by their external pinnae, dense underfur, vibrissae, and long muscular limbs.  They share with other otariids the ability to rotate their rear limbs forward, supporting their body and allowing them to ambulate on land.  In water their front limbs, typically measuring about 1/4th their body length, act as oars and can propel them forward for optimal mobility.  The surfaces of these long, paddle-like fore limbs are leathery with small claws.   Otariids have a dog-like head, sharp, well-developed canines, sharp eyesight and keen hearing.  They are extremely sexually dimorphic mammals, with the males often 2 to 5 times the size of the females, with proportionally larger heads, necks and chests.  Size ranges from about 1.5 m, 64&nbsp;kg in the male Galapagos fur seal (also the smallest pinniped) to 2.5m, 180&nbsp;kg in the adult male New Zealand fur seal.  Most fur seal pups are born with a black-brown coat that molts at 2\u20133 months, revealing a brown coat that typically gets darker with age. Some males and females within the same species have significant differences in appearance, further contributing to the sexual dimorphism.  Females and juveniles often have a lighter colored coat overall or only on the chest, as seen in South American fur seals.  In a Northern fur seal population, the females are typically silvery-gray on the dorsal side and reddish-brown on their ventral side with a light gray patch on their chest.  This makes them easily distinguished from the males with their brownish-gray to reddish-brown or black coats.\n\n==Habitat==\nOf the fur seal family, eight species are considered southern fur seals, and only one is found in the northern hemisphere.  The southern group includes Antarctic, Galapagos, Guadalupe, Juan Fernandez, New Zealand, Brown, South American, and Subantarctic fur seals.  They typically spend about 70% of their lives in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters.  Colonies of fur seals can be seen throughout the Pacific and Southern oceans from south Australia, Africa, and New Zealand, to the coast of Peru and up to California.  They are typically non-migrating mammals, with the exception of the Northern fur seal, which has been known to travel distances up to 10,000&nbsp;km.  Fur seals are often found near isolated islands or peninsulas and can be seen hauling out onto the mainland during winter.  Although they are not migratory, they have been observed wandering hundreds of miles from their breeding grounds in times of scarce resources.  For example, the Subantarctic fur seal typically resides near temperate islands in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans north of the Antarctic Polar Front, but juvenile males have been seen wandering as far north as Brazil and South Africa.\n\n==Behavior and ecology==\n[[File:Seal Sunbathing.jpg|thumb|right|A fur seal at [[Living Coasts]], sunbathing on a rock]]\n[[File:Thousands of fur-seals on a St. Paul beach - a fur seal rookery.jpg|thumb|right|A fur seal rookery with thousands of seals]]\nTypically, fur seals gather during the summer in large [[rookeries|assemblages]] at specific beaches or rocky outcrops to give birth and breed. All species are [[polygynous]], meaning dominant males reproduce with more than one female. For most species, total gestation lasts about 11.5 months, including a several-month period of [[delayed implantation]] of the embryo. Northern fur seal males aggressively select and defend the specific females in their harms.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070818070157/http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/nmml/education/Pinnipeds/furseals.htm Fur Seals (Arctocephalinae)]. afsc.noaa.gov</ref> Females typically reach sexual maturity around 3\u20134 years.  The males reach sexual maturity around the same time but do not become territorial or mate until 6\u201310 years.  The breeding season typically begins in November and lasts 2\u20133 months.  The Northern fur seals begin their breeding season as early as June due to their region, climate, and resources.  In all cases, the males arrive a couple of weeks early to fight for their territory and groups of females to mate with.  They congregate at rocky, isolated breeding grounds and defend their territory through fighting and vocalization.  Males typically do not leave their territory for the entirety of the breeding season, fasting and competing until all energy sources are depleted.  The Juan Fernandez fur seals deviate from this typical behavior, using aquatic breeding territories not seen in other fur seals.  They use rocky sites for breeding but males fight for territory on land and on the shoreline & in the water.  Upon arriving to the breeding grounds, females give birth to their pups from the previous season.  About a week later, the females will mate again and shortly after begin their feeding cycle.  The feeding cycle typically consists of foraging and feeding at sea for about 5 days, then returning to the breeding grounds to nurse the pups for about 2 days.  Mothers and pups locate each other using call recognition during nursing period.  The Juan Fernandez fur seal has a particularly long feeding cycle, with about 12 days of foraging and feeding and 5 days of nursing.  Most fur seals continue this cycle for about 9 months until they wean their pup.  The exception to this is the Antarctic fur seal, which has a feeding cycle that lasts only 4 months.  During foraging trips, most female fur seals travel around 200&nbsp;km from the breeding site, and can dive around 200m depending on food availability.\n \nThe remainder of the year, fur seals lead a largely [[pelagic]] existence in the open sea, pursuing their prey wherever it is abundant. Fur seals feed on moderately sized fish, [[squid]], and [[krill]]. Several species of the southern fur seal also have sea birds, especially penguins, as part of their diets.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00300-008-0475-3|title=Interannual variation in the diet of non-breeding male Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island|year=2008|last1=Daneri|first1=G.

Fur seals are opportunistic mammals tend to feed and dive in shallow waters at night, when their prey are swimming near the surface.  The South American fur seals exhibit a different diet; adults feed almost exclusively on anchovies while juveniles feed on demersal fish, most likely due to availability.\n\nWhen fur seals were hunted in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, they hauled out on remote islands where no predators were present. The hunters reported being able to club the unwary animals to death one after another, making the hunt profitable, though the price per seal skin was low.<ref name=muir/>\n\n==Population and survival==\n[[File:Fur Seal, Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Northern fur seal]] at the [[Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge]].]]\n[[File:Seal fur braclet.jpg|thumb|[[Bracelet]] made from silver and seal fur]]\nThe average lifespan of fur seals varies with different species from 13 to 25 years with females typically living longer.  Most populations continue to expand as they recover from previous commercial hunting and environmental threats.   \nMany fur seal species were heavily exploited by commercial [[seal hunting|sealer]]s, especially during the 19th century when their fur was highly valued. Beginning in the 1790s, the ports of [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] and [[New Haven]], Connecticut, were leaders of the American fur seal trade, which primarily entailed clubbing fur seals to death on uninhabited South Pacific islands, skinning them, and selling the hides in [[China]].<ref name=muir>Muir, Diana, \"[[Reflections in Bullough's Pond]]\", University Press of New England, 2000, pp. 80ff {{ISBN|0-87451-909-8}}.</ref> Many populations, notably the [[Guadalupe fur seal]], [[northern fur seal]], and [[Cape fur seal]], suffered dramatic declines and are still recovering.  Currently, most species are protected and hunting is mostly limited to subsistence harvest.  Globally, most populations can be considered healthy, mostly because they often prefer remote habitats that are relatively inaccessible to humans.  Nonetheless, [[environmental degradation]], competition with [[fisheries]], and [[climate change]] potentially pose threats to some populations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Seal (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Bering Sea Arbitration]]\n*Gentry, R.

His father, Urbano Fellini (1894\u20131956), born to a family of [[Romagna|Romagnol]] peasants and small landholders from [[Gambettola]], moved to [[Rome]] in 1915 as a baker [[apprentice]]d to the Pantanella pasta factory. His mother, Ida Barbiani (1896\u20131984), came from a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeiois]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family of Roman merchants. Despite her family's vehement disapproval, she had eloped with Urbano in 1917 to live at his parents' home in Gambettola.<ref>Alpert, 16</ref> A civil marriage followed in 1918 with the religious ceremony held at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome a year later.\n\nThe couple settled in Rimini where Urbano became a [[Vendor (supply chain)|traveling salesman]] and [[wholesale]] [[vendor]]. Fellini had two siblings: [[Riccardo Fellini|Riccardo]] (1921\u20131991), a documentary director for [[RAI]] Television, and [[Maria Maddalena Fellini|Maria Maddalena]] (m. Fabbri; 1929\u20132002).\nIn 1924, Fellini started primary school in an institute run by the nuns of San Vincenzo in Rimini, attending the Carlo Tonni public school two years later. An attentive student, he spent his leisure time drawing, staging puppet shows, and reading ''Il corriere dei piccoli'', the popular children's magazine that reproduced traditional American cartoons by [[Winsor McCay]], [[George McManus]] and [[Frederick Burr Opper]]. (Opper's ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'' would provide the visual inspiration for Gelsomina in Fellini's 1954 film ''[[La Strada]]''; McCay's ''[[Little Nemo]]'' would directly influence his 1980 film ''[[City of Women]]''.)<ref name= \"ReferenceA\">Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 7</ref> In 1926, he discovered the world of [[Grand Guignol]], the circus with [[Pierino]] the Clown, and the movies. [[Guido Brignone]]\u2019s ''Maciste all\u2019Inferno'' (1926), the first film he saw, would mark him in ways linked to [[Dante]] and the cinema throughout his entire career.<ref>Burke and Waller, 5&ndash;13</ref>\n\nEnrolled at the Ginnasio Giulio Cesare in 1929, he made friends with Luigi \u2018Titta\u2019 Benzi, later a prominent Rimini lawyer (and the model for young Titta in ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973)). In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]\u2019s Italy, Fellini and Riccardo became members of the ''Avanguardista'', the compulsory [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] youth group for males. He visited Rome with his parents for the first time in 1933, the year of the maiden voyage of the transatlantic ocean liner ''[[SS Rex]]'' (which is shown in ''Amarcord''). The sea creature found on the beach at the end of ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960) has its basis in a giant fish marooned on a Rimini beach during a storm in 1934.\n\nAlthough Fellini adapted key events from his childhood and adolescence in films such as ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953), ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963), and ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973), he insisted that such autobiographical memories were inventions: \n{{Quote |It is not memory that dominates my films. To say that my films are autobiographical is an overly facile liquidation, a hasty classification. It seems to me that I have invented almost everything: childhood, character, nostalgias, dreams, memories, for the pleasure of being able to recount them.<ref>Fellini interview in ''Panorama'' 18 (14 January 1980). Screenwriters [[Tullio Pinelli]] and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], cinematographer [[Giuseppe Rotunno]] and set designer [[Dante Ferretti]] also reported that Fellini imagined many of his \u201cmemories\u201d. Cf. Bernardino Zapponi's memoir, ''Il mio Fellini'' and Fellini's own insistence on having created his cinematic autobiography in ''I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 32</ref>}}\n\nIn 1937, Fellini opened Febo, a portrait shop in Rimini, with the painter Demos Bonini. His first humorous article appeared in the \"Postcards to Our Readers\" section of Milan's ''Domenica del Corriere''. Deciding on a career as a caricaturist and gag writer, Fellini travelled to [[Florence]] in 1938, where he published his first cartoon in the weekly ''420''. According to a biographer, Fellini found school \"exasperating\"<ref>Kezich, 17</ref> and, in one year, had 67 absences.<ref>Kezich, 14</ref> Failing his military culture exam, he graduated from high school in July 1938 after doubling the exam.\n\n===Rome (1939)===\nIn September 1939, he enrolled in law school at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] to please his parents. Biographer [[Hollis Alpert]] reports that \"there is no record of his ever having attended a class\".<ref>Alpert, 33</ref> Installed in a family ''pensione'', he met another lifelong friend, the painter Rinaldo Geleng. Desperately poor, they unsuccessfully joined forces to draw sketches of restaurant and caf\u00e9 patrons. Fellini eventually found work as a cub reporter on the dailies ''Il Piccolo'' and ''Il Popolo di Roma'', but quit after a short stint, bored by the local court news assignments.\n\nFour months after publishing his first article in ''[[Marc\u2019Aurelio]]'', the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, he joined the editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled ''But Are You Listening?''<ref>Kezich, 31</ref> Described as \u201cthe determining moment in Fellini\u2019s life\u201d,<ref>Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 8</ref> the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters. These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema. Among his collaborators on the magazine's editorial board were the future director [[Ettore Scola]], [[Marxist]] theorist and scriptwriter [[Cesare Zavattini]], and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], a future Fellini screenwriter. Conducting interviews for ''CineMagazzino'' also proved congenial: when asked to interview [[Aldo Fabrizi]], Italy's most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally. Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9.<ref>Kezich, 55</ref>\n\n==Career and later life==\n\n=== Early screenplays (1940\u20131943) ===\n[[File:Federico Fellini.jpg|thumb|Federico Fellini during the 1950s]]\nRetained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son. Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of ''Marc\u2019Aurelio'', began writing radio sketches and gags for films.\n\nNot yet twenty and with Fabrizi's help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on [[Mario Mattoli]]\u2019s ''[[Il pirata sono io]]'' (''The Pirate's Dream''). Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]], his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist [[Vitaliano Brancati]] and scriptwriter Piero Tellini. In the wake of Mussolini\u2019s declaration of war against France and England on 10 June 1940, Fellini discovered [[Kafka]]\u2019s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', [[Gogol]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[William Faulkner]] along with French films by [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]], [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]], and [[Julien Duvivier]].<ref>Alpert, 42</ref> In 1941 he published ''Il mio amico Pasqualino'', a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego.<ref>Kezich, 35</ref>\n\nWriting for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife [[Giulietta Masina]] in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] in the autumn of 1942. Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini's radio serial, ''Cico and Pallina'', Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war.<ref>\"Giulietta is practical, and likes the fact that she earns a handsome fee for her radio work, whereas theater never pays well. And of course the fame counts for something too. Radio is a booming business and comedy reviews have a broad and devoted public.\" Kezich, 48</ref> In November 1942, Fellini was sent to [[Libya]], occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of ''I cavalieri del deserto'' (''[[Knights of the Desert (film)|Knights of the Desert]]'', 1942), directed by [[Osvaldo Valenti]] and Gino Talamo. Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him \"to secure another extension on his draft order\".<ref>Kezich, 70</ref> Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film's first scenes. When [[Tripoli]] fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to [[Sicily]]. His African adventure, later published in ''Marc\u2019Aurelio'' as \"The First Flight\", marked \u201cthe emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field\u201d.<ref>Kezich, 71</ref>\n\nThe [[apolitical]] Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over [[Bologna]] destroyed his medical records. Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt's apartment until Mussolini's fall on 25 July 1943. After dating for nine months, the couple were married on 30 October 1943. Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage. She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945, but the child died of [[encephalitis]] a month later on 24 April 1945.<ref>Kezich, 74</ref> The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions.<ref>Kezich, 157. Cf. filmed interview with Luigi 'Titta' Benzi in ''[[Fellini: I'm a Born Liar]]'' (2003).</ref>\n\n===Neorealist apprenticeship (1944\u20131949)===\nAfter the Allied liberation of Rome on 4 June 1944, Fellini and Enrico De Seta opened the Funny Face Shop where they survived the postwar recession drawing caricatures of American soldiers. He became involved with [[Italian Neorealism]] when [[Roberto Rossellini]], at work on ''Stories of Yesteryear'' (later ''[[Rome, Open City]]''), met Fellini in his shop, and proposed he contribute gags and dialogue for the script. Aware of Fellini's reputation as Aldo Fabrizi's \u201ccreative muse\u201d,<ref>Kezich, 78</ref> Rossellini also requested that he try to convince the actor to play the role of Father Giuseppe Morosini, the parish priest executed by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] on 4 April 1944.\n\nIn 1947, Fellini and [[Sergio Amidei]] received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay of ''Rome, Open City''.\n\nWorking as both screenwriter and assistant director on Rossellini's ''[[Pais\u00e0]]'' (''Paisan'') in 1946, Fellini was entrusted to film the Sicilian scenes in [[Maiori]]. In February 1948, he was introduced to [[Marcello Mastroianni]], then a young theatre actor appearing in a play with Giulietta Masina.<ref>Kezich, 404</ref> Establishing a close working relationship with [[Alberto Lattuada]], Fellini co-wrote the director's ''[[Senza piet\u00e0]]'' (''Without Pity'') and ''[[Il mulino del Po]]'' (''The Mill on the Po''). Fellini also worked with Rossellini on the [[anthology film]] ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948), co-writing the screenplay and in one segment titled, \"The Miracle\", acting opposite [[Anna Magnani]]. To play the role of a vagabond rogue mistaken by Magnani for a saint, Fellini had to bleach his black hair blond.\n\n===Early films (1950\u20131953)===\n[[File:Fellini masina delpoggio lattuada 1952.jpg|thumb|Fellini, Masina, Carla del Poggio and Alberto Lattuada, 1952]]\nIn 1950 Fellini co-produced and co-directed with Alberto Lattuada ''[[Variety Lights]]'' (''Luci del variet\u00e0''), his first feature film. A backstage comedy set among the world of small-time travelling performers, it featured Giulietta Masina and Lattuada's wife, [[Carla Del Poggio|Carla del Poggio]]. Its release to poor reviews and limited distribution proved disastrous for all concerned. The production company went bankrupt, leaving both Fellini and Lattuada with debts to pay for over a decade.<ref>Kezich, 114</ref> In February 1950, ''Pais\u00e0'' received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay by Rossellini, [[Sergio Amidei]], and Fellini.\n\nAfter travelling to Paris for a script conference with Rossellini on ''[[Europa '51]]'', Fellini began production on ''[[The White Sheik]]'' in September 1951, his first solo-directed feature. Starring [[Alberto Sordi]] in the title role, the film is a revised version of a treatment first written by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] in 1949 and based on the ''fotoromanzi'', the photographed cartoon strip romances popular in Italy at the time. Producer [[Carlo Ponti]] commissioned Fellini and [[Tullio Pinelli]] to write the script but Antonioni rejected the story they developed. With [[Ennio Flaiano]], they re-worked the material into a light-hearted satire about newlywed couple Ivan and Wanda Cavalli ([[Leopoldo Trieste]], Brunella Bovo) in Rome to visit the Pope. Ivan's prissy mask of respectability is soon demolished by his wife's obsession with the White Sheik. Highlighting the music of [[Nino Rota]], the film was selected at Cannes (among the films in competition was [[Orson Welles]]\u2019s ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'') and then retracted. Screened at the [[13th Venice International Film Festival]], it was razzed by critics in \"the atmosphere of a soccer match\u201d.<ref>Kezich, 128</ref> One reviewer declared that Fellini had \u201cnot the slightest aptitude for cinema direction\".\n\nIn 1953, ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' found favour with the critics and public. Winning the Silver Lion Award in Venice, it secured Fellini his first international distributor.\n\n===Beyond neorealism (1954\u20131960)===\n[[File:Cinecitt\u00e0 - Teatro 5.jpg|thumb|[[Cinecitt\u00e0]] - Teatro 5, Fellini's favorite studio<ref>{{cite web|title=Our flexible giant.|url=http://www.cinecittastudios.it/en/events/special-events/teatro-5|publisher=Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios|accessdate=20 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054032/http://www.cinecittastudios.it/en/events/special-events/teatro-5|archive-date=2013-09-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>]]\n\nFellini directed ''[[La Strada]]'' based on a script completed in 1952 with Pinelli and Flaiano. During the last three weeks of shooting, Fellini experienced the first signs of severe clinical depression.<ref name=\"Kezich, 158\">Kezich, 158</ref> Aided by his wife, he undertook a brief period of therapy with Freudian psychoanalyst Emilio Servadio.<ref name=\"Kezich, 158\"/>\n\nFellini cast American actor [[Broderick Crawford]] to interpret the role of an aging swindler in ''[[Il Bidone]]''. Based partly on stories told to him by a petty thief during production of ''La Strada'', Fellini developed the script into a con man's slow descent towards a solitary death. To incarnate the role's \"intense, tragic face\", Fellini's first choice had been [[Humphrey Bogart]]<ref>Kezich, p. 167</ref> but after learning of the actor's lung cancer, chose Crawford after seeing his face on the theatrical poster of ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King\u2019s Men]]'' (1949). The film shoot was wrought with difficulties stemming from Crawford's alcoholism.<ref>Kezich, pp. 168-69</ref> Savaged by critics at the [[16th Venice International Film Festival]], the film did miserably at the box office and did not receive international distribution until 1964.\n\nDuring the autumn, Fellini researched and developed a treatment based on a film adaptation of [[Mario Tobino]]\u2019s novel, ''The Free Women of Magliano''. Located in a mental institution for women, financial backers considered the subject had no potential and the project was abandoned.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWhile preparing ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' in spring 1956, Fellini learned of his father\u2019s death by cardiac arrest at the age of sixty-two. Produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and starring Giulietta Masina, the film took its inspiration from  news reports of a woman\u2019s severed head retrieved in a lake and stories by Wanda, a shantytown prostitute Fellini met on the set of ''[[Il Bidone]]''.<ref>Kezich, p. 177</ref> [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] was hired to translate Flaiano and Pinelli\u2019s dialogue into Roman dialect and to supervise researches in the vice-afflicted suburbs of Rome. The movie won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[30th Academy Awards]] and brought Masina the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nWith Pinelli, he developed ''Journey with Anita'' for [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Gregory Peck]]. An \"invention born out of intimate truth\", the script was based on Fellini's return to Rimini with a mistress to attend his father's funeral.<ref>Kezich, 189</ref> Due to Loren's unavailability, the project was shelved and resurrected twenty-five years later as ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1981), a comedy directed by [[Mario Monicelli]] with [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Giancarlo Giannini]]. For [[Eduardo De Filippo]], he co-wrote the script of ''[[Fortunella (film)|Fortunella]]'', tailoring the lead role to accommodate Masina's particular sensibility.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe [[Hollywood on the Tiber]] phenomenon of 1958 in which American studios profited from the cheap studio labour available in Rome provided the backdrop for photojournalists to steal shots of celebrities on the via Veneto.<ref>Alpert, 122</ref> The scandal provoked by Turkish dancer Haish Nana's improvised striptease at a nightclub captured Fellini's imagination: he decided to end his latest script-in-progress, ''Moraldo in the City'', with an all-night \"orgy\" at a seaside villa. [[Pierluigi Praturlon]]\u2019s photos of [[Anita Ekberg]] wading fully dressed in the [[Trevi Fountain]] provided further inspiration for Fellini and his scriptwriters. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nChanging the title of the screenplay to ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted [[Paul Newman]] as a hedge on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul [[Angelo Rizzoli]]. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter\u2019s in a mammoth d\u00e9cor constructed at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]]. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to [[Saint Peter's Square]] was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at [[Passo Oscuro]] with a bloated mutant fish designed by [[Piero Gherardi]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' broke all box office records. Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire,<ref>Kezich, 208</ref> crowds queued in line for hours to see an \u201cimmoral movie\u201d before the censors banned it. At an exclusive [[Milan]] screening on 5 February 1960, one outraged patron spat on Fellini while others hurled insults. Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magr\u00ec of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film's controversial themes.<ref>Kezich, p. 209</ref> The [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s official press organ, ''[[l'Osservatore Romano]]'', lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film. In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' had severe consequences.<ref>Kezich, p. 210</ref> In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni's ''[[L\u2019Avventura]]'', the film won the [[Cannes Film Festival|Palme d'Or]] awarded by presiding juror [[Georges Simenon]].

After meeting Jungian psychoanalyst Dr. Ernst Bernhard in early 1960, he read Jung's autobiography, ''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'' (1963) and experimented with [[LSD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sostanze.info/esperienza/fellini-e-l039sd|title=FELLINI E L' LSD - sostanze.info|website=www.sostanze.info}}</ref> Bernhard also recommended that Fellini consult the ''[[I Ching]]'' and keep a record of his dreams. What Fellini formerly accepted as \"his extrasensory perceptions\"<ref>Kezich, p. 224</ref> were now interpreted as psychic manifestations of the unconscious. Bernhard's focus on Jungian depth psychology proved to be the single greatest influence on Fellini's mature style and marked the turning point in his work from neorealism to filmmaking that was \"primarily oneiric\".<ref>Kezich, p. 227</ref> As a consequence, Jung's seminal ideas on the ''anima'' and the ''animus'', the role of archetypes and the collective unconscious directly influenced such films as ''[[8\u00bd]]'' (1963), ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' (1965), ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]'' (1969), ''[[Fellini's Casanova|Casanova]]'' (1976), and ''[[City of Women]]'' (1980).<ref>Bondanella, ''Cinema of Federico Fellini'', pp. 151-54</ref> Other key influences on his work include [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]],<ref>\"Bu\u00f1uel is the auteur I feel closest to in terms of an idea of cinema or the tendency to make particular kinds of films.\" In Fellini and Pettigrew, ''I\u2019m a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 87.</ref> [[Charlie Chaplin]],<ref>\u201cOne of Cabiria\u2019s finest moments comes in the movie\u2019s nightclub scene. It begins when the actor\u2019s girlfriend deserts him, and the star picks up Cabiria on the street as a replacement. He whisks her away to the nightclub. Fellini has admitted that this scene owes a debt to Chaplin\u2019s ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931).\" Cited in John C. Stubbs, ''Federico Fellini as Auteur: Seven Aspects of his Films'' (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2006), pp. 152-53. Peter Bondanella points out that Gelsomina's costume, makeup, and antics as a clown figure had \"clear links to Fellini's past as a cartoonist-imitator of Happy Hooligan and Charlie Chaplin\". Cited in Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 104</ref> [[Sergei Eisenstein]],<ref>In his study of ''Fellini Satyricon'', Italian novelist [[Alberto Moravia]] observes that with \"the oars of his galleys suspended in the air, Fellini revives for us the lances of the battle in Eisenstein's ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|''Alexander Nevsky'' (film)]]''.\" Cited in Bondanella (ed), ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', 167</ref> [[Buster Keaton]],<ref name=\"Bondanella\">Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', 8</ref> [[Laurel and Hardy]],<ref name=\"Bondanella\"/> the [[Marx Brothers]],<ref name=\"Bondanella\"/> and [[Roberto Rossellini]].<ref>\u201cRoberto Rossellini walked into my life at a moment when I needed to make a choice, when I needed someone to show me the path to follow.

In ''Fellini on Fellini'', the director explains that his \"meeting with Rossellini was a determining factor... he taught me to make a film as if I were going for a picnic with friends.\" In ''Fellini on Fellini'' (London: Eyre Methuen, 1976), 99-100</ref>\n\nExploiting ''La Dolce Vita''\u2019s success, financier Angelo Rizzoli set up Federiz in 1960, an independent film company, for Fellini and production manager Clemente Fracassi to discover and produce new talent. Despite the best intentions, their overcautious editorial and business skills forced the company to close down soon after cancelling Pasolini\u2019s project, ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961).<ref>Kezich, pp. 218-219</ref>\n\nCondemned as a \"public sinner\"<ref>Kezich, 212</ref> for ''La Dolce Vita'', Fellini responded with ''The Temptations of Doctor Antonio'', a segment in the omnibus ''[[Boccaccio '70]]''. His second colour film, it was the sole project green-lighted at Federiz. Infused with the [[surrealistic]] satire that characterized the young Fellini's work at ''Marc\u2019Aurelio'', the film ridiculed a crusader against vice, interpreted by [[Peppino De Filippo]], who goes insane trying to censor a billboard of [[Anita Ekberg]] espousing the virtues of milk.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering creative block: \"Well then - a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease. It\u2019s a warning bell: something is blocking up his system.\"<ref>Affron, 227</ref> Unclear about the script, its title, and his protagonist's profession, he scouted locations throughout Italy \u201clooking for the film\u201d<ref>Alpert, 159</ref> in the hope of resolving his confusion. Flaiano suggested ''La bella confusione'' (literally ''The Beautiful Confusion'') as the movie's title. Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on ''8\u00bd'', a [[self-referential]] title referring principally (but not exclusively)<ref>Kezich, p. 234 and Affron, pp. 3-4</ref> to the number of films he had directed up to that time.\n\nGiving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]], and [[Sandra Milo]] in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired [[cinematographer]] [[Gianni Di Venanzo]], among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living.<ref>Alpert, p. 160</ref> The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecitt\u00e0 office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had \"lost his film\" and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of ''8\u00bd'', Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he \"felt overwhelmed by shame\u2026 I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight to the heart of the film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make\".<ref>Fellini, ''Comments on Film'', pp. 161-62</ref>\n\nShooting began on 9 May 1962. Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director's American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale. Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels \"on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional - the realm of fantasy\".<ref>Alpert, 170</ref>  After shooting wrapped on 14 October, [[Nino Rota]] composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro's cinema.<ref>Kezich, 245</ref> Nominated for four Oscars, ''8\u00bd'' won awards for best foreign language film and best costume design in black-and-white. In California for the ceremony, Fellini toured [[Disneyland]] with [[Walt Disney]] the day after.\n\nIncreasingly attracted to [[parapsychology]], Fellini met the [[Turin]] magician [[Gustavo Rol]] in 1963. Rol, a former banker, introduced him to the world of [[Spiritism]] and [[s\u00e9ances]]. In 1964, Fellini took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]<ref>A synthetic derivative \"fashioned to produce the same effects as the hallucinogenic mushrooms used by Mexican tribes\". Kezich, 255</ref> under the supervision of Emilio Servadio, his psychoanalyst during the 1954 production of ''La Strada''.<ref>Kezich, 255</ref> For years reserved about what actually occurred that Sunday afternoon, he admitted in 1992 that\n<blockquote>objects and their functions no longer had any significance. All I perceived was perception itself, the hell of forms and figures devoid of human emotion and detached from the reality of my unreal environment. I was an instrument in a virtual world that constantly renewed its own meaningless image in a living world that was itself perceived outside of nature. And since the appearance of things was no longer definitive but limitless, this paradisiacal awareness freed me from the reality external to my self. The fire and the rose, as it were, became one.<ref>Fellini and Pettigrew, p. 91</ref></blockquote>\n\nFellini's hallucinatory insights were given full flower in his first colour feature ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' (1965), depicting [[Giulietta Masina]] as Juliet, a housewife who rightly suspects her husband's infidelity and succumbs to the voices of spirits summoned during a s\u00e9ance at her home. Her sexually voracious next door neighbor Suzy ([[Sandra Milo]]) introduces Juliet to a world of uninhibited sensuality but Juliet is haunted by childhood memories of her [[Catholic guilt]] and a teenaged friend who committed suicide.  Complex and filled with psychological symbolism, the film is set to a jaunty score by [[Nino Rota]].\n\n===Nostalgia, sexuality, and politics (1970\u20131980)===\n[[File:Bruno Zanin &Fellini.JPG|thumb|Fellini & [[Bruno Zanin]] on the set of ''[[Amarcord]]'' in 1973]]\nTo help promote [[Fellini Satyricon|''Satyricon'']] in the United States, Fellini flew to Los Angeles in January 1970 for interviews with [[Dick Cavett]] and [[David Frost]]. He also met with film director [[Paul Mazursky]] who wanted to star him alongside [[Donald Sutherland]] in his new film, ''[[Alex in Wonderland]]''.<ref>Kezich, 410</ref> In February, Fellini scouted locations in Paris for ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'', a [[docufiction]] both for cinema and television, based on his childhood memories of the circus and a \"coherent theory of clowning.\"<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 192</ref> As he saw it, the clown \"was always the caricature of a well-established, ordered, peaceful society. But today all is temporary, disordered, grotesque. Who can still laugh at clowns?... All the world plays a clown now.\"<ref>Alpert, p. 224</ref>\n\nIn March 1971, Fellini began production on ''[[Roma (1972 film)|Roma]]'', a seemingly random collection of episodes informed by the director's memories and impressions of Rome. The \"diverse sequences,\" writes Fellini scholar [[Peter Bondanella]], \"are held together only by the fact that they all ultimately originate from the director\u2019s fertile imagination.\"<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 193</ref> The film's opening scene anticipates ''Amarcord'' while its most surreal sequence involves an ecclesiastical fashion show in which nuns and priests roller skate past shipwrecks of cobwebbed skeletons.\n\nOver a period of six months between January and June 1973, Fellini shot the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Amarcord]]''. Loosely based on the director's 1968 autobiographical essay ''My Rimini'',<ref>Alpert, 239</ref> the film depicts the adolescent Titta and his friends working out their sexual frustrations against the religious and Fascist backdrop of a provincial town in Italy during the 1930s. Produced by [[Franco Cristaldi]], the [[seriocomic]] movie became Fellini's second biggest commercial success after ''La Dolce Vita''.<ref>Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini'', p. 265</ref> Circular in form, ''Amarcord'' avoids plot and linear narrative in a way similar to ''The Clowns'' and ''Roma''.<ref>Alpert, p. 242</ref> The director's overriding concern with developing a poetic form of cinema was first outlined in a 1965 interview he gave to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' journalist [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]]: \"I am trying to free my work from certain constrictions \u2013 a story with a beginning, a development, an ending. It should be more like a poem with metre and cadence.\"<ref>Bondanella, ''Federico Fellini: Essays in Criticism'', p. 104</ref>\n\n===Late films and projects (1981\u20131990)===\n[[File:Sandro Pertini David Donatello.jpg|left|thumb|Italian President [[Sandro Pertini]] receiving a [[David di Donatello]] Award from Fellini in 1985]]\nOrganized by his publisher [[Diogenes Verlag]] in 1982, the first major exhibition of 63 drawings by Fellini was held in [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and the [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery in [[New York City|New York]].<ref>Kezich, 413.

That same year, he became the first non-American to receive the [[Film Society of Lincoln Center]]\u2019s annual award for cinematic achievement.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Fellini Mastroianni 1990 Venice Film Festival 02.jpg|thumb|200px|Fellini rewards [[Marcello Mastroianni]] with the [[Golden Lion#Golden Lion Honorary Award|Golden Lion Honorary Award]] at the [[47th Venice International Film Festival]]]]\n\nLong fascinated by [[Carlos Castaneda]]\u2019s ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge]]'', Fellini accompanied the Peruvian author on a journey to the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] to assess the feasibility of a film. After first meeting Castaneda in Rome in October 1984, Fellini drafted a treatment with Pinelli titled ''Viaggio a Tulun''. Producer [[Alberto Grimaldi]], prepared to buy film rights to all of Castaneda's work, then paid for pre-production research taking Fellini and his entourage from Rome to [[Los Angeles]] and the jungles of [[Mexico]] in October 1985.<ref>Kezich, 360-61</ref> When Castaneda inexplicably disappeared and the project fell through, Fellini's mystico-shamanic adventures were scripted with Pinelli and serialized in ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' in May 1986. A barely veiled satirical interpretation of Castaneda's work,<ref>Kezich, 362</ref> ''Viaggio a Tulun'' was published in 1989 as a [[graphic novel]] with artwork by [[Milo Manara]] and as ''Trip to Tulum'' in America in 1990.\n\nFor ''[[Intervista]]'', produced by Ibrahim Moussa and RAI Television, Fellini intercut memories of the first time he visited [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in 1939 with present-day footage of himself at work on a screen adaptation of [[Franz Kafka]]\u2019s ''[[Amerika (novel)|Amerika]]''. A meditation on the nature of memory and film production, it won the special 40th Anniversary Prize at Cannes and the [[15th Moscow International Film Festival]] Golden Prize. In Brussels later that year, a panel of thirty professionals from eighteen European countries named Fellini the world\u2019s best director and ''8\u00bd'' the best European film of all time.<ref>Burke and Waller, p. xvi</ref>\n\nIn early 1989 Fellini began production on ''[[The Voice of the Moon]]'', based on Ermanno Cavazzoni\u2019s novel, ''Il poema dei lunatici'' (''The Lunatics' Poem''). A small town was built at Empire Studios on the via Pontina outside Rome. Starring [[Roberto Benigni]] as Ivo Salvini, a madcap poetic figure newly released from a mental institution, the character is a combination of ''La Strada'''s Gelsomina, [[Pinocchio]], and Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]].<ref>Bondanella, ''Cinema of Federico Fellini'', p. 330</ref> Fellini improvised as he filmed, using as a guide a rough treatment written with Pinelli.<ref>Kezich, 383</ref> Despite its modest critical and commercial success in Italy, and its warm reception by French critics, it failed to interest North American distributors.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nFellini won the ''[[Praemium Imperiale]]'', the equivalent of the [[Nobel Prize]] in the visual arts, awarded by the Japan Art Association in 1990.<ref>Kezich, p. 387. The award covers five disciplines: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and theatre/film.

Finding it increasingly difficult to secure financing for feature films, Fellini developed a suite of television projects whose titles reflect their subjects: ''Attore'', ''Napoli'', ''L\u2019Inferno'', ''L'opera lirica'', and ''L\u2019America''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1993 Fellini received his fifth [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], for lifetime achievement, \"in recognition of his cinematic accomplishments that have thrilled and entertained audiences worldwide\". On 16 June, he entered the Cantonal Hospital in [[Zurich]] for an [[angioplasty]] on his [[femoral artery]]<ref>Kezich, p. 396</ref> but suffered a [[stroke]] at the Grand Hotel in Rimini two months later.

The band has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling bands]]. In 1998, select members of Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_27061998/fleetwood-mac-drummer-steps-out-front-photo-show|title=Fleetwood Mac drummer steps out front with photo show|first=Ray|last=Mark Rinaldi|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=5 December 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> In 2018, the band was declared [[MusiCares Person of the Year]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8096584/stevie-nicks-fleetwood-mac-grammy-awards-musicares-person-of-the-year-tom-petty|title=Fleetwood Mac Honored by Lorde, Miley Cyrus, Harry Styles & More at 2018 MusiCares Person of the Year Gala|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band was founded by guitarist [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]], drummer [[Mick Fleetwood]] and guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]]. They lacked a permanent bass player for the first few months before Green convinced [[John McVie]] to join, establishing the first official line-up in time to record their [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]]. [[Danny Kirwan]] joined as a third guitarist in 1968. Keyboardist [[Christine McVie|Christine Perfect]], who contributed as a session musician starting with the second album, married John McVie and joined the band in 1970. At this time the band was primarily a [[British blues]] outfit, scoring a UK number one with \"[[Albatross (instrumental)|Albatross]]\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Fleetwood Mac Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/fleetwood-mac/biography|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref> and had lesser hits with the singles \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\" and \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\". Personal problems led to original guitarists Green and Spencer leaving, to be replaced by [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]] and [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]]. By 1974 Welch and Weston had both departed, leaving the band without a primary male vocalist or lead guitarist.\n\nIn late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he was introduced to folk-rock duo [[Lindsey Buckingham]] and [[Stevie Nicks]]. Fleetwood Mac soon asked Buckingham to be their new lead guitarist, and Buckingham agreed on condition that Nicks would also join the band. The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more [[pop rock]]/[[folk rock]] sound and their 1975 self-titled album, ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|Fleetwood Mac]]'', reached No. 1 in the US. ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977), Fleetwood Mac's second album after the arrival of Buckingham and Nicks, produced four US Top 10 singles and remained at No. 1 on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in various countries around the world. ''Rumours'' has sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it the [[list of best-selling albums|eighth-highest-selling album to date]]. The band went through personal turmoil while recording the album as both the romantic partnerships in the band (John & Christine McVie and Buckingham & Nicks) separated, although the band continued making music together.\n\nThe line-up remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. The first to leave was Buckingham, followed by Nicks in 1991, to be replaced by a series of short-term guitarists and vocalists. In 1993 a one-off performance for the Presidential Inauguration of [[Bill Clinton]] featured the five central members back together for the first time in six years, and in 1997 a full reunion occurred. In 1998 Christine McVie retired from touring. The band stayed together as a four-piece consisting of John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. In 2014 Christine McVie rejoined full-time. The latest studio album by the band was 2003's ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]''. A side project known as ''[[Lindsey Buckingham Christine McVie]]'' was released in 2017, containing contributions from the other band members except Nicks. In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-fires-lindsey-buckingham-w518925|title=Fleetwood Mac Fires Lindsey Buckingham|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], formerly of [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], and [[Neil Finn]] of [[Split Enz]] and [[Crowded House]].\n\n==History==\n===1967\u20131970: Formation and early years===\n[[File:Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Green, 18 March 1970]]\nFleetwood Mac were formed in July 1967 in London, England, when Peter Green left the [[British blues]] band [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]].

London: Omnibus Press. p18</ref> John Mayall agreed and Fleetwood joined the Bluesbreakers.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers now consisted of Green, Fleetwood, John McVie and Mayall. Mayall gave Green free recording time as a gift, in which Fleetwood, McVie and Green recorded five songs. The fifth song was an instrumental that Green named after the rhythm section, \"Fleetwood Mac\".\n\nSoon after this, Green suggested to Fleetwood that they form a new band. The pair wanted McVie on bass guitar and named the band 'Fleetwood Mac' to entice him, but McVie opted to keep his steady income with Mayall rather than take a risk with a new band. In the meantime Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood had teamed up with slide guitarist [[Jeremy Spencer]] and bassist [[Bob Brunning]]. Brunning was in the band on the understanding that he would leave if McVie agreed to join. The Green, Fleetwood, Spencer, Brunning version of the band made its debut on 13 August 1967 at the Windsor Jazz and Blues Festival as 'Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac', also featuring Jeremy Spencer. Brunning played only a few gigs with Fleetwood Mac.<ref name=\"McStravickRoos2001\">{{cite book|author1=Summer McStravick|author2=John Roos|title=Blues-rock Explosion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLoQAQAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Old Goat Publishing|isbn=978-0-9701332-7-4}}</ref> Within weeks of this show, John McVie agreed to join the band as permanent bassist.<ref name=\"Darlington2001\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Darlington|title=I was Elvis Presley's Bastard Love-child & Other Stories of Rock'n'roll Excess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQtyBSE6risC&pg=PA67|year=2001|publisher=Critical Vision|isbn=978-1-900486-17-0|pages=67\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Petersen2011\">{{cite book|author=Holger Petersen|title=Talking Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ9GlMzNNVwC&pg=PA93|date=30 September 2011|publisher=Insomniac Press|isbn=978-1-55483-058-9|pages=93\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFleetwood Mac's [[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|self-titled debut album]] was a no-frills blues album and was released by the [[Blue Horizon]] label in February 1968.<ref name=\"Inc.1969\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KygEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4|date=24 May 1969|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=4\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were no other players on the album (except on the song \"Long Grey Mare\", which was recorded with Brunning on bass).

He was recruited from the South London blues trio Boilerhouse, which consisted of Kirwan on guitar, Trevor Stevens on bass and Dave Terrey on drums.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rawlings|first=Terry|title=Then, now and rare British Beat 1960\u20131969|year=2002|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-9094-8|page=77}}</ref> Green and Fleetwood had watched Boilerhouse rehearse in a basement boiler-room and Green had been so impressed that he invited the band to play support slots for Fleetwood Mac. Green wanted Boilerhouse to become a professional band but Stevens and Terrey were not prepared to turn professional, so Green tried to find another rhythm section for Kirwan by placing an ad in [[Melody Maker]]. There were over 300 applicants, but when Green and Fleetwood ran auditions at the Nag's Head in Battersea (home of the [[Mike Vernon (producer)|Mike Vernon]] [[Blue Horizon]] Club) the hard-to-please Green could not find anyone good enough, so he invited Kirwan to join Fleetwood Mac as a third guitarist.<ref name=\"Brunning p18\" />\n\nGreen had been frustrated that Jeremy Spencer had little desire to contribute to his songs. Kirwan, a self-taught guitarist, had a signature vibrato and a unique style that added a new dimension to an already complete band. With Kirwan in the band they released their first number one single in Europe, \"Albatross\", on which Kirwan duetted with Green. Green said later that the success of 'Albatross' was thanks to Kirwan. \"If it wasn't for Danny, I would never had had a number one hit record.\" <ref name=\"vaudeville\">{{cite AV media notes|others= Fleetwood Mac |title= The Vaudeville Years |titlelink= The Vaudeville Years |type= CD booklet notes |year= 1998 |publisher= Receiver Records }}</ref> Around this time they released the compilation album ''[[English Rose (album)|English Rose]]'', which contained half of ''Mr. Wonderful'', new songs from Kirwan. Their second compilation album,''[[The Pious Bird of Good Omen]]'', contained a collection of singles, B-sides and a selection of work the band had done with [[Eddie Boyd]].\n\nThe band went to the United States in January 1969 and recorded many songs at the soon-to-close [[Chess Records]] Studio with some of the blues legends of Chicago, including [[Willie Dixon]], [[Buddy Guy]] and [[Otis Spann]]. These would be Fleetwood Mac's last all-blues recordings. Along with the change of style the band was also going through label changes. Up until that point they had been on the Blue Horizon label, but with Kirwan in the band the musical possibilities had become too diverse for a blues-only label. The band signed with [[Immediate Records]] and released the single \"[[Man of the World (song)|Man of the World]]\", which became another British and European hit. For the B-side Spencer fronted Fleetwood Mac as \"Earl Vince and the Valiants\" and recorded \"[[Somebody's Gonna Get Their Head Kicked In Tonite]]\", typifying the more raucous rock 'n' roll side of the band. Immediate Records was in bad shape, however, and the band shopped around for a new deal. [[The Beatles]] wanted the band on [[Apple Records]] (Mick Fleetwood and [[George Harrison]] were brothers-in-law), but the band's manager [[Clifford Davis (musician)|Clifford Davis]] decided to go with [[Warner Bros. Records]] (through [[Reprise Records]], a [[Frank Sinatra]]-founded label), the label they have stayed with ever since.\n\nUnder the wing of Reprise Fleetwood Mac released their third studio album, ''[[Then Play On]]'', in September 1969. Although the initial pressing of the American release of this album was the same as the British version, it was altered to contain the song \"[[Oh Well (song)|Oh Well]]\", which featured consistently in live performances from the time of its release through 1997 and again starting in 2009. ''Then Play On'', the band's first rock album, featured only the songs of Kirwan and Green. Jeremy Spencer, meanwhile, had recorded a [[Jeremy Spencer (album)|solo album]] of 1950s-style rock and roll songs, backed by the rest of the band.\n\nIn July 1969 Fleetwood Mac opened for [[Ten Years After]] at the [[Schaefer Music Festival]] at New York City's [[Wollman Rink]]. They appeared at the festival again in 1970.\n\nBy 1970 Peter Green, the frontman of the band, was not in good shape. He had taken [[LSD]] at a hippie commune in Munich, which may have contributed to the onset of [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Celmins| first = Martin| title = Peter Green: Founder of Fleetwood Mac| publisher = Castle| isbn = 1-898141-13-4}}</ref> Clifford Davis, quoted by Bob Brunning, said: \"The truth about Peter Green and how he ended up how he did is very simple. We were touring Europe in late 1969. When we were in Germany, Peter told me he had been invited to a party. I knew there were going to be a lot of drugs around and I suggested that he didn't go. But he went anyway and I understand from him that he.... took what turned out to be very bad, impure LSD. He was never the same again.\" .<ref>Brunning, B (1998): Fleetwood Mac&nbsp;\u2013 The First 30 Years. London: Omnibus Press. p28</ref> German author and filmmaker [[Rainer Langhans]] stated in his autobiography that he and [[Uschi Obermaier]] met Green in Munich and invited him to their Highfisch-Kommune, where the drinks were spiked with acid.<ref name=\"High-Fish\">{{cite web |title=Fellowship for Intentional Community/High-Fish Commune|url=https://www.ic.org/wiki/high-fish-commune|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref> Langhans and Obermaier were planning to organise an open-air \"Bavarian Woodstock\" at which they wanted [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] to be the main acts, and they hoped Green would help them to get in contact with The Rolling Stones.<ref name=\"High-Fish\" />\n\nGreen's last hit with Fleetwood Mac was \"[[The Green Manalishi|The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Prong Crown)]]\" (first recorded at the [[Boston Tea Party (concert venue)|Boston Tea Party]] in February 1970 and later recorded by [[Judas Priest]]). This recording was released as Green's mental stability deteriorated. He wanted to give all of the band's money to charity, but the other members of the band disagreed and Green left the band. His last show with Fleetwood Mac was on 20 May 1970. During that show the band went past their allotted time and the power was shut off, although Mick Fleetwood kept drumming. Some of the Boston Tea Party recordings (5/6/7 February 1970) were eventually released in the 1980s as the ''[[Live in Boston (Fleetwood Mac album)|Live in Boston]]'' album. A more complete remastered 3-volume compilation was released by [[Snapper Music]] in the late 1990s.\n\n===1970\u20131974: Transitional era===\nKirwan and Spencer were left with the task of replacing Green in their live shows and on their recordings. In September 1970 Fleetwood Mac released their fourth studio album, ''[[Kiln House]].'' Kirwan's songs on the album moved the band in the direction of rock, while Spencer's contributions focused on re-creating the country-tinged \"Sun Sound\" of the late 1950s. Christine Perfect, who had retired from the music business after one unsuccessful solo album, contributed to ''Kiln House'', singing backup vocals and playing keyboards. She also drew the album cover. Since Fleetwood Mac were progressing and developing a new sound, Perfect was asked to join the band. They released a single, Danny Kirwan's \"[[Dragonfly (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dragonfly]]\" b/w \"The Purple Dancer\" in the UK and certain European countries, but despite good notices in the press it was not a success. The B-side has been reissued only once, on a [[Reprise Records|Reprise]] German and Dutch-only \"Best of\" album, making it one of their most obscure songs.\n\n[[File:mysteryband2.jpg|thumb|1973 line-up with Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Bob Weston, John McVie, and Bob Welch.]]\nChristine Perfect, who by this point had married bassist John McVie, made her first appearance with the band as Christine McVie at [[Bristol University]], England, in May 1969, just as she was leaving Chicken Shack. She had had success with the [[Etta James]] classic \"I'd Rather Go Blind\" and was twice voted female artist of the year in England. Christine McVie played her first gig as an official member of Fleetwood Mac on 6 August 1970 in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana. [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], which now owned Blue Horizon (except in the US and Canada), released the band's fifth compilation album, ''[[The Original Fleetwood Mac]]'', containing previously unreleased material. The album was relatively successful, and the band continued to gain popularity.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nWhile on tour in February 1971, Jeremy Spencer said he was going out to \"get a magazine\", but never returned. After several days of frantic searching the band discovered that Spencer had joined a religious group, the [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fong-Torres|first1=Ben|title=Fleetwood Mac Stolen Away:Guitarist Jeremy Spencer leaves the band mysteriously just before their American tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/fleetwood-mac-stolen-away-19710318|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=14 February 2017}}</ref> The band were liable for the remaining shows on the tour and asked Peter Green to step in as a replacement. Green brought along his friend [[Nigel Watson]], who played the [[congas]]. (Twenty-five years later Green and Watson collaborated again to form the [[Peter Green Splinter Group]].) Green was only back with Fleetwood Mac temporarily and the band began a search for a new guitarist.<ref>SPL 1046 Stony Plain Records LP \"White Skies\" 1981 liner notes</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1971 the band held auditions for a replacement guitarist at their large country home, \"Benifold\", which they had jointly bought with their manager Davis for \u00a323,000 ({{Inflation|UK|23000|1970|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) prior to the ''Kiln House'' tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/benifold.htm|title=Benifold|website=''fleetwoodmac.net''}}</ref> A friend of the band, Judy Wong, recommended her high school friend [[Bob Welch (musician)|Bob Welch]], who was living in [[Paris]], France, at the time. The band held a few meetings with Welch and decided to hire him, without actually playing with him or listening to any of his recordings.\n\nIn September 1971 the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Future Games]]''. As a result of Welch's arrival and Spencer's departure the album was different from anything they had done up to that point, and there were many new fans in America who were becoming interested in the band. In Europe CBS released Fleetwood Mac's first [[Greatest Hits (1971 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]] album, which mostly consisted of songs by Peter Green, with one song by Spencer and one by Kirwan.\n\nIn 1972, six months after the release of ''Future Games'', the band released their sixth studio album, ''[[Bare Trees]]''. Mostly composed by Kirwan, ''Bare Trees'' featured the Welch-penned single \"[[Sentimental Lady]]\", which would be a much bigger hit for Welch five years later when he re-recorded it for his solo album ''[[French Kiss (Bob Welch album)|French Kiss]]'', backed by Mick Fleetwood and Christine McVie. It also featured \"Spare Me a Little of Your Love\", a bright Christine McVie song that became a staple of the band's live act throughout the early to mid-1970s.\n\nWhile the band was doing well in the studio, their tours turned out to be problematic. Danny Kirwan had developed an alcohol dependency and was becoming alienated from Welch and the McVies. When Kirwan smashed his Gibson [[Les Paul Custom]] guitar before a concert, refused to go on stage and criticised the band afterwards, Fleetwood fired him.<ref name=\"brunning\">{{cite book | authorlink=Bob Brunning | first=Bob | last=Brunning | title=Fleetwood Mac: Behind the Masks | publisher=New English Library | year=1990 | location=London | isbn=0-450-53116-3 | oclc=22242160}}</ref>\n\nThe next two and a half years for Fleetwood Mac turned out to be their most challenging and difficult. In the three albums they released in this period they constantly changed line-ups. In September 1972 the band added guitarist [[Bob Weston (guitarist)|Bob Weston]] and vocalist [[Dave Walker]], formerly of [[Savoy Brown]] and [[The Idle Race|Idle Race]].<ref name=\"Music Legends\">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-walker-interview-black-sabbath/|title=Dave Walker Interview| accessdate=6 May 2013|date=30 December 2011|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> Bob Weston was well known as a slide guitarist and had known the band from his touring period with [[Long John Baldry]]. Fleetwood Mac also hired Savoy Brown's road manager, John Courage. Fleetwood, The McVies, Welch, Weston and Walker recorded the band's seventh studio album, ''[[Penguin (album)|Penguin]]'', which was released in January 1973. After the tour the band fired Walker because they felt his vocal style and attitude did not fit well with the rest of the band.\n\nThe remaining five members carried on and recorded the band's eighth studio album, ''[[Mystery to Me]]'', six months later. This album contained Welch's song \"[[Hypnotized (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hypnotized]]\", which received a great amount of airplay on the radio and became one of the band's most successful songs to date in the US. The band was proud of the new album and anticipated that it would be a smash hit. Despite this success there were problems behind the scenes. The McVies' marriage was under a lot of stress, which was aggravated by their constant working with each other by and John McVie's considerable [[alcohol abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=\"McVie, John.\" Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed.|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/epm/18632|website=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref> During the tour Weston had an affair with Fleetwood's wife [[Jenny Boyd|Jenny Boyd Fleetwood]], the sister of [[Pattie Boyd|Pattie Boyd Harrison]]. Courage fired Weston and the tour was cancelled. The lack of touring meant that the album sold less well than the previous one.\n\n===1974: Tour by a fake \"Fleetwood Mac\"===\nIn 1974 the band's manager, Clifford Davis, claimed that he owned the name Fleetwood Mac and recruited members of a band called Legs (which had recently issued one single under Davis' management)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/k16317|title=45cat \u2013 Legs \u2013 So Many Faces / You Bet You Have \u2013 Warner Bros. \u2013 UK \u2013 K 16317|work=''45cat.com''}}</ref> to tour as Fleetwood Mac.\n\nThe bogus Fleetwood Mac consisted of [[Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera|Elmer Gantry]] (vocals, guitar), [[Kirby Gregory]] (guitar), [[Paul Martinez]] (bass), John Wilkinson (keyboards) and Australian-born drummer Craig Collinge (formerly of the Librettos, [[Procession (band)|Procession]] and [[Third World War (band)|Third World War]]). The members of this group had apparently been told that Mick Fleetwood would join them on later dates, and claimed that Fleetwood had been involved in the early planning stages of the tour before dropping out.<ref name=\"Fake Mac\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paulmartinezmusic.com/ |title=Paul Martinez Homepage |accessdate=30 January 2015 |publisher=paulmartinezmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nAs the tour got under way, Fleetwood Mac's road manager John Courage realised that the line-up was not authentic. Courage ended up hiding the real Fleetwood Mac's equipment, helping to shorten the tour by the bogus band which soon dissolved. The lawsuit that followed regarding who actually owned the rights to the band name \"Fleetwood Mac\" put the real Fleetwood Mac out of action for almost a year. Although the band was named after Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, they had apparently signed contracts in which they had forfeited the rights to the name.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the fake Fleetwood Mac, nobody from that lineup was ever officially made a part of the real Fleetwood Mac, although some of them later acted as Danny Kirwan's studio band. Gantry and Gregory went on to become members of [[Stretch (band)|Stretch]], whose 1975 UK hit single \"Why Did You Do It\" was written about the fake Fleetwood Mac touring debacle.<ref name=\"Fake Mac\"/> Gantry later collaborated with [[The Alan Parsons Project]]. Martinez, meanwhile, went on to play with the [[Deep Purple]] offshoot [[Paice Ashton Lord]], as well as [[Robert Plant]]'s backing band.\n\n===1974: Return of the real Fleetwood Mac===\nDuring the fake Fleetwood Mac months, Welch stayed in [[Los Angeles]] and connected with entertainment attorneys. He swiftly realised that the band was being neglected by Warner Bros and that they would need to change their base of operation from England to America, to which the rest of the band agreed. Rock promoter [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] wrote a letter to Warner Bros to convince them that the real Fleetwood Mac was, in fact, Fleetwood, Welch, and the McVies. This did not end the legal battle but the band was able to record as Fleetwood Mac again. Instead of hiring another manager, Fleetwood Mac decided to manage themselves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn September 1974 Fleetwood Mac signed a new recording contract with Warner Bros, but remained on the Reprise label. The band released their ninth studio album, ''[[Heroes Are Hard to Find]],'' in September 1974 and, for the first time in its history, the band had only one guitarist. While on tour they added a second keyboardist, Doug Graves, who had been an engineer on ''Heroes Are Hard to Find''. In late 1974 Graves was preparing to become a permanent member of the band by the end of their US tour. He said:\n\n{{quote|\"I'm looking forward to adding something to this already great band. I helped engineer their album 'Heroes Are Hard to Find' and got to know each member well. It came to me as a shock when Mick asked me to join but I am enjoying playing live with the band, and hopefully will start a new studio album with the band soon.\"}}\n\nHowever, Graves did not ultimately join full-time. In 1980, Christine McVie explained the decision:\n\n{{quote| \"He (Doug Graves) was there to back me up, but I think it was decided after the first two or three concerts that I was better off without him. The band wanted me to expand my role and have a little more freedom, so he played some organ behind me, but he didn't play the same way I did.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doerschuk|first1=Bob|title=Contemporary Keyboard (10/1980), Christine McVie|url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=11&c=2|website=The Blue Letter Archives|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>}}\n\nRobert (\"Bobby\") Hunt, who had been in the band Head West with Bob Welch back in 1970, replaced Graves. Neither musician proved to be a long-term addition to the line-up. Welch left soon after the tour ended (on 5 December 1974 at Cal State University), having grown tired of touring and legal struggles. Nevertheless, the tour had enabled the ''Heroes'' album to reach a higher position on the American charts than any of the band's previous records.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP--><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discog.fleetwoodmac.net/discog.php?pid=80|title=Heroes Are Hard To Find \u2013  Fleetwood Mac|last=Adelson|first=Martin E.|website=discog.fleetwoodmac.net|access-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===1975\u20131987: Addition of Buckingham and Nicks leads to mainstream success===\nAfter Welch announced that he was leaving the band, Fleetwood began searching for a replacement. While Fleetwood was checking out [[Sound City Studios]] in Los Angeles the house engineer, Keith Olsen, played him a track he had recorded in the studio, \"Frozen Love\", from the album ''[[Buckingham Nicks]]'' (1973). Fleetwood liked it and was introduced to the guitarist from the band, [[Lindsey Buckingham]], who was at Sound City that day recording demos. Fleetwood asked him to join Fleetwood Mac and Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his music partner and girlfriend, [[Stevie Nicks]], be included. Buckingham and Nicks joined the band on New Year's Eve 1974, within four weeks of the previous incarnation splitting.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lindsey Buckingham|url=http://www.fleetwoodmac.net/penguin/lindsey.htm|publisher=Fleetwoodmac.net|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Behind the Music Remastered: Fleetwood Mac|url=http://www.vh1.com/video/behind-the-music-remastered/full-episodes/behind-the-music-remastered-fleetwood-mac/1654105/playlist.jhtml|publisher=VH1|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the new line-up released [[Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)|another self-titled album]], their tenth studio album. The album was a breakthrough for the band and became a huge hit, reaching No.1 in the US and selling over 5 million copies. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's \"[[Over My Head (Fleetwood Mac song)|Over My Head]]\" and \"[[Say You Love Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Say You Love Me]]\" and Stevie Nicks' \"[[Rhiannon (song)|Rhiannon]]\", as well as the much-played album track \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\", a live rendition of which became a hit twenty years later on ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'' album.\n{{Listen|filename=Landslide by Fleetwood Mac.ogg|title=\"Landslide\" (Fleetwood Mac)|description=17 second sample from Fleetwood Mac's song \"Landslide\".| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn 1976 the band was suffering severe stress. With success came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as Buckingham and Nicks' long term romantic relationship. Fleetwood was in the midst of divorce proceedings from his wife Jenny. The pressure on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-up album, combined with their new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions which were allegedly fuelled by high consumption of drugs and alcohol.<ref name=\"Rock Nuns\">{{cite web |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Fleetwood Mac's Stevie and Christine: 'We were like rock'n'roll nuns' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/12/fleetwood-mac-stevie-nicks-christine-mcvie-nuns |website=The Guardian |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band's eleventh studio album, ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (the band's first release on the main Warner label after Reprise was retired and all of its acts were reassigned to the parent label), was released in the spring of 1977. In this album the band members laid bare the emotional turmoil they were experiencing at the time. ''Rumours'' was critically acclaimed and won the [[Grammy]] Award for Album of the Year in 1977. The album generated multiple Top Ten singles, including Buckingham's \"[[Go Your Own Way]]\", Nicks' US No.1 \"[[Dreams (Fleetwood Mac song)|Dreams]]\" ({{audio|Dreams by Fleetwood Mac.ogg|sample}}) and Christine McVie's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" and \"[[You Make Loving Fun]]\". Buckingham's \"[[Second Hand News]]\", Nicks' \"[[Gold Dust Woman]]\" and \"[[The Chain]]\" (the only song written by all five band members) also received significant radio airplay. By 2003 ''Rumours'' had sold over 19 million copies in the US alone (certified as a [[diamond album]] by the [[RIAA]]) and a total of 40 million copies worldwide, bringing it to eighth on the [[list of best-selling albums]]. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with a lucrative tour.\n\nOn 10 October 1979, Fleetwood Mac were honoured with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry at 6608 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/fleetwood-mac|title=Fleetwood Mac {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=www.walkoffame.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/fleetwood-mac/|title=Fleetwood Mac|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nBuckingham convinced Fleetwood to let his work on their next album be more experimental, and to be allowed to work on tracks at home before bringing them to the rest of the band in the studio. The result of this, the band's twelfth studio album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', was a 20-track double album released in 1979. It produced three hit singles: Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Tusk (song)|Tusk]]\" (US No. 8), which featured the [[Spirit of Troy|USC Trojan Marching Band]], Christine McVie's \"[[Think About Me]]\" (US No. 20), and Stevie Nicks' 6\u00bd minute opus \"[[Sara (Fleetwood Mac song)|Sara]]\" (US No. 7). \"Sara\" was cut to 4\u00bd minutes for both the hit single and the first CD-release of the album, but the unedited version has since been restored on the [[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|1988 greatest hits compilation]], the 2004 reissue of ''Tusk''  and Fleetwood Mac's 2002 release of ''[[The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac]]''. Original guitarist Peter Green also took part in the sessions of ''Tusk'', although his playing on the Christine McVie track \"Brown Eyes\" is not credited on the album.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=214}}</ref>\n\n''Tusk'' sold four million copies worldwide. Fleetwood blamed the album's relative lack of success on the [[RKO General|RKO]] radio chain having played the album in its entirety prior to release, thereby allowing mass home taping.<ref>{{cite book| title=My Life and Adventures in Fleetwood Mac|last=Davis|first=Stephen|year=1991|page=219}}</ref>\n\nThe band embarked on an 11-month tour to support and promote ''Tusk''. They travelled across the world, including the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In Germany they shared the bill with reggae superstar [[Bob Marley]]. On this world tour the band recorded music for their first [[Live (Fleetwood Mac album)|live album]], which was released at the end of 1980.\n\nThe band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Mirage (Fleetwood Mac album)|Mirage]]'', was released in 1982. Following 1981 solo albums by Nicks (''[[Bella Donna (album)|Bella Donna]]''), Fleetwood (''[[The Visitor (Mick Fleetwood album)|The Visitor]]''), and Buckingham (''[[Law and Order (album)|Law and Order]]''), there was a return to a more conventional approach. Buckingham had been chided by critics, fellow band members and music business managers for the lesser commercial success of ''Tusk''. Recorded at [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] in France and produced by [[Richard Dashut]], ''Mirage'' was an attempt to recapture the huge success of ''Rumours''. Its hits included Christine McVie's \"[[Hold Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Hold Me]]\" and \"[[Love in Store]]\" (co-written by [[Robbie Patton]] and Jim Recor, respectively), Stevie Nicks' \"[[Gypsy (Fleetwood Mac song)|Gypsy]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Oh Diane]]\", which made the Top 10 in the UK. A minor hit was also scored by Buckingham's \"Eyes Of The World\" and \"[[Can't Go Back (Fleetwood Mac song)|Can't Go Back]]\".\n\nIn contrast to the [[Tusk Tour]] the band only embarked on a short tour of 18 American cities, the [[Los Angeles]] show being recorded and released on video. They also headlined the first [[US Festival]], on 5 September 1982, for which the band was paid $500,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1982|r=0}}}} today). ''Mirage'' was certified double platinum in the US.\n\nFollowing ''Mirage'' the band went on hiatus, which allowed members to pursue solo careers. Stevie Nicks released two more solo albums (1983's ''[[The Wild Heart (album)|The Wild Heart]]'' and 1985's ''[[Rock a Little]]''). Lindsey Buckingham issued ''[[Go Insane (album)|Go Insane]]'' in 1984, the same year that Christine McVie made an [[Christine McVie (album)|eponymous album]] (yielding the Top 10 hit \"[[Got a Hold on Me]]\" and the Top 40 hit \"[[Love Will Show Us How]]\"). All three met with success, Nicks being the most popular. During this period Mick Fleetwood had filed for bankruptcy, Nicks was admitted to the [[Betty Ford Clinic]] for addiction problems and John McVie had suffered an addiction-related seizure, all of which were attributed to the lifestyle of excess afforded to them by their worldwide success. It was rumoured that Fleetwood Mac had disbanded, but Buckingham commented that he was unhappy to allow ''Mirage'' to remain as the band's last effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bla.fleetwoodmac.net/index.php?page=index_v2&id=785&c=18 |title=Fleetwood Mac: Return Without Leaving |work=[[Creem]] |last=Kordosh |first=J. |date=September 1987}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rumours'' line-up of Fleetwood Mac recorded one more album, their fourteenth studio album, ''[[Tango in the Night]]'', in 1987. As with various other Fleetwood Mac albums, the material started off as a Buckingham solo album before becoming a group project. The album went on to become their best-selling release since ''Rumours'', especially in the UK where it hit No. 1 three times in the following year. The album sold three million copies in the USA and contained four hits: Christine McVie's \"[[Little Lies]]\" and \"[[Everywhere (Fleetwood Mac song)|Everywhere]]\" ('Everywhere' being co-written with McVie's new husband Eddy Quintela), [[Sandy Stewart (musician)|Sandy Stewart]] and Stevie Nicks' \"[[Seven Wonders (song)|Seven Wonders]]\", and Lindsey Buckingham's \"[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]\". \"[[Family Man (Fleetwood Mac song)|Family Man]]\" (Buckingham and [[Richard Dashut]]), and \"[[Isn't It Midnight]]\" (Christine McVie), were also released as singles, with less success.\n\n===1987\u20131995: Departure of Buckingham and Nicks===\nWith a ten-week tour scheduled, Buckingham held back at the last minute, saying he felt his creativity was being stifled. A group meeting at Christine McVie's house on 7 August 1987 resulted in turmoil. Tensions were coming to a head. Mick Fleetwood said in his autobiography that there was a physical altercation between Buckingham and Nicks. Buckingham left the band the following day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} After Buckingham's departure Fleetwood Mac added two new guitarists to the band, [[Billy Burnette]] and [[Rick Vito]], again without auditions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ressner|first1=Jeffrey|title=Lindsey Buckingham Leaves Fleetwood Mac|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lindsey-buckingham-leaves-fleetwood-mac-19870924|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBurnette was the son of [[Dorsey Burnette]] and nephew of [[Johnny Burnette]], both of [[The Rock and Roll Trio]]. He had already worked with Mick Fleetwood in Zoo, with Christine McVie as part of her solo band, had done some session work with Stevie Nicks, and backed Lindsey Buckingham on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Fleetwood and Christine McVie had played on his ''Try Me'' album in 1985. Vito, a Peter Green admirer, had played with many artists from [[Bonnie Raitt]] to John Mayall, and worked with John McVie on two Mayall albums.\n\nThe 1987\u201388 \"Shake the Cage\" tour was the first outing for this line-up. It was successful enough to warrant the release of a concert video, entitled \"Tango in the Night\", which was filmed at San Francisco's [[Cow Palace]] arena in December 1987.\n\nCapitalising on the success of ''Tango in the Night'', the band released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in 1988. It featured singles from the 1975\u20131988 era and included two new compositions, \"[[No Questions Asked (Fleetwood Mac song)|No Questions Asked]]\" written by Nicks and \"[[As Long as You Follow]]\", written by McVie and Quintela. 'As Long as You Follow' was released as a single in 1988 but only made No. 43 in the US and No.66 in the UK, although it reached No.1 on the US Adult Contemporary charts. The ''Greatest Hits'' album, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US (though it has since sold over 8 million copies there) was dedicated by the band to Buckingham, with whom they were now reconciled.\n\nIn 1990 Fleetwood Mac released their fifteenth studio album, ''[[Behind the Mask (album)|Behind the Mask]]''. With this album the band veered away from the stylised sound that Buckingham had evolved during his tenure in the band (which was also evident in his solo work) and developed a more [[adult contemporary]] style with producer [[Greg Ladanyi]]. The album yielded only one Top 40 hit, McVie's \"[[Save Me (Fleetwood Mac song)|Save Me]]\". ''Behind the Mask'' only achieved [[RIAA certification|Gold]] album status in the US, peaking at No.18 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, though it entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 1. It received mixed reviews and was seen by some music critics as a low point for the band in the absence of Lindsey Buckingham (who had actually made a guest appearance playing on the title track). But ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that Vito and Burnette were \"the best thing to ever happen to Fleetwood Mac\" and the British ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine praised the album. The subsequent \"Behind the Mask\" tour saw the band play sold-out shows at London's Wembley Stadium. In the final show in Los Angeles, Buckingham joined the band on stage. The two women of the band, McVie and Nicks, had decided that the tour would be their last (McVie's father had died during the tour), although both stated that they would still record with the band. In 1991, however, Nicks and Rick Vito announced they were leaving Fleetwood Mac altogether.\n\nIn 1992 Mick Fleetwood arranged a 4-disc box set, spanning highlights from the band's 25-year history, entitled ''[[25 Years \u2013 The Chain]]'' (an edited 2-disc set was also available). A notable inclusion in the box set was \"[[Silver Springs (song)|Silver Springs]]\", a Stevie Nicks composition that was recorded during the ''Rumours'' sessions but was omitted from the album and used as the B-side of \"Go Your Own Way\". Nicks had requested use of this track for her 1991 best-of compilation ''TimeSpace'', but Fleetwood had refused as he had planned to include it in this collection as a rarity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The disagreement between Nicks and Fleetwood garnered press coverage and was believed to have been the main reason for Nicks leaving the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Spanos |first1=Brittany |title=\u2018Silver Springs\u2019: Inside Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Great Lost Breakup Anthem |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/silver-springs-inside-fleetwood-macs-great-lost-breakup-anthem-201303/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}</ref> The box set also included a new Stevie Nicks/Rick Vito composition, \"[[Paper Doll (Fleetwood Mac song)|Paper Doll]]\", which was released in the US as a single. As both members had left the band by this point, the track was presumably a leftover from the ''Behind the Mask'' sessions. There were also two new Christine McVie compositions, \"Heart of Stone\" and [[Love Shines (song)|\"Love Shines]]\". \"Love Shines\" was released as a single in the UK and elsewhere. Lindsey Buckingham also contributed a new song, \"Make Me a Mask\", which sounded like a Buckingham studio creation with no input from other band members. Mick Fleetwood also released a deluxe hardcover companion book to coincide with the release of the box set, entitled ''My 25 Years in Fleetwood Mac''. The volume featured notes written by Fleetwood detailing the band's 25-year history and many rare photographs.\n\nThe Buckingham/Nicks/McVie/McVie/Fleetwood line-up reunited in 1993 at the request of US President [[Bill Clinton]] for his first [[United States presidential inaugural balls|Inaugural Ball]]. Clinton had made Fleetwood Mac's \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\" his campaign theme song. His request for it to be performed at the Inauguration Ball was met with enthusiasm by the band, although this line-up had no intention of reuniting again.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Andy|title=Flashback: Fleetwood Mac Reunite for Bill Clinton's Inauguration|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-fleetwood-mac-reunite-for-bill-clintons-inauguration-20130122|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nInspired by the new interest in the band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Christine McVie recorded another album as Fleetwood Mac, with Billy Burnette taking lead guitar duties. Burnette left in March 1993 to record a country album and pursue an acting career and [[Bekka Bramlett]], who had worked a year earlier with Mick Fleetwood's Zoo, was recruited to take his place. Solo singer-songwriter/guitarist and [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Dave Mason]], who had worked with Bekka's parents [[Delaney & Bonnie]] twenty-five years earlier, was subsequently added. In March 1994 Billy Burnette, himself a good friend and co-songwriter with [[Delaney Bramlett]], returned to the band with Fleetwood's blessing.\n\nThe band, minus Christine McVie, toured in 1994, opening for [[Crosby, Stills, & Nash]] and in 1995 as part of a package with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[Pat Benatar]]. This tour saw the band perform classic Fleetwood Mac songs from their 1967\u20131974 era. In 1995, at a concert in Tokyo, the band was greeted by former member Jeremy Spencer, who performed a few songs with them.\n\nOn 10 October 1995 Fleetwood Mac released their sixteenth studio album, ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'', which was not a success. Although it hit the UK Top 60 for one week, the album had zero impact in the US. It failed even to graze the ''Billboard'' Top 200 albums chart, a stunning reversal for a band that had been a mainstay on that chart for most of the previous two decades. Shortly after the album's release, Christine McVie informed the band that the album would be her last. Bramlett and Burnette subsequently formed a [[country music]] duo, [[Bekka & Billy]].\n\n===1995\u20131997: Reformation===\nJust weeks after disbanding Fleetwood Mac, Mick Fleetwood announced that he was working with Lindsey Buckingham again. John McVie was added to the sessions, and later Christine McVie. Stevie Nicks also enlisted Lindsey Buckingham to produce a song for a soundtrack.\n\nIn May 1996 Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, and Stevie Nicks performed together at a private party in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]], prior to the [[Kentucky Derby]], with [[Steve Winwood]] filling in for Lindsey Buckingham. A week later the ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' film soundtrack was released, which featured the Stevie Nicks-Lindsey Buckingham duet \"[[Twisted (Stevie Nicks song)|Twisted]]\", with Mick Fleetwood on drums. This eventually led to a full reunion of the ''Rumours'' line-up. The band officially reformed in March 1997.\n\n===1997\u20132007: Reunion and Christine McVie's departure===\nThe regrouped Fleetwood Mac performed a live concert on a soundstage at [[Warner Bros.]] [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California, on 22 May 1997. The concert was recorded, and from this performance came the 1997 live album ''[[The Dance (Fleetwood Mac album)|The Dance]]'', which brought Fleetwood Mac back to the top of the US album charts for the first time in 10 years. ''The Dance'' returned Fleetwood Mac to a superstar status they had not enjoyed since ''Tango in the Night''. The album was certified a 5 million seller by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. A successful arena tour followed the [[MTV]] premiere of ''The Dance'' and kept the reunited Fleetwood Mac on the road throughout much of 1997, the 20th anniversary of ''Rumours''. With additional musicians Neale Heywood on guitar, Brett Tuggle on keyboards, [[Lenny Castro]] on percussion and Sharon Celani (who had toured with Fleetwood Mac in the late 1980s) and Mindy Stein on backing vocals, this would be the final appearance of the classic line-up including Christine McVie for 16 years. In 2015 Brett Tuggle, Neale Heywood, and Sharon Celani were still performing with Fleetwood Mac as touring musicians.\n\n[[File:Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.jpg|left|thumb|Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham on the ''Say You Will'' Tour, 2003]]\nIn 1998 Fleetwood Mac were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Members inducted included the original band, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Danny Kirwan, and ''Rumours''-era members Christine McVie, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham. Bob Welch was not included, despite his key role in keeping the band alive during the early 1970s. The ''Rumours''-era version of the band performed both at the induction ceremony and at the Grammy Awards program that year. Peter Green attended the induction ceremony but did not perform with his former bandmates, opting instead to perform his composition \"[[Black Magic Woman]]\" with [[Santana (band)|Santana]], who were inducted the same night. Neither Jeremy Spencer nor Danny Kirwan attended. Fleetwood Mac also received the \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award at the [[Brit Awards]] (British Phonographic Industry Awards) the same year.\n\nIn 1998 Christine McVie left the band. Her departure left Buckingham and Nicks to sing all the lead vocals for the band's seventeenth album, ''[[Say You Will (album)|Say You Will]]'', released in 2003, although Christine contributed some backing vocals and keyboards. The album debuted at No.3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart (No. 6 in the UK) and yielded chart hits with \"[[Peacekeeper (Fleetwood Mac song)|Peacekeeper]]\" and the title track, and a successful [[Say You Will Tour|world arena tour]] which lasted through 2004. The tour grossed $27,711,129 and was ranked No. 21 in the top 25 grossing tours of 2004.\n\nAround 2004\u201305 there were rumours of a reunion of the early line-up of Fleetwood Mac involving Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer.

His elder half-brother was the Elector [[Johann Cicero]] of Brandenburg. Friedrich succeeded his father as [[Margrave of Ansbach]] in 1486 and his younger brother [[Siegmund, Margrave of Bayreuth|Siegmund]] as [[Margrave of Bayreuth]] in 1495. \n\nAfter depleting the finances of the margraviate with his lavish lifestyle, Frederick I was deposed by his two elder sons, [[Kasimir, Margrave of Bayreuth|Casimir]] and [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach|George]], in 1515. He was then locked up at [[Plassenburg|Plassenburg Castle]] by his eldest son Casimir in a tower room from which he could not escape for 12 years. Thereupon, his son Casimir took up the rule of the Margraviate of Bayreuth (Kulmbach) and his son George took up the rule of the Margraviate of Ansbach. However, the overthrow of Frederick did outrage his other younger sons and led to far-reaching political countermeasures. When Elector [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim I of Brandenburg]] visited [[Kulmbach]] during his journey to [[Augsburg]], and wanted to plead for Frederick's release, he was nevertheless denied entry to Plassenburg Castle. The dispute was finally cleared when an agreement was reached in 1522, in which the demands of the younger sons of Frederick were met. \n\n==Family and children==\nOn 14 February 1479, at [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], Frederick I was married to Princess [[Sophia of Poland]] (6 April 1464 \u2013 5 October 1512), daughter of King [[Casimir IV of Poland]] by his wife [[Elizabeth of Austria (1436\u20131505)|Elisabeth of Austria]], and sister of King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]].

The past generations of F-Zero had \"piloted their way to fame\", so it is the only ''F-Zero'' game without [[Captain Falcon]], Samurai Goroh, Pico, or Dr. Stewart. Players control fast hovering crafts and use their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses as quickly as possible.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|F-Zero (video game)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of F-Zero}}<!-- ''Maximum Velocity'' retains the basic gameplay fundamentals seen in ''F-Zero''. -->\n\nEvery race consists of five laps around a race track. A player will lose the race if his or her machine explodes due to either taking too much damage or landing outside of the track, gets ejected from the race due to falling to 20th place or due to completing a lap with a rank outside of the rank limit of that lap, or he or she decides to give up. In the single player Grand Prix mode, all of these conditions requires the player to use an extra machine if and only if he or she has one or more spare machines to try again.\n\nFor each lap completed the player is rewarded with a speed boost, to be used once any time, one of the \"SSS\" marks will be shaded green to indicate that it can be used. A boost will dramatically increase a player's speed, but will decrease their ability to turn. A boost used before a jump will make the player jump farther, which could allow the player to use a shortcut with the right vehicle. Boost time and speed varies according to the machine, and is usually tuned for proper balance. For example, one machine boasts a boost time of twelve seconds, yet has the slowest boost speed of the entire game. Players can also take advantage of the varying deceleration of each vehicle. Some vehicles, such as the Jet Vermilion, take longer than others to decelerate from top boost speed to normal speed, once the boost has been used up. Players can also take advantage of this effect on boost pads.\n\nThe Grand Prix is the main single player component of ''Maximum Velocity''. It consists of four series named after [[chess]] pieces: \"Pawn\", \"Knight\", \"Bishop\" and \"Queen\".  The latter of these can be unlocked by winning the others on \"Expert\" mode. They have five races in four difficulty settings, \"Master\" mode is unlocked by winning expert mode in each series, the player unlocks a new machine after completing it. The player needs to be in the top three at the end of the last lap in order to continue to the next race. If the player is unable to continue, the player will lose a machine and can try the race again. If the player runs out of machines, then the game ends, and the player has to start the series from the beginning.\n\nChampionship is another single player component. It is basically the same as a \"Time Attack\" mode, except the player can only race on one, special course: the Synobazz Championship Circuit. This special course is not selectable in any other modes.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Maximum Velocity'' can be played in two multiplayer modes using the Game Boy Advance link cable, with one cartridge, or one cartridge per player. Two to four Players can play in both modes.\n\nIn single cart, only one player needs to have a cartridge. The other players will boot off the link cable network from the player with the cart using the GBA's [[GBA Network Boot|netboot]] capability. All players drive a generic craft, and the game can only be played on one level, Silence. Silence, along with Fire Field, are the only areas to return from previous games. Aptly, Silence in ''Maximum Velocity'' has no background music, unlike in most other F-Zero games.\n\nIn multi cart, each player needs to have a cartridge to play. This has many advantages over single cart: All players can use any machine in this game that has been unlocked by another player. Players can select any course in this game. After race is finished, all of the player's ranking data are mixed and shared (\"Mixed ranking\" stored in each cart).\n\n==Development==\n{{Expand section|[http://www.famitsu.com/game/special/2001/03/22/f-zero_top.html][https://www.nintendo.co.jp/nom/0103/032/]|date=March 2009}}\n\n''F-Zero: Maximum Velocity'' is one of the first titles to have been developed by [[NDcube]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/01/31/tube-slider-2|title= Tube Slider preview|accessdate=2008-05-02|author=IGN staff|date=2003-01-31|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Like the original ''F-Zero'' for SNES, ''Maximum Velocity'' implements a pseudo-3D visual technique based on the scaling and rotation effects of [[bitmap graphics]].

''Berlin and Its Culture: A Historical Portrait.'' New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press. p. 51.</ref>), was the [[King in Prussia]] and [[Elector of Brandenburg]] from 1713 until his death in 1740 as well as the father of [[Frederick the Great]]. He was in [[personal union]] the sovereign prince of the [[principality of Neuch\u00e2tel]].\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:August II of Poland and Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia.PNG|thumb|Portrait of [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II of Poland]] (left) and Frederick William  I of Prussia (right), during Frederick William's 1728 visit to Dresden. Painting by [[Louis de Silvestre]], about 1730]]\nHe was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Frederick I of Prussia]] and [[Sophia Charlotte of Hanover]]. During his first years, he was raised by the Huguenot governess [[Marthe de Roucoulle]].<ref>Thomas Carlyle: History of Friedrich II of Prussia: Called Frederick the Great, 1870 </ref>\n\nHis father had successfully acquired the title King for the [[margrave]]s of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]].   On ascending the throne in 1713 the new King sold most of his fathers' horses, jewels and furniture; he did not intend to treat the treasury as his personal source of revenue the way Frederick I and many of the other German Princes had.  Throughout his reign, Frederick William was characterized by his frugal, austere and militaristic lifestyle, as well as his devout Calvinist faith.  He practiced rigid management of the treasury, never started a war, and led a simple and austere lifestyle, in contrast to the lavish court his father had presided over. At his death, Prussia had a sound exchequer and a full treasury, in contrast to the other German states.\n\nFrederick William I did much to improve Prussia economically and militarily. He replaced mandatory military service among the middle class with an annual tax, and he established schools and hospitals. The king encouraged farming, reclaimed marshes, stored grain in good times and sold it in bad times. He dictated the manual of Regulations for State Officials, containing 35 chapters and 297 paragraphs in which every public servant in Prussia could find his duties precisely set out: a minister or councillor failing to attend a committee meeting, for example, would lose six months' pay; if he absented himself a second time, he would be discharged from the royal service.  In short, Frederick William I concerned himself with every aspect of his relatively small country, ruling an [[absolute monarchy]] with great energy and skill.\n\nIn 1732, the king invited the [[Salzburg Protestants]] to settle in East Prussia, which had been [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|depopulated by plague]] in 1709.  Under the terms of the [[Peace of Augsburg]], the Prince-Archbishop of [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]] could require his subjects to practice the Catholic faith, but Protestants had the right to emigrate to a Protestant state.  Prussian commissioners accompanied 20,000 Protestants to their new homes on the other side of Germany.  Frederick William I personally welcomed the first group of migrants and sang Protestant hymns with them.<ref name=walker1992>{{Cite book|title = The Salzburg Transaction: Expulsion and Redemption in Eighteenth-Century Germany|last = Walker|first = Mack|publisher = Cornell University Press|year = 1992|isbn = 0-8014-2777-0|location = Ithaca, New York|pages = }}</ref>\n\nFrederick William intervened briefly in the [[Great Northern War]], allied with Peter the Great of Russia, in order to gain a small portion of Swedish Pomerania; this gave Prussia new ports on the Baltic Sea coast. More significantly, aided by his close friend [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau]], the \"Soldier-King\" made considerable reforms to the Prussian army's training, tactics and conscription program\u2014introducing the [[Canton System (Prussia)|canton system]], and greatly increasing the Prussian infantry's rate of fire through the introduction of the iron ramrod.  Frederick William's reforms left his son Frederick with the most formidable army in Europe, which Frederick used to increase Prussia's power. The observation that \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" has sometimes been attributed to him. (''See as well:'' \"[[Prussian virtues]]\".) \n\nAlthough a highly effective ruler, Frederick William had a perpetually short temper which sometimes drove him to physically attack servants (or even his own children) with a cane at the slightest provocation.  His violent, harsh nature was further exacerbated by his inherited [[Porphyria cutanea tarda|porphyritic disease]], which gave him [[gout]], obesity and frequent crippling stomach pains.<ref>[Mitford, Nancy \"Frederick the Great\" (1970) P6]</ref>  He also had a notable contempt for France, and would sometimes fly into a rage at the mere mention of that country, although this did not stop him from encouraging the immigration of French Huguenot refugees to Prussia.\n\n==Burial and reburials==\nFrederick William died in 1740 at age 51 and was interred at the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] in [[Potsdam]].  During World War II, in order to protect it from advancing allied forces, Hitler ordered the king's coffin, as well as those of [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Paul von Hindenburg]], into hiding, first to Berlin and later to a salt mine outside of [[Bernterode (bei Worbis)|Bernterode]]. The coffins were later discovered by occupying American Forces, who re-interred the bodies in [[St. Elisabeth's Church (Marburg)|St. Elisabeth's Church]] in [[Marburg]] in 1946.  In 1953 the coffin was moved to [[Hohenzollern Castle|Burg Hohenzollern]], where it remained until 1991, when it was finally laid to rest on the steps of the altar in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Church of Peace]] on the palace grounds of [[Sanssouci]]. The original black marble sarcophagus collapsed at Burg Hohenzollern\u2014the current one is a copper copy.<ref>MacDonogh, Giles (2007). ''After the Reich: The Brutal History of the Allied Occupation''. New York: Basic Books. p. 93.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Frederick II==\n[[File:Die S\u00f6hne von Friedrich Wilhelm I.jpg|thumb|The sons of Frederick William I and Sophia Dorothea; left to right Frederick, Ferdinand, Augustus William and Henry.  Painting by [[Francesco Carlo Rusca]], 1737]]\nHis eldest surviving son was [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] (Fritz), born in 1712. Frederick William wanted him to become a fine soldier. As a small child, Fritz was awakened each morning by the firing of a cannon. At the age of 6, he was given his own regiment of children <ref>Mitford, Nancy (1970). \"Frederick the Great\" pp.11</ref> to drill as cadets, and a year later, he was given a miniature arsenal.\n  \nThe love and affection Frederick William had for his heir initially was soon destroyed due to their increasingly different personalities. Frederick William ordered Fritz to undergo a minimal education, live a simple Protestant lifestyle, and focus on the Army and statesmanship as he had. However, the intellectual Fritz was more interested in music, books and French culture, which were forbidden by his father as decadent and unmanly.  As Fritz's defiance for his father's rules increased, Frederick William would frequently beat or humiliate Fritz (he preferred his younger sibling [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William]]). Fritz was beaten for being thrown off a bolting horse and wearing gloves in cold weather. After the prince attempted to flee to England with his tutor, [[Hans Hermann von Katte]], the enraged King had Katte beheaded before the eyes of the prince, who himself was court-martialled.<ref>Farquhar, Michael (2001). ''A Treasure of Royal Scandals''. New York: Penguin Books. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.</ref> The court declared itself not competent in this case. Whether it was the king's intention to have his son executed as well (as [[Voltaire]] claims) is not clear. However, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] intervened, claiming that a prince could only be tried by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] itself. Frederick was imprisoned in the Fortress of [[Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105|K\u00fcstrin]] from 2 September to 19 November 1731 and exiled from court until February 1732, during which time he was rigorously schooled in matters of state.  After achieving a measure of reconciliation, Frederick William had his son married to Princess Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, whom Frederick despised, but then grudgingly allowed him to indulge in his musical and literary interests again.  By the time of Frederick William's death in 1740, he and Frederick were on at least reasonable terms with each other.\n\nAlthough the relationship between Frederick William and Frederick was clearly hostile, Frederick himself later wrote that his father \"penetrated and understood great objectives, and knew the best interests of his country better than any minister or general.\"\n\n==Marriage and family==\nFrederick William married his first cousin [[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]'s younger sister (daughter of his uncle, King [[George I of Great Britain]] and [[Sophia Dorothea of Celle]]) on 28 November 1706.  Frederick William was faithful and loving to his wife<ref>Mitford, Nancy (1970). \"Frederick the Great\" p.5</ref> but they did not have a happy relationship: Sophia Dorothea feared his unpredictable temper and resented him, both for allowing her no influence at court and for refusing to marry her children to their English cousins.  She also abhorred his cruelty towards their son and heir Frederick (with whom she was close), although rather than trying to mend the relationship between father and son she frequently spurred Frederick on in his defiance.  They had fourteen children, including:\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Issue\n! width=20% | Name !! width=60px | Portrait !! Lifespan !!

W. Norton & Company, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}</ref> It is contrasted with [[mafic]] rocks, which are relatively richer in [[magnesium]] and [[iron]]. Felsic refers to those rocks rich in [[silicate minerals]], [[magma]], and [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are enriched in the lighter elements such as [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], [[aluminium]], [[sodium]], and [[potassium]].\n\nThey are usually light in color and have [[specific gravity|specific gravities]] less than 3. The most common felsic rock is [[granite]]. Common felsic minerals include quartz, [[muscovite]], [[orthoclase]], and the sodium-rich [[plagioclase]] feldspars.\n\n==Terminology==\nIn modern usage, the term ''acid rock'', although sometimes used as a synonym, refers to a high-silica-content (greater than 63% SiO<sub>2</sub> by weight) [[volcanic rock]], such as [[rhyolite]]. \nThe term was used more broadly in older geologic literature. It is considered archaic now, as the terms \"acidic\" and \"basic rock\" were based on an incorrect idea, dating from the 19th century, that \"[[silicon dioxide|silicic acid]]\" was the chief form of silicon occurring in rocks.\n\nThe term \"felsic\" combines the words \"'''fel'''dspar\" and \"'''si'''lica\". The similarity of the term ''felsic'' to the German words ''Fels'', meaning \"rock\", and ''felsig'', meaning \"rocky\", is purely accidental, as ''feldspar'' is a borrowing from German ''Feldspat'', which derives from German ''Feld'', meaning \"field\".<ref>{{OEtymD|feldspar|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref>\n\n==Classification of felsic rocks==\n[[File:LvMS-Lvg.jpg|thumb|A felsic [[volcanic lithic fragment]], as seen in a [[petrographic microscope]].  Scale box is in millimeters.]]\nIn order for a rock to be classified as felsic, it generally needs to contain more than 75% felsic minerals; namely quartz, [[orthoclase]] and [[plagioclase]]. Rocks with greater than 90% felsic minerals can also be called '''''leucocratic''''', meaning 'light-coloured'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thecse.com/sites/default/files/SWK-20161118-MMICP_Technical_Report_update_November2016.pdf|title=TECHNICAL REPORT MACKENZIE MOUNTAINS IRON-COPPER PROPERTY, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, CANADA|last=Aurora Geosciences Ltd|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Felsite]] is a [[petrology|petrologic]] field term used to refer to very fine-grained or [[aphanitic]], light-colored [[volcanic]] rocks which might be later reclassified after a more detailed microscopic or chemical analysis.\n\nIn some cases, felsic volcanic rocks may contain [[phenocryst]]s of [[mafic]] minerals, usually [[hornblende]], [[pyroxene]] or a feldspar mineral, and may need to be named after their phenocryst mineral, such as 'hornblende-bearing felsite'.\n\nThe chemical name of a felsic rock is given according to the [[TAS classification]] of Le Maitre (1975). However, this only applies to volcanic rocks. If the rock is analyzed and found to be felsic but is [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and has no definite volcanic [[protolith]], it may be sufficient to simply call it a 'felsic schist'. There are examples known of highly [[Shear (geology)|sheared]] granites which can be mistaken for rhyolites.\n\nFor [[phaneritic]] felsic rocks, the [[QAPF diagram]] should be used, and a name given according to the [[granite]] nomenclature. Often the species of mafic minerals is included in the name, for instance, hornblende-bearing granite, [[pyroxene]] [[tonalite]] or [[augite]] megacrystic [[monzonite]], because the term \"granite\" already assumes content with feldspar and quartz.\n\nThe rock texture thus determines the basic name of a felsic rock.\n[[File:Granite Yosemite P1160483.jpg|thumb|Close-up of [[granite]] from [[Yosemite National Park]].]]\n[[File:RhyoliteUSGOV.jpg|thumb|A specimen of [[rhyolite]].]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Rock texture'''||'''Name of felsic rock'''\n|-\n| [[Pegmatitic]]||[[Granite]] [[pegmatite]]\n|-\n| Coarse-grained ([[phaneritic]])||[[Granite]]\n|-\n| Coarse-grained and [[porphyritic]]||Porphyritic [[granite]]\n|-\n| Fine-grained ([[aphanitic]])||[[Rhyolite]]\n|-\n| Fine-grained and porphyritic||Porphyritic [[rhyolite]]\n|-\n| [[Pyroclastic]]||Rhyolitic [[tuff]] or [[breccia]]\n|-\n| [[Vesicular texture|Vesicular]]||[[Pumice]]\n|-\n| [[Amygdule|Amygdaloidal]]||None\n|-\n| [[Vitreous lustre|Vitreous (Glassy)]]||[[Obsidian]] or porcellanite\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[QAPF diagram]]\n*[[List of minerals]]\n*[[List of rock types]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Le Maitre, L.

This farthest extent of Frisian territory is sometimes referred to as ''[[Frisian Kingdom|Frisia Magna]]''. Early Frisia was ruled by a [[High King]], with the earliest reference to a 'Frisian King' being dated 678.\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisian nobles came into increasing conflict with the [[Franks]] to their south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia in 734. These wars benefited attempts by Anglo-Irish missionaries (which had begun with [[Saint Boniface]]) to convert the Frisian populace to [[Christianity]], in which [[Saint Willibrord]] largely succeeded.<ref>{{Cite CE1913|wstitle=St. Willibrord}}</ref>\n\nSome time after the death of [[Charlemagne]], the Frisian territories were in theory under the control of the [[Count of Holland]], but in practice the Hollandic counts, starting with [[Arnulf, Count of Holland|Count Arnulf]] in 993, were unable to assert themselves as the sovereign lords of Frisia. The resulting stalemate resulted in a period of time called the '[[Frisian freedom]]', a period in which [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] (as well as central or judicial [[administration (government)|administration]]) did not exist, and in which the Frisian lands only owed their allegiance to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nDuring the 13th century, however, the counts of Holland became increasingly powerful and, starting in 1272, sought to reassert themselves as rightful lords of the Frisian lands in [[Friso-Hollandic Wars|a series of wars]], which (with a series of lengthy interruptions) ended in 1422 with the Hollandic conquest of Western Frisia and with the establishment of a more powerful noble class in Central and Eastern Frisia.\n\nIn 1524, Frisia became part of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] and in 1568 joined the [[Dutch revolt]] against [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of [[Spain]], heir of the Burgundian territories; Central Frisia has remained a part of the Netherlands ever since. The eastern periphery of [[Frisia]] would become part of various German states (later [[Germany]]) and [[Denmark]]. An old tradition existed in the region of exploitation of peatlands.\n\n==Migration to England and Scotland==\n\nThough impossible to know exact numbers and migration patterns, research has indicated that many Frisians were part of the wave of ethnic groups to colonise areas of England alongside the Anglo-Saxons and [[Jutes]],<ref name=\"openaccess.leidenuniv.nl\">{{Citation |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/20850/Bremmer%20Frisians%20in%20Anglo-Saxon%20England.pdf?sequence=7 |hdl=1887/20850|title=Frisians in Anglo-Saxon England: A Historical and Toponymical Investigation|year=1981}}</ref> starting from around the fifth century when Frisians arrived along the coastline of Kent.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/the-anglo-saxon-invasion-britain-is-more-germanic-than-it-thinks-a-768706.html | title=The Anglo-Saxon Invasion: Britain is More Germanic than It Thinks| newspaper=Spiegel Online| date=2011-06-16| last1=Schulz| first1=Matthias}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://dedutchman.ca/friesland/ | title=The History of the Frisian Folk}}</ref> Studies have found the DNA of people tested in [[The Midlands|Central England]] to be \"indistinguishable\" from that of Frisians.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004160|pmid = 12082121| title=Y Chromosome Evidence for Anglo-Saxon Mass Migration| journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution| volume=19| issue=7| pages=1008\u20131021| year=2002| last1=Weale| first1=Michael E.| last2=Weiss| first2=Deborah A.| last3=Jager| first3=Rolf F.| last4=Bradman| first4=Neil| last5=Thomas| first5=Mark G.}}</ref>\n\nFrisians principally settled in modern-day Kent, [[East Anglia]],<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2590857|title = The Frisians in East Anglia|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 10|issue = 2|pages = 189\u2013206|last1 = Homans|first1 = George C.|year = 1957}}</ref> the [[East Midlands]], [[North East England]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wilcuma.org.uk/who-are-the-anglo-saxons/the-frisians/ | title=The Frisians, their tribes & allies}}</ref> and [[Yorkshire]].

He was associated with the [[utopian]] and [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] artistic and literary community [[Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil]] between 1907 and 1908. Marinetti is best known as the author of the first ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'', which was written and published in 1909; and also of the [[Fascist Manifesto]].\n\n==Childhood and adolescence==\nEmilio Angelo Carlo Marinetti (some documents give his name as \"Filippo Achille Emilio Marinetti\") spent the first years of his life in [[Alexandria]], [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]], where his father (Enrico Marinetti) and his mother (Amalia Grolli) lived together ''more uxorio'' (as if married). Enrico was a lawyer from [[Piedmont]], and his mother was the daughter of a literary professor from [[Milan]]. They had come to Egypt in 1865, at the invitation of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]], to act as legal advisers for foreign companies that were taking part in his modernization program.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Berghaus, G\u00fcnther|title=Filippo Tommaso Marinetti: Critical Writings|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007|isbn=9780374706944|chapter=F.T.

He experimented with every type of literature (poetry, narrative, theatre, ''words in liberty''), signing everything \"Filippo Tommaso Marinetti\".\n\n==Futurism==\n[[File:Filippo Tommaso Marinetti - Zang tumb tumb - Hoge Rijndijk 8, Leiden.JPG|thumb|Poem of Marinetti on a [[Wall poems in Leiden|wall in Leiden]]]]\nMarinetti and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]] were visitors of the [[Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil]] c. 1908 along with young writers like Roger Allard (one of the first to defend [[Cubism]]), Pierre Jean Jouve, and Paul Castiaux, who wanted to publish their works through the Abbaye. The Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil was a ''[[phalanst\u00e8re]]'' community founded in the autumn of 1906 by the painter [[Albert Gleizes]], and the poets [[:fr:Ren\u00e9 Arcos|Ren\u00e9 Arcos]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]] and [[Charles Vildrac]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/lredudrameessa00barz#page/134/mode/2up Barzun, Henri-Martin, ''L'Ere du Drame, Essai de Synth\u00e8se Po\u00e9tique Moderne'', Figui\u00e8re, 1912]</ref> The movement drew its inspiration from the ''Abbaye de Th\u00e9l\u00e8me,'' a fictional creation by [[Rabelais]] in his novel ''[[Gargantua]]''.

It was published in French on the front page of the most prestigious French daily newspaper, ''[[Le Figaro]]'', on 20 February 1909. In ''The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism'', Marinetti declared that \"Art, in fact, can be nothing but violence, cruelty, and injustice.\" [[Georges Sorel]], who influenced the entire political spectrum from anarchism to Fascism, also argued for the importance of violence. Futurism had both anarchist and Fascist elements; Marinetti later became an active supporter of [[Benito Mussolini]].\n\nMarinetti, who admired speed, had a minor car accident outside [[Milan]] in 1908 when he veered into a ditch to avoid two cyclists. He referred to the accident in the Futurist Manifesto: the Marinetti who was helped out of the ditch was a new man, determined to end the pretense and decadence of the prevailing [[Art nouveau|Liberty style]]. He discussed a new and strongly revolutionary programme with his friends, in which they should end every artistic relationship with the past, \"destroy the museums, the libraries, every type of academy\". Together, he wrote, \"We will glorify war\u2014the world's only hygiene\u2014[[militarism]], patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman\".<ref>[http://www.italianfuturism.org/manifestos/foundingmanifesto/ The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Futurist Manifesto was read and debated all across Europe, but Marinetti's first 'Futurist' works were not as successful. In April, the opening night of his drama ''Le Roi bombance'' (The Feasting King), written in 1905, was interrupted by loud, derisive whistling by the audience... and by Marinetti himself, who thus introduced another element of Futurism, \"the desire to be heckled.\" Marinetti did, however, fight a duel with a critic he considered too harsh.\n\nHis drama ''La donna \u00e8 mobile'' (Poup\u00e9es \u00e9lectriques), first presented in [[Turin]], was not successful either. Nowadays, the play is remembered through a later version, named ''Elettricit\u00e0 sessuale'' (Sexual Electricity), and mainly for the appearance onstage of humanoid automatons, ten years before the [[Czechs|Czech]] writer [[Karel \u010capek]] would invent the term \"[[robot]]\".\n\n[[File:FilippoTommasoMarinetti.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]\nIn 1910 his first novel, ''Mafarka il futurista'', was cleared of all charges by an obscenity trial. That year, Marinetti discovered some allies in three young painters ([[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carr\u00e0]], [[Luigi Russolo]]), who adopted the Futurist philosophy. Together with them (and with poets such as [[Aldo Palazzeschi]]), Marinetti began a series of Futurist Evenings, theatrical spectacles in which Futurists declaimed their manifestos in front of a crowd that in part attended the performances in order to throw vegetables at them.\n\nThe most successful \"happening\" of that period was the publicization of the \"Manifesto Against Past-Loving [[Venice]]\" in Venice. In the flier, Marinetti demands \"fill(ing) the small, stinking canals with the rubble from the old, collapsing and leprous palaces\" to \"prepare for the birth of an industrial and militarized Venice, capable of dominating the great [[Adriatic]], a great Italian lake.\"\n\nIn 1911, the [[Italo-Turkish War]] began and Marinetti departed for [[Libya]] as war correspondent for a French newspaper. His articles were eventually collected and published in ''The Battle of Tripoli''. He then covered the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912\u201313, witnessing the surprise success of Bulgarian troops against the Ottoman Empire in the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)|Siege of Adrianople]]. In this period he also made a number of visits to London, which he considered 'the Futurist city par excellence', and where a number of exhibitions, lectures and demonstrations of Futurist music were staged. However, although a number of artists, including [[Wyndham Lewis]], were interested in the new movement, only one British convert was made, the young artist [[C.R.W. Nevinson]]. Nevertheless, Futurism was an important influence upon Lewis's [[Vorticist]] philosophy.<ref>Haycock, ''A Crisis of Brilliance'' (London: Old Street Publishing, 2009), 138\u201340, 142, 147, 187\u20138</ref>\n\nAbout the same time Marinetti worked on a very anti-[[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and anti-[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] verse-novel, ''Le monoplan du Pape'' (''The Pope's Aeroplane'', 1912) and edited an anthology of futurist poets. But his attempts to renew the style of poetry did not satisfy him. So much so that, in his foreword to the anthology, he declared a new revolution: it was time to be done with traditional syntax and to use \"words in freedom\"  (''parole in libert\u00e0''). His sound-poem ''[[Zang Tumb Tumb]]'', an account of the Battle of Adrianople,<ref>[http://blogs.guggenheim.org/checklist/words-in-freedom-the-unique-colors-of-our-changeable-i/ Valesio, Paolo; ''Words-in-Freedom\u2014\"The Unique Colors of our Changeable 'I'\"'', Guggenheim website,  August 28, 2014]</ref> exemplifies words in freedom. Recordings can be heard of Marinetti reading some of his sound poems: ''Battaglia, Peso + Odore'' (1912);<ref>[http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Battaglia.mp3]</ref> ''Dune, parole in libert\u00e0'' (1914);<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117142522/http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/marinetti_ft/Marinetti-Filippo-Tommaso_Dune.mp3]</ref>  ''La Battaglia di Adrianopoli'' (1926) (recorded 1935).<ref>[http://ubu.wfmu.org/sound/artist_tellus/Tellus-21-Artists_03_marinetti.mp3]</ref>\n\n==Wartime==\n\nMarinetti agitated for Italian involvement in the [[World War I]], and once Italy was engaged, promptly volunteered for service. In the Fall of 1915 he and several other Futurists who were members of the Lombard Volunteer Cyclists were stationed at [[Lake Garda]], in [[Trentino]] province, high in the mountains along the Italo-Austrian border. They endured several weeks of fighting in harsh conditions before the cyclists units, deemed inappropriate for mountain warfare, were disbanded.\n\nMarinetti spent most of 1916 supporting Italy's war effort with speeches, journalism, and theatrical work, then returned to military service as a regular army officer in 1917.<ref>[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13532944.2013.806289 Daly, Selena ; ''The Futurist mountains: Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War'', Modern Italy, 2013]; retvd 8 24 15</ref> In May of that year he was seriously wounded while serving with an artillery battalion on the [[So\u010da|Isonzo]] front; he returned to service after a long recovery, and participated in the decisive Italian victory at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]] in October 1918.<ref>Berghaus, G\u00fcnter (editor; introduction to) Marinetti, Filippo Tommaso; ''Critical Writings: New Edition''; Macmillan, 2007; {{ISBN|0374706948}}, 9780374706944</ref>\n\n== Marriage ==\n\nAfter an extended courtship, in 1923 Marinetti married [[Benedetta Cappa]] (1897\u20131977), a writer and painter and a pupil of [[Giacomo Balla]].  Born in Rome, she had joined the Futurists in 1917.  They'd met in 1918, moved in together in Rome, and chose to marry only to avoid legal complications on a lecture tour of [[Brazil]].<ref>Futurism: an anthology By Lawrence S. Rainey, Christine Poggi, Laura Wittman, page 30</ref>  They would have three daughters:  Vittoria, Ala, and Luce.\n\nCappa and Marinetti collaborated on a genre of mixed-media assemblages in the mid-1920s they called ''tattilismo'' (\"Tactilism\"), and she was a strong proponent and practitioner of the [[aeropittura]] movement after its inception in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org/archive/2/AC73F5BDEEF8DE5D6173.htm |title=WAC &#124; La Futurista: Benedetta Cappa Marinetti (1917\u20131945) |publisher=Walkerart.org |accessdate=5 January 2014}}</ref> She also produced three experimental novels.  Cappa's major public work is likely a series of five murals at the Palermo Post Office (1926\u20131935) for the Fascist public-works architect [[Angiolo Mazzoni]].\n\n==Marinetti and Fascism==\n\nIn early 1918 he founded the ''Partito Politico Futurista'' or Futurist Political Party, which only a year later merged with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento]]''. Marinetti was one of the first affiliates of the [[Partito Nazionale Fascista|Italian Fascist Party]]. In 1919 he co-wrote with [[Alceste De Ambris]] the [[Fascist Manifesto]], the original manifesto of [[Italian Fascism]].<ref>Dahlia S. Elazar. The making of fascism: class, state, and counter-revolution, Italy 1919\u20131922. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 2001, p.73</ref> He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, terming them \"reactionary,\" and, after walking out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrew from politics for three years. However, he remained a notable force in developing the party philosophy throughout the regime's existence. For example, at the end of the ''Congress of Fascist Culture'' that was held in [[Bologna]] on 30 March 1925, [[Giovanni Gentile]] addressed [[Sergio Panunzio]] on the need to define Fascism more purposefully by way of Marinetti's opinion, stating, \"Great spiritual movements make recourse to precision when their primitive inspirations\u2014what F. T. Marinetti identified this morning as artistic, that is to say, the creative and truly innovative ideas, from which the movement derived its first and most potent impulse\u2014have lost their force. We today find ourselves at the very beginning of a new life and we experience with joy this obscure need that fills our hearts\u2014this need that is our inspiration, the genius that governs us and carries us with it.\"\n\nAs part of his campaign to overturn tradition, Marinetti also attacked traditional Italian food. His ''Manifesto of Futurist Cooking'' was published in the Turin ''[[Gazzetta del Popolo]]'' on 28 December 1930.<ref name=\"Scarpellini\">{{cite book|last1=Scarpellini|first1=Emanuela|title=Food and Foodways in Italy from 1861 to the Present|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-56962-2|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hI8YDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Sorini\">{{cite news|last1=Sorini|first1=Alex Revelli|last2=Cutini|first2=Susanna|title=Dining With Marinetti: the Manifesto of Futurist Cuisine|url=https://www.finedininglovers.com/stories/futurism-cuisine-manifesto-dining-marinetti/|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=Fine Dining Lovers|date=15 February 2014}}</ref> Arguing that \"People think, dress and act in accordance with what they drink and eat\",<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Food Fight|journal=Distillations|year=2016|volume=2|issue=3|pages=22\u201323|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/food-fight|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Marinetti proposed wide-ranging changes to diet.

His attraction to whatever was new made scientific discoveries appealing to him, but his views on diet were not scientifically based. He was fascinated with the idea of processed food, predicting that someday pills would replace food as a source of energy, and calling for the creation of \"plastic complexes\" to replace natural foods.<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Food, in turn, would become a matter of artistic expression. Many of the meals Marinetti described and ate resemble [[performance art]], such as the \"Tactile Dinner\",<ref name=\"Theroux\"/> recreated in 2014 for an exhibit at the [[Guggenheim Museum]]. Participants wore pajamas decorated with sponge, sandpaper, and aluminum, and ate salads without using cutlery.<ref name=\"Gross\"/><ref name=\"Brickman\">{{cite news|last1=Brickman|first1=Sophie|title=The Food of the Future|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/food-future|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Fascist regime Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Italy but failed to do so. Mussolini was personally uninterested in art and chose to give patronage to numerous styles in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said: \"I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.

The theory attracted a wide following between about 1780 and 1850, and continued to have some influence until the end of the century.<ref name=Crabtree>Crabtree, introduction</ref> In 1843 the Scottish doctor [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] proposed the term [[hypnosis]] for a technique derived from animal magnetism; today this is the usual meaning of  ''[[wiktionary:en:mesmerism|mesmerism]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nMesmer was born in the village of Iznang, on the shore of [[Lake Constance]] in [[Swabia]], [[Germany]], a son of master forester Anton Mesmer (1701\u2014after 1747) and his wife, Maria/Ursula (n\u00e9e Michel; 1701\u20141770).<ref>Prinz</ref> After studying at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] universities of [[University of Dillingen|Dillingen]] and [[University of Ingolstadt|Ingolstadt]], he took up the study of [[medicine]] at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1759. In 1766 he published a [[doctoral dissertation]] with the [[Latin]] title ''De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum'' (''On the Influence of the Planets on the Human Body''), which discussed the influence of the [[moon]] and the [[planets]] on the human body and on disease. This was not [[medical astrology]]. Building largely on [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of the tides, Mesmer expounded on certain tides in the human body that might be accounted for by the movements of the sun and moon.<ref>Bloch, xiii</ref> Evidence assembled by [[Frank A. Pattie]] suggests that Mesmer plagiarized<ref>Pattie, 13ff.</ref> a part of his dissertation from a work<ref>''De Imperio Solis ac Lunae in Corpora Humana et Morbis inde Oriundis'' (On the Influence of the Sun and Moon upon Human Bodies and the Diseases Arising Therefrom (1704). See Pattie, 16.</ref> by [[Richard Mead]], an eminent English physician and Newton's friend. However, in Mesmer's day doctoral theses were not expected to be original.<ref>Pattie, 13</ref>\n\nIn January 1768, Mesmer married Anna Maria von Posch, a wealthy widow, and established himself as a doctor in [[Vienna]]. In the summers he lived on a splendid estate and became a patron of the arts. In 1768, when court intrigue prevented the performance of ''[[La finta semplice]]'' (K. 51), for which the twelve-year-old [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] had composed 500 pages of music, Mesmer is said to have arranged a performance in his garden of Mozart's ''[[Bastien und Bastienne]]'' (K. 50), a one-act opera,<ref>Pattie, 30</ref> though Mozart's biographer [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen|Nissen]] found no proof that this performance actually took place. Mozart later immortalized his former patron by including a comedic reference to Mesmer in his opera ''[[Cos\u00ec fan tutte]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steptoe|first=Andrew|date=1986|title=Mozart, Mesmer and 'Cosi Fan Tutte'|jstor=735887|journal=Music & Letters|volume=67|issue=3|pages=248\u2013255}}</ref>\n[[Image:De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum manuscript.jpg|thumb|''De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum'']]\n\n==Animal magnetism==\n{{Hypnosis|origins}}\nIn 1774, Mesmer produced an \"artificial tide\" in a patient, Francisca \u00d6sterlin, who suffered from hysteria, by having her swallow a preparation containing iron and then attaching magnets to various parts of her body. She reported feeling streams of a mysterious fluid running through her body and was relieved of her symptoms for several hours. Mesmer did not believe that the magnets had achieved the cure on their own. He felt that he had contributed [[animal magnetism]], which had accumulated in his work, to her. He soon stopped using magnets as a part of his treatment.\n\nIn the same year Mesmer collaborated with [[Maximilian Hell]].\n\nIn 1775, Mesmer was invited to give his opinion before the Munich Academy of Sciences on the [[exorcism]]s carried out by [[Johann Joseph Gassner]] (Ga\u00dfner), a [[priest]] and [[Faith healer|healer]] who grew up in [[Vorarlberg]], Austria. Mesmer said that while Gassner was sincere in his beliefs, his cures resulted because he possessed a high degree of animal magnetism. This confrontation between Mesmer's secular ideas and Gassner's religious beliefs marked the end of Gassner's career as well as, according to [[Henri Ellenberger]], the emergence of [[dynamic psychiatry]].\n\nThe scandal that followed Mesmer's unsuccessful attempt to treat the blindness of an 18-year-old musician, [[Maria Theresia Paradis]], led him to leave [[Vienna]] in 1777. In February 1778 Mesmer moved to [[Paris]], rented an apartment in a part of the city preferred by the wealthy and powerful, and established a medical practice. Paris soon divided into those who thought he was a charlatan who had been forced to flee from Vienna and those who thought he had made a great discovery.\n\nIn his first years in Paris, Mesmer tried and failed to get either the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences]] or the [[Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine|Royal Society of Medicine]] to provide official approval for his doctrines. He found only one physician of high professional and social standing, Charles d'Eslon, to become a disciple. In 1779, with d'Eslon's encouragement, Mesmer wrote an 88-page book, ''M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte du magn\u00e9tisme animal'', to which he appended his famous 27 Propositions. These propositions outlined his theory at that time. Some contemporary scholars equate Mesmer\u2019s animal magnetism with the Qi (chi) of Traditional Chinese Medicine and mesmerism with [[Qigong#Chinese Medical Qigong|medical Qigong]] practices.<ref>Fenton, 105ff.</ref><ref>Mackett, J., ''British Journal of Experimental & Clinical Hypnosis''</ref>\n\nAccording to d'Eslon, Mesmer understood health as the free flow of the process of life through thousands of channels in our bodies. Illness was caused by obstacles to this flow. Overcoming these obstacles and restoring flow produced crises, which restored health. When [[Nature]] failed to do this spontaneously, contact with a conductor of animal magnetism was a necessary and sufficient remedy. Mesmer aimed to aid or provoke the efforts of Nature. To cure an [[Insanity|insane]] person, for example, involved causing a fit of madness. The advantage of magnetism involved accelerating such crises without danger.\n\n===Procedure===\nMesmer treated patients both individually and in groups. With individuals he would sit in front of his patient with his knees touching the patient's knees, pressing the patient's thumbs in his hands, looking fixedly into the patient's eyes. Mesmer made \"passes\", moving his hands from patients' shoulders  down along their arms. He then pressed his fingers on the patient's  [[hypochondrium]] region (the area below the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]]), sometimes holding his hands there for hours. Many patients felt peculiar sensations or had convulsions that were regarded as crises and supposed to bring about the cure. Mesmer would often conclude his treatments by playing some music on a [[glass armonica]].<ref>Gielen & Raymond, 32ff.</ref>\n\nBy 1780 Mesmer had more patients than he could treat individually and he established a collective treatment known as the \"baquet.\" An English doctor who observed Mesmer described the treatment as follows:[[File:AMesmerianExperimentogv.ogv|thumb|A caricature of Mesmer \"baquet\" filmed by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]], 1905|262x262px]]<blockquote>In the middle of the room is placed a vessel of about a foot and a half high which is called here a \"baquet\". It is so large that twenty people can easily sit round it; near the edge of the lid which covers it, there are holes pierced corresponding to the number of persons who are to surround it; into these holes are introduced iron rods, bent at right angles outwards, and of different heights, so as to answer to the part of the body to which they are to be applied. Besides these rods, there is a rope which communicates between the baquet and one of the patients, and from him is carried to another, and so on the whole round. The most sensible effects are produced on the approach of Mesmer, who is said to convey the fluid by certain motions of his hands or eyes, without touching the person. I have talked with several who have witnessed these effects, who have convulsions occasioned and removed by a movement of the hand...</blockquote>\n\n===Investigation===\n[[Image:Franz Anton Mesmers Grabstein 01 Gesamt.jpg|thumb|Mesmer's grave in the cemetery in [[Meersburg]], Germany.]]\n\nIn 1784, without Mesmer requesting it, [[King Louis XVI]] appointed four members of the Faculty of Medicine as commissioners to investigate animal magnetism as practiced by d'Eslon. At the request of these commissioners the King appointed five additional commissioners from the Royal Academy of Sciences. These included the [[chemistry|chemist]] [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the doctor [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the [[astronomy|astronomer]] [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], and the American [[ambassador]] [[Benjamin Franklin]].\n\nThe commission conducted a series of experiments aimed not at determining whether Mesmer's treatment worked, but whether he had discovered a new physical fluid. The commission concluded that there was no evidence for such a fluid. Whatever benefit the treatment produced was attributed to \"[[imagination]].\" But one of the commissioners, the botanist [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] took exception to the official reports. He wrote a dissenting opinion that declared Mesmer's theory credible and worthy of further investigation.\n\nThe commission did not examine Mesmer, but investigated the practice of d'Eslon.\n\nIn August 1784 Mesmer visited a Mesmeric society in Lyon. In 1785 Mesmer left Paris. In 1790 he was in Vienna again to settle the estate of his deceased wife Maria Anna. When he sold his house in Vienna in 1801 he was in Paris.\n\nMesmer was driven into exile soon after the investigations on animal magnetism although his influential student, Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis de Pus\u00e9gur (1751-1825), continued to have many followers until his death.<ref>Gielen & Raymond, 39-45</ref> Mesmer continued to practice in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, for a number of years and died in 1815 in [[Meersburg]], Germany.<ref>(de) [http://www.knerger.de/html/mesmererfinder.html Mesmer's grave on the cemetery in Meersburg, source: knerger.de]</ref>\n\n[[Abb\u00e9 Faria]], an Indo-Portuguese monk in Paris and a contemporary of Mesmer, claimed that \"nothing comes from the magnetizer; everything comes from the subject and takes place in his [[imagination]], i.e. [[autosuggestion]] generated from within the mind.\"\n\n==Works==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''De planetarum influxu in corpus humanum'' (''\u00dcber den Einfluss der Gestirne auf den menschlichen K\u00f6rper''; \"The Influence of the Planets on the Human Body\" / original language: Latin) (1766).\n*''M\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9couverte du magnetisme animal'', Didot, Genf und Paris 1779 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75421p.r (Digitalisat)]\n*''Sendschreiben an einen ausw\u00e4rtigen Arzt \u00fcber die Magnetkur'' (\"Circulatory letter to an external[?] physician about the magnetic cure\" / original language: German) (1775).\n*''Th\u00e9orie du monde et des \u00eatres organis\u00e9s suivant les principes de M\u2026.'', Paris, 1784 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k107858b (Digitalisat)]\n*''M\u00e9moire de F.

Only a few substances are ferromagnetic.  The common ones are [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]] and most of their alloys, and some compounds of [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth metals]].\nFerromagnetism is very important in industry and modern technology, and is the basis for many electrical and electromechanical devices such as [[electromagnet]]s, [[electric motor]]s, [[Electric generator|generators]], [[transformer]]s, and [[magnetic storage]] such as [[tape recorder]]s, and [[hard disk]]s, and [[nondestructive testing]] of ferrous materials.\n\n==History and distinction from ferrimagnetism==\n[[File:Ferromagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ferromagnetic ordering in the strict sense]]\n[[File:Ferrimagnetic ordering.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Ferrimagnetic ordering]]\nHistorically, the term ''ferromagnetism'' was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field.

There are ferromagnetic metal alloys whose constituents are not themselves ferromagnetic, called [[Heusler alloy]]s, named after [[Fritz Heusler]]. Conversely there are non-magnetic alloys, such as types of [[stainless steel]], composed almost exclusively of ferromagnetic metals.\n\nAmorphous (non-crystalline) ferromagnetic metallic alloys can be made by very rapid [[quenching]] (cooling) of a liquid alloy. These have the advantage that their properties are nearly isotropic (not aligned along a crystal axis); this results in low [[coercivity]], low [[hysteresis]] loss, high permeability, and high electrical resistivity. One such typical material is a transition metal-metalloid alloy, made from about 80% transition metal (usually Fe, Co, or Ni) and a metalloid component ([[Boron|B]], [[Carbon|C]], [[Silicon|Si]], [[Phosphorus|P]], or [[Aluminium|Al]]) that lowers the melting point.\n<!--changes here are not correct; commenting out until sorted out on talk: One example of such an amorphous alloy is Fe<sub>80</sub>B<sub>20</sub> (Metglas 2605) which has a Curie temperature of 647&nbsp;K and a room-temperature (300&nbsp;K) saturation magnetization of 1.58&nbsp;[[tesla (unit)|teslas]] (1,257&nbsp;[[gauss]]), compared with 1,043&nbsp;K and 2.15&nbsp;T (1,707&nbsp;gauss) for pure iron from above. The melting point, or more precisely the glass transition temperature, is only 714&nbsp;K for the alloy versus a melting point of 1,811&nbsp;K for pure iron.-->\n\nA relatively new class of exceptionally strong ferromagnetic materials are the [[rare-earth magnet]]s. They contain [[lanthanide]] elements that are known for their ability to carry large magnetic moments in well-localized f-orbitals.\n\n===Actinide ferromagnets===\nA number of [[actinide]] compounds are ferromagnets at room temperature or exhibit ferromagnetism upon cooling. [[Plutonium|Pu]][[Phosphorus|P]] is a paramagnet with [[Cubic crystal system|cubic symmetry]] at [[room temperature]], but which undergoes a structural transition into a [[Tetragonal crystal system|tetragonal]] state with ferromagnetic order when cooled below its T<sub>C</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;125&nbsp;K.

Magnetism is now regarded as a purely [[quantum mechanical]] effect. Ferromagnetism arises due to two effects from quantum mechanics: [[spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Feynman|first = Richard P.|author2=Robert Leighton |author3=Matthew Sands|title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol.2|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year = 1963 |location = USA|pages = Ch. 37}}</ref>\n\n===Origin of magnetism===\nOne of the fundamental properties of an [[electron]] (besides that it carries charge) is that it has a [[Electron magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moment]], i.e., it behaves like a tiny magnet, producing a [[magnetic field]]. This dipole moment comes from the more fundamental property of the electron that it has quantum mechanical [[Spin (physics)|spin]].  Due to its quantum nature, the spin of the electron can be in one of only two states; with the magnetic field either pointing \"up\" or \"down\" (for any choice of up and down). The spin of the electrons in atoms is the main source of ferromagnetism, although there is also a contribution from the [[Atomic orbital|orbital]] [[angular momentum]] of the electron about the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. When these magnetic dipoles in a piece of matter are aligned, (point in the same direction) their individually tiny magnetic fields add together to create a much larger macroscopic field.\n\nHowever, materials made of atoms with filled [[electron shell]]s have a total dipole moment of zero, because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., [[Unpaired electron|unpaired spins]]) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism only occurs in materials with partially filled shells. Because of [[Hund's rules]], the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment.\n\nThese [[unpaired electron|unpaired dipoles]] (often called simply \"spins\" even though they also generally include orbital angular momentum) tend to align in parallel to an external magnetic field, an effect called [[paramagnetism]]. Ferromagnetism involves an additional phenomenon, however: in a few substances the dipoles tend to align spontaneously, giving rise to a [[spontaneous magnetization]], even when there is no applied field.\n\n===Exchange interaction===\n{{Main|Exchange interaction}}\nWhen two nearby atoms have unpaired electrons, whether the electron spins are parallel or antiparallel affects whether the electrons can share the same orbit as a result of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect called the [[exchange interaction]]. This in turn affects the electron location and the [[Coulomb force|Coulomb (electrostatic) interaction]] and thus the energy difference between these states.\n\nThe exchange interaction is related to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which says that two electrons with the same spin cannot also be in the same spatial state (orbital). This is a consequence of the [[spin-statistics theorem]] and that electrons are [[fermions]]. Therefore, under certain conditions, when the [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the unpaired outer [[valence electron]]s from adjacent atoms overlap, the distributions of their electric charge in space are farther apart when the electrons have parallel spins than when they have opposite spins. This reduces the [[electrostatic energy]] of the electrons when their spins are parallel compared to their energy when the spins are anti-parallel, so the parallel-spin state is more stable.  In simple terms, the electrons, which repel one another, can move \"further apart\" by aligning their spins, so the spins of these electrons tend to line up.  This difference in energy is called the [[exchange energy]].\n\nThis energy difference can be orders of magnitude larger than the energy differences associated with the [[magnetic dipole-dipole interaction]] due to dipole orientation,<ref name=Chikazumi2>{{cite book|last=Chikazumi|first=S\u014dshin|title=Physics of ferromagnetism|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199564811|edition=2nd |others= English edition prepared with the assistance of C.D.

In certain doped semiconductor oxides [[RKKY interaction]]s have been shown to bring about periodic longer-range magnetic interactions, a phenomenon of significance in the study of [[Spintronics|spintronic materials]].<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.H.N| last2=Hanaor| first2=D.A.H| title= Theoretical study on copper's energetics and magnetism in TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=2013| volume=113| issue=23| pages= 233913| url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1304/1304.1854.pdf| doi=10.1063/1.4811539|arxiv = 1304.1854 |bibcode = 2013JAP...113w3913A }}</ref>\n\nThe materials in which the exchange interaction is much stronger than the competing dipole-dipole interaction are frequently called ''magnetic materials''. For instance, in iron (Fe) the exchange force is about 1000 times stronger than the dipole interaction.  Therefore, below the Curie temperature virtually all of the dipoles in a ferromagnetic material will be aligned. In addition to ferromagnetism, the exchange interaction is also responsible for the other types of spontaneous ordering of atomic magnetic moments occurring in magnetic solids, [[antiferromagnetism]] and [[ferrimagnetism]].\nThere are different exchange interaction mechanisms which create the magnetism in different ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and antiferromagnetic substances.  These mechanisms include [[Exchange interaction#Direct exchange interactions in solids|direct exchange]], [[RKKY interaction|RKKY exchange]], [[double exchange]], and [[superexchange]].\n\n===Magnetic anisotropy===\n{{Main|Magnetic anisotropy}}\n\nAlthough the exchange interaction keeps spins aligned, it does not align them in a particular direction. Without [[magnetic anisotropy]], the spins in a magnet randomly change direction in response to [[thermal fluctuations]] and the magnet is [[superparamagnetic]]. There are several kinds of magnetic anisotropy, the most common of which is [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]]. This is a dependence of the energy on the direction of magnetization relative to the [[crystallographic lattice]]. Another common source of anisotropy, [[inverse magnetostriction]], is induced by internal [[deformation (mechanics)|strains]]. [[Single-domain (magnetic)|Single-domain magnets]] also can have a ''shape anisotropy'' due to the magnetostatic effects of the particle shape. As the temperature of a magnet increases, the anisotropy tends to decrease, and there is often a [[superparamagnetism#Blocking temperature|blocking temperature]] at which a transition to superparamagnetism occurs.<ref name=Aharoni>{{cite book|last=Aharoni|first=Amikam|author-link=Amikam Aharoni|title=Introduction to the Theory of Ferromagnetism|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|year=1996|isbn=0-19-851791-2|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/ElectricityMagnetism/?view=usa&ci=9780198508090|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022541/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Physics/ElectricityMagnetism/?view=usa&ci=9780198508090|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Magnetic domains===\n[[File:Electromagnetic dynamic magnetic domain motion of grain oriented electrical silicon steel.gif|thumb|Electromagnetic dynamic magnetic domain motion of grain oriented electrical silicon steel.]]\n[[File:Weiss-Bezirke1.png|thumb|Kerr micrograph of metal surface showing magnetic domains, with red and green stripes denoting opposite magnetization directions.]]\n{{Main|Magnetic domain}}\n\nThe above would seem to suggest that every piece of ferromagnetic material should have a strong magnetic field, since all the spins are aligned, yet iron and other ferromagnets are often found in an \"unmagnetized\" state.  The reason for this is that a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material is divided into tiny regions called ''[[magnetic domain]]s''<ref name=\"Feynman\">\n {{cite book\n  | last = Feynman | first = Richard P.\n  | author2=Robert B.

Within each domain, the spins are aligned, but (if the bulk material is in its lowest energy configuration; i.e. ''unmagnetized''), the spins of separate domains point in different directions and their magnetic fields cancel out, so the object has no net large scale magnetic field.\n\nFerromagnetic materials spontaneously divide into magnetic domains because the ''[[exchange interaction]]'' is a short-range force, so over long distances of many atoms the tendency of the magnetic dipoles to reduce their energy by orienting in opposite directions wins out. If all the dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are aligned parallel, it creates a large magnetic field extending into the space around it.  This contains a lot of [[magnetostatics|magnetostatic]] energy.  The material can reduce this energy by splitting into many domains pointing in different directions, so the magnetic field is confined to small local fields in the material, reducing the volume of the field. The domains are separated by thin [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain wall]]s a number of molecules thick, in which the direction of magnetization of the dipoles rotates smoothly from one domain's direction to the other.\n\n===Magnetized materials===\n[[File:Moving magnetic domains by Zureks.gif|thumb|Moving domain walls in a grain of [[silicon steel]] caused by an increasing external magnetic field in the \"downward\" direction, observed in a Kerr microscope. White areas are domains with magnetization directed up, dark areas are domains with magnetization directed down.]]\n\nThus, a piece of iron in its lowest energy state (\"unmagnetized\") generally has little or no net magnetic field. However, the magnetic domains in a material are not fixed in place; they are simply regions where the spins of the electrons have aligned spontaneously due to their magnetic fields, and thus can be altered by an external magnetic field.  If a strong enough external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domain walls will move by the process of the spins of the electrons in atoms near the wall in one domain turning under the influence of the external field to face in the same direction as the electrons in the other domain, thus reorienting the domains so more of the dipoles are aligned with the external field.  The domains will remain aligned when the external field is removed, creating a magnetic field of their own extending into the space around the material, thus creating a \"permanent\" magnet. The domains do not go back to their original minimum energy configuration when the field is removed because the domain walls tend to become 'pinned' or 'snagged' on defects in the crystal lattice, preserving their parallel orientation.  This is shown by the [[Barkhausen effect]]: as the magnetizing field is changed, the magnetization changes in thousands of tiny discontinuous jumps as the domain walls suddenly \"snap\" past defects.\n\nThis magnetization as a function of the external field is described by a [[Hysteresis loop|hysteresis curve]]. Although this state of aligned domains found in a piece of magnetized ferromagnetic material is not a minimal-energy configuration, it is [[metastable]], and can persist for long periods, as shown by samples of [[magnetite]] from the sea floor which have maintained their magnetization for millions of years.\n\nHeating and then cooling ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) a magnetized material, subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a [[degaussing|degaussing coil]] tends to release the domain walls from their pinned state, and the domain boundaries tend to move back to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus ''[[demagnetization|demagnetizing]]'' the material.\n\nCommercial [[magnet]]s are made of \"hard\" ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials with very large [[magnetic anisotropy]] such as [[alnico]] and [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]], which have a very strong tendency for the magnetization to be pointed along one axis of the crystal, the \"easy axis\".  During manufacture the materials are subjected to various metallurgical processes in a powerful magnetic field, which aligns the crystal grains so their \"easy\" axes of magnetization all point in the same direction.  Thus the magnetization, and the resulting magnetic field, is \"built in\" to the crystal structure of the material, making it very difficult to demagnetize.\n\n===Curie temperature===\n{{Main|Curie temperature}}\nAs the temperature increases, thermal motion, or [[entropy]], competes with the ferromagnetic tendency for dipoles to align. When the temperature rises beyond a certain point, called the [[Curie temperature]], there is a second-order [[phase transition]] and the system can no longer maintain a spontaneous magnetization, so its ability to be magnetized or attracted to a magnet disappears, although it still responds paramagnetically to an external field. Below that temperature, there is a [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] and magnetic moments become aligned with their neighbors. The Curie temperature itself is a [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], where the [[magnetic susceptibility]] is theoretically infinite and, although there is no net magnetization, domain-like spin correlations fluctuate at all length scales.\n\nThe study of ferromagnetic phase transitions, especially via the simplified [[Ising model|Ising]] spin model, had an important impact on the development of statistical physics. There, it was first clearly shown that [[mean field theory]] approaches failed to predict the correct behavior at the critical point (which was found to fall under a ''universality class'' that includes many other systems, such as liquid-gas transitions), and had to be replaced by [[renormalization group]] theory.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ferromagnetic material properties]]\n*[[Orbital magnetization]]\n*[[Stoner criterion]]\n*[[Thermo-magnetic motor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lightandmatter.com/area1sn.html Electromagnetism] \u2013 ch. 11, from an online textbook\n*{{cite web\n|last = Sandeman\n|first = Karl\n|title = Ferromagnetic Materials\n|work = DoITPoMS\n|publisher = Dept. of Materials Sci. and Metallurgy, Univ. of Cambridge\n|date = January 2008\n|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/doitpoms/tlplib/ferromagnetic/printall.php\n|accessdate = 2008-08-27}} Detailed nonmathematical description of ferromagnetic materials with animated illustrations\n* [http://www.cond-mat.de/events/correl13/manuscripts/pavarini.pdf Magnetism: Models and Mechanisms] in E.

In particular, on March 11 a militant of the far-left organization ''[[Lotta Continua]]'', [[Francesco Lorusso]], was killed by a gunshot to the back (probably fired by a policeman), when police dispersed protesters against a mass meeting of [[Communion and Liberation]], which was being held that morning at [[University of Bologna|the University]]. This event served as a detonator for a long series of clashes with [[Polizia di Stato|security forces]] for two days, which affected the entire city of Bologna.<ref>Gino Moliterno, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6vVS_Y1mcIEC&pg=PA800 Encyclopedia of contemporary Italian culture]'' (annotated), CRC Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-415-14584-8}}, p 800</ref>\nCossiga sent [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored vehicle]]s into the university area and other hot spots of the city to quell what he perceived as [[guerrilla warfare]]. Clashes with the police caused numerous casualties among people who got caught up in the riots, including uninvolved locals. No old leftist party, except the Youth Socialist Federation, led by local secretary Emilio Lonardo, participated at the funeral of the student Lorusso, showing the dramatic split between the movement and the historical left parties.\n\n[[Turin]] was also the scene of bloody clashes and attacks. On October 1, 1977, after a procession had started with an attack on the headquarters of the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI), a group of militants of ''Lotta Continua'' reached a downtown bar, ''L'angelo azzurro'' (The Blue Angel), frequented by young right-wing activists. They threw two [[Molotov cocktail]]s, and Roberto Crescenzio, a totally apolitical student, died of burns. The perpetrators of the murder were never identified. ''Lotta Continua'' leader Silvio Viale called it a \"tragic accident\".\n\nAnother innocent victim of the riots of that year was Giorgiana Masi, who was killed in [[Rome]] by a gunshot during an event organized by the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]] to celebrate the third anniversary of the victory in the referendum on divorce. As the perpetrators of the murder remained unknown, the movement attributed the responsibility of the crime to police officers in plain clothes, which were immortalized at that time dressed in clothing of the style of young people of the movement.\n\n===Kidnapping of Aldo Moro===\n{{main|Kidnapping of Aldo Moro}}\n[[File:Moro Cossiga.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Cossiga with [[Aldo Moro]].]]\nCossiga was in office at the time of the [[Kidnapping of Aldo Moro|kidnapping]] and murder of the Christian Democratic leader [[Aldo Moro]] by the [[Marxist-Leninist]] extreme-left terrorist group [[Red Brigades]]. On the morning of 16 March 1978, the day on which the new cabinet led by [[Giulio Andreotti]] was supposed to have undergone a [[confidence and supply|confidence]] vote in the [[Italian Parliament]], the car of Moro, former prime minister and then president of DC, was assaulted by a group of Red Brigades [[terrorists]] in Via Fani in [[Rome]]. Firing automatic weapons, the terrorists killed Moro's bodyguards, (two [[Carabinieri]] in Moro's car and three [[Italian police|policemen]] in the following car) and kidnapped him.\n\nCossiga formed immediately two \"crisis committees\". The first one was a technical-operational-political committee, chaired by Cossiga himself and, in his absence, by undersecretary Nicola Lettieri. Other members included the supreme commanders of the Italian Police Forces, of the Carabinieri, the [[Guardia di Finanza]], the recently named directors of [[SISMI]] and [[SISDE]]   (respectively, Italy's military and civil intelligence services), the national secretary of [[CESIS]] (a secret informations agency), the director of UCIGOS and the police prefect of Rome. The second one was an information committee, including members of CESIS, SISDE, SISMI and [[SIOS]], another military intelligence office.\n\n[[File:Andreotti cossiga.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Francesco Cossiga with [[Giulio Andreotti]] in 1978.]]\nA third unofficial committee was created which never met officially, called the ''comitato di esperti'' (\"committee of experts\"). Its existence was not disclosed until 1981, by Cossiga himself, in his interrogation by the Italian Parliament's Commission about the Moro affair. He omitted to reveal the decisions and the activities of the committee however. This committee included: [[Steve Pieczenik]], a psychologist  of the anti-terrorism section of the US State Department, and notable Italian criminologists.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicola|last= Biondo|author2=Massimo Veneziani|title= Il falsario di Stato.

The attack was carried out by the [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] terrorist organization ''[[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]]'' (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), which always denied any involvement; other theories have been proposed, especially in correlation with the [[strategy of tension]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9pywmKG0sk Carlo Lucarelli, ''Blu notte La strage di Bologna''] {{it}}.</ref>\n\nFrancesco Cossiga first assumed the explosion to have been caused by an accident (the  explosion of an old [[boiler]] located in the basement of the station). Nevertheless, soon the evidence gathered on site of the explosion made it clear that the attack constituted an act of [[terrorism]]. ''[[L'Unit\u00e0]]'', the newspaper of the Communist Party on 3 August already attributed responsibility for the attack to neo-fascists. Later, in a special session to the Senate, Cossiga supported the theory that [[neofascist]]s were behind the attack, \"unlike leftist terrorism, which strikes at the heart of the state through its representatives, black terrorism prefers the massacre because it promotes panic and impulsive reactions.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Police search starts for Bologna bombers |publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=5 August 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Neo-Fascists 'Prefer Massacre'|publisher= Reuters|date=6 August 1980}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Stragedibologna-2.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Rescue teams making their way through the rubble after the [[Bologna massacre|attack]].]]\nLater, according to media reports in 2004, taken up again in 2007,<ref>[http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=214956 \"Il giallo della strage di Bologna.

His candidacy was endorsed by the Christian Democracy, but supported also by communists, socialists, social democrats, liberals and republicans. This was the first time an Italian presidential candidate had won the election on the first ballot, where a two thirds majority is necessary.\n\nThe Cossiga presidency was essentially divided into two phases related to the attitudes of the head of state. In the first five years, Cossiga played its role in a traditional way, caring for the role of the republican institutions under the Constitution, which makes the President of the Republic a kind of arbitrator in relations between the powers of the state.\n\n===\"Pickaxe-wielder\" president===\nIt was in his last two years as President that Cossiga began to express some unusual opinions regarding the Italian political system. He opined that the Italian parties, especially the Christian Democrats and the Communists had to take into account the deep changes brought about by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the end of the [[Cold War]].<ref name=washingtonpost>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/17/AR2010081701409_2.html The Washington Post: Veteran Italian politician Cossiga dies]</ref> According to him, DC and PCI would therefore have been seriously affected by this change, but Cossiga believed that political parties and the same institutions refused to recognize it.\n\n[[File:Cossiga Francesco 3.jpg|thumb|220px|left|President Cossiga in his office at [[Quirinal Palace]].]]\nThus, a period of conflict and political controversy began, often provocative and deliberately excessive, and with very strong media exposure.

This reported improvement is attributed to better maintenance training, as F-35 maintainers have received far more extensive instruction at this early stage of the program than on the [[F-22 Raptor]]. The F-35's stealth coatings are much easier to work with than those used on the Raptor. Cure times for coating repairs are lower and many of the fasteners and access panels are not coated, further reducing the workload for maintenance crews. Some of the F-35's radar-absorbent materials are baked into the jet's composite skin, which means its stealthy signature is not easily degraded.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-air-force-praises-early-performance-of-lockheed-martin-f-35-378578/ \"US Air Force praises early performance of Lockheed Martin F-35\"].''Flightglobal.com'', 6 November 2012.</ref> It is still harder to maintain (because of the need to preserve its stealth characteristics) than fourth-generation aircraft.<ref>Majumdar, Dave.

Further, the complexity of maintaining the F-35 means that, currently, none of the Services are ready to keep it in working order and instead \"rely heavily on contractor support and unacceptable workarounds\". DOT&E found that the program achieved 61 percent of planned flight hours and that the average rate of availability was as low as 28 percent for the F-35A and 33 percent for the F-35B. The program created a new \"modeled achievable\" flight hour projection \"since low availability was preventing the full use of bed-down plan flight hours\". According to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management, in FY2014, each non-test F-35 flew only 7.7 hours per month, which amounts to approximately one sortie every 5.5 days\u2014for combat purposes, a sortie rate so low as to be crippling. Mean flight hours between removal (MFHBR) have increased, but are still only 59 percent to 65 percent of the required threshold. DOT&E found that mean corrective maintenance time for critical failures got worse for the F-35A and the F-35C over the last year.

Known as distributed STOVL operations (DSO), Marine F-35Bs would sustain operations from temporary bases in allied territory within the range of hostile ballistic and cruise missiles, but be moved between temporary locations inside the enemy's 24- to 48-hour targeting cycle.  This strategy accounts for the F-35B's short range, the shortest of the three variants, with mobile forward arming and refueling points (M-Farps) accommodating [[KC-130]] and [[MV-22 Osprey]] aircraft to rearm and refuel the jets, as well as littoral areas for sea links of mobile distribution sites on land.  M-Farps could be based on small airfields, multi-lane roads, or damaged main bases, while F-35Bs would return to U.S. Navy ships, rear-area U.S. Air Force bases, or friendly carriers for scheduled maintenance; metal planking would be needed to protect unprepared roads from the F-35B's engine exhaust, which would be moved between sites by helicopters, and the Marines are studying lighter and more heat-resistant products.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/marines-propose-rapidly-mobile-f-35-operations Marines Propose Rapidly Mobile F-35 Operations] \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 16 December 2014</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2018 an F-35B from the {{USS|Essex|LHD-2|6}} carried out an air strike using a precision-guided bomb against a Taliban position in Afghanistan, marking the first US combat use of the F-35.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-marine-corps-f-35b-makes-first-air-strike-in-afg-452259/|title=US Marine Corps\u2019 F-35B makes first air strike in Afghanistan |publisher=Flightglobal|date=27 September 2018|accessdate=30 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===F-35C===<!--This section is redirected to from [[F-35C]] and [[F-35C Lightning II]].-->\n[[File:Formation of F-35 Aircraft MOD 45157750.jpg|thumb|All main F-35 variants in formation, the greater wing area of the F-35C (left) can be seen when compared to the F-35B (middle) and the F-35A (right).]]\n[[File:F-35C.jpg|thumb|F-35C of VFA-101]]\n\nCompared to the F-35A, the F-35C carrier variant features larger wings with [[Folding wing|foldable wingtip sections]], larger wing and tail control surfaces for improved low-speed control, stronger landing gear for the stresses of [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] arrested landings, a twin-wheel nose gear, and a stronger [[tailhook]] for use with carrier [[arrestor cable]]s.

With the F-35C as the center of a network of naval systems, it could feed information to the UCLASS and order it to fire on a certain target.

Some additives have been used for centuries; for example, preserving food by [[pickling]] (with [[vinegar]]), [[salt]]ing, as with [[bacon]], preserving [[Candy|sweets]] or using [[sulfur dioxide]] as with [[wine]]s. With the advent of processed foods in the second half of the twentieth century, many more additives have been introduced, of both natural and artificial origin.  Food additives also include substances that may be introduced to food indirectly (called \"indirect additives\") in the manufacturing process, through [[food packaging|packaging]], or during storage or transport.<ref name=FDAoverview/><ref>{{cite web |title=Food Ingredients and Packaging Terms |url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/Definitions/default.htm |publisher=FDA |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en |date=January 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Numbering ==\nTo regulate these additives, and inform consumers, each additive is assigned a unique number, termed as \"[[E number]]s\", which is used in [[Europe]] for all approved additives.  This numbering scheme has now been adopted and extended by the ''[[Codex Alimentarius]]'' Commission to internationally identify all additives,<ref>\n{{Cite news\n | last1 = Codex Alimentarius\n | title = Class Names and the International Numbering System for Food Additives.\n | url = http://www.fao.org/tempref/codex/Meetings/CCFAC/ccfac31/INS_e.pdf\n}}</ref> regardless of whether they are approved for use.\n\nE numbers are all prefixed by \"[[E]]\", but countries outside Europe use only the number, whether the additive is approved in Europe or not.\nFor example, [[acetic acid]] is written as E260 on products sold in Europe, but is simply known as additive 260 in some countries.  Additive 103, [[alkannin]], is not approved for use in Europe so does not have an E number, although it is approved for use in [[Australia]]  and [[New Zealand]].  Since 1987, Australia has had an approved system of labelling for additives in packaged foods. Each food additive has to be named or numbered. The numbers are the same as in Europe, but without the prefix \"E\".\n\nThe United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) lists these items as \"[[generally recognized as safe]]\" (GRAS);<ref>See also \"[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/default.htm Food Additives]\", Food and Drug Administration website</ref> they are listed under both their [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] number and FDA regulation under the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]].\n* See [[list of food additives]] for a complete list of all the names.\n\n===Categories===\nFood additives can be divided into several groups, although there is some overlap because some additives exert more than one effect.  For example, salt is both a preservative as well as a flavor.<ref name=Ullmann>Erich L\u00fcck and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski \"Foods, 3.

Common acidulents include [[vinegar]], [[citric acid]], [[tartaric acid]], [[malic acid]], [[fumaric acid]], and [[lactic acid]].\n;Acidity regulators : [[Acidity regulator]]s are used for controlling the [[pH]] of foods for stability or to affect activity of enzymes.\n;Anticaking agents : [[Anticaking agent]]s keep powders such as milk powder from caking or sticking.\n;Antifoaming and foaming agents : [[Defoamer|Antifoaming agents]] reduce or prevent foaming in foods.  Foaming agents do the reverse.\n;Antioxidants : [[Antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin C]] are preservatives by inhibiting the degradation of food by [[oxygen]].\n{{anchor|bulking}}\n;Bulking agents : Bulking agents such as [[starch]] are additives that increase the bulk of a food without affecting its taste.\n;Food coloring : [[Food coloring|Colorings]] are added to food to replace colors lost during preparation or to make food look more attractive.\n;Fortifying agents: [[Vitamin]]s, [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]], and [[dietary supplement]]s to increase the nutritional value\n;Color retention agents : In contrast to colorings, [[Colour retention agent|color retention agents]] are used to preserve a food's existing color.\n;Emulsifiers : [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|Emulsifiers]] allow water and oils to remain mixed together in an [[emulsion]], as in [[mayonnaise]], [[ice cream]], and homogenized [[milk]].\n;Flavors : [[Flavor]]s are additives that give food a particular taste or smell, and may be derived from natural ingredients or created artificially.\n;Flavor enhancers : [[Flavor|Flavor enhancers]] enhance a food's existing flavors.  A popular example is [[monosodium glutamate]].  Some flavor enhancers have their own flavors that are independent of the food.\n;Flour treatment agents : [[Flour treatment agent]]s are added to [[flour]] to improve its color or its use in [[baking]].\n;Glazing agents: [[Glazing agent]]s provide a shiny appearance or protective coating to foods.\n;Humectants : [[Humectant]]s prevent foods from drying out.\n;Tracer gas: [[Tracer gas]] allow for package integrity testing to prevent foods from being exposed to atmosphere, thus guaranteeing shelf life.\n;Preservatives : [[Preservative]]s prevent or inhibit spoilage of food due to [[Fungus|fungi]], [[bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s.\n;Stabilizers : [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|Stabilizers]], thickeners and gelling agents, like [[agar]] or [[pectin]] (used in [[Fruit preserves|jam]] for example) give foods a firmer texture.  While they are not true emulsifiers, they help to stabilize [[emulsion]]s.\n;Sweeteners : [[Sugar substitute|Sweeteners]] are added to foods for flavoring. Sweeteners other than [[sugar]] are added to keep the [[food energy]] ([[calorie]]s) low, or because they have beneficial effects regarding [[diabetes mellitus]], [[Dental caries|tooth decay]], or [[diarrhea]].\n;Thickeners : [[Thickening agent]]s are substances which, when added to the mixture, increase its [[viscosity]] without substantially modifying its other properties.\n;Packaging : [[Bisphenols]], [[phthalates]], and [[Perfluorinated compound|perfluoroalkyl chemicals]] (PFCs) are indirect additives used in manufacturing or packaging.  In July 2018 the American Academy of Pediatrics called for more careful study of those three substances, along with [[nitrates]] and food coloring, as they might harm children during development.<ref>{{cite news |title=Press release: Some Common Food Additives May Pose Health Risks to Children |url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/AAP-Says-Some-Common-Food-Additives-May-Pose-Health-Risks-to-Children.aspx |work=American Academy of Pediatrics |date=July 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Safety and regulation==\nWith the increasing use of [[processed food]]s since the 19th century, food additives are more widely used.

During [[World War II]], the urgent need for cheap, available food preservatives led to it being used again, but it was finally banned in the 1950s.<ref name=NutInj/>  Such cases led to a general mistrust of food additives, and an application of the [[precautionary principle]] led to the conclusion that only additives that are known to be safe should be used in foods.  In the United States, this led to the adoption of the [[Delaney clause]], an amendment to the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938, stating that no [[carcinogen]]ic substances may be used as food additives.  However, after the banning of [[sodium cyclamate|cyclamates]] in the United States and Britain in 1969, [[saccharin]], the only remaining legal [[artificial sweetener]] at the time, was found to cause cancer in rats.  Widespread public outcry in the United States, partly communicated to Congress by postage-paid postcards supplied in the packaging of [[Sweetened beverage|sweetened soft drinks]], led to the retention of saccharin, despite its violation of the Delaney clause.<ref>{{cite book | title = Assessment of technologies for determining cancer risks from the environment | publisher = DIANE publishing | year = 1981 | location = Darby, Pennsylvania, USA | pages = 177 | isbn = 1-4289-2437-X }}</ref> However, in 2000, saccharin was found to be carcinogenic in rats due only to their unique urine chemistry.<ref name=\"Whysner-1996\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Whysner | first1 = J. | last2 = Williams | first2 = GM. | title = Saccharin mechanistic data and risk assessment: urine composition, enhanced cell proliferation, and tumor promotion | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 71 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 225\u201352 | year = 1996 | doi = 10.1016/0163-7258(96)00069-1| pmid = 8910956 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dybing-2002\">{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dybing | first1 = E. | title = Development and implementation of the IPCS conceptual framework for evaluating mode of action of chemical carcinogens | journal = Toxicology | volume = 181-182 | issue = | pages = 121\u20135 |date=December 2002 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00266-4| pmid = 12505296 }}</ref>\n\n===Hyperactivity===\nPeriodically, concerns have been expressed about a linkage between additives and [[hyperactivity]],<ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = McCann\n | first1 = D\n | last2 = Barrett\n | first2 = A\n | last3 = Cooper\n | first3 = A\n | last4 = Crumpler\n | first4 = D\n | last5 = Dalen\n | first5 = L\n | last6 = Grimshaw\n | first6 = K\n | last7 = Kitchin\n | first7 = E\n | last8 = Lok\n | first8 = K\n | last9 = Porteous\n | first9 = L\n | last10 = Prince\n | first10 = Emily\n | last11 = Sonuga-Barke\n | first11 = Edmund\n | last12 = Warner\n | first12 = John O\n | last13 = Stevenson\n | first13 = Jim\n | year = 2007\n | title = Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial\n | periodical = Lancet\n | volume = 370\n | issue = 9598\n | pages = 1560\u20137\n | pmid = 17825405\n | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61306-3\n| display-authors = 8\n }}</ref> however \"no clear evidence of ADHD was\nprovided\".<ref>Amchova, Petra; Kotolova, Hana; Ruda-Kucerova, Jana \"Health safety issues of synthetic food colorants\" Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology (2015), 73(3), 914-922.{{doi|10.1016/j.yrtph.2015.09.026}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] published an official shoppers' guidance with which the concerns of food additives and their labeling are mediated.<ref name=crso>{{cite web| last =[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Choosing the Right Stuff - the official shoppers\u2019 guide to food additives and labels, kilojoules and fat content| work =| publisher =| year =2007| url =http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/| doi =| accessdate =3 May 2009| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090514070251/http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/publications/choosingtherightstuff/| archivedate =14 May 2009| df =}}</ref>  In the EU it can take 10 years or more to obtain approval for a new food additive.

In his youth he was a champion skier and ice skater. He led the team that made the first crossing of the [[Greenland]] interior in 1888, traversing the island on cross-country skis. He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86\u00b014\u2032 during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|North Pole expedition]] of 1893\u201396. Although he retired from exploration after his return to Norway, his techniques of polar travel and his innovations in equipment and clothing influenced a generation of subsequent [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] expeditions.\n\nNansen studied zoology at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] in Christiania (renamed [[Oslo]] in 1925) and later worked as a curator at the [[University Museum of Bergen]] where his research on the central nervous system of lower marine creatures earned him a doctorate and helped establish [[neuron]] doctrine. Later, famed neuroscientist  [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]] would win the 1906 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his research on the same subject, though \"technical priority\" for the theory is given to Nansen.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = [[J.

As one of his country's leading citizens, in 1905 Nansen spoke out for the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|ending]] of [[Norway's union with Sweden]], and was instrumental in persuading [[Prince Carl of Denmark]] to accept the throne of the newly independent Norway. Between 1906 and 1908 he served as the Norwegian representative in London, where he helped negotiate the Integrity Treaty that guaranteed Norway's independent status.\n\nIn the final decade of his life, Nansen devoted himself primarily to the [[League of Nations]], following his appointment in 1921 as the League's High Commissioner for Refugees. In 1922 he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work on behalf of the displaced victims of the [[First World War]] and related conflicts. Among the initiatives he introduced was the \"[[Nansen passport]]\" for stateless persons, a certificate that used to be recognised by more than 50 countries. He worked on behalf of refugees until his sudden death in 1930, after which the League established the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] to ensure that his work continued. This office received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. His name is commemorated in numerous geographical features, particularly in the polar regions.\n\n== Family background and childhood ==\n[[File:Nansen-aged4.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=an unsmiling fair-haired child stands upright, his left hand resting on a stool, in front of an ornate fireplace.|Nansen in 1865 (age 4)]]\nThe Nansen family originated in Denmark. [[Hans Nansen]] (1598\u20131667), a trader, was an early explorer of the [[White Sea]] region of the Arctic Ocean. In later life he settled in Copenhagen, becoming the city's ''[[burgomaster|borgmester]]'' in 1654. Later generations of the family lived in Copenhagen until the mid-18th century, when Ancher Antoni Nansen moved to Norway (then in [[Denmark\u2013Norway|a union with Denmark]]). His son, Hans Leierdahl Nansen (1764\u20131821), was a magistrate first in the [[Trondheim]] district, later in [[J\u00e6ren]]. After Norway's separation from Denmark in 1814, he entered national political life as the representative for [[Stavanger]] in the first [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]], and became a strong advocate of union with Sweden.  After suffering a paralytic stroke in 1821 Hans Leierdahl Nansen died, leaving a four-year-old son, Baldur Fridtjof Nansen, the explorer's father.<ref>Br\u00f8gger and Rolfsen, pp. 1\u20137, 10\u201315</ref>\n\nBaldur was a lawyer without ambitions for public life, who became Reporter to the [[Supreme Court of Norway]].  He married twice, the second time to Adelaide Johanne Thekla Isidore B\u00f8lling Wedel-Jarlsberg from [[B\u00e6rum]], a niece of [[Johan Caspar Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg|Herman Wedel-Jarlsberg]] who had helped frame the [[Constitution of Norway|Norwegian constitution of 1814]] and was later the Swedish king's Norwegian [[Governor-general of Norway|Viceroy]].<ref>Br\u00f8gger and Rolfsen, pp. 8\u20139</ref>  Baldur and Adelaide settled at Store Fr\u00f8en, an estate at Aker, a few kilometres north of Norway's capital city, [[Oslo|Christiania]] (since renamed Oslo). The couple had three children; the first died in infancy, the second, born 10 October 1861, was Fridtjof Nansen.<ref name=\"Reynolds11\">Reynolds, pp. 11\u201314</ref><ref name=\"Huntford7\">Huntford, pp. 7\u201312</ref>\n\nStore Fr\u00f8en's rural surroundings shaped the nature of Nansen's childhood. In the short summers the main activities were swimming and fishing, while in the autumn the chief pastime was hunting for game in the forests. The long winter months were devoted mainly to skiing, which Nansen began to practice at the age of two, on improvised skis.<ref name=\"Huntford7\" />  At the age of 10 he defied his parents and attempted the ski jump at the nearby [[Husebyrennet|Huseby]] installation. This exploit had near-disastrous consequences, as on landing the skis dug deep into the snow, pitching the boy forward: \"I, head first, described a fine arc in the air ... [W]hen I came down again I bored into the snow up to my waist. The boys thought I had broken my neck, but as soon as they saw there was life in me ... a shout of mocking laughter went up.\"<ref name=\"Reynolds11\" /> Nansen's enthusiasm for skiing was undiminished, though as he records, his efforts were overshadowed by those of the skiers from the mountainous region of [[Telemark]], where a [[Telemark skiing|new style of skiing]] was being developed. \"I saw this was the only way\", wrote Nansen later.<ref>Scott, pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nAt school, Nansen worked adequately without showing any particular aptitude.<ref name=\"Huntford7\" />  Studies took second place to sports, or to expeditions into the forests where he would live \"like [[Robinson Crusoe]]\" for weeks at a time.<ref>Scott, pp. 11\u201312</ref> Through such experiences Nansen developed a marked degree of self-reliance. He became an accomplished skier and a highly proficient [[Ice skating|skater]]. Life was disrupted when, in the summer of 1877, Adelaide Nansen died suddenly. Distressed, Baldur Nansen sold the Store Fr\u00f8en property and moved with his two sons to Christiania.<ref>Huntford, pp. 16\u201317</ref>  Nansen's sporting prowess continued to develop;at 18 he broke the world one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) skating record, and in the following year won the national cross-country skiing championship, a feat he would repeat on 11 subsequent occasions.<ref name=\"Ryne\">{{cite web | last = Ryne | first = Linn | title = Fridtjof Nansen: Man of many facets | url = http://www.mnc.net/norway/Nansen.htm | publisher = Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs | accessdate =25 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\n== Student and adventurer ==\n[[File:Fridtjof Nansen 1880.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Nansen as a student in [[Oslo|Christiania]] (1880, age 19)]]\nIn 1880 Nansen passed his university entrance examination, the ''[[examen artium]]''. He decided to study [[zoology]], claiming later that he chose the subject because he thought it offered the chance of a life in the open air. He began his studies at the [[Royal Frederick University]] in Christiania early in 1881.<ref>Huntford, pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nEarly in 1882 Nansen took \"...the first fatal step that led me astray from the quiet life of science.\"<ref name=\"Scott15\">Scott, p. 15</ref> Professor [[Robert Collett]] of the university's zoology department proposed that Nansen take a sea voyage, to study Arctic zoology at first hand. Nansen was enthusiastic, and made arrangements through a recent acquaintance, Captain Axel Krefting, commander of the [[seal hunting|sealer]] ''[[SS Viking|Viking]]''.<ref name=\"Scott15\" /> The voyage began on 11 March 1882 and extended over the following five months.  In the weeks before sealing started, Nansen was able to concentrate on scientific studies.<ref name=\"Huntford21\" /> From water samples he showed that, contrary to previous assumption, sea ice forms on the surface of the water rather than below. His readings also demonstrated that the [[Gulf Stream]] flows beneath a cold layer of surface water.<ref>Reynolds, p. 20</ref>  Through the spring and early summer ''Viking'' roamed between Greenland and [[Svalbard|Spitsbergen]] in search of seal herds. Nansen became an expert marksman, and on one day proudly recorded that his team had shot 200 seal. In July, ''Viking'' became trapped in the ice close to an unexplored section of the Greenland coast; Nansen longed to go ashore, but this was impossible.<ref name=\"Huntford21\" /> However, he began to develop the idea that the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland icecap]] might be explored, or even crossed.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> On 17 July the ship broke free from the ice, and early in August was back in Norwegian waters.<ref name=\"Huntford21\">Huntford, pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n\nNansen did not resume formal studies at the university. Instead, on Collett's recommendation, he accepted a post as curator in the zoological department of the [[Bergen Museum]]. He was to spend the next six years of his life there\u2014apart from a six-month [[sabbatical]] tour of Europe\u2014working and studying with leading figures such as [[Gerhard Armauer Hansen]], the discoverer of the [[leprosy]] bacillus,<ref>Huntford, pp. 28\u201329</ref> and [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]], the museum's director who had turned it from a backwater collection into a centre of scientific research and education.<ref>Reynolds, p. 25</ref> Nansen's chosen area of study was the then relatively unexplored field of [[neuroanatomy]], specifically the central nervous system of lower marine creatures.   Before leaving for his sabbatical in February 1886 he published a paper summarising his research to date, in which he stated that \"anastomoses or unions between the different ganglion cells\" could not be demonstrated with certainty. This unorthodox view was confirmed by the simultaneous researches of the embryologist [[Wilhelm His, Sr.|Wilhelm His]] and the psychiatrist [[August Forel]]. Nansen is considered the first Norwegian defender of the neuron theory, originally proposed by [[Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal]]. His subsequent paper, ''The Structure and Combination of Histological Elements of the Central Nervous System'', published in 1887, became his doctoral thesis.<ref>Huntford, pp. 65\u201369</ref>\n\n== Crossing of Greenland ==\n\n=== Planning ===\n[[File:A E Nordenskiold.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders portrait of a middle-aged man, facing half-left. He has dark, neatly brushed hair, a heavy moustache, and is wearing a dark, formal jacket.|Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld, whose 1883 expedition had penetrated {{convert|160|km|mi nmi|sigfig=1}} into the [[Greenland]] [[Ice cap|icecap]]]]\nThe idea of an expedition across the Greenland icecap grew in Nansen's mind throughout his Bergen years. In 1887, after the submission of his [[doctoral thesis]], he finally began organising this project. Before then, the two most significant penetrations of the Greenland interior had been those of [[Adolf Erik Nordenski\u00f6ld]] in 1883, and [[Robert Peary]] in 1886. Both had set out from [[Disko Bay]] on the western coast, and had travelled about {{convert|160|km|mi|sigfig=1}} eastward before turning back.<ref>Huntford, pp. 73\u201375</ref> By contrast, Nansen proposed to travel from east to west, ending rather than beginning his trek at Disko Bay. A party setting out from the inhabited west coast would, he reasoned, have to make a return trip, as no ship could be certain of reaching the dangerous east coast and picking them up.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 44\u201345</ref>  By starting from the east\u2014assuming that a landing could be made there\u2014Nansen's would be a one-way journey towards a populated area. The party would have no line of retreat to a safe base; the only way to go would be forward, a situation that fitted Nansen's philosophy completely.<ref>Scott, pp. 44\u201346</ref>\n\nNansen rejected the complex organisation and heavy manpower of other Arctic ventures, and instead planned his expedition for a small party of six.  Supplies would be [[manhauling|manhauled]] on specially designed lightweight sledges.  Much of the equipment, including sleeping bags, clothing and cooking stoves, also needed to be designed from scratch.<ref>Huntford, pp. 79\u201381</ref> These plans received a generally poor reception in the press;<ref>Scott, p. 46</ref> one critic had no doubt that \"if [the] scheme be attempted in its present form ... the chances are ten to one that he will ... uselessly throw his own and perhaps others' lives away\".<ref>Nansen (1890), p. 8</ref> The Norwegian parliament refused to provide financial support, believing that such a potentially risky undertaking should not be encouraged. The project was eventually launched with a donation from a Danish businessman, Augustin Gam\u00e9l; the rest came mainly from small contributions from Nansen's countrymen, through a fundraising effort organised by students at the university.<ref>Nansen (1890), p. vii</ref>\n\nDespite the adverse publicity, Nansen received numerous applications from would-be adventurers. He wanted expert skiers, and attempted to recruit from the skiers of Telemark, but his approaches were rebuffed.<ref>Huntford, p. 78</ref>  Nordenski\u00f6ld had advised Nansen that [[Sami people]], from [[Finland]] in the far north of Norway, were expert snow travellers, so Nansen recruited a pair, [[Samuel Balto]] and [[Ole Nielsen Ravna]]. The remaining places went to [[Otto Sverdrup]], a former sea-captain who had more recently worked as a forester; [[Oluf Christian Dietrichson]], an army officer, and [[Kristian Kristiansen (explorer)|Kristian Kristiansen]], an acquaintance of Sverdrup's. All had experience of outdoor life in extreme conditions, and were experienced skiers.<ref name=\"Huntford87\" /> Just before the party's departure, Nansen attended a formal examination at the university, which had agreed to receive his doctoral thesis.  In accordance with custom he was required to defend his work before appointed examiners acting as [[devil's advocate|\"devil's advocates\"]]. He left before knowing the outcome of this process.<ref name=\"Huntford87\">Huntford, pp. 87\u201392</ref>\n\n=== Expedition ===\n[[File:Nansen Greenland Crossing Map.png|thumb|300px|alt=Southern Greenland (below 70\u00b0N), showing, on the west coast, Christianhaab and Godthaab, on the east coast [[Sermilik]] and [[Umivik]].

On 17 July, with the coast still {{convert|20|km|mi nmi}} away, Nansen decided to launch the small boats; they were within sight of the [[Sermilik|Sermilik Fjord]], which Nansen believed would offer a route up on to the icecap.<ref name=\"Huntford97\">Huntford, pp. 97\u201399</ref>\n\nThe expedition left ''Jason'' \"in good spirits and with the highest hopes of a fortunate result\", according to ''Jason's'' captain.<ref name=\"Huntford97\" /> There followed days of extreme frustration for the party as, prevented by weather and sea conditions from reaching the shore, they drifted southwards with the ice. Most of this time was spent camping on the ice itself\u2014it was too dangerous to launch the boats. By 29 July 1888, they were {{convert|380|km|mi nmi}} south of the point where they had left the ship. On that day they finally reached land, but were too far south to begin the crossing. After a brief rest, Nansen ordered the team back into the boats and to begin rowing north.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 48\u201352</ref>\n\n[[File:NansenBoatsGreenland.png|thumb|left|The expedition boats stored against the rocks on the east coast of Greenland and covering surplus supplies.  Drawing from a photo from Nansen's book documenting the expedition, page 245.]]\nDuring the next 12 days, the party battled northward along the coast through the ice floes. On the first day they encountered a large Eskimo encampment near [[Cape Steen Bille]],<ref>Huntford, pp. 105\u2013110</ref> and there were further occasional contacts with the nomadic native population as the journey continued. On 11 August, when they had covered about {{convert|200|km|mi nmi}} and had reached [[Umivik Bay]], Nansen decided that although they were still far south of his intended starting place, they needed to begin the crossing before the season became too advanced for travel.<ref>Scott, p. 84</ref> After landing at Umivik, they spent the next four days preparing for their journey, and on the evening of 15 August they set out. They were heading north-west, towards [[Qasigiannguit|Christianhaab (now Qasigiannguit)]] on the west Greenland shores of Disko Bay, {{convert|600|km|mi nmi|sigfig= 2}} away.<ref>Huntford, pp. 115\u2013116</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the party struggled to ascend the inland ice over a treacherous surface with many hidden [[crevasses]]. The weather was generally bad; on one occasion all progress was halted for three days by violent storms and continuous rain.<ref>Nansen (1890), p. 250</ref> On 26 August Nansen concluded that there was now no chance of reaching Christianhaab by mid-September, when the last ship was due to leave. He therefore ordered a change of course, almost due west towards [[Nuuk|Godthaab (now Nuuk)]], a shorter journey by at least {{convert|150|km|mi nmi|sigfig=2}}. The rest of the party, according to Nansen, \"hailed the change of plan with acclamation\".<ref>Nansen (1890), pp. 267\u2013270</ref> They continued climbing, until on 11 September they had reached a height of {{convert|2719|m|ft}} above sea level, the summit of the icecap with temperatures dropping to {{convert|-45|C|F}} at night. From then on the downward slope made travelling easier, although the terrain was difficult and the weather remained hostile.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 61\u201362</ref> Progress was slow because of fresh snowfalls which made dragging the sledges as hard as pulling them through sand. By 26 September they had battled their way down to the edge of a [[fjord]] that ran westward towards Godthaab. From their tent, some local willows and parts of the sledges Sverdrup constructed a makeshift boat, and on 29 September Nansen and Sverdrup began the last stage of the journey, rowing down the fjord.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 64\u201367</ref>  Four days later, on 3 October 1888, they reached Godthaab, where they were greeted by the town's Danish representative. His first words were to inform Nansen that he had been awarded his doctorate, a matter that \"could not have been more remote from my thoughts at that moment\".<ref>Nansen (1890), p. 363</ref> The crossing had been accomplished in 49 days, making 78 days in total since they had left the ''Jason''; throughout the journey the team had maintained careful meteorological, geographical and other records relating to the previously unexplored interior.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> The rest of the team arrived in Godthaab on 12 October.\n\nNansen soon learned that no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the following spring, though they were able to send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving [[Ivigtut]] at the end of October. He and his party therefore spent the next seven months in Greenland, hunting, fishing and studying the life of the local inhabitants.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\nOn 15 April 1889, the Danish ship ''Hvidbj\u00f8rnen'' finally entered the harbour, and Nansen and his comrades prepared to depart. Nansen recorded: <blockquote>\"It was not without sorrow that we left this place and these people, among whom we had enjoyed ourselves so well.\"<ref>Nansen (1890), pp. 442\u2013444</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Interlude and marriage ==\n[[File:FridtjofNansenEvaSars1889.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Fridtjof Nansen and Eva Nansen in autumn 1889]]\n''Hvidbj\u00f8rnen'' reached Copenhagen on 21 May 1889. News of the crossing had preceded its arrival, and Nansen and his companions were feted as heroes.  This welcome, however, was dwarfed by the reception in Christiania a week later, when crowds of between thirty and forty thousand\u2014a third of the city's population\u2014thronged the streets as the party made its way to the first of a series of receptions.  The interest and enthusiasm generated by the expedition's achievement led directly to the formation that year of the [[Norwegian Geographical Society]].<ref name=\"Huntford156\">Huntford, pp. 156\u2013163</ref>\n\nNansen accepted the position of curator of the Royal Frederick University's zoology collection, a post which carried a salary but involved no duties; the university was satisfied by the association with the explorer's name.<ref name=\"Huntford156\" /> Nansen's main task in the following weeks was writing his account of the expedition, but he found time late in June to visit London, where he met [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|the Prince of Wales]] (the future King Edward VII), and addressed a meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS).<ref name=\"Huntford156\" />\n\nThe RGS president, Sir [[Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff]], said that Nansen has claimed \"the foremost place amongst northern travellers\", and later awarded him the Society's prestigious [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]]. This was one of many honours Nansen received from institutions all over Europe.<ref name=\"Reynolds71\">Reynolds, pp. 71\u201372</ref> He was invited by a group of Australians to lead an expedition to Antarctica, but declined, believing that Norway's interests would be better served by a North Pole conquest.<ref>Fleming, p. 238</ref>\n\nOn 11 August 1889 Nansen announced his engagement to [[Eva Sars]], the daughter of [[Michael Sars]], a zoology professor who had died when Eva was 11 years old.<ref name=\"Huntford168\" /> The couple had met some years previously, at the skiing resort of [[Frognerseteren]], where Nansen recalled seeing \"two feet sticking out of the snow\".<ref name=\"Reynolds71\" /> Eva was three years older than Nansen, and despite the evidence of this first meeting, was an accomplished skier. She was also a celebrated classical singer who had been coached in Berlin by [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Art\u00f4t]], one-time paramour of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. The engagement surprised many; since Nansen had previously expressed himself forcefully against the institution of marriage, Otto Sverdrup assumed he had read the message wrongly. The wedding took place on 6 September 1889, less than a month after the engagement.<ref name=\"Huntford168\">Huntford, pp. 168\u2013173</ref>\n\n== ''Fram'' expedition ==\n{{main|Nansen's Fram expedition}}\n\n=== Theories and plans ===\n[[File:Portrett av Fridtjof Nansen med hatt, 1889.jpg|170pxpx|thumb|upright|left|alt=Portrait of a youngish man recognisable as Nansen from the earlier photograph. He has a stern expression and is wearing a collarless jacket buttoned to the neck.|Nansen in 1889 (age 28)]]Nansen first began to consider the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of [[Henrik Mohn]], the distinguished Norwegian [[meteorology|meteorologist]]. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel ''[[USS Jeannette (1878)|Jeannette]]'', which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 on the opposite side of the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the existence of an ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.<ref name=\"Nansen14\">Nansen (1897), Vol. I pp. 14\u201338</ref><ref name=\"Fleming240\" />\n\nThis idea remained with Nansen during following years. After his triumphant return from Greenland he began to develop a detailed plan for a polar venture, which he made public in February 1890 at a meeting of the recently formed Norwegian Geographical Society. Previous expeditions, he argued, had approached the North Pole from the west, and had failed because they were working ''against'' the prevailing east-west current. The secret of success was to work ''with'' this current. A workable plan, Nansen said, would require a small, strong and manoeuvrable ship capable of carrying fuel and provisions for twelve men for five years. The ship would sail to the approximate location of ''Jeannette's'' sinking, and would enter the ice. It would then drift west with the current towards the pole and beyond it, eventually reaching the sea between Greenland and Spitsbergen.<ref name=\"Nansen14\" />\n\nMany experienced polar hands were dismissive of Nansen's plans. The retired American explorer [[Adolphus Greely]] called the idea \"an illogical scheme of self-destruction\".<ref>Berton, p. 489</ref> Sir Allen Young, a veteran of the searches for [[Franklin's lost expedition|Sir John Franklin's lost expedition]],<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. I pp. 42\u201345</ref> and Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Joseph Hooker]], who had sailed south with [[James Clark Ross]] in 1839\u201343, were equally dismissive.<ref name=\"Berton492\">Berton, p. 492</ref><ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. I pp. 47\u201348</ref> However, after an impassioned speech Nansen secured the support of the Norwegian parliament, which voted him a grant. The balance of funding was met by private donations and from a national appeal.<ref name=\"Fleming240\">Fleming, pp. 239\u2013240</ref>\n\n=== Preparations ===\n[[File:Framnameplate.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph showing part of a ship's curved [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], bearing the name FRAM. A small lifeboat has been slung above the ship's rail.|Modern photograph of the ''[[Fram]]'s'' rounded [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]]]\n\nNansen chose [[Colin Archer]], Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect, to design and build a suitable ship for the planned expedition. Using the toughest oak timbers available, and an intricate system of crossbeams and braces throughout its length, Archer built a vessel of extraordinary strength. Its rounded hull was designed so that it would slip upwards out of the grip of pack ice instead of being crushed.  Speed and sailing performance were secondary to the requirement of making the ship a safe and warm shelter during a predicted lengthy confinement.<ref name=\"Fleming240\" /> With an overall length of {{convert|39|m|ft}} and a beam of {{convert|11|m|ft}}, the length-to-beam ratio of just over three gave the ship its stubby appearance,<ref name=\"Huntford192\">Huntford, pp. 192\u2013197</ref> justified by Archer thus: \"A ship that is built with exclusive regard to its suitability for [Nansen's] object must differ essentially from any known vessel.\"<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. I p. 60</ref> The ship was launched by [[Eva Nansen]] at Archer's yard at [[Larvik]], on 6 October 1892, and was named ''[[Fram]]'', in English \"Forward\".<ref name=\"Huntford192\" />\n\nFrom thousands of applicants, Nansen selected a party of twelve. Otto Sverdrup from the Greenland expedition was appointed captain of ''Fram'' and second-in-command of the expedition.<ref name=\"Nansen78\" /> Competition for places on the voyage was such that reserve Army lieutenant and dog-driving expert [[Hjalmar Johansen]] signed on as ship's stoker, the only position available.<ref name=\"Nansen78\">Nansen (1897), Vol. I pp. 78\u201381</ref><ref name=\"Huntford222\">Huntford, pp. 222\u2013223</ref>\n\n=== Into the ice ===\n[[File:Nansen Fram Map.png|thumb|400px|left|alt=The eastern Arctic Ocean, including the Barents, Kara, and Laptev Seas, showing the area between the North Pole and the Eurasian coast.

Progress was impeded by fog and ice conditions in the mainly uncharted seas.<ref>Scott, pp. 128\u2013135</ref> The crew also experienced the [[dead water]] phenomenon, where a ship's forward progress is impeded by friction caused by a layer of fresh water lying on top of heavier salt water.<ref>Huntford, pp. 234\u2013237</ref> Nevertheless, [[Cape Chelyuskin]], the most northerly point of the Eurasian continental mass, was passed on 10 September. Ten days later, as ''Fram'' approached the area in which ''Jeannette'' had been crushed, heavy [[drift ice|pack ice]] was sighted at around latitude 78\u00b0N. Nansen followed the line of the pack northwards to a position recorded as 78\u00b049\u2032N, 132\u00b053\u2032E, before ordering engines stopped and the rudder raised. From this point ''Fram's'' drift began.<ref>Huntford, pp. 238\u2013240</ref>\n\nThe first weeks in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably, sometimes north, sometimes south; by 19 November ''Fram's'' latitude was south of that at which she had entered the ice.<ref>Huntford, p. 246</ref> Only after the turn of the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80\u00b0 mark was finally passed on 22 March.<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. I p. 378</ref> Nansen calculated that, at this rate, it might take the ship five years to reach the pole.<ref name=\"Huntford257\" /> As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) a day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan\u2014a [[dog sled]]ge journey towards the pole.<ref name=\"Huntford257\">Huntford, pp. 257\u2013258</ref> With this in mind he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice.  In November Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83\u00b0 he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship with the dogs and make for the pole while ''Fram'', under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped [[Franz Josef Land]]. They would then cross to [[Svalbard|Spitzbergen]] where they would find a ship to take them home.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nThe crew spent the rest of the 1894\u201395 winter preparing clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. [[Kayaks]] were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water.<ref>Fleming, pp. 246\u2013247</ref> Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would be crushed, but ''Fram'' proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83\u00b034\u2032N, above Greely's previous [[Farthest North]] record of 83\u00b024.<ref>Huntford, pp. 275\u2013278</ref>{{refn| Members of Greely's 1881\u201384 expedition had achieved this latitude travelling north from Greenland.

After a week of travel a [[sextant]] observation indicated that they were averaging nine nautical miles a day, (17&nbsp;km; 10&nbsp;mi), putting them ahead of schedule.<ref>Huntford, pp. 308\u2013313</ref> However, uneven surfaces made skiing more difficult, and their speeds slowed. They also realised that they were marching against a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression.<ref name=\"Fleming248\">Fleming, p. 248</ref> On 3 April Nansen began to wonder whether the pole was, indeed, attainable. Unless their speed improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to [[Franz Josef Land]].<ref name=\"Fleming248\" /> He confided in his diary: \"I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time.\"<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II p. 127</ref> On 7 April, after making camp and observing that the way ahead was \"a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon\", Nansen decided to turn south. He recorded the latitude of the final northerly camp as 86\u00b013.6\u2032N, almost three degrees beyond the previous Farthest North mark.<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II p. 142</ref>\n\n=== Retreat ===\nAt first Nansen and Johansen made good progress south, but on 13 April suffered a serious setback when both of their [[Marine chronometer|chronometer]]s stopped. Without knowing the correct time, it was impossible for them to calculate their longitude and thus navigate their way accurately to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches on the basis of Nansen's guess that they were at longitude 86\u00b0E, but from then on were uncertain of their true position.<ref>Fleming, p. 249</ref>\n\n[[File:WinterHutFJL.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Artist's impression: A full moon in a dark sky; on the ground a mound of snow with a small square opening indicates the hut, with an upturned sledge standing outside.

On 31 May, by Nansen's calculations, they were only {{convert|50|nmi|km mi}} from [[Cape Fligely]], the northernmost known point of Franz Josef Land.<ref>Huntford, pp. 343\u2013346</ref> However, travel conditions worsened as the warmer weather caused the ice to break up. On 22 June the pair decided to rest on a stable [[Drift ice|ice floe]] while they repaired their equipment and gathered their strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained on the floe for a month.<ref>Huntford, pp. 346\u2013351</ref> The day after leaving this camp Nansen recorded: \"At last the marvel has come to pass\u2014land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\"<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II p. 276</ref> Whether this still-distant land was Franz Josef Land or a new discovery they did not know\u2014they had only a rough sketch map to guide them.{{refn| The Franz Josef archipelago had been discovered in 1873 by [[Julius Payer]], and at this stage had been only partially explored and mapped.<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II p. 518</ref> | group = n }} On 6 August they reached the edge of the ice, where they shot the last of their dogs\u2014they had been killing the weakest regularly since 24 April, to feed the others. They then lashed their two kayaks together, raised a sail and made for the land.<ref>Huntford, pp. 365\u2013368</ref>\n\nIt was soon clear that this land was part of a group of islands.  As they moved slowly southwards, Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, on the western edge of Franz Josef Land.  Towards the end of August, as the weather grew colder and travel became increasingly difficult, Nansen decided to camp for the winter.<ref>Huntford, pp. 375\u2013379</ref> In a sheltered cove, with stones and moss for building materials, the pair erected a hut which was to be their home for the next eight months.<ref>Huntford, pp. 378\u2013383</ref> With ready supplies of bear, walrus and seal to keep their larder stocked, their principal enemy was not hunger but inactivity.<ref>Fleming, p. 259</ref> After muted Christmas and New Year celebrations, in slowly improving weather they began to prepare to leave their refuge, but it was 19 May 1896 before they were able to resume their journey.<ref>Huntford, pp. 403\u2013404</ref>\n\n=== Rescue and return ===\nOn 17 June, during a stop for repairs after the kayaks had been attacked by a [[walrus]], Nansen thought he heard sounds of a dog barking, and of voices.  He went to investigate, and a few minutes later saw the figure of a man approaching.<ref name=\"Fleming261\">Fleming, pp. 261\u2013262</ref> It was the British explorer [[Frederick George Jackson|Frederick Jackson]], who was leading an expedition to Franz Josef Land and was camped at [[Cape Flora]] on the nearby [[Northbrook Island]].

Nansen later wrote that he could \"still scarcely grasp\" the sudden change of fortune;<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II p. 456</ref> had it not been for the walrus attack that caused the delay, the two parties might have been unaware of each other's existence.<ref name=\"Fleming261\" />\n[[File:CapeFloraMeeting.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men shake hands in the midst of a snowfield, with a dog sitting nearby. Dark hills are shown in the background.|The Nansen\u2013Jackson meeting at [[Northbrook Island|Cape Flora]], 17 June 1896]]\nOn 7 August Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's supply ship [[Windward (ship)|''Windward'']], and sailed for Vard\u00f8 where they arrived on the 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the originator of the polar drift theory, who was in the town by chance.<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. II, pp. 506\u2013507</ref> The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return,<ref>Huntford, pp. 433\u2013434</ref> but as yet there was no news of ''Fram''. Taking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached [[Hammerfest]] on 18 August, where they learned that ''Fram'' had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Troms\u00f8. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark.<ref>Huntford, pp. 435\u2013436</ref> Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Troms\u00f8, where they were reunited with their comrades.<ref name=\"Fleming264\">Fleming, pp. 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nThe homeward voyage to Christiania was a series of triumphant receptions at every port.  On 9 September ''Fram'' was escorted into Christiania's harbour and welcomed by the largest crowds the city had ever seen.<ref>Huntford, p. 438</ref> The crew were received by King Oscar, and Nansen, reunited with family, remained at the palace for several days as a special guest. Tributes arrived from all over the world; typical was that from the British mountaineer [[Edward Whymper]], who wrote that Nansen had made \"almost as great an advance as has been accomplished by all other voyages in the nineteenth century put together\".<ref name=\"Fleming264\" />\n\n== National figure ==\n\n=== Scientist and polar oracle ===\nNansen's first task on his return was to write his account of the voyage. This he did remarkably quickly, producing 300,000 words of Norwegian text by November 1896; the English translation, titled ''Farthest North'', was ready in January 1897. The book was an instant success, and secured Nansen's long-term financial future.<ref>Huntford, pp. 441\u2013442</ref> Nansen included without comment the one significant adverse criticism of his conduct, that of Greely, who had written in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' on Nansen's decision to leave ''Fram'' and strike for the pole: \"It passes comprehension how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition.\"<ref>Nansen (1897), Vol. 1 pp. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nDuring the 20 years following his return from the Arctic, Nansen devoted most of his energies to scientific work. In 1897 he accepted a professorship in zoology at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]],<ref>Huntford, p. 452</ref> which gave him a base from which he could tackle the major task of editing the reports of the scientific results of the ''Fram'' expedition. This was a much more arduous task than writing the expedition narrative. The results were eventually published in six volumes, and according to a later polar scientist, [[Robert Neal Rudmose-Brown|Robert Rudmose-Brown]], \"were to Arctic oceanography what the [[Challenger expedition]] results had been to the oceanography of other oceans.\"<ref>Reynolds, pp. 159\u2013160</ref>\n\nIn 1900 Nansen became director of the Christiania-based International Laboratory for North Sea Research, and helped found the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]].<ref>Reynolds, p. 165</ref> Through his connection with the latter body, in the summer of 1900 Nansen embarked on his first visit to Arctic waters since the ''Fram'' expedition, a cruise to Iceland and Jan Mayen Land on the oceanographic research vessel ''Michael Sars'', named after Eva's father.<ref>Huntford, p. 467</ref> Shortly after his return he learned that his Farthest North record had been passed, by members of [[Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|the Duke of the Abruzzi]]'s Italian expedition. They had reached 86\u00b034\u2032N on 24 April 1900, in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land.<ref>Fleming, p. 323</ref> Nansen received the news philosophically: \"What is the value of having goals for their own sake? They all vanish ... it is merely a question of time.\"<ref>Huntford, p. 468</ref>\n[[File:Polh\u00f8gda.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A substantial building in pink stone or cladding, consisting of a three-storey square tower with two two-storey wings.

Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian [[Adrien de Gerlache]], each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic.<ref>Huntford, pp. 451\u2013452, 463</ref> Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] (whom he considered a fraud),<ref>Huntford, p. 463</ref> he gave advice to [[Robert Falcon Scott]] on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901\u201304 [[Discovery Expedition]]. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained on the drawing board.<ref>Huntford, pp. 464\u2013465</ref>\n\nBy 1901 Nansen's family had expanded considerably. A daughter, Liv, had been born just before ''Fram'' set out; a son, K\u00e5re was born in 1897 followed by a daughter, Irmelin, in 1900 and a second son [[Odd Nansen|Odd]] in 1901.<ref>Huntford, pp. 200, 452, 467, 477</ref> The family home, which Nansen had built in 1891 from the profits of his Greenland expedition book,<ref>Huntford, pp. 177\u2013178</ref> was now too small. Nansen acquired a plot of land in the [[Lysaker]] district and built, substantially to his own design, a large and imposing house which combined some of the characteristics of an English [[manor house]] with features from the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian renaissance]]. The house was ready for occupation by April 1902; Nansen called it ''[[Polh\u00f8gda]]'' (in English \"polar heights\"), and it remained his home for the rest of his life. A fifth and final child, son Asmund, was born at Polh\u00f8gda in 1903.<ref>Huntford, pp. 477\u2013478</ref>\n\n=== Politician and diplomat ===\n[[File:Oscar II of Sweden painted by Oscar Bj\u00f6rck.jpg|thumb|200px| upright|alt=An elderly, bearded man in ornate robes, wearing a jewelled crown surmounted by a cross, looks straight out of the picture.|[[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]], last king of the union of Sweden and Norway.

The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by [[Christian Michelsen]], whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.<ref name=\"Union\" />\n\nIn February and March Nansen published a series of newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. The new prime minister wanted Nansen in the cabinet, but Nansen had no political ambitions.<ref>Huntford, pp. 489\u2013490</ref> However, at Michelsen's request he went to Berlin and then to London where, in a letter to ''The Times'', he presented Norway's legal case for a separate consular service to the English-speaking world. On 17 May 1905, Norway's Constitution Day, Nansen addressed a large crowd in Christiania, saying: \"Now have all ways of retreat been closed. Now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free Norway\".<ref>Scott, p. 285</ref> He also wrote a book, ''Norway and the Union with Sweden'', specifically to promote Norway's case abroad.<ref>Reynolds, p. 147</ref>\n\nOn 23 May the Storting passed the Consulate Act establishing a separate consular service. King Oscar refused his assent; on 27 May the Norwegian cabinet resigned, but the king would not recognise this step. On 7 June the Storting unilaterally announced that the union with Sweden was dissolved. In a tense situation the Swedish government agreed to Norway's request that the dissolution should be put to a referendum of the Norwegian people.<ref name=\"Union\" /> This was held on 13 August 1905 and resulted in an overwhelming vote for separation, at which point King Oscar relinquished the crown of Norway while retaining the Swedish throne.  A second referendum, held in November, determined that the new independent state should be a [[monarchy]] rather than a republic. In anticipation of this, Michelsen's government had been considering the suitability of various princes as candidates for the Norwegian throne. Faced with King Oscar's refusal to allow anyone from his own [[House of Bernadotte]] to accept the crown, the favoured choice was [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Charles of Denmark]]. In July 1905 Michelsen sent Nansen to Copenhagen on a secret mission to persuade Charles to accept the Norwegian throne.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Leiren | first = Terje | title = A Century of Norwegian Independence | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1254607651.html  | journal = The Scandinavian Review | date = Spring 2005 | page = 7 | accessdate =2 August 2005 }} {{subscription}}</ref> Nansen was successful; shortly after the second referendum Charles was proclaimed king, taking the name Haakon VII.

He had been persuaded by his government to rescind his resignation until after King Edward's state visit to Norway in April 1908. His formal retirement from the diplomatic service was dated 1 May 1908, the same day on which his university professorship was changed from zoology to oceanography. This new designation reflected the general character of Nansen's more recent scientific interests.<ref>Huntford, pp. 555\u2013556</ref>  In 1905 he had supplied the Swedish physicist [[Walfrid Ekman]] with the data which established the principle in oceanography known as the [[Ekman spiral]]. Based on Nansen's observations of ocean currents recorded during the ''Fram'' expedition, Ekman concluded that the effect of wind on the sea's surface produced currents which \"formed something like a spiral staircase, down towards the depths\".<ref>Huntford, p. 476</ref> In 1909 Nansen combined with [[Bj\u00f8rn Helland-Hansen]] to publish an academic paper, ''The Norwegian Sea: its Physical Oceanography'', based on the ''Michael Sars'' voyage of 1900.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nNansen had by now retired from polar exploration, the decisive step being his release of ''Fram'' to his fellow-Norwegian [[Roald Amundsen]], who was planning a North Pole expedition.<ref>Huntford, pp. 548\u2013549</ref>  When Amundsen made his controversial change of plan and set out for the South Pole, Nansen stood by him.<ref>Huntford, p. 564</ref>{{refn| Amundsen kept his South Pole intentions secret until ''Fram'' was beyond contact.

In 1910, aboard the Norwegian naval vessel ''Fridtjof'', he carried out researches in the northern Atlantic,<ref name=\"Reynolds179\">Reynolds, pp. 179\u2013184</ref> and in 1912 he took his own yacht, ''Veslem\u00f8y'', to [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and Spitsbergen. The main objective of the ''Veslem\u00f8y'' cruise was the investigation of [[salinity]] in the North Polar Basin.<ref name=\"Reynolds184\">Reynolds, pp. 184\u2013189</ref> One of Nansen's lasting contributions to oceanography was his work designing instruments and equipment; the \"[[Nansen bottle]]\" for taking deep water samples remained in use into the 21st century, in a version updated by [[Shale Niskin]].<ref>Spitz (ed.), p. 421</ref>\n\nAt the request of the Royal Geographical Society, Nansen began work on a study of Arctic discoveries, which developed into a two-volume history of the exploration of the northern regions up to the beginning of the 16th century. This was published in 1911 as ''Nord i T\u00e5keheimen'' (\"In Northern Mists\").<ref name=\"Reynolds179\" />  That year he renewed an acquaintance with [[Kathleen Scott]], wife of Robert Falcon Scott whose [[Terra Nova Expedition]] had sailed for Antarctica in 1910.

The party then took a steamer up the [[Yenisei River]] to [[Krasnoyarsk]], and travelled on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to [[Vladivostok]] before turning for home.

Nansen was appointed president of the Norwegian Union of Defence, but had few official duties, and continued with his professional work as far as circumstances permitted.<ref name=\"Reynolds204\" /> As the war progressed, the loss of Norway's overseas trade led to acute shortages of food in the country, which became critical in April 1917 when the United States entered the war and placed extra restrictions on international trade. Nansen was dispatched to Washington by the Norwegian government; after months of discussion he secured food and other supplies in return for the introduction of a rationing system. When his government hesitated over the deal, he signed the agreement on his own initiative.<ref>Reynolds, p. 214</ref>\n\nWithin a few months of the war's end in November 1918 a draft agreement had been accepted by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] to create a [[League of Nations]], as a means of resolving disputes between nations by peaceful means.<ref>Pollock, pp. 88\u201389</ref> The foundation of the League at this time was providential as far as Nansen was concerned, giving him a new outlet for his restless energy.<ref>Huntford, p. 583</ref>\n\nHe became president of the Norwegian League of Nations Society, and although the Scandinavian nations with their traditions of neutrality initially held themselves aloof, his advocacy helped to ensure that Norway became a full member of the League in 1920, and he became one of its three delegates to the League's General Assembly.<ref>Reynolds, p. 216</ref>\n\nIn April 1920, at the League's request, Nansen began organising the repatriation of around half a million prisoners of war, stranded in various parts of the world. Of these, 300,000 were in Russia which, gripped by revolution and civil war, had little interest in their fate.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> Nansen was able to report to the Assembly in November 1920 that around 200,000 men had been returned to their homes.  \"Never in my life\", he said, \"have I been brought into touch with so formidable an amount of suffering.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 221</ref> Nansen continued this work for a further two years until, in his final report to the Assembly in 1922, he was able to state that 427,886 prisoners had been repatriated to around 30 different countries. In paying tribute to his work, the responsible committee recorded that the story of his efforts \"would contain tales of heroic endeavour worthy of those in the accounts of the crossing of Greenland and the great Arctic voyage.\"<ref>Reynolds, pp. 222\u2013223</ref>\n\nEven before this work was complete, Nansen was involved in a further humanitarian effort. On 1 September 1921, prompted by the British delegate [[Philip Noel-Baker]], he accepted the post of the League's High Commissioner for Refugees.<ref>Huntford, pp. 599\u2013603</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S1560775500119285 |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jree.htm |first1=Gilbert |last1=Jaeger |year=2001 |title=On the history of the international protection of refugees |journal=Revue Internationale de la Croix-Rouge |volume=83 |issue=843 |pages=727\u201338}}</ref> His main brief was the resettlement of around two million Russian refugees displaced by the upheavals of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]].  At the same time he tried to tackle the urgent problem of [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in Russia]]; following a widespread failure of crops around 30 million people were threatened with starvation and death. Despite Nansen's pleas on behalf of the starving, Russia's revolutionary government was feared and distrusted internationally, and the League was reluctant to come to its peoples' aid.<ref>Reynolds, pp. 224\u2013229</ref> Nansen had to rely largely on fundraising from private organisations, and his efforts met with limited success.<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> Later he was to express himself bitterly on the matter:\n\n<blockquote>There was in various transatlantic countries such an abundance of maize, that the farmers had to burn it as fuel in their railway engines. At the same time the ships in Europe were idle, for there were no cargoes. Simultaneously there were thousands, nay millions of unemployed. All this, while thirty million people in the Volga region\u2014not far away and easily reached by our ships\u2014were allowed to starve and die.<ref>Reynolds, p. 230</ref></blockquote>\n\nA major problem impeding Nansen's work on behalf of refugees was that most of them lacked documentary proof of identity or nationality. Without legal status in their country of refuge, their lack of papers meant they were unable to go anywhere else. To overcome this, Nansen devised a document that became known as the \"[[Nansen passport]]\", a form of identity for [[Statelessness|stateless persons]] that was in time recognised by more than 50 governments, and which allowed refugees to cross borders legally. Among the more distinguished holders of Nansen passports were the artist [[Marc Chagall]], the composer [[Igor Stravinsky]], and the dancer [[Anna Pavlova]].<ref>Huntford, p. 638</ref> Although the passport was created initially for refugees from Russia, it was extended to cover other groups.<ref name=\"GibneyHarrison2005\">Gibney & Harrison, pp. 441\u2013442</ref> After the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish wars]] of 1919\u20131922 Nansen travelled to [[Istanbul]] to negotiate the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of refugees, mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army. The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in,<ref name=\"Ryne\" /> and so Nansen devised a scheme for a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|population exchange]] whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey, with full financial compensation, while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland.<ref>Reynolds, p. 241</ref> Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange,<ref name=\"GibneyHarrison2005\" /> the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years. In November 1922, while attending the [[Conference of Lausanne]], Nansen learned that he had been awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for 1922. The citation referred to \"his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war, his work for the Russian refugees, his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine, and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace\".<ref>Huntford, pp. 649\u201350</ref> Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts.<ref name=\"Ryne\" />\n\n[[File:Nansen in Armenia.jpg|thumb|Fridtjof Nansen among orphaned Armenian boys at a summer camp near Gyumri in 1925]]\nFrom 1925 onwards he spent much time trying to help Armenian refugees, victims of [[Armenian genocide|Armenian Genocide]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the First World War and further ill-treatment thereafter.<ref>[http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/genocide/armenian_genocide.htm \"Armenian Genocide\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181947/http://www.unitedhumanrights.org/Genocide/armenian_genocide.htm |date=3 March 2016 }}, United Human Rights Council.

He used the occasion of his inaugural address to review his life and philosophy, and to deliver a call to the youth of the next generation. He ended:\n\n<blockquote>We all have a Land of Beyond to seek in our life\u2014what more can we ask? Our part is to find the trail that leads to it. A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go.

There were fears in Norway that should the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-oriented [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] gain power it would introduce a revolutionary programme. At the inaugural rally of the League in Oslo (as Christiania had now been renamed), Nansen declared: \"To talk of the right of revolution in a society with full civil liberty, universal suffrage, equal treatment for everyone ... [is] idiotic nonsense.\" <ref>Huntford, pp. 657\u2013658</ref>\n\nFollowing continued turmoil between the centre-right parties, there was even an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right [[national unity government]] on a [[balanced budget]] program, an idea he did not reject.<ref>Norland, pp. 54\u201362</ref> He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in T\u00f8nsberg in 1928.<ref>Norland, pp. 112\u2013115.</ref> In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship ''Stella Polaris'', holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.<ref>Norland p. 151.</ref>\n\nIn between his various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had continued to take skiing holidays when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later [[phlebitis]], and was visited on his sickbed by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].<ref>Scott, p. 255</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 665</ref>\n\nNansen was a close friend of a clergyman named Wilhelm.

He was given a non-religious [[state funeral]] before cremation, after which his ashes were laid under a tree at Polh\u00f8gda. Nansen's daughter Liv recorded that there were no speeches, just music: [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', which Eva used to sing.<ref>Scott, p. 256</ref> Among the many tributes paid to him subsequently was that of [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], a fellow League of Nations delegate, who spoke of the range of Nansen's work, done with no regard for his own interests or health: \"Every good cause had his support. He was a fearless peacemaker, a friend of justice, an advocate always for the weak and suffering.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 276</ref>\n\nNansen had been a pioneer and innovator in many fields. As a young man he embraced the revolution in skiing methods that transformed it from a means of winter travel to a universal sport, and quickly became one of Norway's leading skiers. He was later able to apply this expertise to the problems of polar travel, in both his Greenland and his ''Fram'' expeditions. He invented the \"Nansen sledge\" with broad, ski-like runners, the \"Nansen cooker\" to improve the heat efficiency of the standard spirit stoves then in use, and the layer principle in polar clothing, whereby the traditionally heavy, awkward garments were replaced by layers of lightweight material. In science, Nansen is recognised both as one of the founders of modern [[neurology]],<ref>{{cite journal | last = Haas | first = L.F. | title = Neurological stamp: Fridtjof Nansen (1861\u20131930) | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.74.4.515 | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | year = 2003 | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 515| pmc = 1738364 | pmid=12640078}} {{subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Wyke | first = Barry | title = Fridtjof Nansen GCVO: A Note on his Contribution to Neurology on the Occasion of the Centenary of his birth | journal = Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 243\u2013252 | date = April 1962|pmc=2414154|pmid=14038096 }}</ref> and as a significant contributor to early oceanographical science, in particular for his work in establishing the Central Oceanographic Laboratory in Christiania.<ref>Huntford, pp. 475\u2013477</ref>\n\nThrough his work on behalf of the League of Nations, Nansen helped to establish the principle of international responsibility for refugees.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hassell | first = James E. | title = Russian Refugees in France and the United States Between the World Wars | url = https://books.google.com/?id=uUsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Nansen+New+York+Times#v=onepage&q=Nansen%20New%20York%20Times&f=false | journal = Transactions of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 81 | year = 1991 | page = 21 | isbn = 978-0-87169-817-9 }}</ref> Immediately after his death the League set up the [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]], a semi-autonomous body under the League's authority, to continue his work.

Baptista Nikolaus Raphael Peter Xavier Franz de Paula Venantius Felix'') ({{Lang-de|Friedrich August II;}} 18 May 1797 in [[Dresden]] &ndash; 9 August 1854 in [[Brennb\u00fcchel]], [[Karr\u00f6sten]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]) was [[monarch|King]] of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] and a member of the [[House of Wettin]].\n\nHe was the eldest son of [[Maximilian, Prince of Saxony]] &mdash; younger son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony &mdash; by his first wife, [[Princess Caroline of Parma|Caroline of Bourbon, Princess of Parma]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years===\nFrom his birth, it was clear that one day Frederick Augustus would become the ruler of Saxony. His father was the only son of the Elector Frederick Christian of Saxony who left surviving male issue. When the King Frederick Augustus I died (1827) and Anton succeeded him as King, Frederick Augustus became second in line to the throne, preceded only by his father Maximilian.\n\nHe was an officer in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]]. However, he had little interest in military affairs.\n\n===Co-Regent to the Kingdom===\nThe [[July Revolution]] of 1830 in [[France]] marked the beginning of disturbances in Saxony that autumn. The people claimed a change in the constitution and demanded a young regent of the kingdom to share the government with the King Anton. On 1 September the Prince Maximilian renounced his rights of succession in favor of his son Frederick Augustus, who was proclaimed Prince Co-Regent (de: ''Prinz-Mitregenten'') of Saxony. On 2 February 1832 Frederick Augustus brought Free Autonomy to the cities. Also, by an edict of 17 March of that year, the farmers were freed from the corv\u00e9e and hereditary submission.\n\n===King of Saxony===\nOn 6 June 1836, King Anton died and Frederick Augustus succeeded him. As an intelligent man, he was quickly popular with the people as he had been since the time of his regency. The new king solved political questions only from a pure sense of duty. Mostly he preferred to leave these things on the hands of his ministers.\n\nA standardized jurisdiction for Saxony created the [[Criminal Code]] of 1836. During the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|Revolutionary disturbances of 1848]] (March Revolution), he appointed liberal ministers in the government, lifted censorship, and remitted a liberal electoral law. Later his attitude changed. On 28 April Frederick August II dissolved the Parliament.  In 1849, Frederick Augustus was forced to flee to the [[K\u00f6nigstein Fortress]]. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|May Uprising]] was crushed by Saxon and [[Prussian Army|Prussian troops]] and Frederick was able to return after only a few days.\n\n===Journey through England and Scotland===\nIn 1844 Frederick Augustus, accompanied by his personal physician [[Carl Gustav Carus]], made an informal (''incognito'') visit to England and Scotland. Among places they visited were [[Lyme Regis]] where he purchased from the local fossil collector and dealer, [[Mary Anning]], an ichthyosaur skeleton for his own extensive natural history collection. It was not a state visit, but the King was the guest of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] at [[Windsor Castle]], visited many of the sights in [[London]] and in the university cities of [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], and toured widely in England, Wales and Scotland.<ref>C.G.Carus, ''The King of Saxony's Journey through England and Scotland, 1844'', english edition, London, Chapman and Hall, 1846 [https://archive.org/stream/kingofsaxonysjou00caru/kingofsaxonysjou00caru_djvu.txt]</ref>\n\n==Accidental Death==\nDuring a journey in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], he had an accident in Brennb\u00fcchel in which he fell in front of a horse that stepped on his head. On 8 August 1854, he died in the Gasthof Neuner. He was buried on 16 August in the [[Katholische Hofkirche]] of [[Dresden]]. In his memory, the Dowager Queen Maria arranged to establish the K\u00f6nigskapelle (King's Chapel) at the accident place, which was consecrated one year later, some of the last members of the Saxon royal family, including [[Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen]], are buried beside the chapel\n\n==Marriages==\nIn [[Vienna]] on 26 September 1819 (by proxy) and again in [[Dresden]] on 7 October 1819 (in person), Frederick Augustus married firstly with the [[Marie Caroline, Crown Princess of Saxony|Archduchess Maria Caroline of Austria]] (Maria Karoline Ferdinande Theresia Josephine Demetria), daughter of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]]. They had no children.\n\nIn [[Dresden]] on 24 April 1833 Frederick Augustus married secondly with the [[Maria Anna of Bavaria (1805-1877)|Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria]] (Maria Anna Leopoldine Elisabeth Wilhelmine), daughter of the King [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]]. Like his first marriage, this was childless.\n\nThe musician [[Theodor Uhlig]] (1822\u20131853) was an illegitimate son of Frederick Augustus.<ref>John Warrack, ''Uhlig, Theodor'', [[Oxford Music Online]],consulted 23.6.2010</ref>\n\nWithout legitimate issue, after his death Frederick Augustus was succeeded by his younger brother, [[John of Saxony|Johann]].\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

In a free market the laws and forces of [[supply and demand]] are free from any intervention by a [[Forms of government| government]], by a price-setting monopoly, or by other authority. Proponents of the concept of free market contrast it with a [[regulated market]], in which a government intervenes in supply and demand through various methods \u2014 such as [[tariff]]s \u2014 used to restrict trade and to protect the local economy. In an idealized [[free-market economy]], prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy.\n\nScholars contrast the concept of a free market with the concept of a [[Coordinated market economy| coordinated market]] in fields of study such as [[political economy]], [[new institutional economics]], [[economic sociology]], and [[political science]]. All of these fields emphasize the importance in actually existing market systems of rule-making institutions external to the simple forces of supply and demand which create space for those forces to operate to control productive output and distribution.\n\nAlthough free markets are commonly associated with [[capitalism]] within a [[market economy]] in contemporary usage and [[popular culture]], free markets have also been advocated by [[free-market anarchism| free-market anarchists]], [[market socialism |market socialists]], and some proponents of [[cooperative]]s and advocates of [[profit sharing]].<ref>{{cite book | last= Bockman |first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2011 |month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3}}</ref> Criticism of the theoretical concept may regard systems with significant [[market power]], [[inequality of bargaining power]], or [[information asymmetry]] as less than free, with regulation being necessary to control those imbalances in order to allow markets to function more efficiently as well as produce more desirable social outcomes.\n\n==Economic systems==\n\n===Laissez-faire economics===\n{{Libertarianism sidebar}}\n{{Liberalism sidebar}}\n{{Main|Laissez-faire}}\nThe laissez-faire principle expresses a preference for an absence of non-market pressures on prices and wages, such as those from discriminatory government taxes, subsidies, [[tariff]]s, regulations of purely private behavior, or [[government-granted monopoly|government-granted]] or [[coercive monopoly|coercive monopolies]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] argued in ''The Pure Theory of Capital'' that the goal is the preservation of the unique information contained in the price itself.<ref name=\"hayek_pure\">''The Pure Theory of Capital'', F.A. Hayek, 1941</ref>\n\nThe definition of ''free market'' has been disputed and made complex by collectivist political philosophers and socialist economic ideas.<ref name=\"Popper 1994\">{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Open Society and Its Enemies| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=1994 |isbn= 978-0-415-61021-6}}</ref> This contention arose from the divergence from [[Classical economics|classical economists]] such as [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], and from the continental [[Economics|economic science]] developed primarily by the Spanish scholastic and French classical economists, including [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]], [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]].\n\nDuring the [[Marginal utility#The Marginal Revolution|marginal revolution]], subjective value theory was rediscovered.<ref>{{cite book |last= Popper| first= Karl |title=The Poverty of Historicism| publisher= Routledge Classics|year=2002 |isbn= 0415278465}}</ref>\n\n===Socialist economics===\n{{Socialism sidebar}}\n\nVarious forms of [[socialism]] based on free markets have existed since the 19th century. Early notable socialist proponents of free markets include [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], and the [[Ricardian socialist]]s. These economists believed that genuinely free markets and [[voluntary exchange]] could not exist within the [[Exploitation (Marxism)|exploitative]] conditions of [[capitalism]].\n\nThese proposals ranged from various forms of [[worker cooperative]]s operating in a free market economy, such as the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] system proposed by Proudhon, to state-owned enterprises operating in unregulated and open markets. These models of socialism are not to be confused with other forms of market socialism (e.g. the [[Lange model]]) where publicly owned enterprises are coordinated by various degrees of [[economic planning]], or where capital good prices are determined through marginal cost pricing.\n\nAdvocates of free-market socialism such as [[Jaroslav Vanek]] argue that genuinely free markets are not possible under conditions of private ownership of productive property. Instead, he contends that the class differences and inequalities in income and power that result from private ownership enable the interests of the dominant class to skew the market to their favor, either in the form of monopoly and market power, or by utilizing their wealth and resources to legislate government policies that benefit their specific business interests.<ref>\"Cooperative Economics: An Interview with Jaroslav Vanek\", interview by Albert Perkins. Retrieved March 17, 2011: http://www.ru.org/51cooper.html</ref> Additionally, Vanek states that workers in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises have stronger incentives to maximize productivity because they would receive a share of the profits (based on the overall performance of their enterprise) in addition to receiving their fixed wage or salary.\n\nSocialists also assert that free market capitalism leads to an excessively skewed distribution of income, which in turn leads to social instability. As a result, corrective measures in the form of [[social welfare]], re-distributive taxation, and administrative costs are required, which end up being paid into workers hands who spend and help the economy to run. They claim corporate monopolies run rampant in free markets, with endless agency over the consumer. Thus, free market socialism desires government regulation of markets to prevent social instability, although at the cost of taxpayer dollars.<ref name=\"The Political Economy of Socialism 1982. pp. 197\u2013198\">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (pp. 197\u201398)</ref>\n\n===Geoist economics===\nAs explained above, for classical economists such as [[Adam Smith]] the term \"free market\" does not necessarily refer to a market free from government interference, but rather free from all forms of economic privilege, monopolies, and artificial scarcities.<ref name=\"Popper 1994\"/> This implies that [[economic rent]]s, i.e. profits generated from a lack of [[perfect competition]], must be reduced or eliminated as much as possible through free competition.\n\nEconomic theory suggests the returns to [[land]] and other [[natural resource]]s are economic rents that cannot be reduced in such a way because of their perfect inelastic supply.<ref>[[Adam Smith]], [[The Wealth of Nations]] [[s:The Wealth of Nations/Book V/Chapter 2|Book V, Chapter 2]], Part 2, Article I: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses</ref> Some economic thinkers emphasize the need to share those rents as an essential requirement for a well functioning market. It is suggested this would both eliminate the need for regular taxes that have a negative effect on trade (see [[deadweight loss]]) as well as release land and resources that are speculated upon or monopolised. Two features that improve the competition and free market mechanisms. [[Winston Churchill]] supported this view by his statement \"Land is the mother of all monopoly\".<ref>House Of Commons May 4th; King's Theatre, Edinburgh, July 17</ref>\n\nThe American economist and social philosopher [[Henry George]], the most famous proponent of this thesis, wanted to accomplish this through a high [[land value tax]] that replaces all other taxes.<ref>Backhaus, \"Henry George's Ingenious Tax,\" pp. 453\u201358.</ref> Followers of his ideas are often called [[Georgism|Georgists]] or Geoists and [[Geolibertarianism|Geolibertarians]].\n\n[[L\u00e9on Walras]], one of the founders of the [[neoclassical economics]] who helped formulate the [[general equilibrium theory]], had a very similar view. He argued that free competition could only be realized under conditions of state ownership of natural resources and land. Additionally, income taxes could be eliminated because the state would receive income to finance public services through owning such resources and enterprises.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 21|quote= For Walras, socialism would provide the necessary institutions for free competition and social justice. Socialism, in Walras's view, entailed state ownership of land and natural resources and the abolition of income taxes. As owner of land and natural resources, the state could then lease these resources to many individuals and groups, which would eliminate monopolies and thus enable free competition. The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref>\n\n===Non-laissez-faire capitalist systems===\nThe stronger incentives to maximize productivity that Vanek conceives as possible in a socialist economy based on cooperative and self-managed enterprises might be accomplished in a capitalistic free market if [[employee stock ownership plan|employee-owned companies]] were the norm, as envisioned by various thinkers including [[Louis O. Kelso]] and [[James S. Albus]].\n\n==Concepts==\n\n===Perfect competition and market failure===\n\nConditions that must exist for unregulated markets to behave as \"free markets\" are summarized at [[perfect competition]].  An absence of any of these perfect competition ideal conditions is a \"[[market failure]].\"  Most schools of economics allow that regulatory intervention may provide a substitute force to counter a market failure.  Under this thinking, this form of market regulation may be better than an unregulated market at providing a \"free market.\"\n\n===Supply and demand===\n{{Main|Supply and demand}}\nDemand for an item (such as goods or services) refers to the market pressure from people trying to buy it. Buyers have a maximum price they are willing to pay and sellers have a minimum price they are willing to offer their product. The point at which the supply and demand curves meet is the equilibrium price of the good and quantity demanded. Sellers willing to offer their goods at a lower price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|producer surplus]]. Buyers willing to pay for goods at a higher price than the equilibrium price receive the difference as [[economic surplus|consumer surplus]].<ref name=\"Judd1997\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0165-1889(97)00010-9| title = Computational economics and economic theory: Substitutes or complements?| journal = [[Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control]]| volume = 21| issue = 6| pages = 907\u201342| year = 1997| last1 = Judd | first1 = K. L.}}</ref>\n\nThe model is commonly applied to wages in the market for labor. The typical roles of supplier and consumer are reversed. The suppliers are individuals, who try to sell (supply) their labor for the highest price. The consumers are businesses, which try to buy (demand) the type of labor they need at the lowest price. As more people offer their labor in that market, the equilibrium wage decreases and the equilibrium level of employment increases as the supply curve shifts to the right. The opposite happens if fewer people offer their wages in the market as the supply curve shifts to the left.<ref name=\"Judd1997\" />\n\nIn a free market, individuals and firms taking part in these transactions have the liberty to enter, leave and participate in the market as they so choose. Prices and quantities are allowed to adjust according to economic conditions in order to reach equilibrium and properly allocate resources. However, in many countries around the world, governments seek to intervene in the free market in order to achieve certain social or political agendas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522012501/http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/ema_uk_he_sloman_econbus_3/18/4748/1215583.cw/ |archivedate=2014-05-22 |df= }}</ref> Governments may attempt to create [[social equality]] or [[equality of outcome]] by intervening in the market through actions such as imposing a [[minimum wage]] (price floor) or erecting [[price controls]] (price ceiling). Other lesser-known goals are also pursued, such as in the United States, where the federal government subsidizes owners of fertile land to not grow crops in order to prevent the supply curve from further shifting to the right and decreasing the equilibrium price. This is done under the justification of maintaining farmers' profits; due to the relative [[elasticity (economics)|inelasticity]] of demand for crops, increased supply would lower the price but not significantly increase quantity demanded, thus placing pressure on farmers to exit the market.<ref>{{cite news |title=Farm Program Pays $1.3 Billion to People Who Don't Farm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=3 June 2014 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/01/AR2006070100962.html }}</ref>  Such interventions are often done in the name of maintaining basic assumptions of free markets, such as the idea that the costs of production must be included in the price of goods.  Pollution and depletion costs are sometimes NOT included in the cost of production (a manufacturer that withdraws water at one location then discharges it polluted downstream, avoiding the cost of treating the water), so governments may opt to impose regulations in an attempt to try to internalize all of the cost of production (and ultimately include them in the price of the goods).\n\nAdvocates of the free market contend that government intervention hampers economic growth by disrupting the natural allocation of resources according to supply and demand, while critics of the free market contend that government intervention is sometimes necessary to protect a country's economy from better-developed and more influential economies, while providing the stability necessary for wise long-term investment.\n[[Milton Friedman]] pointed to failures of [[central planning]], [[price controls]] and [[government-owned corporation|state-owned corporations]], particularly in the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China#Economy|Communist China]],<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~esp2/WSJ%20Whitehouse%20Article.pdf Ip, Greg and Mark Whitehouse, \"How Milton Friedman Changed Economics, Policy and Markets\", ''Wall Street Journal Online'' (November 17, 2006).]</ref> while [[Ha-Joon Chang]] cites the examples of post-war Japan and the growth of South Korea's steel industry.<ref>\"[[Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism]]\", Ha-Joon Chang, Bloomsbury Press, {{ISBN|978-1596915985}}</ref>\n\n===Economic equilibrium===\n{{Main|Economic equilibrium}}\n[[General equilibrium theory]] has demonstrated, with varying degrees of mathematical rigor over time, that under certain conditions of [[Perfect Competition|competition]], the law of [[supply and demand]] predominates in this ideal free and competitive market, influencing prices toward an [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] that balances the demands for the products against the supplies.<ref>''Theory of Value'', by [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]]</ref> At these equilibrium prices, the market distributes the products to the purchasers according to each purchaser's preference (or utility) for each product and within the relative limits of each buyer's [[purchasing power]]. This result is described as market efficiency, or more specifically a [[Pareto optimum]].\n\nThis equilibrating behavior of free markets requires certain assumptions about their agents, collectively known as [[perfect competition]], which therefore cannot be results of the market that they create. Among these assumptions are several which are impossible to fully achieve in a real market, such as complete information, interchangeable goods and services, and lack of market power. The question then is what approximations of these conditions guarantee approximations of market efficiency, and which failures in competition generate overall market failures. Several [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prizes in Economics]] have been awarded for analyses of market failures due to [[asymmetric information]].\n\n===Low barriers to entry===\n{{main|Barriers to entry}}\nA free market does not require the existence of competition, however it does require a framework that allows new market entrants. Hence, in the lack of coercive barriers, and in markets with low entry cost it is generally understood that competition flourishes in a free-market environment. It often suggests the presence of the [[profit motive]], although neither a profit motive or profit itself are necessary for a free market.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All modern free markets are understood to include [[entrepreneur]]s, both individuals and [[business]]es. Typically, a modern free market economy would include other features, such as a [[stock exchange]] and a [[financial services]] sector, but they do not define it.\n\n===Spontaneous order===\n{{Main|Invisible hand|Spontaneous order}}\n[[Friedrich Hayek]] popularized the view that market economies promote [[spontaneous order]] which results in a better \"allocation of societal resources than any design could achieve.\"<ref>Hayek cited. Petsoulas, Christina. ''Hayek's Liberalism and Its Origins: His Idea of Spontaneous Order and the Scottish Enlightenment''. Routledge. 2001. p. 2</ref> According to this view, in market economies are characterized by the formation of complex transactional networks which produce and distribute goods and services throughout the economy. These networks are not designed, but nevertheless emerge as a result of decentralized individual economic decisions. The idea of spontaneous order is an elaboration on the [[invisible hand]] proposed by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''.  Smith wrote that the individual who:\n\n{{quote|By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest [an individual] frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the [common] good.|Adam Smith, ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''}}\n\nSmith pointed out that one does not get one's dinner by appealing to the brother-love of the butcher, the farmer or the baker. Rather one appeals to their self-interest, and pays them for their labor.\n\n{{quote|It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.|Adam Smith<ref>{{Cite book | last = Smith | first = Adam | author-link = Adam Smith | title = Wealth of Nations | place = London | publisher = W. Strahan and T.

They further believe that any attempt to implement central planning will result in more disorder, or a less efficient production and distribution of goods and services.\n\nCritics, such as political economist [[Karl Polanyi]], question whether a spontaneously ordered market can exist, completely free of \"distortions\" of political policy; claiming that even the ostensibly freest markets require a state to exercise coercive power in some areas \u2013 to enforce [[contract]]s, to govern the formation of [[labor union]]s, to spell out the rights and obligations of [[corporation]]s, to shape who has standing to bring legal actions, to define what constitutes an unacceptable [[conflict of interest]], etc.<ref>''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer \u2013 and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class'' by [[Jacob S. Hacker]] and [[Paul Pierson]], Simon & Schuster 2010, p. 55</ref>\n\n===General principles===\n[[The Heritage Foundation]], a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[think tank]], tried to identify the key factors necessary to measure the degree of freedom of economy of a particular country. In 1986 they introduced the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], which is based on some fifty variables. This and other similar indices do not ''define'' a free market, but measure the ''degree'' to which a modern economy is free, meaning in most cases, free of state intervention. The variables are divided into the following major groups:\n* Trade policy,\n* [[Fiscal burden of government]],\n* Government intervention in the economy,\n* Monetary policy,\n* Capital flows and foreign investment,\n* Banking and finance,\n* Wages and prices,\n* Property rights,\n* Regulation, and\n* Informal market activity.\nThese free market principles are what helped America transition to a free market economy. International free trade improved the country and in order for Americans to prosper from a strong economy they had no choice but to embrace it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 To The Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's|pages=313}}</ref> Each group is assigned a numerical value between 1 and 5; IEF is the arithmetical mean of the values, rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Saul, John\">Saul, John ''The End of Globalism''.</ref> While its supporters argue that only a free market can create healthy competition and therefore more business and reasonable prices, opponents say that a free market in its purest form may result in the opposite. According to Klein and Ralston, the merging of companies into giant corporations or the privatization of government-run industry and national assets often result in monopolies (or oligopolies) requiring government intervention to [[Competition law|force competition]] and reasonable prices.<ref name=\"The End of Globalism. Saul, John\"/> Another form of market failure is [[speculation]], where transactions are made to profit from short term fluctuation, rather from the [[intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]] of the companies or products.\n\nThis criticism has been challenged by historians such as [[Lawrence Reed]], who argued that monopolies have historically failed to form even in the absence of anti-trust law.<ref>[https://fee.org/articles/41-rockefellers-standard-oil-company-proved-that-we-needed-anti-trust-laws-to-fight-such-market-monopolies/ \"Cliche #41: \u201cRockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil Company Proved That We Needed Anti-Trust Laws to Fight Such Market Monopolies\"], ''[[The Freeman]]'', January 23, 2015.

[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] support market roles for government, such as using fiscal policy for economic stimulus when actions in the private sector lead to sub-optimal economic outcomes of [[depression (economics)|depressions]] or [[recession]]s.

The black market produces wholly unregulated goods, and are purchased and consumed unregulated.

The alternative view is that the black market is not a free market at all since high prices and monopolies are often enforced through murder, theft and destruction. Black markets can only exist peripheral to regulated markets where laws are being regularly enforced. \n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Binary economics]]\n* [[Black market]]\n* [[Crony capitalism]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Free trade]]\n* [[Freedom of choice]]\n* [[Grey market]]\n* [[Neoliberalism]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Quasi-market]]\n* [[Self-managed economy]]\n* [[Transparency (market)]]\n* [[Index of Economic Freedom]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Fred L.

Ford/Shelby chassis #P-1075, which won in 1968 and 1969, is the first car in Le Mans history to win the race more than once, using the same chassis. Using an American Ford V-8 engine, originally of 4.7-liter displacement capacity ([[Ford Windsor engine#289 HiPo (K-code)|289]] cubic inches), it was later enlarged to the 4.9-liter engine ([[Ford Windsor engine#302|302]] cubic inches), with custom designed alloy [[Dan Gurney|Gurney]]\u2013[[Weslake]] [[cylinder head]]s.\n\nThe car was named the '''GT''' (for [[Grand tourer|Grand Touring]]) with the '''40''' representing its overall height of 40&nbsp;inches (1.02 m, measured at the windshield) as required by the rules. Large-displacement Ford V8 engines (4.2-liter, 4.7-liter and 7-liter) were used, compared with the Ferrari V12, which displaced 3.0 liters or 4.0 liters.\n\nEarly cars were simply named \"Ford GT\". The name \"GT40\" was the name of Ford's project to prepare the cars for the international endurance racing circuit, and the quest to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The first 12 \"prototype\" vehicles carried serial numbers GT-101 through GT-112. The \"production\" began and the subsequent cars\u2014the MkI, MkII, MkIII, and MkV (with the exception of the MkIV, which were numbered J1-J12)\u2014were numbered GT40P/1000 through GT40P/1145, and thus officially \"GT40s\". The name of Ford's project, and the serial numbers dispel the story that \"GT40\" was \"only a nickname.\"\n\nThe contemporary [[Ford GT]] is a modern homage to the GT40.\n\n== History ==\n[[Henry Ford II]] had wanted a Ford at Le Mans since the early 1960s. In early 1963, Ford reportedly received word through a European intermediary that [[Enzo Ferrari]] was interested in selling to Ford Motor Company. Ford reportedly spent several million dollars in an audit of Ferrari factory assets and in legal negotiations, only to have Ferrari unilaterally cut off talks at a late stage due to disputes about the ability to direct open wheel racing. Ferrari, who wanted to remain the sole operator of his company's motor sports division, was angered when he was told that he would not be allowed to race at the [[Indianapolis 500]] if the deal went through since Ford fielded Indy cars using its own engine, and didn't want competition from Ferrari. Enzo cut the deal off out of spite and Henry Ford II, enraged, directed his racing division to find a company that could build a Ferrari-beater on the world endurance-racing circuit.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1019613496|title=Ford GT40.|last=Ray.|first=Hutton,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781907085680|location=|pages=12|oclc=1019613496}}</ref>\n\nTo this end Ford began negotiation with [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]].

[[Colin Chapman]] probably had similar views as he asked a high price for his contribution and insisted that the car (which became the [[Lotus Europa]]) should be named a Lotus-Ford.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Lola Mk6 GT front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lola Mk6]] ]]\nThe Lola proposal was chosen, since Lola had used a Ford V8 engine in their mid-engined [[Lola Mk6]] (also known as Lola GT). It was one of the most advanced racing cars of the time, and made a noted performance in Le Mans 1963, even though the car did not finish, due to low gearing and slow revving out on the [[Mulsanne Straight]]. However, [[Eric Broadley]], Lola Cars' owner and chief designer, agreed on a short-term personal contribution to the project without involving Lola Cars.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe agreement with Broadley included a one-year collaboration between Ford and Broadley, and the sale of the two Lola Mk 6 chassis builds to Ford.

Three weeks later at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], all three entries retired although the Ginther/Gregory car led the field from the second lap until its first pitstop. After a season-long series of dismal results under John Wyer in 1964, the program was handed over to [[Carroll Shelby]] after the 1964 Nassau race. The cars were sent directly to Shelby, still bearing the dirt and damage from the Nassau race. Carroll Shelby was noted for complaining that the cars were poorly maintained when he received them, but later information revealed the cars were packed up as soon as the race was over, and FAV never had a chance to clean, and organize the cars to be transported to Shelby.\n\nShelby's first victory came on their maiden race with the Ford program, with Ken Miles and Lloyd Ruby taking a Shelby American-entered Ford GT <ref>[http://www.racingsportscars.com/covers/_Daytona-1965-02-28e.jpg ''Entries for the fourth annual Daytona Continental'', 1965 Daytona Speedweeks Program No 2, 15-28 February 1965, www.racingsportscars.com] Retrieved 7 June 2015</ref> to victory in the [[24 Hours of Daytona#2000 km distance|Daytona 2000 in February 1965]]. One month later Ken Miles and Bruce McLaren came in second overall (to the winning Chaparral in the sports class) and first in prototype class at the Sebring 12-hour race. The rest of the season, however, was a disappointment.\n\n[[File:Ford GT40.JPG|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk I road version]]\nThe experience gained in 1964 and 1965 allowed the 7-liter Mk II to dominate the following year. In February, the GT40 again won at Daytona. This was the first year [[24 Hours of Daytona#24 Hour duration .281966.E2.80.931971.29|Daytona was run in the 24 Hour format]] and Mk II's finished 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In March, at the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring]], GT40's again took all three top finishes with the X-1 Roadster first, a Mk. II taking second, and a Mk. I in third. Then in June at the [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] the GT40 achieved yet another 1-2-3 result.\n\nThe Le Mans finish, however, was clouded in controversy: in the final few hours, the Ford GT of New Zealanders [[Bruce McLaren]] and [[Chris Amon]] closely trailed the leading Ford GT driven by Englishman [[Ken Miles]] and New Zealander [[Denny Hulme]]. With a multimillion-dollar program finally on the very brink of success, Ford team officials faced a difficult choice. They could allow the drivers to settle the outcome by racing each other \u2013 and risk one or both cars breaking down or crashing. They could dictate a finishing order to the drivers \u2013 guaranteeing that one set of drivers would be extremely unhappy. Or they could arrange a tie, with the McLaren/Amon and Miles/Hulme cars crossing the line side-by-side.\n\nThe team chose the last and informed McLaren and Miles of the decision just before the two got in their cars for the final stint. Then, not long before the finish, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO), organizers of the Le Mans event, informed Ford that the geographical difference in starting positions would be taken into account at a close finish.  This meant that the McLaren/Amon vehicle, which had started perhaps {{convert|60|ft|m}} behind the Hulme-Miles car, would have covered slightly more ground over the 24 hours and would therefore be the winner. Secondly, Ford officials admitted later, the company's contentious relationship with Miles, its top contract driver, placed executives in a difficult position. They could reward an outstanding driver who had been at times extremely difficult to work with, or they could decide in favour of drivers (McLaren/Amon) with less commitment to the Ford program but who had been easier to deal with. Ford stuck with the orchestrated photo finish but Miles, deeply bitter over this decision after his dedication to the program, issued his own protest by suddenly slowing just yards from the finish and letting McLaren across the line first. Miles died in a testing accident in the J-car (later to become the Mk IV) at Riverside (CA) Raceway just two months later.\n\nMiles' death occurred at the wheel of the Ford \"J-car\", an iteration of the GT40 that included several unique features. These included an aluminum honeycomb chassis construction and a \"breadvan\" body design that experimented with \"[[Kammback]]\" aerodynamic theories. Unfortunately, the fatal Miles accident was attributed at least partly to the unproven aerodynamics of the J-car design, as well as the experimental chassis' strength. The team embarked on a complete redesign of the car, which became known as the Mk IV. The Mk IV, a newer design with a Mk II engine but a different chassis and a different body, won [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|the following year at Le Mans]] (when four Mark IVs, three Mark IIs and three Mark Is raced). The high speeds achieved in that race caused a rule change, which already came in effect in 1968: the prototypes were limited to the capacity of 3.0 liters, the same as in [[Formula One]]. This took out the V12-powered [[Ferrari P#330 P 3/4 and P4|Ferrari 330P]] as well as the Chaparral and the Mk. IV.\n\nIf at least 50 cars had been built, sportscars like the GT40 and the [[Lola T70]] were allowed, with a maximum of 5.0&nbsp;L. [[John Wyer]]'s revised 4.7-liter (bored to 4.9 liter, and [[O-ring]]s cut and installed between the [[Cylinder block|block]] and [[Cylinder head|head]] to prevent [[head gasket]] failure, a common problem found with the 4.7 engine) Mk I. It won the [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 hours of Le Mans race in 1968]] against the fragile smaller prototypes. This result, added to four other round wins for the GT40, gave Ford victory in the [[1968 World Sportscar Championship|1968 International Championship for Makes]]. The GT40's intended 3.0&nbsp;L replacement, the [[Ford P68]], and Mirage cars proved a dismal failure. While facing more experienced prototypes and the new yet still unreliable 4.5&nbsp;L [[Flat-12 engine|flat-12]]-powered [[Porsche 917]]s, Wyer's [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans]] winners [[Jacky Ickx]]/[[Jackie Oliver]] managed to beat the remaining 3.0-liter [[Porsche 908]] by just a few seconds with the already outdated GT40 Mk I, in the very car that had won in 1968&nbsp;\u2014 the legendary GT40P/1075. Apart from brake wear in the Porsche and the decision not to change brake pads so close to the race end, the winning combination was relaxed driving by both GT40 drivers and heroic efforts at the right time by (at that time Le Mans' rookie) Ickx, who won Le Mans five more times in later years.\n\n=== Le Mans 24 Hour victories ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:skyBlue; text-align:center; border-bottom:3px solid;\"|Le Mans 24 Hour victories\n|-\n| || || || || || || Distance || colspan=\"2\"|Speed\n|-\n| Year || Car || Team || Drivers || Engine || Tire/Tyre || km || mph || km/h\n|-\n| [[1966 24 Hours of Le Mans|1966]] || GT40P/1046 (Mk&nbsp;II) || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American Inc.]] || {{Flagicon|New Zealand}} [[Bruce McLaren]]<br />{{Flagicon|New Zealand}} [[Chris Amon]] || [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] 7.0L V8 || {{Goodyear}} || 4843.09 || 130.98 || 210.80\n|-\n| [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans|1967]] || J5 (Mk&nbsp;IV) || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American Inc.]] || {{Flagicon|United States}} [[Dan Gurney]]<br />{{Flagicon|United States}} [[A.

Five prototype models were built with [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] bodywork, including the Ford X-1.<ref name=isr/>\n\nThe Mk.I met with little success in its initial tune for the 1964 and 1965 Le Mans races. The first success came after their demise at the Nassau Speed Weekend Nov 1964 when the racing was handed over to Carrol Shelby. Shelby's team modified the Ford GT40 and the first win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] February 1965 was achieved. Much was later modified and run by [[John Wyer]] in 1968 and 1969, winning Le Mans in both those years and [[Sebring International Raceway|Sebring]] in 1969. The Mk.II and IV were both obsolete after the [[FIA]] had changed the rules to ban unlimited capacity engines, ruling out the {{cvt|427|CID|L|1|order=flip}} Ford V8.

The car had an aluminum chassis built at Abbey Panels and was originally powered by a 4.7-liter (289&nbsp;ci) engine. The real purpose of this car was to test several improvements originating from Kar Kraft, Shelby and McLaren. Several gearboxes were used: a [[Hewland]] LG500 and at least one automatic gearbox. It was later upgraded to Mk.II specifications with a 7.0-liter (427&nbsp;ci) engine and a standard four ratio Kar Kraft (subsidiary of Ford) gearbox, however the car kept specific features such as its open roof and lightweight aluminum chassis. The car went on to win the [[1966 12 Hours of Sebring|12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1966. The X-1 was a one-off and having been built in the United Kingdom and being liable for United States [[tariff]]s, was later ordered to be destroyed by United States customs officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/2492.html|title=Ford GT40 X1|work=supercars.net}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Mk II ===\n[[File:Ford GT40 (rear).jpg|thumb|left|Ford GT40 Mk II rear]]\nThe Mk.II was very similar in appearance to the Mk.I, but it actually was a bit different from its predecessor. It used the [[Ford FE engine|7.0-liter FE (427 ci)]] engine from the [[Ford Galaxie]], which was an engine used in NASCAR at the time, but the engine was modified for road course use. The car's chassis was more or less the same as the British-built Mk.I chassis, but it and other parts of the car had to be redesigned and modified by Carroll Shelby's organization in order to accommodate the larger and heavier 427 engine. A new Kar Kraft-built four-speed gearbox (same as the one described above; Ford-designed, using Galaxie gearsets) was built to handle the more powerful engine, replacing the ZF five-speed used in the Mk.I. This car is sometimes called the ''Ford Mk.II''.\n\nIn 1966, the Mk.II dominated Le Mans, taking European audiences by surprise and beating Ferrari to finish 1-2-3 in the standings. After the success of these Mk.II cars, the Ford GT40 went on to win the race for the next three years.\n\nFor 1967, the Mk.IIs were upgraded to \"B\" spec; they had re-designed bodywork and twin carburetors for an additional 15&nbsp;hp. A batch of improperly heat treated input shafts in the transaxles sidelined virtually every Ford in the race at Daytona, however, and Ferrari won 1-2-3. The Mk.IIBs were also used for Sebring and Le Mans that year, and also it won the Reims 12 Hours in France. For the Daytona 24 Hours, two Mk II models (chassis 1016 and 1047) had their engines re-badged as Mercury engines. Mercury was a Ford Motor Company division at that time, and Mercury's 427 was exactly the same engine as Ford's with different logos. Ford saw a good opportunity to advertise that division of the company.\n\n=== Mk III ===\n[[File:1963 Ford GT40 Mk.III (6315540555).jpg|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk III]]\nThe Mk III was a road-car only, of which seven were built.<ref name=isr /> The car had four headlamps, the rear part of the body was expanded to make room for luggage, the 4.7-liter engine was detuned to {{convert|306|BHP||abbr=on}}, the shock absorbers were softened, the shift lever was moved to the center, an ash tray was added, and the car was available with the steering wheel on the left side of the car. As the Mk III looked significantly different from the racing models many customers interested in buying a GT40 for road use chose to buy a Mk I that was available from Wyer Ltd. Of the seven MK III that were produced four were left hand drive. One of these examples is currently on display at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]].\n\n=== J-car ===\n[[File:1967 GT40 Mk IV at 2010 Canadian International AutoShow.JPG|thumb|left|1967 Ford GT40 Mk IV, which was developed from the J-car. This particular car, J-4, won the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]]]]\nIn an effort to develop a car with better [[aerodynamics]] and lighter weight, it was decided to retain the 7-liter engine, but redesign the rest of the car and ditch the Mk.I/Mk.II chassis. In order to bring the car more \"in house\" and lessening partnership with English firms, Ford Advanced Vehicles was sold to [[John Wyer]] and the new car was designed by Ford's studios and produced by Ford's subsidiary Kar Kraft under [[Ed Hull]]. There was also a partnership with the [[Brunswick Aircraft Corporation]] for expertise on the novel use of honeycomb [[aluminium]] panels bonded together to form a lightweight, rigid \"tub\". The car was designated as the J-car, as it was constructed to meet the new Appendix J regulations <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/3406/Ford-Mk-IV.html|title=Ford Mk IV|accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref>\nwhich were introduced by the FIA in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|title=Appendix J to the International Sporting Code|accessdate=23 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302205843/http://www.fia.com/resources/documents/2102817986__Hist_App_J_69_Art_252_a.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2005|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first J-car was completed in March, 1966 and set the fastest time at the Le Mans trials that year. The tub weighed only {{convert|86|lb|abbr=on}}, and the entire car weighed only {{convert|2660|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|300|lb|abbr=on}} less than the Mk II. It was decided to run the MkIIs due to their proven reliability, however, and little or no development was done on the J-car for the rest of the season. Following Le Mans, the development program for the J-car was resumed, and a second car was built. During a test session at Riverside International Raceway in August 1966, with Ken Miles driving, the car suddenly went out of control at the end of Riverside's high-speed, 1-mile-long back straight. The honeycomb chassis did not live up to its design goal, shattering upon impact, bursting into flames and killing Miles. It was determined that the unique, flat-topped \"bread van\" aerodynamics of the car, lacking any sort of spoiler, were implicated in generating excess lift. Therefore, a more conventional but significantly more aerodynamic body was designed for the subsequent development of the J-car which was officially known as the Mk IV.<ref name=\"supercars.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/cars/694.html|title=1967 Ford GT40 Mark IV|accessdate=2010-02-23|work=supercars.net}}</ref> A total of nine cars were constructed with J-car chassis numbers although six were designated as Mk IVs and one as the G7A.<ref name=isr />\n\n=== Mk IV ===\n[[File:Ford GT40 Mk IV.jpg|thumb|right|Ford GT40 Mk IV]]\nThe Mk IV was built around a reinforced J chassis powered by the same 7.0 L engine as the Mk II. Excluding the engine, gearbox, some suspension parts and the brakes from the Mk.II, the Mk.IV was totally different from other GT40s, using a specific chassis and specific bodywork. It was undoubtedly the most radical and American variant of all the GT40's over the years. As a direct result of the Miles accident, the team installed a NASCAR-style steel-tube roll cage in the Mk.IV, which made it much safer, but the roll cage was so heavy that it negated most of the weight saving of the then-highly advanced, radically innovative honeycomb-panel construction. The Mk. IV had a long, streamlined shape, which gave it exceptional top speed, crucial to do well at Le Mans in those days (a circuit made up almost entirely of straights)- the race it was ultimately built for. A 2-speed automatic gearbox was tried, but during the extensive testing of the J-car in 1966 and 1967, it was decided that the 4-speed from the Mk.II would be retained. Dan Gurney often complained about the weight of the Mk.IV, since the car was {{convert|600|lb}} heavier than the Ferrari 330 P4's. During practice at Le Mans in 1967, in an effort to preserve the highly stressed brakes, Gurney developed a strategy (also adopted by co-driver A.J. Foyt) of backing completely off the throttle several hundred yards before the approach to the Mulsanne hairpin and virtually coasting into the braking area. This technique saved the brakes, but the resulting increase in the car's recorded lap times during practice led to speculation within the Ford team that Gurney and Foyt, in an effort to compromise on chassis settings, had hopelessly \"dialed out\" their car. The car proved to be fastest in a straight line that year, thanks to its streamlined aerodynamics, achieveing 212&nbsp;mph on the 3.6-mile [[Mulsanne Straight]].\n\nThe Mk. IV ran in only two races, the [[1967 12 Hours of Sebring]] and the [[1967 24 Hours of Le Mans]] and won both events. Only one Mk.IV was completed for Sebring; the pressure from Ford had been amped up considerably after Ford's humiliation at Daytona two months earlier. [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Bruce McLaren]] won Sebring, [[Dan Gurney]] and [[A. J. Foyt]] won Le Mans (Gurney and Foyt's car was the Mk.IV that was apparently least likely to win), where the Ford-representing Shelby-American and Holman & Moody teams showed up to Le Mans with 2 Mk.IV's each.<ref name=\"supercars.net\" /> The installation of the roll cage was ultimately credited by many with saving the life of Andretti, who crashed violently at the Esses during the 1967 Le Mans 24 Hours, but escaped with minor injuries.\n\nUnlike the earlier Mk.I - III cars, which were built in England, the Mk.IVs were built in the United States by Kar Kraft. Le Mans 1967 remains the only truly all-American victory in Le Mans history&nbsp;\u2014 American drivers, team, chassis, engine and tires. A total of six Mk IVs were constructed.<ref name=isr /> One of the Mk IVs was rebuilt to the [[Ford G7]] in 1968, and used in the Can-Am series for 1969 and 1970, but with no success. This car is sometimes called the ''Ford Mk.IV''.<ref name=isr />\n{{Clear}}\n\n;MkV\nPeter Thorp had searched years looking for a GT40 in good condition. Most of the cars had problems including the dreaded rust issue. His company, Safir Engineering, was building and fielding [[Formula 3]] race cars, in addition had a Token Formula One car purchased from the [[Ron Dennis]] Company, Rondell Racing. Formula One events in which Safir Engineering competed included [[Brands Hatch]] and [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]. Safir was also redesigning [[Range Rover]]s modifying the unit to six wheel drive, and exporting them to foreign markets. Safir technical capabilities were such that they could rebuild GT40s. It was with this in mind that Thorp approached John Willment for his thoughts. Wilment was of the same mindset, and discussions between the two were positive. It was soon decided that there would be a limited, further run of the significant GT40. JW Engineering would oversee the build, and Safir was to do the work. The continued JW Engineering/Safir Engineering production would utilize sequential serial numbers starting at the last used GT40 serial number, and move forward. Maintaining the GT40 Mark nomenclature, this continued production would be named GT40 MkV. These cars would carry JW Engineering chassis plates identical to those on all the GT40s produced by JW Engineering.\n\nJW Engineering wished to complete the GT40 chassis numbers GT40P-1087, 1088 and 1089. This was supposed to take place prior to the beginning of Safir production, however the completion of these three chassis\u2019 was very much delayed.\n\nFord\u2019s Len Bailey was hired to inspect the proposed build and engineer any changes he thought prudent to ensure the car was safe, as well as minimize problems experienced in the past. Baily changed the front suspension to [[Alan Mann Racing|Alan Mann]] specifications, which minimized nose dive under braking. Zinc coated steel replaced the previous uncoated rust prone sheet metal. The vulnerable drive donuts were replaced with CV joints and the leak prone rubber gas tanks were replaced with aluminum tanks. The GT40 chassis was upgraded without making any major changes.\n\nTennant Panels supplied the roof structure and the balance of the chassis was completed by Safir. JW Engineering employees were used where ever possible. Bill Pink, noted for his electrical experience and the wiring installation of previous GT40 automobiles, was brought in. Also, Jim Rose was hired for his experienced with working at both Alan Mann and Shelby. After the manufacture of chassis 1120, John Etheridge of JW Engineering was hired to manage the GT40 build. The chassis was supplied from Adams McCall Engineering and parts supplied from Tennant panels.\n\nFor the most part, the MkV resembled very closely the MkI car, although there were a few changes, and, as with the 60s production, very few cars were identical.\n\nThe first car, GT40P-1090, had an open top in place of roofed doors. Most motors were Ford small block, Webers or 4 Barrel Carburetor. Safir produced five Big Block GT40s, serial numbers GT40P-1128 to GT40P-1132. These aluminium big block cars all had easily removable door roof sections. Most GT40s were high performance street cars however some of the MkV production can be described as full race. Two road cars GT40P-1133 (roadster) and GT40P-1142 (roofed doors) were built as lightweights which included an aluminium honeycomb chassis and carbon fiber bodywork.\n\nComplete files on each of these forty cars have been forwarded to authors and journalists known for maintaining accurate records on the GT40 automobile.\n\n=== Continuation models, replicas and modernizations ===\n[[File:Ford GT40 P-2090 at Road America.jpg|thumb|right| GT40/R Competition at [[Road America]] ]]\n[[File:1965 Ford GT40.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A \"Roaring Forties\" replica of a 1965 Ford GT40 in Shelby livery on display at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]]]]\nSeveral [[kit car]]s and replicas inspired by the Ford GT40 have been built.

Three production prototype cars were shown in 2003 as part of Ford's centenary, and delivery of the production Ford GT began in the fall of 2004. The Ford GT was assembled in the Ford Wixom plant and painted by [[Saleen|Saleen, Incorporated]] at their [[Saleen Special Vehicles]] plant in [[Troy, Michigan]].\n\nA British company, [[Safir Engineering]], who continued to produce a limited number of GT40s (the '''MkV''') in the 1980s under an agreement with Walter Hayes of Ford and John Wilment of J.W. Automotive Engineering, owned the GT40 trademark at that time, and when they completed production, they sold the excess parts, tooling, design, and trademark to a small American company called '''Safir GT40 Spares, Limited''' based in [[Ohio]]. Safir GT40 Spares licensed the use of the GT40 trademark to Ford for the initial 2002 show car, but when Ford decided to make the production vehicle, negotiations between the two failed, and as a result the new Ford GT does not wear the badge GT40. Bob Wood, one of three partners who own Safir GT40 Spares, said: \"When we talked with Ford, they asked what we wanted. We said that Ford owns Beanstalk in New York, the company that licenses the Blue Oval for Ford on such things as T-shirts. Since Beanstalk gets 7.5 percent of the retail cost of the item for licensing the name, we suggested 7.5 percent on each GT40 sold.\"<ref name=\"Nixed\">{{Cite news|title=A GT by any other name is nixed by Ford|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=Chicago|date=31 October 2003|first=Jim|last=Mateja|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119462642.html|accessdate=23 June 2014}} {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> In this instance, Ford wished to purchase, not just license the GT40 trademark. At the then-estimated $125,000 per copy, 7.5% of 4,500 vehicles would have totalled approximately $42,187,500.<ref name=\"Nixed\" /> It was widely and erroneously reported following an ''Automotive News Weekly'' story that Safir \"demanded\" the $40 million for the sale of the trademark. Discussions between Safir and Ford ensued. However, in fact, the Ford Motor Company never made an offer in writing to purchase the famed GT40 trademark. Later models or prototypes have also been called the Ford GT but have had different numbering on them such as the Ford GT90 or the Ford GT70. The GT40 name and trademark is currently licensed to Superformance in the USA.\n\nA second-generation Ford GT was unveiled at the 2015 [[North American International Auto Show]]. It features a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 engine, carbon fiber monocoque and body panels, pushrod suspension and active aerodynamics. It will compete in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|United SportsCar Championship]].\n\n== GT40 Guitars ==\n[[File:Gulf GT40 Guitar.jpg|thumb|Gulf livery GT40 Guitar representing GT40 Chassis P1075]]\nOn August 31, 2017, Safir GT40 Spares announced the release of the GT40 Victory Series, a limited production run of 400 electric guitars commemorating the GT40's racing history.

The predominant pathway in animals and plants is the reverse of the glycine synthase pathway mentioned above. In this context, the enzyme system involved is usually called the [[glycine cleavage system]]:<ref name=\"Lehninger\"/>\n: Glycine + tetrahydrofolate + NAD<sup>+</sup> \u21cc CO<sub>2</sub> + NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} + ''N<sup>5</sup>'',''N<sup>10</sup>''-Methylene tetrahydrofolate + [[NADH]] + H<sup>+</sup>\n\nIn the second pathway, glycine is degraded in two steps.

When [[glycine receptors]] are activated, [[chloride]] enters the neuron via ionotropic receptors, causing an [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] (IPSP). [[Strychnine]] is a strong antagonist at ionotropic glycine receptors, whereas [[bicuculline]] is a weak one. Glycine is a required [[co-agonist]] along with [[glutamate]] for [[NMDA receptor]]s. In contrast to the inhibitory role of glycine in the spinal cord, this behaviour is facilitated at the ([[NMDA]]) [[glutamatergic]] receptors which are excitatory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmj.org/Periodical/paperlist.asp?id=LW7347&linkintype=pubmed |title=Recent development in NMDA receptors |year=2000 |publisher=Chinese Medical Journal}}</ref>  The {{LD50}} of glycine is 7930&nbsp;mg/kg in rats (oral),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/GL/glycine.html |title=Safety (MSDS) data for glycine |year=2005 |publisher= The Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory Oxford University |accessdate=2006-11-01}}</ref> and it usually causes death by hyperexcitability.\n\n==Uses==\nIn the US, glycine is typically sold in two grades: [[United States Pharmacopeia]] (\u201cUSP\u201d), and technical grade.

Where the customer\u2019s purity requirements exceed the minimum required under the USP standard, for example for some pharmaceutical applications such as intravenous injections, pharmaceutical grade glycine, often produced to proprietary specifications and typically sold at a premium over USP grade glycine, may be used.

The sound of the vibrating strings is projected either acoustically, by means of the hollow chamber of the guitar (for an [[acoustic guitar]]), or through an [[guitar amplifier|electrical amplifier and a speaker]].\n\nThe guitar is a type of [[chordophone]], traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, [[nylon]] or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the [[gittern]], the [[vihuela]], the four-[[course (music)|course]] [[Renaissance guitar]], and the five-course [[baroque guitar]], all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.\n\nThere are three main types of modern [[acoustics|acoustic]] guitar: the [[classical guitar]] (nylon-string guitar), the [[steel-string acoustic guitar]], and the [[archtop guitar]], which is sometimes called a \"[[jazz guitar]]\". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a [[Helmholtz resonance|resonating chamber]]. The classical guitar is often played as a [[solo (music)|solo]] instrument using a comprehensive [[fingerpicking|finger-picking]] technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term \"finger-picking\" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States. The [[acoustic bass guitar]] is a low-pitched instrument that is one octave below a regular guitar.\n\n[[Electric guitar]]s, introduced in the 1930s, use an [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]] that both makes the sound of the instrument loud enough for the performers and audience to hear, and, given that it produces an electric signal when played, that can electronically manipulate and shape the tone using [[graphic equalizer|an equalizer]] (e.g., bass and treble tone controls) and a huge variety of electronic [[effects unit]]s, the most commonly used ones being [[distortion (music)|distortion (or \"overdrive\")]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]. Early amplified guitars employed a hollow body, but a solid wood body was eventually found more suitable during the 1960s and 1970s, as it was less prone to unwanted [[acoustic feedback]] \"howls\". As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including [[Semi-acoustic guitar|hollowbody guitars]], [[archtop guitar]]s (used in [[jazz guitar]], [[blues]] and [[rockabilly]]) and [[Solid body|solid-body guitar]]s, which are widely used in [[rock music]].\n\nThe loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of [[blues]] and [[rock music]], both as an [[accompaniment]] instrument (playing [[riff]]s and [[chord (music)|chord]]s) and performing [[guitar solo]]s, and in many rock subgenres, notably [[heavy metal music]] and [[punk rock]]. The electric guitar has had a major influence on [[popular culture]]. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[flamenco]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[jota (music)|jota]], [[mariachi]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[reggae]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], and many forms of [[pop music|pop]].\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Lute#History and evolution of the lute|Gittern|Citole#Origins|Classical guitar#History}}\n[[File:Guitar-like plucked instrument, Carolingian Psalter, 9th century manuscript, 108r part, Stuttgart Psalter.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration labeled \"[[cythara]]\" in the [[Stuttgart Psalter]], a [[Carolingian]] [[psalter]] from the 9th century. The instrument shown is of the [[chordophone]] family, possibly an early [[citole]] or [[lute]]]]\nBefore the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having \"a long, fretted neck, flat wooden [[sound board (music)|soundboard]], ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides.\"{{sfn|Kasha 1968|pp=3\u201312}} The term is used to refer to a number of [[chordophone]]s that were developed and used across Europe, beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.{{sfn|Wade 2001|p=10}} A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a [[Hittites|Hittite]] bard playing a stringed instrument is the oldest iconographic representation of a chordophone and clay plaques from [[Babylonia]] show people playing an instrument that has a strong resemblance to the guitar, indicating a possible [[Babylonia]]n origin for the guitar.{{sfn|Kasha 1968|pp=3\u201312}}\n\nThe modern word ''guitar,'' and its antecedents, has been applied to a wide variety of chordophones since classical times and as such causes confusion. The English word ''guitar,'' the German ''{{lang|de|Gitarre}},'' and the French ''{{lang|fr|guitare}}'' were all adopted from the Spanish ''{{lang|es|guitarra}},'' which comes from the [[Andalusian Arabic]] {{lang|xaa|\u0642\u064a\u062b\u0627\u0631\u0629}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|q\u012bth\u0101rah}}''){{sfn|Farmer 1930|p=137}} and the Latin ''{{lang|la|cithara}},'' which in turn came from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03b9\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|[[kithara]]}}'').{{refn|''Kithara'' appears in the Bible four times (1 Cor. 14:7, Rev. 5:8, 14:2 and 15:2), and is usually translated into English as ''harp.''{{sfn|Strong 1890|p=2788}} |group=upper-alpha}} which comes from Persian word Sihtar.

Although the development of the earliest \"guitars\" is lost in the history of medieval Spain, two instruments are commonly cited as their most influential predecessors, the European [[lute]] and its cousin, the four-string [[oud]]; the latter was brought to Iberia by the [[Moors]] in the 8th century.{{sfn|Summerfield 2003}}\n\nAt least two instruments called \"guitars\" were in use in Spain by 1200: the ''{{lang|la|[[guitarra latina]]}}'' (Latin guitar) and the so-called ''{{lang|la|[[guitarra morisca]]}}'' (Moorish guitar). The guitarra morisca had a rounded back, wide fingerboard, and several sound holes. The guitarra Latina had a single sound hole and a narrower neck. By the 14th century the qualifiers \"moresca\" or \"morisca\" and \"latina\" had been dropped, and these two cordophones were simply referred to as guitars.<ref>Tom and Mary Anne Evans. ''Guitars: From the Renaissance to Rock.'' Paddington Press Ltd 1977 p.16</ref>\n\nThe Spanish [[vihuela]], called in Italian the \"{{lang|la|viola da mano}}\", a guitar-like instrument of the 15th and 16th centuries, is widely considered to have been the single most important influence in the development of the baroque guitar. It had six courses (usually), lute-like [[guitar tunings|tuning]] in fourths and a guitar-like body, although early representations reveal an instrument with a sharply cut waist. It was also larger than the contemporary four-course guitars. By the 16th century, the vihuela's construction had more in common with the modern guitar, with its curved one-piece ribs, than with the viols, and more like a larger version of the contemporary four-[[course (music)|course]] guitars. The vihuela enjoyed only a relatively short period of popularity in Spain and Italy during an era dominated elsewhere in Europe by the [[lute]]; the last surviving published music for the instrument appeared in 1576.{{sfn|Turnbull et al}}\n\nMeanwhile, the five-course [[baroque guitar]], which was documented in Spain from the middle of the 16th century, enjoyed popularity, especially in Spain, Italy and France from the late 16th century to the mid-18th century.<ref group=upper-alpha>\"The first incontrovertible evidence of five-course instruments can be found in Miguel Fuenllana's ''Orphenica Lyre'' of 1554, which contains music for a ''vihuela de cinco ordenes.'' In the following year, Juan Bermudo wrote in his ''Declaracion de Instrumentos Musicales:'' 'We have seen a guitar in Spain with five courses of strings.' Bermudo later mentions in the same book that 'Guitars usually have four strings,' which implies that the five-course guitar was of comparatively recent origin, and still something of an oddity.\" Tom and Mary Anne Evans, ''Guitars: From the Renaissance to Rock.''

During the early seventeenth century the guitar was an instrument of the people of Spain, but was widely played by the Italian aristocracy.\" Tom and Mary Anne Evans.

Within each of these categories, there are also further sub-categories. For example, an electric guitar can be purchased in a six-string model (the most common model) or in seven or 12-string models.\n\n===Acoustic===\n{{Main|Acoustic guitar}}\n{{See also|Extended-range classical guitar|Flamenco guitar|Guitar battente|Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|Harp guitar|Russian guitar|Selmer guitar|Tenor guitar}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = romanza_espa\u00f1ola.ogg\n| title       = Classical Guitar Sample\n| description = Spanish Romance.\n}}\n\nAcoustic guitars form several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group: classical and [[flamenco guitar]]s; steel-string guitars, which include the flat-topped, or \"folk\", guitar; [[twelve-string guitar]]s; and the arched-top guitar. The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play in different registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a similar tuning to that of the electric bass guitar.\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\n{{Main|Baroque guitar}}\nRenaissance and Baroque guitars are the ancestors of the modern [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[flamenco guitar]]. They are substantially smaller, more delicate in construction, and generate less volume. The strings are paired in courses as in a modern [[12-string guitar]], but they only have four or five courses of strings rather than six single strings normally used now. They were more often used as rhythm instruments in ensembles than as solo instruments, and can often be seen in that role in [[early music]] performances. ([[Gaspar Sanz]]'s ''Instrucci\u00f3n de M\u00fasica sobre la Guitarra Espa\u00f1ola'' of 1674 contains his whole output for the solo guitar.)<ref>The Guitar (From The Renaissance To The Present Day) by Harvey Turnbull (Third Impression 1978) - Publisher: Batsford. p57 (Chapter 3 - The Baroque, Era Of The Five Course Guitar)</ref> [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] guitars are easily distinguished, because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the Baroque guitar is very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted \"wedding cake\" inside the hole.\n\n===Classical===\n{{Main|Classical guitar}}\nClassical guitars, also known as \"Spanish\" guitars \n<ref name=CMUSE>{{cite web |url=https://www.cmuse.org/what-is-a-classical-guitar/\n |title=What Is A Classical Guitar? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=April 18, 2017 |website=CMUSE |publisher=CMUSE |access-date=June 4, 2018 |quote=}}</ref> , are typically strung with nylon strings, plucked with the fingers, played in a seated position and are used to play a diversity of musical styles including [[European classical music|classical music]]. The classical guitar's wide, flat neck allows the musician to play scales, arpeggios, and certain chord forms more easily and with less adjacent string interference than on other styles of guitar. [[Flamenco guitar]]s are very similar in construction, but they are associated with a more percussive tone. In Portugal, the same instrument is often used with steel strings particularly in its role within [[fado]] music. The guitar is called [[viola]], or [[Seven-string guitar|viol\u00e3o]] in Brazil, where it is often used with an extra seventh string by [[choro]] musicians to provide extra bass support.\n\nIn Mexico, the popular [[mariachi]] band includes a range of guitars, from the small ''[[requinto]]'' to the ''[[guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]],'' a guitar larger than a cello, which is tuned in the bass register. In Colombia, the traditional quartet includes a range of instruments too, from the small ''[[bandola]]'' (sometimes known as the Deleuze-Guattari, for use when traveling or in confined rooms or spaces), to the slightly larger [[tiple]], to the full-sized classical guitar. The requinto also appears in other Latin-American countries as a complementary member of the guitar family, with its smaller size and scale, permitting more projection for the playing of single-lined melodies. Modern dimensions of the classical instrument were established by the Spaniard [[Antonio de Torres Jurado]] (1817\u20131892).<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Morrish\n|first=John\n|title=Antonio De Torres\n|work=\n|publisher=Guitar Salon International\n|date=\n|url=http://www.guitarsalon.com/articles.php?articleid=18\n|doi=\n|access-date=2011-05-08}}</ref>\n\n====Flat-top====\n[[File:Bernd Voss - Copito Blues guitar.ogv|thumb|A guitarist playing a blues tune on a semi-acoustic guitar]]\n{{Main|Steel-string acoustic guitar}}\nFlat-top or steel-string guitars are similar to the [[classical guitar]], however, within the varied sizes of the steel-stringed guitar the body size is usually significantly larger than a classical guitar, and has a narrower, reinforced neck and stronger structural design. The robust X-bracing typical of the steel-string was developed in the 1840s by German-American luthiers, of whom [[C.F. Martin|Christian Friedrich \"C. F.\" Martin]] is the best known. Originally used on gut-strung instruments, the strength of the system allowed the guitar to withstand the additional tension of steel strings when this fortunate combination arose in the early 20th century. The steel strings produce a brighter tone, and according to many players, a louder sound. The acoustic guitar is used in many kinds of music including folk, country, bluegrass, pop, jazz, and blues. Many variations are possible from the roughly classical-sized [[00 guitar|OO]] and [[Parlour guitar|Parlour]] to the large [[Dreadnought (guitar type)|Dreadnought]] (the most commonly available type) and [[Jumbo (guitar type)|Jumbo]]. [[Ovation Guitar Company|Ovation]] makes a modern variation, with a rounded back/side assembly molded from artificial materials.\n\n====Archtop====\n{{Main|Archtop guitar}}\nArchtop guitars are steel-string instruments in which the top (and often the back) of the instrument are carved, from a solid billet, into a curved, rather than a flat, shape. This violin-like construction is usually credited to the American [[Orville Gibson]]. [[Lloyd Loar]] of the [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co]] introduced the violin-inspired \"F\"-shaped hole design now usually associated with archtop guitars, after designing a style of [[mandolin]] of the same type. The typical archtop guitar has a large, deep, hollow body whose form is much like that of a mandolin or a violin-family instrument. Nowadays, most archtops are equipped with magnetic pickups, and they are therefore both acoustic and electric. F-hole archtop guitars were immediately adopted, upon their release, by both [[jazz]] and [[country music|country]] musicians, and have remained particularly popular in jazz music, usually with flatwound strings.\n\n====Resonator, resophonic or Dobros====\n[[File:JMT8stringguitar.jpg|right|thumb|An 8-string [[baritone guitar|baritone]] tricone [[resonator guitar]].]]\n{{Main|Resonator guitar|Dobro}}\nAll three principal types of resonator guitars were invented by the Slovak-American [[John Dopyera]] (1893\u20131988) for the National and Dobro ('''Do'''pyera '''Bro'''thers) companies. Similar to the flat top guitar in appearance, but with a body that may be made of brass, nickel-silver, or steel as well as wood, the sound of the resonator guitar is produced by one or more aluminum resonator cones mounted in the middle of the top. The physical principle of the guitar is therefore similar to the [[loudspeaker]].\n\nThe original purpose of the resonator was to produce a very loud sound; this purpose has been largely superseded by [[guitar amplifier|electrical amplification]], but the resonator guitar is still played because of its distinctive tone. Resonator guitars may have either one or three resonator cones. The method of transmitting sound resonance to the cone is either a \"biscuit\" bridge, made of a small piece of hardwood at the vertex of the cone (Nationals), or a \"spider\" bridge, made of metal and mounted around the rim of the (inverted) cone (Dobros). Three-cone resonators always use a specialized metal bridge. The type of resonator guitar with a neck with a square cross-section\u2014called \"square neck\" or \"Hawaiian\"\u2014is usually played face up, on the lap of the seated player, and often with a metal or glass [[slide guitar|slide]]. The round neck resonator guitars are normally played in the same fashion as other guitars, although slides are also often used, especially in blues.\n\n====Twelve-string ====\n{{Main|Twelve-string guitar}}\nThe [[twelve-string guitar]] usually has steel strings, and it is widely used in [[folk music]], [[blues]], and [[rock and roll]]. Rather than having only six strings, the 12-string guitar has six [[course (music)|courses]] made up of two strings each, like a [[mandolin]] or [[lute]]. The highest two courses are tuned in unison, while the others are tuned in octaves. The 12-string guitar is also made in electric forms. The chime-like sound of the 12-string electric guitar was the basis of [[jangle pop]].\n\n====Acoustic bass====\n[[File:Ashton ABG.JPG|thumb|Acoustic bass guitar]]\n{{Main|Acoustic bass guitar}}\nThe acoustic bass guitar is a bass instrument with a hollow wooden body similar to, though usually somewhat larger than, that of a 6-string acoustic guitar. Like the traditional [[bass guitar|electric bass guitar]] and the [[double bass]], the acoustic bass guitar commonly has four strings, which are normally tuned E-A-D-G, an [[octave]] below the lowest four strings of the 6-string guitar, which is the same tuning pitch as an electric bass guitar. It can, more rarely, be found with 5 or 6 strings, which provides a wider range of notes to be played with less movement up and down the neck.\n\n===Electric===\n{{Main|Electric guitar}}\n[[File:Eric-Clapton 1975.jpg|upright|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Eric Clapton]] playing his signature custom made \"[[Blackie (guitar)|Blackie]]\"\n [[Fender Stratocaster]]]]\nElectric guitars can have solid, semi-hollow, or hollow bodies; solid bodies produce little sound without amplification. [[Electromagnetism|Electromagnetic]] [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] convert the vibration of the steel strings into [[signal (electronics)|signals]], which are fed to an [[amplifier]] through a [[patch cable]] or [[radio]] [[transmitter]]. The sound is frequently modified by other electronic devices ([[effects units]]) or the natural [[distortion (music)|distortion]] of valves ([[vacuum tube]]s) or the pre-amp in the amplifier. There are two main types of magnetic pickups, [[single coil|single]]- and double-coil (or [[humbucker]]), each of which can be [[Active pickup|passive]] or [[Active pickup|active]]. The electric guitar is used extensively in [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[R & B]], and [[rock and roll]]. The first successful magnetic pickup for a guitar was invented by [[George Beauchamp]], and incorporated into the 1931 Ro-Pat-In (later [[Rickenbacker]]) [[Frying pan (guitar)|\"Frying Pan\"]] lap steel; other manufacturers, notably [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]], soon began to install pickups in archtop models. After World War II the completely solid-body electric was popularized by Gibson in collaboration with [[Les Paul]], and independently by [[Leo Fender]] of [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender Music]]. The lower fretboard [[Action (music)|action]] (the height of the strings from the fingerboard), lighter (thinner) strings, and its electrical amplification lend the electric guitar to techniques less frequently used on acoustic guitars. These include [[tapping]], extensive use of [[legato]] through [[pull-off]]s and [[hammer-on]]s (also known as slurs), [[pinch harmonic]]s, [[volume swells]], and use of a [[tremolo arm]] or [[effects pedals]].\n\nSome electric guitar models feature [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups, which function as [[transducer]]s to provide a sound closer to that of an acoustic guitar with the flip of a switch or knob, rather than switching guitars. Those that combine piezoelectric pickups and magnetic pickups are sometimes known as hybrid guitars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarnoize.com/blog/category/hybrid-guitars/ |title=Hybrid guitars |publisher=Guitarnoize.com |date= |access-date=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225153202/http://www.guitarnoize.com/blog/category/hybrid-guitars |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nHybrids of acoustic and electric guitars are also common. There are also more exotic varieties, such as guitars with [[double neck guitar|two]], three,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vai.com/Machines/guitarpages/guitar040.html |title=The Official Steve Vai Website: The Machines |publisher=Vai.com |date=1993-08-03 |access-date=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130043815/http://www.vai.com/Machines/guitarpages/guitar040.html |archivedate=2010-01-30 |df= }}</ref> or rarely four necks, all manner of alternate string arrangements, [[fretless guitar|fretless fingerboards]] (used almost exclusively on bass guitars, meant to emulate the sound of a [[Double bass|stand-up bass]]), [[5.1 surround guitar]], and such.\n\n====Seven-string and eight-string ====\n{{Main|Seven-string guitar|eight-string guitar}}\nSolid body seven-string guitars were popularized in the 1980s and 1990s. Other artists go a step further, by using an eight-string guitar with two extra low strings. Although the most common seven-string has a low B string, [[Roger McGuinn]] (of [[The Byrds]] and [[Rickenbacker]]) uses an octave G string paired with the regular G string as on a 12-string guitar, allowing him to incorporate chiming 12-string elements in standard six-string playing. In 1982 [[Uli Jon Roth]] developed the \"Sky Guitar\", with a vastly extended number of frets, which was the first guitar to venture into the upper registers of the violin. Roth's seven-string and \"Mighty Wing\" guitar features a wider octave range.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n====Electric bass ====\n{{Main|Bass guitar}}\n[[File:J&J Precision Bass \u201cRoi du Soleil\u201d (JJ004).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A [[Fender Precision Bass]]-style bass guitar.]]\nThe bass guitar (also called an \"electric bass\", or simply a \"bass\") is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and four to six strings. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one octave lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). (The bass guitar is a [[transposing instrument]], as it is notated in [[bass clef]] an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive [[ledger line]]s.{{Technical statement|date=December 2017}}) Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and it is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.\n\n==Construction==\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Acoustic guitar parts.png|width1=216\n| image2 = Electric guitar parts.jpg|width2=175\n| footer = {{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n#[[Guitar#Headstock|Headstock]]\n#[[Guitar#Nut|Nut]]\n#[[Machine head]]s (or pegheads, tuning keys, tuning machines, tuners)\n#[[Guitar#Frets|Frets]]\n#[[Guitar#Truss rod|Truss rod]]\n#[[Guitar#Inlays|Inlays]]\n#[[Guitar#Neck|Neck]]\n#[[Guitar#Neck joint or \"heel\"|Heel&nbsp;(acoustic)]] Neckjoint (electric)\n#[[Guitar#Body (acoustic guitar)|Body]]\n#[[Guitar#Pickups|Pickups]]\n#[[Guitar#Electronics|Electronics]]\n#[[Guitar#Bridge|Bridge]]\n#[[Guitar#Pickguard|Pickguard]]\n#Back\n#[[Sound board (music)|Soundboard]] (top)\n#Body sides (ribs)\n#[[Sound hole]], with [[Rosette (design)|Rosette]] inlay\n#[[Guitar#Strings|Strings]]\n#[[Saddle (guitar)|Saddle]]\n#[[Guitar#Fretboard|Fretboard]] (or Fingerboard)\n{{div col end}}\n}}\n\n===Handedness===\nModern guitars can be constructed to suit both left- and right-handed players. Normally, the dominant hand (in most people, the right hand) is used to pluck or strum the strings. This is similar to the convention of the [[violin]] family of instruments where the right hand controls the bow.\n\nLeft-handed players sometimes choose an opposite-handed (mirror) instrument, although some play in a standard-handed manner, others play a standard-handed guitar reversed, and still others (for example [[Jimi Hendrix]]) played a standard-handed guitar strung in reverse. This last configuration differs from a true opposite handed guitar in that the saddle is normally angled in such a way that the bass strings are slightly longer than the treble strings to improve [[intonation (music)|intonation]]. Reversing the strings, therefore, reverses the relative orientation of the saddle, adversely affecting intonation, although in Hendrix's case, this is believed to have been an important element in his unique sound.\n\n===Components===\n====Head====\n{{Main|Headstock}}\n{{See also|Nut (string instrument)}}\nThe headstock is located at the end of the guitar neck farthest from the body. It is fitted with machine heads that adjust the tension of the strings, which in turn affects the pitch. The traditional tuner layout is \"3+3\", in which each side of the headstock has three tuners (such as on [[Gibson Les Paul]]s). In this layout, the headstocks are commonly symmetrical. Many guitars feature other layouts, including six-in-line tuners (featured on [[Fender Stratocaster]]s) or even \"4+2\" (e.g. Ernie Ball Music Man). Some guitars (such as [[Steinberger]]s) do not have headstocks at all, in which case the tuning machines are located elsewhere, either on the body or the bridge.\n\nThe nut is a small strip of [[bone]], [[plastic]], [[brass]], [[corian]], [[graphite]], [[stainless steel]], or other medium-hard material, at the joint where the headstock meets the fretboard. Its grooves guide the strings onto the fretboard, giving consistent lateral string placement. It is one of the endpoints of the strings' vibrating length. It must be accurately cut, or it can contribute to tuning problems due to string slippage or string buzz. To reduce string friction in the nut, which can adversely affect tuning stability, some guitarists fit a roller nut. Some instruments use a zero fret just in front of the nut. In this case the nut is used only for lateral alignment of the strings, the string height and length being dictated by the zero fret.\n\n====Neck====\n{{Main|Neck (music)}}\n{{See also|Fingerboard|Fret|Truss rod|Inlay (guitar)|Set-in neck|Bolt-on neck|Neck-through}}\nA guitar's [[frets]], [[fretboard]], [[Machine head|tuners]], [[headstock]], and [[truss rod]], all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its [[neck (music)|neck]]. The wood used to make the fretboard usually differs from the wood in the rest of the neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used (see [[Guitar#Tuning|Tuning]]), and the ability of the neck to resist bending (see [[#Truss rod|Truss rod]]) is important to the guitar's ability to hold a constant pitch during tuning or when strings are fretted. The rigidity of the neck with respect to the body of the guitar is one determinant of a good instrument versus a poor-quality one.\n\nThe shape of the neck (from a cross-sectional perspective) can also vary, from a gentle \"C\" curve to a more pronounced \"V\" curve. There are many different types of neck profiles available, giving the guitarist many options. Some aspects to consider in a guitar neck may be the overall width of the fretboard, scale (distance between the frets), the neck wood, the type of neck construction (for example, the neck may be glued in or bolted on), and the shape (profile) of the back of the neck. Other types of material used to make guitar necks are graphite ([[Steinberger]] guitars), aluminum ([[Kramer Guitars]], [[Travis Bean]] and [[Veleno (guitar)|Veleno guitars]]), or carbon fiber ([[Modulus Guitars]] and [[ThreeGuitars]]). [[Double neck guitars|Double neck]] electric guitars have two necks, allowing the musician to quickly switch between guitar sounds.\n\nThe neck joint or heel is the point at which the neck is either bolted or glued to the body of the guitar. Almost all acoustic steel-string guitars, with the primary exception of Taylors, have glued (otherwise known as set) necks, while electric guitars are constructed using both types. Most classical guitars have a neck and headblock carved from one piece of wood, known as a \"Spanish heel.\" Commonly used set neck joints include [[mortise and tenon]] joints (such as those used by C. F. Martin & Co.), dovetail joints (also used by C. F. Martin on the D-28 and similar models) and Spanish heel neck joints, which are named after the shoe they resemble and commonly found in classical guitars. All three types offer stability.\n\nBolt-on necks, though they are historically associated with cheaper instruments, do offer greater flexibility in the guitar's set-up, and allow easier access for neck joint maintenance and repairs. Another type of neck, only available for solid body electric guitars, is the [[neck-through-body]] construction. These are designed so that everything from the machine heads down to the bridge are located on the same piece of wood. The sides (also known as wings) of the guitar are then glued to this central piece. Some luthiers prefer this method of construction as they claim it allows better sustain of each note. Some instruments may not have a neck joint at all, having the neck and sides built as one piece and the body built around it.\n\nThe [[fingerboard]], also called the fretboard, is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that comprises the top of the neck. It is flat on classical guitars and slightly curved crosswise on acoustic and electric guitars. The curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. The smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. Most modern guitars feature a 12\" neck radius, while older guitars from the 1960s and 1970s usually feature a 6-8\" neck radius. Pinching a string against a fret on fretboard effectively shortens the vibrating length of the string, producing a higher pitch.\n\nFretboards are most commonly made of [[rosewood]], [[ebony]], [[maple]], and sometimes manufactured using composite materials such as HPL or resin. See the section \"Neck\" below for the importance of the length of the fretboard in connection to other dimensions of the guitar. The fingerboard plays an essential role in the treble tone for acoustic guitars. The quality of vibration of the fingerboard is the principal characteristic for generating the best treble tone. For that reason, ebony wood is better, but because of high use, ebony has become rare and extremely expensive. Most guitar manufacturers have adopted rosewood instead of ebony.\n\n[[File:Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] playing a Fender guitar with a [[capo]] ]]\n\n=====Frets=====\nAlmost all guitars have frets, which are metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the fretboard and located at exact points that divide the scale length in accordance with a specific mathematical formula. The exceptions include [[fretless bass]] guitars and very rare fretless guitars. Pressing a string against a fret determines the strings' vibrating length and therefore its resultant pitch. The pitch of each consecutive fret is defined at a half-step interval on the [[chromatic scale]]. Standard classical guitars have 19 frets and electric guitars between 21 and 24 frets, although guitars have been made with as many as 27 frets. Frets are laid out to accomplish an [[equal temperament|equal tempered]] division of the octave. Each set of twelve frets represents an octave. The twelfth fret divides the [[scale (string instruments)|scale length]] exactly into two halves, and the 24th fret position divides one of those halves in half again.\n\nThe [[ratio]] of the spacing of two consecutive frets is <math>\\sqrt[12]{2}</math> ([[twelfth root of two]]). In practice, [[luthiers]] determine fret positions using the constant 17.817\u2014an approximation to 1/(1-1/<math>\\sqrt[12]{2}</math>). If the nth fret is a distance x from the bridge, then the distance from the (n+1)th fret to the bridge is x-(x/17.817).<ref name=\"Calculating Fret Positions\">{{cite web |last=Mottola |first=R.M. |title=Lutherie Info\u2014Calculating Fret Positions |url=http://www.liutaiomottola.com/formulae/fret.htm}}</ref> Frets are available in several different gauges and can be fitted according to player preference. Among these are \"jumbo\" frets, which have much thicker gauge, allowing for use of a slight vibrato technique from pushing the string down harder and softer. \"Scalloped\" fretboards, where the wood of the fretboard itself is \"scooped out\" between the frets, allow a dramatic vibrato effect. Fine frets, much flatter, allow a very low [[Action (music)|string-action]], but require that other conditions, such as curvature of the neck, be well-maintained to prevent buzz.\n\n=====Truss rod=====\nThe '''truss rod''' is a thin, strong metal rod that runs along the inside of the neck. It is used to correct changes to the neck's curvature caused by aging of the neck timbers, changes in humidity, or to compensate for changes in the tension of strings. The tension of the rod and neck assembly is adjusted by a hex nut or an allen-key bolt on the rod, usually located either at the headstock, sometimes under a cover, or just inside the body of the guitar underneath the fretboard and accessible through the sound hole. Some truss rods can only be accessed by removing the neck. The truss rod counteracts the immense amount of tension the strings place on the neck, bringing the neck back to a straighter position. Turning the truss rod clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. Turning the truss rod counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension to act on the neck and creating a forward bow.\n\nAdjusting the truss rod affects the intonation of a guitar as well as the height of the strings from the fingerboard, called the [[Action (music)|action]]. Some truss rod systems, called ''double action'' truss systems, tighten both ways, pushing the neck both forward and backward (standard truss rods can only release to a point beyond which the neck is no longer compressed and pulled backward). The artist and [[luthier]] Irving Sloane pointed out, in his book ''Steel-String Guitar Construction,'' that truss rods are intended primarily to remedy concave bowing of the neck, but cannot correct a neck with \"back bow\" or one that has become twisted.{{Page needed|date=November 2015}} Classical guitars do not require truss rods, as their nylon strings exert a lower tensile force with lesser potential to cause structural problems. However, their necks are often reinforced with a strip of harder wood, such as an [[ebony]] strip that runs down the back of a [[Thuja plicata|cedar]] neck. There is no tension adjustment on this form of reinforcement.\n\n=====Inlays=====\nInlays are visual elements set into the exterior surface of a guitar, both for decoration and artistic purposes and, in the case of the markings on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 12th fret (and in higher octaves), to provide guidance to the performer about the location of frets on the instrument. The typical locations for inlay are on the fretboard, headstock, and on acoustic guitars around the soundhole, known as the [[rosette (design)|rosette]]. Inlays range from simple plastic dots on the fretboard to intricate works of art covering the entire exterior surface of a guitar (front and back). Some guitar players have used [[LED]]s in the fretboard to produce unique lighting effects onstage. Fretboard inlays are most commonly shaped like dots, diamond shapes, parallelograms, or large blocks in between the frets.\n\nDots are usually inlaid into the upper edge of the fretboard in the same positions, small enough to be visible only to the player. These usually appear on the odd numbered frets, but also on the 12th fret (the one [[octave]] mark) instead of the 11th and 13th frets. Some older or high-end instruments have inlays made of mother of pearl, abalone, ivory, colored wood or other exotic materials and designs. Simpler inlays are often made of plastic or painted. High-end classical guitars seldom have fretboard inlays as a well-trained player is expected to know his or her way around the instrument. In addition to fretboard inlay, the headstock and soundhole surround are also frequently inlaid. The manufacturer's logo or a small design is often inlaid into the headstock. Rosette designs vary from simple concentric circles to delicate fretwork mimicking the historic rosette of lutes. Bindings that edge the finger and sound boards are sometimes inlaid. Some instruments have a filler strip running down the length and behind the neck, used for strength or to fill the cavity through which the truss rod was installed in the neck.\n\n====Body====\n{{Main|Sound box|Solid body|Bridge (instrument)|Pickguard}}\n{{See also|Vibrato systems for guitar}}\n[[File:Guitarist girl.jpg|thumb|In the guitar, the sound box is the hollowed wooden structure that constitutes the body of the instrument.]]\nIn acoustic guitars, string vibration is transmitted through the bridge and saddle to the body via [[Sound board (music)|sound board]]. The sound board is typically made of tone woods such as spruce or cedar. Timbers for tone woods are chosen for both strength and ability to transfer mechanical energy from the strings to the air within the guitar body. Sound is further shaped by the characteristics of the guitar body's resonant cavity. In expensive instruments, the entire body is made of wood. In inexpensive instruments, the back may be made of plastic.\n\nIn an acoustic instrument, the body of the guitar is a major determinant of the overall sound quality. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element made of [[tonewood]]s such as [[spruce]] and [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]]. This thin piece of wood, often only 2 or 3&nbsp;mm thick, is strengthened by differing types of [[Guitar bracing|internal bracing]]. Many luthiers consider the top the dominant factor in determining the sound quality. The majority of the instrument's sound is heard through the vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. The body of an acoustic guitar has a sound hole through which sound projects. The sound hole is usually a round hole in the top of the guitar under the strings. Air inside the body vibrates as the guitar top and body is vibrated by the strings, and the response of the air cavity at different frequencies is characterized, like the rest of the guitar body, by a number of resonance modes at which it responds more strongly.\n\nThe top, back and ribs of an acoustic guitar body are very thin (1\u20132&nbsp;mm), so a flexible piece of wood called lining is glued into the corners where the rib meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20&nbsp;mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints. Solid linings are often used in classical guitars, while kerfed lining is most often found in steel string acoustics. Kerfed lining is also called kerfing because it is scored, or \"kerfed\"(incompletely sawn through), to allow it to bend with the shape of the rib). During final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called [[purfling]]. This binding serves to seal off the end grain of the top and back. Purfling can also appear on the back of an acoustic guitar, marking the edge joints of the two or three sections of the back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or plastic.\n\nBody size, shape and style has changed over time. 19th century guitars, now known as salon guitars, were smaller than modern instruments. Differing patterns of internal bracing have been used over time by luthiers. Torres, Hauser, Ramirez, Fleta, and [[C. F. Martin & Company|C.&nbsp;F. Martin]] were among the most influential designers of their time. Bracing not only strengthens the top against potential collapse due to the stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also affects the resonance characteristics of the top. The back and sides are made out of a variety of timbers such as mahogany, Indian [[rosewood]] and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (''Dalbergia nigra''). Each one is primarily chosen for their aesthetic effect and can be decorated with inlays and purfling.\n\nInstruments with larger areas for the guitar top were introduced by Martin in an attempt to create greater volume levels. The popularity of the larger \"[[C. F. Martin & Company|dreadnought]]\" body size amongst acoustic performers is related to the greater sound volume produced.\n\nMost electric guitar bodies are made of wood and include a plastic pick guard. Boards wide enough to use as a solid body are very expensive due to the worldwide depletion of hardwood stock since the 1970s, so the wood is rarely one solid piece. Most bodies are made from two pieces of wood with some of them including a seam running down the center line of the body. The most common woods used for electric guitar body construction include [[maple]], [[Tilia americana|basswood]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[Populus|poplar]], [[alder]], and [[mahogany]]. Many bodies consist of good-sounding, but inexpensive woods, like ash, with a \"top\", or thin layer of another, more attractive wood (such as maple with a natural \"flame\" pattern) glued to the top of the basic wood. Guitars constructed like this are often called \"flame tops\". The body is usually carved or routed to accept the other elements, such as the bridge, pickup, neck, and other electronic components. Most electrics have a polyurethane or [[nitrocellulose]] lacquer finish. Other alternative materials to wood are used in guitar body construction. Some of these include carbon composites, plastic material, such as polycarbonate, and aluminum alloys.\n\nThe main purpose of the bridge on an acoustic guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings. On all electric, acoustic and original guitars, the bridge holds the strings in place on the body. There are many varied bridge designs. There may be some mechanism for raising or lowering the bridge saddles to adjust the distance between the strings and the fretboard ([[Action (music)|action]]), or fine-tuning the intonation of the instrument. Some are spring-loaded and feature a \"[[Vibrato systems for guitar|whammy bar]]\", a removable arm that lets the player modulate the pitch by changing the tension on the strings. The whammy bar is sometimes also called a \"tremolo bar\". (The effect of rapidly changing pitch is properly called \"vibrato\". See [[Tremolo]] for further discussion of this term.) Some bridges also allow for alternate tunings at the touch of a button.\n\nOn almost all modern electric guitars, the bridge has saddles that are adjustable for each string so that intonation stays correct up and down the neck. If the open string is in tune, but sharp or flat when frets are pressed, the bridge saddle position can be adjusted with a screwdriver or hex key to remedy the problem. In general, flat notes are corrected by moving the saddle forward and sharp notes by moving it backwards. On an instrument correctly adjusted for intonation, the actual length of each string from the nut to the bridge saddle is slightly, but measurably longer than the [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]] of the instrument. This additional length is called compensation, which flattens all notes a bit to compensate for the sharping of all fretted notes caused by stretching the string during fretting.\n\nThe saddle of a guitar refers to the part of the bridge that physically supports the strings. It may be one piece (typically on acoustic guitars) or separate pieces, one for each string (electric guitars and basses). The saddle's basic purpose is to provide the end point for the string's vibration at the correct location for proper intonation, and on acoustic guitars to transfer the vibrations through the bridge into the top wood of the guitar. Saddles are typically made of plastic or bone for acoustic guitars, though synthetics and some exotic animal tooth variations (e.g. fossilized tooth, ivory, etc. ) have become popular with some players. Electric guitar saddles are typically metal, though some synthetic saddles are available.\n\nThe pickguard, also known as the scratchplate, is usually a piece of laminated plastic or other material that protects the finish of the top of the guitar from damage due to the use of a plectrum (\"pick\") or fingernails. Electric guitars sometimes mount pickups and electronics on the pickguard. It is a common feature on steel-string acoustic guitars. Some performance styles that use the guitar as a percussion instrument (tapping the top or sides between notes, etc.), such as [[flamenco]], require that a scratchplate or pickguard be fitted to nylon-string instruments.\n\n====Strings====\n{{See also|Classical guitar strings}}\nThe standard guitar has six [[strings (music)|strings]], but [[Tenor guitar|four-]], [[Seven-string guitar|seven-]], [[Eight-string guitar|eight-]], [[Nine-string guitar|nine-]], [[Ten-string guitar|ten-]], [[Eleven-string guitar|eleven-]], [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve-]], [[Thirteen-string guitar|thirteen-]] and [[doubleneck guitar|eighteen-string]] guitars are also available. Classical and flamenco guitars historically used [[Catgut|gut]] strings, but these have been superseded by polymer materials, such as nylon and fluorocarbon. Modern guitar [[strings (music)|strings]] are constructed from metal, polymers, or animal or plant product materials. Instruments utilizing \"steel\" strings may have strings made from alloys incorporating steel, nickel or phosphor bronze. Bass strings for both instruments are wound rather than monofilament.\n\n====Pickups and electronics====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n[[File:Stratocaster detail DSC06937.jpg|thumb|right|This [[Fender Stratocaster]] has features common to many electric guitars: multiple pickups, a [[Vibrato systems for guitar|vibrato bar]]/[[vibrato unit]], and volume and tone knobs.]]\n[[Pickup (music technology)|Pickups]] are [[transducer]]s attached to a guitar that detect (or \"pick up\") string vibrations and convert the mechanical energy of the string into electrical energy. The resultant electrical signal can then be electronically [[amplifier|amplified]]. The most common type of pickup is [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] in design. These contain magnets that are within a coil, or coils, of copper wire. Such pickups are usually placed directly underneath the guitar strings. Electromagnetic pickups work on the same principles and in a similar manner to an [[electric generator]]. The vibration of the strings creates a small electric current in the coils surrounding the magnets. This signal current is carried to a [[guitar amplifier]] that drives a [[loudspeaker]].\n\nTraditional electromagnetic pickups are either [[Single coil guitar pickup|single-coil]] or double-coil. Single-coil pickups are susceptible to noise induced by stray electromagnetic fields, usually mains-frequency (60 or 50&nbsp;hertz) hum. The introduction of the double-coil [[humbucker]] in the mid-1950s solved this problem through the use of two coils, one of which is wired in opposite polarity to cancel or \"buck\" stray fields.\n\nThe types and models of pickups used can greatly affect the tone of the guitar. Typically, humbuckers, which are two magnet-coil assemblies attached to each other, are traditionally associated with a heavier sound. Single-coil pickups, one magnet wrapped in copper wire, are used by guitarists seeking a brighter, twangier sound with greater dynamic range.\n\nModern pickups are tailored to the sound desired. A commonly applied approximation used in selection of a pickup is that less wire (lower [[electrical impedance]]) gives brighter sound, more wire gives a \"fat\" tone. Other options include specialized switching that produces coil-splitting, in/out of phase and other effects. Guitar circuits are either active, needing a battery to power their circuit, or, as in most cases, equipped with a passive circuit.\n\n[[Fender Stratocaster]]-type guitars generally utilize three single-coil pickups, while most [[Gibson Les Paul]] types use humbucker pickups.\n\nPiezoelectric, or piezo, pickups represent another class of pickup. These employ [[piezoelectricity]] to generate the musical signal and are popular in hybrid electro-acoustic guitars. A crystal is located under each string, usually in the saddle. When the string vibrates, the shape of the crystal is distorted, and the stresses associated with this change produce tiny voltages across the crystal that can be amplified and manipulated.\n\nSome piezo-equipped guitars use a hexaphonic pickup. \"Hex\" is a prefix meaning six. A hexaphonic pickup produces a separate output for each string, usually from a discrete piezoelectric or magnetic pickup for each string. This arrangement lets on-board or external electronics process the strings individually for modeling or [[MIDI|Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) conversion. [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] makes hexaphonic pickups for guitar and bass, and a line of guitar modeling and synthesis products. [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] hexaphonic-equipped [[Variax]] guitars use on-board electronics to model the sound after various vintage instruments, and vary pitch on individual strings.\n\nMIDI converters use a hexaphonic guitar signal to determine pitch, duration, attack, and decay characteristics. The MIDI sends the note information to an internal or external sound bank device. The resulting sound closely mimics numerous instruments. The MIDI setup can also let the guitar be used as a game controller (i.e., Rock Band Squier) or as an instructional tool, as with the [[Fretlight]] Guitar.\n\nOn guitars that have them, these components and the wires that connect them allow the player to control some aspects of the sound like volume or tone using knobs, switches, or buttons. The most basic electronic control is a volume knob. Some guitars also have a tone-control knob, and some guitars with multiple pickups have pickup selector switches or knobs to determine which pickup(s) are activated. At their simplest, these consist of passive components, such as [[potentiometer]]s and [[capacitor]]s, but may also include specialized [[integrated circuit]]s or other active components requiring [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] for power, for preamplification and signal processing, or even for [[electronic tuner|electronic tuning]]. In many cases, the electronics have some sort of shielding to prevent pickup of external interference and noise.\n\n==Tuning==\n{{Main|Guitar tunings}}\n{{See also|Stringed instrument tunings}}\nNotationally, the guitar is considered a [[transposing instrument]]. Its pitch sounds one octave lower than it is notated on a score.\n\n===Standard===\n[[File:Standard diagonal shifting of C major chord.png|right|thumb|upright|In standard tuning, the C-major chord has three shapes because of the irregular major-third between the G- and B-strings.]]\nA variety of tunings may be used. The most common tuning, known as \"Standard Tuning\", has the strings tuned from a low E, to a high E, traversing a two octave range\u2014EADGBE.

In standard tuning, chords change their shape because of the irregular major-third G-B.]]\n{{Main|Guitar tunings#Alternative}}\n{{See also|Open tunings|Regular tunings}}\nStandard tuning has evolved to provide a good compromise between simple fingering for many [[Guitar chord|chords]] and the ability to play common scales with reasonable left-hand movement. There are also a variety of commonly used [[guitar tuning#Alternative|alternative tunings]], for example, the classes of ''open'', ''regular'', and ''dropped'' tunings.\n[[File:Ry Cooder playing.jpg|left|upright|thumb|alt=Ry Cooder plays the guitar.|Ry Cooder plays slide-guitar with open tunings.]]\n\n''Open tuning'' refers to a guitar tuned so that strumming the open strings produces a [[chord (music)|chord]], typically a major chord. The base chord consists of at least 3 notes and may include all the strings or a subset. The tuning is named for the open chord, Open D, open G, and open A are popular tunings. All similar chords in the chromatic scale can then be played by [[barre chord|barring]] a single fret.{{sfn|Sethares 2001|p=16}} Open tunings are common in [[blues music|blues]] and [[folk music]],{{sfn|Denyer 1992|p=158}} and they are used in the playing of [[slide guitar|slide]] and [[bottleneck guitar]]s.{{sfn|Sethares 2001|p=16}}{{sfn|Denyer 1992|p=160}} Many musicians use open tunings when playing slide guitar.{{sfn|Denyer 1992|p=158}}\n\nFor the standard tuning, there is exactly one interval of a [[major third]] between the second and third strings, and all the other intervals are fourths. The irregularity has a price - chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords. There are separate chord-forms for chords having their [[root note]] on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.{{sfn|Denyer 1992|p=119}}\n\nIn contrast, [[regular tunings|''regular'' tunings]] have equal intervals between the strings,{{sfn|Sethares 2001|pp=52\u201367}} and so they have symmetrical scales all along the fretboard. This makes it simpler to translate chords. For the regular tunings, chords may be moved diagonally around the fretboard. The diagonal movement of chords is especially simple for the regular tunings that are repetitive, in which case chords can be moved vertically: Chords can be moved three strings up (or down) in major-thirds tuning and chords can be moved two strings up (or down) in augmented-fourths tuning. Regular tunings thus appeal to new guitarists and also to jazz-guitarists, whose improvisation is simplified by regular intervals.\n\nOn the other hand, some chords are more difficult to play in a regular tuning than in standard tuning. It can be difficult to play conventional chords especially in augmented-fourths tuning and all-fifths tuning,{{sfn|Sethares 2001|pp=52\u201367}} in which the large spacings require hand stretching. Some chords, which are conventional in folk music, are difficult to play even in all-fourths and major-thirds tunings, which do not require more hand-stretching than standard tuning.<ref name=\"Patt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphpatt.com/Tune.html |first=Ralph |last=Patt |authorlink=Ralph Patt |publisher=ralphpatt.com |work=Ralph Patt's jazz web page |title=The major 3rd tuning |ref=harv |date=April 2008 |access-date=10 June 2012|id=cited by {{harvtxt |Sethares |2010}}}}</ref>\n* In [[major-thirds tuning]], the interval between open strings is always a [[major third]]. Consequently, four frets suffice to play the chromatic scale. [[Chord inversion]] is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes by three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes.<ref name=\"Griewank10\">{{harvtxt |Griewank |2010 |p=10}}: {{citation |last=Griewank |first=Andreas |title=Tuning guitars and reading music in major thirds |date=January 2010 |url=http://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-matheon/frontdoor/index/index/docId/675 |id={{URN|nbn|de:0296-matheon-6755}} <!-- |id=MSC-Classification 97M80 Arts.

With all-fourths tuning, playing the triads is more difficult, but improvisation is simplified, because chord-patterns remain constant when moved around the fretboard. Jazz guitarist [[Stanley Jordan]] uses the all-fourths tuning EADGCF. Invariant chord-shapes are an advantage of other regular tunings, such as [[major-thirds tuning|major-thirds]] and all-fifths tunings.{{sfn|Sethares 2001|pp=52\u201367}}\n* Extending the tunings of [[violin]]s and [[cello]]s, [[all-fifths tuning]] offers an expanded range CGDAEB,{{sfn|Sethares 2001|p=62\u201363}} which however has been impossible to implement on a conventional guitar. All-fifths tuning is used for the lowest five strings of the [[new standard tuning]] of [[Robert Fripp]] and his former students in [[Guitar Craft]] courses; new standard tuning has a high G on its last string CGDAE-G.<ref>{{citation |title=Robert Fripp: From crimson king to crafty master |first=Eric |last=Tamm |authorlink=Eric Tamm (musicologist) |url=http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/ch10.htm |ref=harv |year=2003 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Faber and Faber (1990) |isbn=0-571-16289-4 |edition=Progressive Ears |id=[http://www.erictamm.com/rf.zip Zipped Microsoft Word Document] |access-date=25 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026180438/http://www.progressiveears.com/frippbook/ch10.htm |archivedate=26 October 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Fripp11\">{{harvtxt |Fripp |2011 |p=3}}: {{cite book |last=Fripp |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Fripp |title=Seven Guitar Craft themes: Definitive scores for guitar ensemble |publisher=Partitas Music |year=2011 |ref=harv |editor-first=Horacio |editor-last=Pozzo |url=http://partitasmusic.com/ |id=[[International Standard Music Number|ISMN]]&nbsp;979-0-9016791-7-7.

Dropping down the lowest string a [[major second|whole tone]] results in the \"[[drop-D]]\" (or \"dropped D\") tuning. Its open-string notes DADGBE (from low to high) allow for a deep bass D note, which can be used in keys such as D major, d minor and G major. It simplifies the playing of simple fifths ([[powerchord]]s). Many contemporary rock bands re-tune all strings down, making, for example, Drop-C or Drop-B tunings.\n\n===Scordatura===\nMany [[scordatura]] (alternate tunings) modify the standard tuning of the [[lute]], especially when playing [[Renaissance music]] repertoire originally written for that instrument. Some scordatura drop the pitch of one or more strings, giving access to new lower notes. Some scordatura make it easier to play in unusual keys.\n\n==Accessories==\nThough a guitar may be played on its own, there are a variety of common accessories used for holding and playing the guitar.\n\n===Capotasto===\n{{Main|Capo}}\nA capo (short for ''capotasto'') is used to change the pitch of open strings.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52231445|title=The guitarist's guide to the capo|last=Rikky.|first=Rooksby,|date=2003|publisher=Artemis|isbn=1904411150|location=Iver Heath|oclc=52231445}}</ref> Capos are clipped onto the fretboard with the aid of spring tension, or in some models, elastic tension. To raise the guitar's pitch by one semitone, the player would clip the capo onto the fretboard just below the first fret. Its use allows players to play in different keys without having to change the chord formations they use. For example, if a folk guitar player wanted to play a song in the key of B Major, they could put a capo on the second fret of the instrument, and then play the song as if it were in the key of A Major, but with the capo the instrument would make the sounds of B Major. This is because with the capo barring the entire second fret, [[open chord]]s would all sound two semitones (aka one tone) higher in pitch. For example, if a guitarist played an open A Major chord (a very common open chord), it would sound like a B Major chord. All of the other open chords would be similarly modified in pitch. Because of the ease with which they allow guitar players to change keys, they are sometimes referred to with pejorative names, such as \"cheaters\" or the \"hillbilly crutch\". Despite this negative viewpoint, another benefit of the capo is that it enables guitarists to obtain the ringing, resonant sound of the common keys (C, G, A, etc.) in \"harder\" and less-commonly used keys. Classical performers are known to use them to enable modern instruments to match the pitch of historical instruments such as the Renaissance music [[lute]].\n\n===Slides===\n{{Main|Slide guitar}}\n[[File:Fingandslide.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Example of a bottleneck slide, with [[fingerpick]]s and a [[resonator guitar]] made of metal.]]\nA [[slide guitar|slide]], (neck of a bottle, knife blade or round metal or glass bar or cylinder) is used in blues and rock to create a [[glissando]] or \"[[Lap steel guitar|Hawaiian]]\" effect. The slide is used to fret notes on the neck, instead of using the fretting hand's fingers. The characteristic use of the slide is to move up to the intended pitch by, as the name implies, sliding up the neck to the desired note. The necks of bottles were often used in blues and country music as improvised slides. Modern slides are constructed of glass, plastic, ceramic, chrome, brass or steel bars or cylinders, depending on the weight and tone desired (and the amount of money a guitarist can spend). An instrument that is played exclusively in this manner (using a metal bar) is called a [[steel guitar]] or [[pedal steel]]. Slide playing to this day is very popular in [[blues|blues music]] and [[country music]]. Some slide players use a so-called [[Dobro]] guitar. Some performers who have become famous for playing slide are [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Elmore James]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[George Harrison]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Derek Trucks]], [[Warren Haynes]], [[Duane Allman]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Rory Gallagher]], and [[George Thorogood]].\n\n===Plectrum===\n{{Main|Guitar pick}}\n[[File:Guitar picks-KayEss-1.jpeg|thumb|A variety of guitar picks]]\nA \"[[guitar pick]]\" or \"[[plectrum]]\" is a small piece of hard material generally held between the thumb and first finger of the picking hand and is used to \"pick\" the strings. Though most classical players pick with a combination of fingernails and fleshy fingertips, the pick is most often used for electric and steel-string acoustic guitars. Though today they are mainly plastic, variations do exist, such as bone, wood, steel or tortoise shell. Tortoise shell was the most commonly used material in the early days of pick-making, but as tortoises and turtles became endangered, the practice of using their shells for picks or anything else was banned. Tortoise-shell picks made before the ban are often coveted for a supposedly superior tone and ease of use, and their scarcity has made them valuable.\n\nPicks come in many shapes and sizes. Picks vary from the small jazz pick to the large bass pick. The thickness of the pick often determines its use. A thinner pick (between 0.2 and 0.5&nbsp;mm) is usually used for strumming or rhythm playing, whereas thicker picks (between 0.7 and 1.5+ mm) are usually used for single-note lines or lead playing. The distinctive guitar sound of [[Billy Gibbons]] is attributed to using a [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] or [[peso]] as a pick. Similarly, [[Brian May]] is known to use a [[British sixpence coin|sixpence coin]] as a pick, while noted 1970s and early 1980s session musician David Persons is known for using old credit cards, cut to the correct size, as plectrums.\n\nThumb picks and finger picks that attach to the finger tips are sometimes employed in finger-picking styles on steel strings. These allow the fingers and thumb to operate independently, whereas a flat pick requires the thumb and one or two fingers to manipulate.\n\n===Straps===\nA guitar strap is a strip of material with an attachment mechanism on each end, made to hold a guitar via the shoulders at an adjustable length. Guitars have varying accommodations for attaching a strap. The most common are strap buttons, also called strap pins, which are flanged steel posts anchored to the guitar with screws. Two strap buttons come pre-attached to virtually all electric guitars, and many steel-string acoustic guitars. Strap buttons are sometimes replaced with \"strap locks\", which connect the guitar to the strap more securely.\n\nThe lower strap button is usually located at the bottom (bridge end) of the body. The upper strap button is usually located near or at the top (neck end) of the body: on the upper body curve, at the tip of the upper \"horn\" (on a double cutaway), or at the neck joint (heel). Some electrics, especially those with odd-shaped bodies, have one or both strap buttons on the back of the body. Some Steinberger electric guitars, owing to their minimalist and lightweight design, have both strap buttons at the bottom of the body. Rarely, on some acoustics, the upper strap button is located on the headstock. Some acoustic and classical guitars only have a single strap button at the bottom of the body\u2014the other end must be tied onto the headstock, above the nut and below the machine heads.\n\n===Amplifiers, effects and speakers===\n[[File:JesseNabers-6.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|A range of guitar combo amps and guitars for sale at a [[music store]].]]\n[[Electric guitar]]s and [[bass guitar]]s have to be used with a [[guitar amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] or a [[bass amplifier]] and speaker, respectively, in order to make enough sound to be heard by the performer and audience. Electric guitars and bass guitars almost always use [[magnetic pickup]]s, which generate an electric signal when the musician plucks, strums or otherwise plays the instrument. The amplifier and speaker strengthen this signal using a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]]. Acoustic guitars that are equipped with a piezoelectric pickup or microphone can also be plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]], [[guitar amplifier|acoustic guitar amp]] or [[PA system]] to make them louder. With electric guitar and bass, the amplifier and speaker are not just used to make the instrument louder; by adjusting the [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] controls, the [[preamplifier]], and any onboard [[effects unit]]s ([[reverb]], [[distortion (music)|distortion/overdrive]], etc.) the player can also modify the tone (aka timbre or \"colour\") and sound of the instrument. Acoustic guitar players can also use the amp to change the sound of their instrument, but in general, acoustic guitar amps are used to make the natural acoustic sound of the instrument louder without changing its sound that much.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Guitar}}\n* [[Outline of guitars]]\n* [[List of guitar manufacturers]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n====Books, journals====\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Tony|title=The Ultimate Guitar Book|year=1997|publisher=Alfred A.
