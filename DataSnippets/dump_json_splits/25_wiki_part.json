Isaiah 1\u201333 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations, and chapters 34\u201366 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration follows soon.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998| pp = 78\u201379}} It can thus be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Exile.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2003|p= 159}}\n\nThe Deutero-Isaian part of the book describes how God will make Jerusalem the centre of his worldwide rule through a royal saviour (a [[messiah]]) who will destroy her oppressor ([[Neo-Babylonian empire|Babylon]]); this messiah is the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]], who is merely the agent who brings about Yahweh's kingship.{{sfn| Sweeney| 1998| pp=79\u201380}} Isaiah speaks out against corrupt leaders and for the disadvantaged, and roots righteousness in God's holiness rather than in Israel's covenant.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=89-90}} Isaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of [[monotheism]]: \"I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no God\".{{sfn|Gnuse|1997|p=87}} This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic [[Judaism]], and the basis for [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=335-336}}\n\nIsaiah was one of the most popular works among Jews in the [[Second Temple period]] (c. 515 BCE \u2013 70 CE).{{sfn|Hannah|2005|p=7}} In Christian circles, it was held in such high regard as to be called \"the Fifth Gospel\",{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|p=1-2}} and its influence extends beyond Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of [[Handel's Messiah]] to a host of such everyday phrases as \"[[Swords to ploughshares|swords into ploughshares]]\" and \"[[Voice in the Wilderness (disambiguation)|voice in the wilderness]]\".{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n== Structure ==\n[[File:Great Isaiah Scroll.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Isaiah scroll]], the oldest surviving manuscript of Isaiah: found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and dating from about 150 to 100 BCE, it contains almost the whole Book of Isaiah and is substantially identical with the modern [[Masoretic text]].{{sfn| Goldingay | 2001|pp = 22\u201323}}]]\nThe scholarly consensus which held sway through most of the 20th century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of Isaiah.{{sfn| Petersen| 2002| pp = 47\u201348}} A typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors:{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p= 78}}\n\n* 1\u201339: Proto-Isaiah, containing the words of the original [[Isaiah]];\n* 40\u201355: Deutero-Isaiah, the work of an anonymous Exilic author;\n* 56\u201366: Trito-Isaiah, an anthology of about twelve passages.{{sfn|Soggin|1989|p= 394}}\n\nWhile one part of the consensus still holds \u2013 virtually no contemporary scholar maintains that the entire book, or even most of it, was written by one person \u2013 this perception of Isaiah as made up of three rather distinct sections underwent a radical challenge in the last quarter of the 20th century.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=47-48}} The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34:{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=78-79}}\n\n* 1\u201333: Warnings of judgment and promises of subsequent restoration for Jerusalem, Judah and the nations;\n* 34\u201366: Judgment has already taken place and restoration is at hand.\n\n== Summary ==\n[[Image:Michelangelo, profeti, Isaiah 01.jpg|thumb|[[Michelangelo]] (c. 1508\u201312), ''Isaiah'', [[Vatican City]]: [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]\n[[File:30 Rockefeller.JPG|thumb|Detail of entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza showing verse from Isaiah 33:6 [[Rockefeller Center]], [[New York City|New York]]]]\nSeeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1\u201333 and 34\u201366) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following:{{sfn| Sweeney| 1998| pp = 79\u201380}}\n* The book opens by setting out the themes of judgment and subsequent restoration for the righteous. God has a plan which will be realised on the \"[[Day of Yahweh]]\", when Jerusalem will become the centre of his worldwide rule. On that day all the nations of the world will come to Zion (Jerusalem) for instruction, but first the city must be punished and cleansed of evil. Israel is invited to join in this plan. Chapters 5\u201312 explain the significance of the Assyrian judgment against Israel: righteous rule by the Davidic king will follow after the arrogant Assyrian monarch is brought down. Chapters 13\u201327 announce the preparation of the nations for Yahweh's world rule; chapters 28\u201333 announce that a royal saviour (a [[messiah]]) will emerge in the aftermath of Jerusalem's punishment and the destruction of her oppressor.\n* The oppressor (now identified as Babylon rather than Assyria) is about to fall. Chapters 34\u201335 tell how Yahweh will return the redeemed exiles to Jerusalem. Chapters 36\u201339 tell of the faithfulness of king Hezekiah to Yahweh during the Assyrian siege as a model for the restored community. Chapters 40\u201354 state that the restoration of Zion is taking place because Yahweh, the creator of the universe, has designated the Persian king [[Cyrus the Great]] as the promised messiah and temple-builder. Chapters 55\u201366 are an exhortation to Israel to keep the covenant. God's eternal promise to David is now made to the people of Israel/Judah at large. The book ends by enjoining righteousness as the final stages of God's plan come to pass, including the pilgrimage of the nations to Zion and the realisation of Yahweh's kingship.\n\nThe older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example:\n* Proto-Isaiah/First Isaiah (chapters 1\u201339):{{sfn|Boadt|1984|p= 325}}\n** 1\u201312: Oracles against Judah mostly from Isaiah's early years;\n** 13\u201323: Oracles against foreign nations from his middle years;\n** 24\u201327: The \"Isaiah Apocalypse\", added at a much later date;\n** 28\u201333: Oracles from Isaiah's later ministry\n** 34\u201335: A vision of Zion, perhaps a later addition;\n** 36\u201339: Stories of Isaiah's life, some from the Book of Kings\n* Deutero-Isaiah/Second Isaiah (chapters 40\u201354), with two major divisions, 40\u201348 and 49\u201354, the first emphasising Israel, the second Zion and Jerusalem:{{sfn | Boadt | 1984 | pp =418\u201319}}\n** An introduction and conclusion stressing the power of God's word over everything;\n** A second introduction and conclusion within these in which a herald announces salvation to Jerusalem;\n** Fragments of hymns dividing various sections;\n** The role of foreign nations, the fall of Babylon, and the rise of Cyrus as God's chosen one;\n** Four \"[[Servant Songs]]\" personalising the message of the prophet;\n** Several longer poems on topics such as God's power and invitations to Israel to trust in him;\n* Trito-Isaiah/Third Isaiah (chapters 55\u201366):\n** A collection of oracles by unknown prophets in the years immediately after the return from Babylon.{{sfn|Boadt|1984|p= 444}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[Image:Isaiah scroll.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Scroll of Book of Isaiah]]\n\n=== Authorship ===\nWhile it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the [[Kingdom of Judah]] during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2003|p=159}}{{sfn|Stromberg|2011|p=2}} The observations which have led to this are as follows:\n* Historical situation: Chapters 40\u201355 presuppose that Jerusalem has already been destroyed (they are not framed as prophecy) and the Babylonian exile is already in effect \u2013 they speak from a present in which the Exile is about to end. Chapters 56\u201366 assume an even later situation, in which the people are already returned to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the Temple is already under way.{{sfn|Stromberg|2011|p=2-4}}\n* Anonymity: Isaiah's name suddenly stops being used after chapter 39.{{sfn|Childs|2001|p=3}}\n* Style: There is a sudden change in style and theology after chapter 40; numerous key words and phrases found in one section are not found in the other.{{sfn|Cate|1990b|p=414}}\n\nThe composition history of Isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient Israel and in modern societies; the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous.{{sfn|Stromberg|2011|p=4}} While the authors are anonymous, it is plausible that all of them were priests, and the book may thus reflect [[Priestly source|Priestly]] concerns, in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the [[Deuteronomist]]s.{{sfn|Barker|2003|p=494}}\n\n=== Historical context ===\nThe historic Isaiah ben Amoz lived in the [[Kingdom of Judah]] during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th-century BCE.{{sfn|Stromberg|2011|p=2}}{{sfn|Brettler|2010|p=161-162}} During this period, [[Assyria]] was expanding westward from its origins in modern-day northern Iraq towards the Mediterranean, destroying first [[Aram-Damascus|Aram]] (modern Syria) in 734\u2013732 BCE, then the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in 722\u2013721, and finally subjugating Judah in 701.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=75}} Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages, and a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original 8th-century Isaiah, while the prose sections are \"sermons\" on his texts composed at the court of [[Josiah]] a hundred years later, at the end of the 7th century.{{sfn|Goldingay|2001|p=4}}\n\nThe conquest of Jerusalem by [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylon]] and the exile of its elite in 586 BCE ushered in the next stage in the formation of the book. Deutero-Isaiah addresses himself to the Jews in exile, offering them the hope of return.{{sfn|Barker|2003|p=524}} This was the period of the meteoric rise of Persia under its king [[Cyrus the Great]] \u2013 in 559 BCE he succeeded his father as ruler of a small vassal kingdom in modern eastern Iran, by 540 he ruled an empire stretching from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, and in 539 he conquered Babylon.{{sfn|Whybray|2004|p=11}} Deutero-Isaiah's predictions of the imminent fall of Babylon and his glorification of Cyrus as the deliverer of Israel date his prophecies to 550\u2013539 BCE, and probably towards the end of this period.{{sfn|Whybray|2004|p=11-12}}\n\nThe Persians ended the Jewish exile, and by 515 BCE the exiles, or at least some of them, had returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple. The return, however, was not without problems: the returnees found themselves in conflict with those who had remained in the country and who now owned the land, and there were further conflicts over the form of government that should be set up. This background forms the context of Trito-Isaiah.{{sfn|Barker|2003|p=524}}\n\n== Themes ==\n[[Image:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Swords to ploughshares#Biblical references|Isaiah 2:3\u20134]] is taken as an unofficial mission statement by the [[United Nations]]. (Isaiah Wall in [[Ralph Bunche Park]], a [[New York City]] park near [[United Nations Headquarters|UN headquarters]])]]\n\n=== Overview ===\nIsaiah is focused on the main role of Jerusalem in God's plan for the world, seeing centuries of history as though they were all the single vision of the 8th-century prophet Isaiah.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=78}} Proto-Isaiah speaks of Israel's desertion of God and what will follow: Israel will be destroyed by foreign enemies, but after the people, the country and Jerusalem are punished and purified, a holy remnant will live in God's place in Zion, governed by God's chosen king (the [[messiah]]), under the presence and protection of God; Deutero-Isaiah has as its subject the liberation of Israel from captivity in Babylon in another [[The Exodus|Exodus]], which the God of Israel will arrange using Cyrus, the Persian conqueror, as his agent; Trito-Isaiah concerns Jerusalem, the Temple, the Sabbath, and Israel's salvation.{{sfn|Lemche|2008|p=18-20}} (More explicitly, it concerns questions current among Jews living in Jerusalem and Palestine in the post-Exilic period about who is a God-loving Jew and who is not).{{sfn|Lemche|2008|p=233}} [[Walter Brueggemann]] has described this overarching narrative as \"a continued meditation upon the destiny of Jerusalem\".{{sfn|Brueggemann|2003|p=160}}\n\n=== Holiness, righteousness, and God's plan ===\nGod's plan for the world is based on his choice of Jerusalem as the place where he will manifest himself, and of the line of [[David]] as his earthly representative \u2013 a theme that may possibly have been created through Jerusalem's reprieve from Assyrian attack in 701 BCE. {{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=91-94}} God is \"the holy one of Israel\"; justice and righteousness are the qualities that mark the essence of God, and Israel has offended God through unrighteousness.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=89-90}} Isaiah speaks out for the poor and the oppressed and against corrupt princes and judges, but unlike the prophets [[book of Amos|Amos]] and [[book of Micah|Micah]] he roots righteousness not in Israel's covenant with God but in God's holiness.{{sfn|Petersen|2002|p=89-90}}\n\n=== Monotheism ===\nIsaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of [[monotheism]]: \"I am the first and I am the last; besides me there is no God\".{{sfn|Gnuse|1997|p=87}} In Isaiah 44:09\u201320, this is developed into a satire on the making and worship of idols, mocking the foolishness of the carpenter who worships the idol that he himself has carved. While Yahweh had shown his superiority to other gods before, in Second Isaiah, he becomes the sole God of the world. This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic [[Judaism]] and became the basis for Christianity and Islam.{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=335-336}}\n\n=== A new Exodus ===\nA central theme in Second Isaiah is that of a new Exodus \u2013 the return of the exiled people Israel from Babylon to Jerusalem. The author imagines a ritualistic return to Zion (Judah) led by Yahweh.  The importance of this theme is indicated by its placement at the beginning and end of Second Isaiah (40:3\u20135, 55:12\u201313). This new Exodus is repeatedly linked with Israel's [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt to Canaan under divine guidance, but with new elements. These links include the following:\n* The original Exodus participants left \"in great haste\" (Ex 12:11, Deut 16:3), whereas the participants in this new Exodus will \"not go out in great haste\" (Isa 52:12).\n* The land between Egypt and Canaan of the first Exodus was a \"great and terrible wilderness, an arid wasteland\" (Deut 8:15), but in this new Exodus, the land between Babylon (Mesopotamia) and the Promised Land will be transformed into a paradise, where the mountains will be lowered and the valleys raised to create level road (Isa 40:4).\n* In the first Exodus, water was provided by God, but scarcely.  In the new Exodus, God will \"make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water\" (Isa 41:18).{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=333}}\n\n== Later interpretation and influence ==\n[[Image:William Strutt Peace 1896.jpg|thumb|right|''Peace'', 1896 etching by [[William Strutt]], based upon Isaiah 11:6,7]]\n\n=== 2nd Temple Judaism (515 BCE \u2013 70 CE) ===\nIsaiah was one of the most popular works in the period between the foundation of the Second Temple c. 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE.{{sfn| Hannah | 2005 | p=7}} Isaiah's \"shoot [which] will come up from the stump of Jesse\" is alluded to or cited in the [[Psalms of Solomon]] and various apocalyptic works including the [[Similitudes of Enoch]], [[2 Baruch]], [[2 Esdras|4 Ezra]], and the third of the [[Sibylline oracles]], all of which understood it to refer to a/the messiah and the messianic age.{{sfn|Hannah| 2005| p= 11}} Isaiah 6, in which Isaiah describes his vision of God enthroned in the Temple, influenced the visions of God in works such as the \"Book of the Watchers\" section of the [[Book of Enoch]], the [[Book of Daniel]] and others, often combined with the similar vision from the [[Book of Ezekiel]].{{sfn | Hannah | 2005 | pp = 22\u201323}} A very influential portion of Isaiah was the four so-called [[Songs of the Suffering Servant]] from Isaiah 42, 49, 50 and 52, in which God calls upon his servant to lead the nations (the servant is horribly abused, sacrifices himself in accepting the punishment due others, and is finally rewarded). Some [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple]] texts, including the [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and the [[Book of Daniel]] identified the Servant as a group \u2013 \"the wise\" who \"will lead many to righteousness\" (Daniel 12:3) \u2013 but others, notably the [[Similitudes of Enoch]], understood it in messianic terms.{{sfn |Hannah|2005|p=27-31}} The earliest Christians, building on this second tradition, interpreted Isaiah 52:13\u201353:12, the fourth of the songs, as a prophecy of the death and exaltation of Jesus, a role which Jesus himself accepted according to Luke 4:17\u201321.{{sfn|Barker|2003|pp = 534\u201335}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\nThe Book of Isaiah has been immensely influential in the formation of Christianity, from the devotion to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] to anti-Jewish polemic, medieval passion iconography, and modern [[Christian feminism]] and [[liberation theology]]. The regard in which Isaiah was held was so high that the book was frequently called \"the Fifth Gospel\", the prophet who spoke more clearly of Christ and the Church than any others.{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|p=1-2}} Its influence extends beyond the Church and Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of [[Handel's Messiah]] to a host of such everyday phrases as \"swords into ploughshares\" and \"voice in the wilderness\".{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|pp =1\u20132}}\n\nThe [[Gospel of John]] quotes {{bibleref||Isaiah|6:10|NIV}} and states that \"Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus\u2019 glory and spoke about him.\"<ref>{{bibleref||John|12:39-41|NIV}}</ref> Isaiah makes up 27 of the 37 quotations from the prophets in the [[Pauline epistles]], and takes pride of place in the Gospels and in [[Acts of the Apostles]].{{sfn|Sawyer| 1996| p= 22}} [[Isaiah 7:14]], where the prophet is assuring king [[Ahaz]] that God will save Judah from the invading armies of Israel and Syria, forms the basis for [[Matthew 1:23]]'s doctrine of the virgin birth,{{sfn|Sweeney|1996|p= 161}} while Isaiah 40:3\u20135's image of the exiled Israel led by God and proceeding home to Jerusalem on a newly constructed road through the wilderness was taken up by all four Gospels and applied to [[John the Baptist]] and Jesus.{{sfn|Brueggemann| 2003| p= 174}}\n\nIsaiah seems always to have had a prominent place in Jewish Bible use, and it is probable that Jesus himself was deeply influenced by Isaiah.{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|p=23}} Thus many of the Isaiah passages that are familiar to Christians gained their popularity not directly from Isaiah but from the use of them by Jesus and the early Christian authors \u2013 this is especially true of the [[Book of Revelation]], which depends heavily on Isaiah for its language and imagery.{{sfn|Sawyer|1996|p=25}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Messiah (Handel)]]\n* ''[[Rorate Coeli]]''\n* [[Songs of the Suffering Servant]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n|last = Bandstra\n|first = Barry L.\n|title = Reading the Old Testament: an introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n|publisher = Cengage Learning\n|year = 2008\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA489&lpg=PA489&dq=Bandstra,+Barry+L+%282004%29.+Reading+the+Old+Testament:+an+introduction+to+the+Hebrew+Bible#v=onepage&q=Isaiah&f=false\n|ref = harv\n|isbn = 0495391050\n}}\n* {{cite book\n|last = Barker\n|first = Margaret\n|chapter                           = Isaiah\n|editor1-last                      = Dunn\n|editor1-first                     = James D.

A bilinear map is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]\n:''B'' : ''V'' \u00d7 ''W'' \u2192 ''X''\nsuch that for any ''w'' in ''W'', the map <math>B_w</math>\n:''v'' \u21a6 ''B''(''v'', ''w'')\nis a [[linear map]] from ''V'' to ''X'', and for any ''v'' in ''V'', the map <math>B_v</math>\n:''w'' \u21a6 ''B''(''v'', ''w'')\nis a linear map from ''W'' to ''X''.\n\nIn other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed. \n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W''}} and we have {{nowrap|1=''B''(''v'', ''w'') = ''B''(''w'', ''v'')}} for all ''v'', ''w'' in ''V'', then we say that ''B'' is ''[[symmetric function|symmetric]]''.\n\nThe case where ''X'' is the base field ''F'', and we have a '''[[bilinear form]]''', is particularly useful (see for example [[scalar product]], [[inner product]] and [[quadratic form]]).\n\n=== Modules ===\nThe definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field ''F'', we use [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[commutative ring]] ''R''. It generalizes to ''n''-ary functions, where the proper term is ''[[Multilinear map|multilinear]]''.\n\nFor non-commutative rings ''R'' and ''S'', a left ''R''-module ''M'' and a right ''S''-module ''N'', a bilinear map is a map {{nowrap|''B'' : ''M'' \u00d7 ''N'' \u2192 ''T''}} with ''T'' an {{nowrap|(''R'', ''S'')}}-[[bimodule]], and for which any ''n'' in ''N'', {{nowrap|''m'' \u21a6 ''B''(''m'', ''n'')}} is an ''R''-module homomorphism, and for any ''m'' in ''M'', {{nowrap|''n'' \u21a6 ''B''(''m'', ''n'')}} is an ''S''-module homomorphism.  This satisfies\n\n:''B''(''r'' \u22c5 ''m'', ''n'') = ''r'' \u22c5 ''B''(''m'', ''n'')\n:''B''(''m'', ''n'' \u22c5 ''s'') = ''B''(''m'', ''n'') \u22c5 ''s''\n\nfor all ''m'' in ''M'', ''n'' in ''N'', ''r'' in ''R'' and ''s'' in ''S'', as well as ''B'' being [[Additive map|additive]] in each argument.\n\n==Properties==\nA first immediate consequence of the definition is that {{nowrap|1=''B''(''v'', ''w'') = 0<sub>''X''</sub>}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''v'' = 0<sub>''V''</sub>}} or {{nowrap|1=''w'' = 0<sub>''W''</sub>}}. This may be seen by writing the [[zero vector]] 0<sub>''X''</sub> as {{nowrap|0 \u22c5 0<sub>''X''</sub>}} (and similarly for 0<sub>''W''</sub>) and moving the scalar 0 \"outside\", in front of ''B'', by linearity.\n\nThe set {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W''; ''X'')}} of all bilinear maps is a [[linear subspace]] of the space ([[viz.]] [[vector space]], [[module (mathematics)|module]]) of all maps from {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''W''}} into ''X''.\n\n[[File:FourfacesofBilinaearmaps.PNG|thumb|320px|A matrix ''M'' determines a bilinear map into the reals by means of a real bilinear form {{nowrap|(''v'', ''w'') \u21a6 ''v''\u2032''Mw''}}, then [[metric tensor|associates]] of this are taken to the other three possibilities using [[dual space|duality]] and the [[musical isomorphism]]]]\n\nIf ''V'', ''W'', ''X'' are [[finite-dimensional]], then so is {{nowrap|''L''(''V'', ''W''; ''X'')}}. For {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''F''}}, i.e. bilinear forms, the dimension of this space is {{nowrap|dim ''V'' \u00d7 dim ''W''}} (while the space {{nowrap|''L''(''V'' \u00d7 ''W''; ''F'')}} of ''linear'' forms is of dimension {{nowrap|dim ''V'' + dim ''W''}}). To see this, choose a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for ''V'' and ''W''; then each bilinear map can be uniquely represented by the matrix {{nowrap|''B''(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''j''</sub>)}}, and vice versa. \nNow, if ''X'' is a space of higher dimension, we obviously have {{nowrap|1=dim ''L''(''V'', ''W''; ''X'') = dim ''V'' \u00d7 dim ''W'' \u00d7 dim ''X''}}.\n\n== Examples ==\n* [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrix multiplication]] is a bilinear map {{nowrap|M(''m'', ''n'') \u00d7 M(''n'', ''p'') \u2192 M(''m'', ''p'')}}.\n* If a [[vector space]] ''V'' over the [[real number]]s '''R''' carries an [[inner product space|inner product]], then the inner product is a bilinear map {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 '''R'''}}.\n* In general, for a vector space ''V'' over a field ''F'', a [[bilinear form]] on ''V'' is the same as a bilinear map {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''V'' \u2192 ''F''}}.\n* If ''V'' is a vector space with [[dual space]] ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup>, then the application operator, {{nowrap|1=''b''(''f'', ''v'') = ''f''(''v'')}} is a bilinear map from {{nowrap|''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> \u00d7 ''V''}} to the base field.\n* Let ''V'' and ''W'' be vector spaces over the same base field ''F''. If ''f'' is a member of ''V''<sup>\u2217</sup> and ''g'' a member of ''W''<sup>\u2217</sup>, then {{nowrap|1=''b''(''v'', ''w'') = ''f''(''v'')''g''(''w'')}} defines a bilinear map {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''W'' \u2192 ''F''}}.\n* The [[cross product]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is a bilinear map {{nowrap|'''R'''<sup>3</sup> \u00d7 '''R'''<sup>3</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.\n* Let {{nowrap|''B'' : ''V'' \u00d7 ''W'' \u2192 ''X''}} be a bilinear map, and {{nowrap|''L'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''W''}} be a [[linear map]], then {{nowrap|(''v'', ''u'') \u21a6 ''B''(''v'', ''Lu'')}} is a bilinear map on {{nowrap|''V'' \u00d7 ''U''}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tensor product]]\n* [[Sesquilinear form]]\n* [[Bilinear filtering]]\n* [[Multilinear map]]\n* [[Multilinear subspace learning]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Bilinear mapping|id=p/b016280}}\n\n{{Functional Analysis}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilinear Map}}\n[[Category:Bilinear operators]]\n[[Category:Multilinear algebra]]", "sha1": "pgpexyyg5z0blc8s5ii2fr65d02jvtg"}}, {"title": "Blind Blake", "ns": "0", "id": "4366", "revision": {"id": "861755481", "parentid": "858261825", "timestamp": "2018-09-29T19:47:33Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2A00:23C5:D00C:6C00:C49F:557E:12C7:4443"}, "comment": "/* Music */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|the calypso performer|Blake Alphonso Higgs}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2012}}\n{{Infobox musical artist <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Musicians -->\n| name                = Blind Blake\n| image               = Blind Blake.jpg\n| caption             = The only known photograph of Blake,<ref name=gracyk/> ca. 1927\n| background          = solo_singer<!-- do not tamper -->\n| birth_name          = Arthur Blake\n| birth_date          = 1896\n| birth_place         = [[Jacksonville, Florida]], or [[Newport News, Virginia]], United States (uncertain)\n| origin              = \n| death_date          = December 1, 1934 (aged 38)\n| death_place         = [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], U.S.\n| genre               = {{flatlist|\n*[[Piedmont blues]]\n*[[ragtime]]\n*[[country blues]]\n}}\n| instrument          = {{flatlist|\n*Guitar\n*vocals\n}}\n| years_active        = \n| label               = \n| associated_acts     = [[Irene Scruggs]]\n}}\n'''Arthur \"Blind\" Blake''' (1896 \u2013 December 1, 1934) was an American [[blues]] and [[ragtime]] singer and guitarist. He is known for numerous recordings he made for [[Paramount Records]] between 1926 and 1932.\n\n==Early life==\nLittle is known of Blake's life. Promotional materials from [[Paramount Records]] indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and it seems that he lived there during various periods. He seems to have had relatives in [[Patterson, Georgia]]. Some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a [[Geechee]] or [[Gullah]] dialect, suggesting a connection with the [[Sea Islands]]. [[Blind Willie McTell]] indicated that Blake's real name was Arthur Phelps, but later research has shown this is unlikely to be correct.<ref name=\"Balfour\">Balfour, Alan. CD liner notes.

One of these documents is his 1934 death certificate, which states he was born in 1896 in [[Newport News, Virginia]], to Winter and Alice Blake (his mother's name is followed by a question mark).

According to van der Tuuk et al., he apparently returned to Florida for the winter. In the 1930s he was reported to be playing in front of a Jacksonville hotel.<ref name=Tuuk/>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nBlake married Beatrice McGee around 1931. In the following year he made his final recording at the Paramount headquarters, in [[Grafton, Wisconsin]], just before the label went out of business. For decades nothing was known of him after this point, and it was rumored that he met with a violent death; [[Reverend Gary Davis]] heard he had been hit by a [[streetcar]] in 1934. The research of van der Tuuk et al. suggests that Blake stayed in Wisconsin, living in [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Brewer's Hill (Milwaukee)|Brewer's Hill]] neighborhood, where Paramount boarded many of its artists. He seems not to have found work as a musician. In April 1933 he was hospitalized with [[pneumonia]] and never fully recovered. On December 1, 1934, after three weeks of decline, Beatrice Blake summoned an ambulance. He suffered a [[pulmonary hemorrhage]] and died on the way to the hospital. The cause of death was listed as [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. He was buried in Glen Oaks Cemetery, in [[Glendale, Wisconsin]].<ref name=Tuuk/>\n\n==Music==\nBlake's first recordings were made in 1926,<ref name=\"Russell 2\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=12|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> and his [[Gramophone record|records]] sold well. His first solo record was \"Early Morning Blues\", with \"West Coast Blues\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and were prototypes for the burgeoning [[Piedmont blues]]. Blake made his last recordings in 1932; his career ended with Paramount's bankruptcy. Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow have suggested it is possible that only one side of Blake's last record is actually by him;<ref>Jas Obrecht 1993</ref> \"Champagne Charlie Is My Name\" does not sound like Blake's playing or singing.\n\nHis complex and intricate fingerpicking inspired [[Reverend Gary Davis]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[Ry Cooder]], [[Arlen Roth]], [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Leon Redbone]] and many others.\n\nOne of the classic folk blues tracks on [[Bob Dylan]]'s 1992 album ''[[Good As I Been to You]]'' is a cover of Blind Blake's \"You Gonna Quit Me Blues.\"\n\nThe French singer-songwriter [[Francis Cabrel]] refers to Blake in the song \"Cent Ans de Plus\", on the 1999 album ''Hors-Saison.''\n\n==Compilations==\n* ''The Legendary Blind

His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays. As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique. Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary. He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz. A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to [[Fatima College]] where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ramdass. Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team. When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket.\n\n==Early first-class career==\n1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by [[Carl Hooper]] set the previous year.<ref>[http://www.nalis.gov.tt/Biography%5Cbio_BrianLara_captaincy.html ''The Coming Foretold''] [[The Independent]].

Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 1988\u201389|touring Indian team]] further elevated his reputation.\n\nHis first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team. In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in [[Zimbabwe]] and scored 145.\n\nIn 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day [[Geddes Grant Shield]]. It was also in 1990 that he made his belated Test debut for West Indies against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], scoring 44 and 5. He had made his ODI debut a month earlier against Pakistan, scoring 11.\n\n==International career==\n{{see also|List of batsmen who have scored over 10000 One Day International cricket runs}}\n\nIn January 1993, Lara scored 277 versus [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] in [[Sydney]]. This, his maiden Test century in his fifth Test, was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2\u20131.

He has the highest individual score in both [[first-class cricket]] (501 [[not out]] for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] in 1994) and Test cricket (400 not out for the West Indies against [[English cricket team|England]] in 2004). Lara amassed his world record 501 in 474 minutes off only 427 balls. He hit 308 in boundaries (10 sixes and 62 fours). His partners were [[Roger Twose]] (115 partnership \u2013 2nd wicket), [[Trevor Penney]] (314 \u2013 3rd), [[Paul Smith (cricketer, born 1964)|Paul Smith]] (51 \u2013 4th) and [[Keith John Piper|Keith Piper]] (322 unbroken \u2013 5th). Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire.\n\n[[File:BrianLaraUkexpatCropped.jpg|thumb|right|Brian Lara batting for the West Indies against [[India national cricket team|India]] at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados, in 2002.]]\n\nHe is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until [[Matthew Hayden]]'s 380 against [[Zimbabwean cricket team|Zimbabwe]] in 2003. His 400 not out also made him the second player (after [[Donald Bradman]]) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after [[Bill Ponsford]]) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries. He has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and [[Kumar Sangakkara]]'s eleven. As a captain, he scored five double centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge. In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in Three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award. The Test Series was eventually drawn 2\u20132. He also held the record for the highest total number of runs in a Test career, after overtaking [[Allan Border]] in an innings of 226 played at [[Adelaide Oval]], Australia in November 2005. This would be later broken by [[Sachin Tendulkar]] of [[India]] on 17 October 2008 whilst playing against Australia at Mohali in the 2nd Test of the [[Border-Gavaskar Trophy]] 2008.\n\nLara captained the West Indies from 1998 to 1999, when West Indies suffered their first whitewash at the hands of [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. Following this they played [[Australia cricket team|Australia]] in a four-Test series which was drawn 2\u20132, with Lara scoring 546 runs including three centuries and one double hundred. In the second Test at Kingston he scored 213 while in the third Test he scored 153* in the second innings as West Indies chased down 311 with one wicket left. He won the Man of the Match award for both matches and was also named Man of the Series.\n\nThe [[Wisden 100]] rates Lara's 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown in 1998\u201399 as the second best innings ever after Sir Donald Bradman's 270 against England in Melbourne in 1936\u201337.\n\nIn 2001 Lara was named the Man of the Carlton Series in Australia with an average of 46.50, the highest average by a West Indian in that series, scoring two half centuries and one century, 116 against Australia. That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty \u2013 including the double century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test Match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series. These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/srilanka/content/story/133274.html |title=Murali: 'Lara's still No. 1' |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nLara was reappointed as captain against the touring [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 2003, and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge, showing a return to stellar performance. Later that season, under his captaincy, West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1\u20130 with Lara making a double century in the First Test. In September 2004, West Indies won the ICC Champions Trophy in England under his captaincy.\n\nIn March 2005, Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal [[Cable & Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable & Wireless]] sponsorship deal, which clashed with the Cricket Board's main sponsor, [[Digicel]]. Six other players were involved in this dispute, including stars [[Chris Gayle]], [[Ramnaresh Sarwan]] and [[Dwayne Bravo]]. Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity, when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/westindies/content/story/146390.html |title='I'm ready to play if best team is selected' \u2013 Lara |publisher=Content-uk.cricinfo.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref> The issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring [[South African cricket team|South African team]].\n\nLara returned to the team for the second Test (and scored a huge first innings score of 196), but in the process lost his captaincy indefinitely to the newly appointed [[Shivnarine Chanderpaul]]. In the next Test, against the same opponents, he scored a 176 in the first innings. After a one-day series against South Africa, he scored his first Test century against the visiting Pakistanis in the first Test at [[Kensington Oval]], [[Bridgetown]], Barbados which the West Indies eventually won.\n\n[[File:Brian Lara lap of honour.jpg|thumb|right|Lara during his lap of honour in his final international match, [[2007 Cricket World Cup]].]]\n\nOn 26 April 2006 Lara was reappointed the captain of the West Indies cricket team for the third time. This followed the resignation of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who had been captain for thirteen months \u2013 in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed. In May 2006, Lara led the West Indies to successful One-Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India. Lara's team played Australia in the finals of the DLF Cup and the ICC Champions Trophy where they finished runners up in both finals.\n\nOn 16 December 2006 he became the first player for the West Indies to pass 10,000 One Day International runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingCareerRuns_ODI.asp?Stat=5000 |title= ODI Batting Statistics}}</ref> along with [[Sachin Tendulkar]] one of only two players, at the time, to do so in both forms of the game.

breed|breed]] of small [[hound]] that is similar in appearance to the much larger [[foxhound]]. The beagle is a [[scent hound]], developed primarily for [[Tracking (hunting)|hunting]] [[hare]]. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as [[detection dog]] for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in [[quarantine]] around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular [[Companion dog|pet]] due to its size, good temper, and lack of [[Dog health#Genetic diseases|inherited health problems]].\n\nAlthough beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in [[Great Britain]] around the 1830s from several breeds, including the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot Hound]], the [[North Country Beagle]], the [[Southern Hound]], and possibly the [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]].\n\nBeagles have been depicted in popular culture since [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. [[Snoopy]] of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Peanuts]]'' has been called \"the world's most famous beagle\".<ref name=\"mostfamousbeagle\">{{Citation |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OwtaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dUsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=6491,3147272 |accessdate= 31 May 2013 |title= World's Most Famous Beagle |newspaper = [[The Victoria Advocate]] |date= 15 December 1974 |page= 54 |location= [[Victoria, Texas]] }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nDogs of similar size and purpose to the modern beagle{{Ref label|A|a|none}} can be traced in [[Ancient Greece]]<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Beagle Club of NSW (Australia)|title=Breed Information|url=http://www.beagleclubnsw.org.au/breedinf.htm |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\nback to around the 5th century BC. [[Xenophon]], born around 430 BC, in his ''Treatise on Hunting'' or ''[[Cynegeticus]]'' refers to a [[hound]] that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot. Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of [[Canute the Great|Canute]] which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a [[Deer|stag]] should have one foot mutilated.<ref>Daglish p.7</ref> If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the [[Middle Ages]] to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.<ref>Rackham p.130</ref>\n\n[[Image:Southern Hound.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Southern Hound]] is thought to be an ancestor of the beagle]]\n\nIn the 11th century, [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] brought the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot hound]] to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the [[St. Hubert Hound]] which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with [[Greyhound]]s to give them an extra turn of speed.<ref>Smith p.209</ref> Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.{{Ref label|B|b|none}}\n\nFrom medieval times, ''beagle'' was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood {{convert|8|to|9|in|cm}} at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her ''singing beagles'' and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups.<ref name=\"J1858\">Jesse (1858) pp.438\u20139</ref> 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's ''Researches into the History of the British Dog'' from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer [[Gervase Markham]] is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: {{quote|little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds.<ref>G. Jesse vol II, pp.223\u2013232</ref>}} Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.<ref name=\"PB\">{{cite web|url=http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html#24.|title=What is a Pocket Beagle?|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=9 July 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070609070137/http://clubs.akc.org/NBC/NBC_FAQs.html| archivedate = 9 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Beagle ancient.jpg|thumb|right|This image from the turn of the 19th century shows a dog with a heavier body and lacking the features of later strains.]]\n\nBy the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the [[Southern Hound]] and the [[North Country Beagle]] (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the [[River Trent]] and probably closely related to the [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot Hound]]. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in [[Yorkshire]] and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New Sporting Magazine|publisher=Baldwin and Craddock|year=1833|volume=4}}</ref> As [[fox hunting]] became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern [[English Foxhound|Foxhound]]. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small [[rabbit-hunting]] packs.\n\n===Development of the modern breed===\nReverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in [[Essex]] in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; [[William Youatt]] suspected that [[Harrier (dog)|Harriers]] formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure.<ref name=\"Y110\">Youatt. p.110</ref> Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about {{convert|10|in|cm}} at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in ''The Sportsman's Library'' in 1845). [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and [[Edward Turnour, 4th Earl Winterton|Lord Winterton]] also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.<ref>Mills p.172</ref>\n\n[[Image:4-beagles.jpg|thumb|right|Early images of the Beagle (clockwise from top left): 1833, 1835, [[John Henry Walsh|Stonehenge]]'s Medium (1859, reusing [[William Youatt|Youatt]]'s 1852 \"Beagle\" image) and Dwarf Beagle (1859).]]\n\nAlthough credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.<ref name=\"K7\">Kraeuter p.7</ref>\n\nIn the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs.<ref>Scott pp.75\u20138</ref> In 1856, \"Stonehenge\" (the pseudonym of [[John Henry Walsh]]), writing in the ''Manual of British Rural Sports'', was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish [[terrier]] breeds.<ref name=\"S98\">\"Stonehenge\" pp.98\u20139</ref> Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:\n\n{{quote|In size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.<ref name=\"S98\" />}}\n\nBy 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England.<ref name=\"K9\">Krauter p.9</ref> The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time.<ref name=\"A12\">Arnold p.12</ref> The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle.<ref>Daglish p.9</ref> By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.<ref name=\"K9\" />\n\n===Export===\nBeagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged [[Dachshund]]s with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General [[Richard Rowett]] from [[Illinois]] imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887.<ref>Arnold p.14</ref> The beagle was accepted as a breed by the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) in 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/beagle/index.cfm |title=Get to know the Beagle |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=29 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PDVOZicz?url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/beagle/index.cfm |archivedate=30 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.\n\n==Popularity==\n\n[[Image:Beagle Upsy.jpg|thumb|right|An attractive uniform type for the breed developed at the start of the 20th century]]\n\nOn its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at [[Peterborough]] that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896.<ref name=\"A12\" /> The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of [[World War I]] when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by [[World War II]], the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.<ref>Daglish pp.10\u201312</ref>\n\nAs purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the [[Westminster Kennel Club]]'s show and by 1939 a beagle \u2013 Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman \u2013 had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.<ref>Arnold pp.14\u20135</ref>  On 12 February 2008, a beagle, [[K-Run's Park Me In First|K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno)]], won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&sid=aS4PHV8NjOW8|title=Beagle Breakthrough: Westminster Crowd Favorite Uno Is Top Dog|publisher=Bloomberg|date=12 February 2008|accessdate=13 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413162716/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088|archivedate=13 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years.

Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle.

The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a [[dewlap]]; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered [[abdomen]] and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the \"stern\") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent.<ref name=\"QLD\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beagleclubqld.org/documents/booklet.pdf|format=PDF|title=What you need to know about Beagles|publisher=The Beagle Club of Queensland|accessdate=14 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925110905/http://www.beagleclubqld.org/documents/booklet.pdf|archivedate=25 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the [[Stifle joint|stifles]].<ref>See various breed standards linked from the breed box at the top of the article.</ref>\n\nThe tricolored beagle{{mdash}}white with large black areas and light brown shading{{mdash}}is the most common.  Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the \"Classic Tri\" with a jet black saddle (also known as \"Blackback\"), to the \"Dark Tri\" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the \"Faded Tri\" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as ''pied''. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures.  (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.\n\nTwo-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (''ticking''), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the [[Bluetick Coonhound]].

As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-[[acre]] field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while [[Fox Terrier]]s took 15 minutes and [[Scottish Terrier]]s failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most [[mountain rescue]] teams in favor of [[collie]]s, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable.<ref name=\"F40\" /> The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.<ref>Fogle p.173</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Breed varieties===\nThe [[American Kennel Club]] recognizes two separate varieties of beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than {{convert|13|in|cm}}, and the 15-inch for those between {{convert|13|and|15|in|cm}}. The [[Canadian Kennel Club]] recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding {{convert|15|in|cm}}.  The [[Kennel Club (UK)]] and [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between {{convert|13|and|16|in|cm}}.\n\n[[Image:BraxtonPuggle-edit1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Puggle]], a beagle/pug cross, shows traits from both breeds.]]\n\nEnglish and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard \u2013 which disallows animals over {{convert|15|in|cm}} \u2013 are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to {{convert|16|in|cm}}.\n\nPocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is now not recognized by any Kennel Club.\n  \nA strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability.

Described in several breed standards as \"merry\", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor [[guard dogs]] for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the [[Yorkshire Terrier]], [[Cairn Terrier]], [[Miniature Schnauzer]], [[West Highland White Terrier]], and [[Fox Terrier]].<ref>Fogle pp.176\u20137</ref>{{Ref label|C|c|none}}\n\nBeagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]'', as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence.

Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry.<ref>Kraeuter pp.96</ref> They also generally get along well with cats and other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest.

They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses.<ref>Maxwell p.42</ref> Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together (\"so close that they might be covered with a sheet\"<ref name=\"Y110\" />) which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to [[spaniel]]s when hunting [[pheasant]].<ref>Blakey p.77</ref>\n\nWith the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In ''Anecdotes of Dogs'' (1846), [[Edward Jesse]] says:\n\n{{quote|In rabbit-shooting, in gorse and thick cover, nothing can be more cheerful than the beagle. They also are easily heard over long distances and in thick cover. They have been called rabbit-beagles from this employment, for which they are peculiarly qualified, especially those dogs which are somewhat wire-haired.<ref name=\"J1858\" />}}[[Image:Moritz v d Tomburg.jpg|thumb|left|The Beagle has been used for rabbit-hunting since the earliest development of the breed.]]\n\nIn the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.\nHunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]] and in England and Wales by the [[Hunting Act 2004]]. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the [[landowner]]'s permission. [[Drag hunting]] is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.\n\nThe traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.\n\nAs hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British [[Independent school (UK)|public schools]] traditionally maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against [[Eton College|Eton's]] use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today,<ref>{{cite book|title=Henry Salt: Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters|first=George|last=Hendrick|year=1977|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-00611-9|pages=68\u201371}}</ref> and a pack used by [[Wye College|Imperial College]] in [[Wye, Kent]] was stolen by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1103181.stm |title=Activists steal beagle pack|publisher=BBC News|date=5 January 2001|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]], Wye, [[Radley College|Radley]], the [[Royal Agricultural University]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/best/article.php?aid=71052&cid=396|title=Directory of UK hunts 2006/2007|publisher=Horse and Hound|date=20 November 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071006200749/http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/best/article.php?aid=71052&cid=396| archivedate= 6 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including [[snowshoe hare]], [[cottontail rabbit]]s, [[game bird]]s, [[roe deer]], [[red deer]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]], [[wild boar]] and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt [[stoat]].<ref name=\"K101\">Kraeuter pp.97\u2013104</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/mammalsoc.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512151544/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/mammalsoc.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 May 2010|title=Submission to Lord Burns' Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs|publisher=The Mammal Society|date=16 March 2000|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.<ref name=\"K101\" />\n\n==Detection==\n[[Image:CBP Airport.jpg|thumb|Beagles have excellent noses; this dog is employed by the US Customs and Border Protection Agency.]]\n\nBeagles are used as detection dogs in the [[Beagle Brigade]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]].

It was leather that had been treated so that it became tough and rigid, as well as able to hold moulded decoration. It was the usual material for the robust carrying-cases that were made for important pieces of metalwork, instruments such as [[astrolabe]]s, personal sets of cutlery, books, pens and the like.<ref>Davies, 94; [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=cuir+bouilli 24 items in the British Museum]</ref> It was used for some [[armour]], being both much cheaper and much lighter than [[plate armour]], but could not withstand a direct blow from a blade, nor a gunshot.<ref>Ffoulkes, 97\u201399; Cheshire, 42; Abse; Loades, 10</ref>\n\nAlternative names are \"moulded leather\" and \"hardened leather\". In the course of making the material it becomes very soft, and can be impressed into a [[moulding (process)|mould]] to give it the desired shape and decoration, which most surviving examples have. Pieces such as chests and coffers also usually have a wooden inner core.<ref>Davies, 94; Abse</ref>\n\nVarious recipes for making cuir bouilli survive, and do not agree with each other; probably there were a range of recipes, partly reflecting different final uses. Vegetable-tanned leather is generally specified. Scholars have debated the subject at length and attempted to recreate the historical material. Many, but not all, sources agree that actual boiling of the leather was not part of the process, but immersion in water, cold or hot, was.<ref>Davies, 94\u201398; Cheshire, 42\u201353; Loades, 10; Abse; Bradbury, 10</ref>\n\n==Military use==\n[[File:2 Pickelhauben (1860).jpg|thumb|German [[pickelhaube]], c. 1860]]\nCuir bouilli was used for cheap and light armour, although it was much less effective than plate armour, which was extremely expensive and too heavy for much to be worn by infantry. However, cuir bouilli could be reinforced against slashing blows by the addition of metal bands or strips, especially in helmets. Modern experiments on simple cuir bouilli have shown that it can reduce the depth of an arrow wound considerably, especially if coated with a crushed mineral facing mixed with glue, as one medieval Arab author recommended.<ref>Cheshire, 41\u201344, 51\u201353; Loades, 10; Bradbury, 10</ref>\n\nIn addition, \"armour based on hide has the unique advantage that it can, in extremis, provide some nutrition\", when actually boiled. [[Josephus]] records that the Jewish defenders in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|Siege of Jerusalem in AD 70]] were reduced to eating their shields and other leather kit, as was the Spanish expedition of [[Tristan de Luna]] in 1559.<ref>Cheshire, 47</ref> \n[[File:Crupper Plate MET DP108778.jpg|thumb|Crupper plate for [[barding|horse armour]], 16th century, north Europe]]\n\nVersions of cuir bouilli were used since ancient times, especially for shields, in many parts of the world.<ref>Ffoulkes, 97\u2013100; Cheshire, 43 ([[Sioux]])</ref> Although in general leather does not survive long burial, and excavated archaeological evidence for it is rare, an Irish shield of cuir bouilli with wooden formers, deposited in a [[peat bog]], has survived for some 2,500 years.<ref>Davies, 94\u201395</ref> It was commonly used in the Western world for [[helmet]]s; the [[pickelhaube]], the standard German helmet, was not replaced by a steel [[stahlhelm]] until 1916, in the midst of [[World War I]].<ref>Stone, 220\u2013221; Ward, Arthur, ''A Guide to Wartime Collectables'', 23, 2013, Pen and Sword, {{ISBN|1473831067}}, 9781473831063, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vOt7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA23 google books]</ref> As leather does not conduct heat the way metal does, firemen continued to use boiled leather helmets until WW2, and the invention of strong [[plastic]]s.<ref>Davies, 95; [http://www.ccq.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=100&no_cache=1&id=100&no_cache=1&tx_mcccfrechercheavancee_pi1%5Bress_uid%5D=27&type=0 19th-century fireman's helmet from Montreal (text in French)]</ref>\n\nThe word [[cuirass]] for a breastplate indicates that these were originally made of leather.<ref>Loades, 10</ref> In the [[Late Middle Ages]], the heyday of plate armour, cuir bouilli continued to be used even by the rich for [[barding|horse armour]] and often for [[tournament]] armour,<ref>Ffoulkes, 97\u201398</ref> as well as by ordinary infantry soldiers. Tournaments were increasingly regulated in order to reduce the risk to life, and in 1278 [[Edward I of England]] organized one in [[Windsor Great Park]] at which cuir bouilli armour was worn, and the king provided swords made of [[whale]] bone and [[parchment]].<ref>Barker, 179</ref>  \n[[File:Traiciti\u00e9 de la forme et devis comme on fait les tournoys BNF Fr. 2695 f27v (cropped).jpg|thumb|Design for cuir bouilli armour for tournaments, from ''[[Le Livre des tournois]]'', 1460s]]\n  \nThe account of the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415 by [[Jean de Wavrin]], who was present on the French side, describes the crucial force of English [[longbow]]men as having on their heads either cuir bouilli helmets, or [[wicker]] with iron strips, or nothing (the last, he says, were also barefoot).<ref>Loades, 39; the passage in Wavrin's text [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R6n_GnE9hSYC&pg=PA211#v=onepage&q&f=false is here]</ref>\n\nA few pieces of Roman horse armour in cuir bouilli have been excavated. Evidence from documents such as inventories show that it was common in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, and used by the highest ranks, but survivals are very few.<ref>Phyrr et al., 57\u201359; all significant survivals are listed.</ref> In 1547 the Master of Armoury in the [[Tower of London]] ordered 46 sets of bards and crinets in preparation for the final invasion of Scotland in the war known as the [[Rough Wooing]].<ref>Phyrr et al., 57\u201358</ref> In September that year the English cavalry were crucial in the decisive victory at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]]. The German [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]] had six sets of cuir bouilli horse armour for his and his family's use in the 16th century.

This is of special interest to art historians because it was made in 1540 as a replica of a crucifix in silver presented by [[Charlemagne]] some 740 years before; an object of great interest as possibly the first of the long line of monumental crucifixes in Western art. In 1540 the original silver was melted down for church plate to replace that looted in the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527.

Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer. If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and [[crash (computing)|crashes]].\n\nExploiting the behavior of a buffer overflow is a well-known [[exploit (information security)|security exploit]]. On many systems, the memory layout of a program, or the system as a whole, is well defined. By sending in data designed to cause a buffer overflow, it is possible to write into areas known to hold [[execution (computing)|executable code]] and replace it with [[malicious code]], or to selectively overwrite data pertaining to the program's state, therefore causing behavior that was not intended by the original programmer. Buffers are widespread in [[operating system]] (OS) code, so it is possible to make attacks that perform [[privilege escalation]] and gain unlimited access to the computer's resources. The famed [[Morris worm]] in 1988 used this as one of its attack techniques.\n\n[[Programming language]]s commonly associated with buffer overflows include [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an [[Array data structure|array]] (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. [[Bounds checking]] can prevent buffer overflows, but requires additional code and processing time. Modern operating systems use a variety of techniques to combat malicious buffer overflows, notably by [[Address space layout randomization|randomizing the layout of memory]], or deliberately leaving space between buffers and looking for actions that write into those areas (\"canaries\").\n\n==Technical description==\nA buffer overflow occurs when [[data]] written to a buffer also corrupts data values in [[memory address]]es adjacent to the destination buffer due to insufficient [[bounds checking]]. This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.\n\n===Example===\n{{details|topic=stack-based overflows|Stack buffer overflow}}\n\nIn the following example expressed in [[C (programming language)|C]], a program has two variables which are adjacent in memory: an 8-byte-long string buffer, A, and a two-byte [[endianness|big-endian]] integer, B.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nchar           A[8] = \"\";\nunsigned short B    = 1979;\n</source>\n\nInitially, A contains nothing but zero bytes, and B contains the number 1979.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:32em; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | variable name\n! colspan=8 style=\"background:#ddf;\" | A\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:#fdd;\" | B\n|- style=\"background:#ddf;\"\n! value\n| colspan=8 | [<nowiki/>[[null string]]<nowiki/>]\n| colspan=2 style=\"background:#fdd;\" | <tt>1979</tt>\n|- style=\"background:#ddf;\"\n! hex value\n| <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt>\n|| <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt> || <tt>00</tt>\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\" | <tt>07</tt> || style=\"background:#fdd;\" | <tt>BB</tt>\n|}\n\nNow, the program attempts to store the [[null-terminated string]] {{code|\"excessive\"}} with [[ASCII]] encoding in the A buffer.\n<source lang=\"c\">\nstrcpy(A, \"excessive\");\n</source>\n{{code|\"excessive\"}} is 9 characters long and encodes to 10 bytes including the null terminator, but A can take only 8 bytes. By failing to check the length of the string, it also overwrites the value of B:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:32em; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"white-space:nowrap;\" | variable name\n! colspan=8 style=\"background:#ddf;\" | A\n! colspan=2 style=\"background:#fdd;\" | B\n|- style=\"background:#ddf;\"\n! value\n| <tt>'e'</tt> || <tt>'x'</tt> || <tt>'c'</tt> || <tt>'e'</tt>\n|| <tt>'s'</tt> || <tt>'s'</tt> || <tt>'i'</tt> || <tt>'v'</tt>\n| colspan=2 style=\"background:#dbd;\" | <tt>25856</tt>\n|- style=\"background:#ddf;\"\n! hex\n| <tt>65</tt> || <tt>78</tt> || <tt>63</tt> || <tt>65</tt>\n|| <tt>73</tt> || <tt>73</tt> || <tt>69</tt> || <tt>76</tt>\n| style=\"background:#dbd;\" | <tt>65</tt> || style=\"background:#dbd;\" | <tt>00</tt>\n|}\n\nB's value has now been inadvertently replaced by a number formed from part of the character string. In this example \"e\" followed by a zero byte would become 25856.\n\nWriting data past the end of allocated memory can sometimes be detected by the operating system to generate a [[segmentation fault]] error that terminates the process.\n\nTo prevent the buffer overflow from happening in this example, the call to <tt>[[strcpy]]</tt> could be replaced with <tt>[[strncpy]]</tt>, which takes the maximum capacity of A as an additional parameter and ensures that no more than this amount of data is written to A:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nstrncpy(A, \"excessive\", sizeof(A));\n</source>\n\nNote that the above code is not free from problems either; while a buffer overrun has been prevented this time, the <tt>[[strncpy]]</tt> library function does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string's length is greater than or equal to the size of the buffer (the third argument passed to the function), therefore <tt>A</tt> is, in this case, not null-terminated and cannot be treated as a valid C-style string.\n\n==Exploitation==\n\nThe techniques to [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]] a buffer overflow vulnerability vary by [[computer architecture|architecture]], by [[operating system]] and by memory region. For example, exploitation on the [[heap memory|heap]] (used for dynamically allocated memory), differs markedly from exploitation on the [[call stack]].\n\n===Stack-based exploitation===\n{{Main article|Stack buffer overflow}}\n\nA technically inclined user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program to their advantage in one of several ways:\n\n* By overwriting a local variable that is located near the vulnerable buffer on the stack, in order to change the behavior of the program\n* By overwriting the return address in a [[stack frame]]. Once the function returns, execution will resume at the return address as specified by the attacker - usually a user-input filled buffer\n* By overwriting a function pointer<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/462728/30/150/threaded |title=CORE-2007-0219: OpenBSD's IPv6 mbufs remote kernel buffer overflow |accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> or [[exception handler]], which is subsequently executed\n* By overwriting a local variable (or pointer) of a different stack frame, which will be used by the function which owns that frame later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/download/121751/ModernOverflowTargets.pdf |title=Modern Overflow Targets |accessdate=2013-07-05}}</ref>\n\nIf the address of the user-supplied data used to affect the stack buffer overflow is unpredictable, exploiting a stack buffer overflow to cause remote code execution becomes much more difficult.  One technique that can be used to exploit such a buffer overflow is called \"trampolining\".  In that technique, an attacker will find a pointer to the vulnerable stack buffer, and compute the location of their [[shellcode]] relative to that pointer.  Then, they will use the overwrite to jump to an [[Opcode|instruction]] already in memory which will make a second jump, this time relative to the pointer; that second jump will branch execution into the shellcode.  Suitable instructions are often present in large code.  The [[Metasploit Project]], for example, maintains a database of suitable opcodes, though it lists only those found in the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metasploit.com/users/opcode/msfopcode.cgi |title=The Metasploit Opcode Database |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512195939/http://www.metasploit.com/users/opcode/msfopcode.cgi |archivedate=12 May 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Heap-based exploitation===\n{{Main article|Heap overflow}}\n\nA buffer overflow occurring in the heap data area is referred to as a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows.  Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data.  Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers.  The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as [[malloc]] meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.\n\n[[Microsoft]]'s [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI+]] vulnerability in handling [[JPEG]]s is an example of the danger a heap overflow can present.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-028.mspx |title=Microsoft Technet Security Bulletin MS04-028 |accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>\n\n===Barriers to exploitation===\n\nManipulation of the buffer, which occurs before it is read or executed, may lead to the failure of an exploitation attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of [[metacharacter]]s and filtering out of non-[[alphanumeric]] strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; [[alphanumeric code]], [[polymorphic code]], [[self-modifying code]] and [[return-to-libc attack]]s. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by [[intrusion detection system]]s. In some cases, including where code is converted into [[Unicode]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/unicodebo.pdf |title=Creating Arbitrary Shellcode In Unicode Expanded Strings |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105041036/http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/unicodebo.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-05 |df= }}</ref> the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.\n\n===Practicalities of exploitation===\n\nIn real-world exploits there are a variety of challenges which need to be overcome for exploits to operate reliably. These factors include null bytes in addresses, variability in the location of shellcode, differences between environments and various counter-measures in operation.\n\n====NOP sled technique====\n\n{{Main article|NOP slide}}\n\n[[File:nopsled.svg|right|thumb|200px|Illustration of a NOP-sled payload on the stack.]]\n\nA NOP-sled is the oldest and most widely known technique for successfully exploiting a stack buffer overflow.<ref name=\"neworder\" /> It solves the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer by effectively increasing the size of the target area. To do this, much larger sections of the stack are corrupted with the [[no-op]] machine instruction. At the end of the attacker-supplied data, after the no-op instructions, the attacker places an instruction to perform a relative jump to the top of the buffer where the [[shellcode]] is located. This collection of no-ops is referred to as the \"NOP-sled\" because if the return address is overwritten with any address within the no-op region of the buffer, the execution will \"slide\" down the no-ops until it is redirected to the actual malicious code by the jump at the end. This technique requires the attacker to guess where on the stack the NOP-sled is instead of the comparatively small shellcode.<ref name=\"enderunix\" />\n\nBecause of the popularity of this technique, many vendors of [[intrusion prevention system]]s will search for this pattern of no-op machine instructions in an attempt to detect shellcode in use. It is important to note that a NOP-sled does not necessarily contain only traditional no-op machine instructions; any instruction that does not corrupt the machine state to a point where the shellcode will not run can be used in place of the hardware assisted no-op. As a result, it has become common practice for exploit writers to compose the no-op sled with randomly chosen instructions which will have no real effect on the shellcode execution.<ref name=\"Akritidis1\" />\n\nWhile this method greatly improves the chances that an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region.<ref name=\"klein1\" /> An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the [[system administrator]] to the attacker's activities. Another problem is that the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space from the end of the current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation, and as such it is still an important technique.\n\n====The jump to address stored in a register technique====\n\nThe \"jump to register\" technique allows for reliable exploitation of stack buffer overflows without the need for extra room for a NOP-sled and without having to guess stack offsets. The strategy is to overwrite the return pointer with something that will cause the program to jump to a known pointer stored within a register which points to the controlled buffer and thus the shellcode. For example, if register A contains a pointer to the start of a buffer then any jump or call taking that register as an operand can be used to gain control of the flow of execution.<ref name=\"shah\" /> [[File:jumpToEsp.png|left|thumb|300px|An instruction from ntdll.dll to call the <code>DbgPrint()</code> routine contains the [[i386]] machine opcode for <code>jmp esp</code>.]]\n\nIn practice a program may not intentionally contain instructions to jump to a particular register. The traditional solution is to find an unintentional instance of a suitable [[opcode]] at a fixed location somewhere within the program memory. In figure [[:Image:JumpToEsp.png|E]] on the left you can see an example of such an unintentional instance of the i386 <code>jmp esp</code> instruction. The opcode for this instruction is <code>FF E4</code>.<ref name=\"intel1\" /> This two-byte sequence can be found at a one-byte offset from the start of the instruction <code>call DbgPrint</code> at address <code>0x7C941EED</code>. If an attacker overwrites the program return address with this address the program will first jump to <code>0x7C941EED</code>, interpret the opcode <code>FF E4</code> as the <code>jmp esp</code> instruction, and will then jump to the top of the stack and execute the attacker's code.<ref name=\"packetstorm1\" />\n\nWhen this technique is possible the severity of the vulnerability increases considerably. This is because exploitation will work reliably enough to automate an attack with a virtual guarantee of success when it is run. For this reason, this is the technique most commonly used in [[Internet worm]]s that exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.<ref name=\"Yuji1\" />\n\nThis method also allows shellcode to be placed after the overwritten return address on the Windows platform. Since executables are mostly based at address <code>0x00400000</code> and x86 is a [[Little endian|Little Endian]] architecture, the last byte of the return address must be a null, which terminates the buffer copy and nothing is written beyond that. This limits the size of the shellcode to the size of the buffer, which may be overly restrictive. DLLs are located in high memory (above <code>0x01000000</code>) and so have addresses containing no null bytes, so this method can remove null bytes (or other disallowed characters) from the overwritten return address. Used in this way, the method is often referred to as \"DLL Trampolining\".\n\n==Protective countermeasures==\n\nVarious techniques have been used to detect or prevent buffer overflows, with various tradeoffs. The most reliable way to avoid or prevent buffer overflows is to use automatic protection at the language level. This sort of protection, however, cannot be applied to [[legacy code]], and often technical, business, or cultural constraints call for a vulnerable language. The following sections describe the choices and implementations available.\n\n===Choice of programming language===\n\nAssembly and C/C++ are popular programming languages that are vulnerable to buffer overflow, in part because they allow direct access to memory and are not strongly typed.<ref name=\"OWASP\">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overflows Buffer Overflows article on OWASP</ref> C provides no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory; more specifically, it does not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer. The standard C++ libraries provide many ways of safely buffering data, and C++'s [[Standard Template Library]] (STL) provides containers that can optionally perform bounds checking if the programmer explicitly calls for checks while accessing data. For example, a <code>vector</code>'s member function <code>at()</code> performs a bounds check and throws an <code>out_of_range</code> [[Exception handling|exception]] if the bounds check fails.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/at/ |title=vector::at - C++ Reference |publisher=Cplusplus.com |accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref> However, C++ behaves just like C if the bounds check is not explicitly called. Techniques to avoid buffer overflows also exist for C.\n\nLanguages that are strongly typed and don't allow direct memory access, such as COBOL, Java, Python, and others, prevent buffer overflow from occurring in most cases.<ref name=\"OWASP\"/> Many programming languages other than C/C++ provide runtime checking and in some cases even compile-time checking which might send a warning or raise an exception when C or C++ would overwrite data and continue to execute further instructions until erroneous results are obtained which might or might not cause the program to crash.  Examples of such languages include [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Modula-2]], [[Smalltalk]], [[OCaml]] and such C-derivatives as [[Cyclone (programming language)|Cyclone]], [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] and [[D (programming language)|D]]. The [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework]] bytecode environments also require bounds checking on all arrays. Nearly every [[interpreted programming language|interpreted language]] will protect against buffer overflows, signaling a well-defined error condition. Often where a language provides enough type information to do bounds checking an option is provided to enable or disable it. [[Static code analysis]] can remove many dynamic bound and type checks, but poor implementations and awkward cases can significantly decrease performance. Software engineers must carefully consider the tradeoffs of safety versus performance costs when deciding which language and compiler setting to use.\n\n===Use of safe libraries===\n\nThe problem of buffer overflows is common in the C and C++ languages because they expose low level representational details of buffers as containers for data types.  Buffer overflows must thus be avoided by maintaining a high degree of correctness in code which performs buffer management. It has also long been recommended to avoid standard library functions which are not bounds checked, such as <code>[[gets()|gets]]</code>, <code>[[scanf]]</code> and <code>[[strcpy]]</code>. The [[Morris worm]] exploited a <code>gets</code> call in [[fingerd]].<ref>http://wiretap.area.com/Gopher/Library/Techdoc/Virus/inetvir.823</ref>\n\nWell-written and tested abstract data type libraries which centralize and automatically perform buffer management, including bounds checking, can reduce the occurrence and impact of buffer overflows.  The two main building-block data types in these languages in which buffer overflows commonly occur are strings and arrays; thus, libraries preventing buffer overflows in these data types can provide the vast majority of the necessary coverage.  Still, failure to use these safe libraries correctly can result in buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities; and naturally, any bug in the library itself is a potential vulnerability. \"Safe\" library implementations include \"The Better String Library\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bstring.sf.net/ |title=The Better String Library}}</ref> Vstr<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.and.org/vstr/ |title=The Vstr Homepage |accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>  and Erwin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theiling.de/projects/erwin.html |title=The Erwin Homepage |accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> The [[OpenBSD]] operating system's [[C library]] provides the [[strlcpy]] and [[strlcat]] functions, but these are more limited than full safe library implementations.\n\nIn September 2007, Technical Report 24731, prepared by the C standards committee, was published;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:tr:24731:-1:ed-2:v1:en:sec:4|title=Information technology \u2014 Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces \u2014 Extensions to the C library \u2014 Part 1: Bounds-checking interfaces|last=International  Organization  for  Standardization|first=|date=2007|website=ISO Online Browsing Platform|access-date=}}</ref> it specifies a set of functions which are based on the standard C library's string and I/O functions, with additional buffer-size parameters.  However, the efficacy of these functions for the purpose of reducing buffer overflows is disputable; it requires programmer intervention on a per function call basis that is equivalent to intervention that could make the analogous older standard library functions buffer overflow safe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/x/QwY |title=CERT Secure Coding Initiative |accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>\n\n===Buffer overflow protection===\n{{Main article|Buffer overflow protection}}\n\nBuffer overflow protection is used to detect the most common buffer overflows by checking that the [[call stack|stack]] has not been altered when a function returns.  If it has been altered, the program exits with a [[segmentation fault]]. Three such systems are Libsafe,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://directory.fsf.org/libsafe.html |title=Libsafe at FSF.org |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> and the ''[[StackGuard]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec98/full_papers/cowan/cowan.pdf |title=StackGuard: Automatic Adaptive Detection and Prevention of Buffer-Overflow Attacks by Cowan et al. |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref> and ''[[ProPolice]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ProPolice |title=ProPolice at X.ORG |accessdate=2007-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212032750/http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ProPolice |archivedate=12 February 2007 }}</ref> [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]] patches.\n\nMicrosoft's implementation of [[Data Execution Prevention]] (DEP) mode explicitly protects the pointer to the [[Structured Exception Handler]] (SEH) from being overwritten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uninformed.org/?v=2&a=4&t=txt |title=Bypassing Windows Hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>\n\nStronger stack protection is possible by splitting the stack in two: one for data and one for function returns.  This split is present in the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth language]], though it was not a security-based design decision.  Regardless, this is not a complete solution to buffer overflows, as sensitive data other than the return address may still be overwritten.\n\n===Pointer protection===\n\nBuffer overflows work by manipulating pointers (including stored addresses).  PointGuard was proposed as a compiler-extension to prevent attackers from being able to reliably manipulate pointers and addresses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/sec03/tech/full_papers/cowan/cowan_html/index.html|title=12th USENIX Security Symposium \u2014 Technical Paper|author=|date=|website=www.usenix.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>  The approach works by having the compiler add code to automatically XOR-encode pointers before and after they are used.  Because the attacker (theoretically) does not know what value will be used to encode/decode the pointer, he cannot predict what it will point to if he overwrites it with a new value.  PointGuard was never released, but Microsoft implemented a similar approach beginning in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/01/30/520200.aspx|title=Protecting against Pointer Subterfuge (Kinda!)|author=|date=|website=msdn.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>  Rather than implement pointer protection as an automatic feature, Microsoft added an API routine that can be called at the discretion of the programmer.  This allows for better performance (because it is not used all of the time), but places the burden on the programmer to know when it is necessary.\n\nBecause XOR is linear, an attacker may be able to manipulate an encoded pointer by overwriting only the lower bytes of an address.  This can allow an attack to succeed if the attacker is able to attempt the exploit multiple times or is able to complete an attack by causing a pointer to point to one of several locations (such as any location within a NOP sled).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2005-06/pdfs/alexander0506.pdf|title=USENIX - The Advanced Computing Systems Association|author=|date=|website=www.usenix.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>  Microsoft added a random rotation to their encoding scheme to address this weakness to partial overwrites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/08/16/702707.aspx|title=Protecting against Pointer Subterfuge (Redux)|author=|date=|website=msdn.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Executable space protection===\n{{Main article|Executable space protection}}\n\nExecutable space protection is an approach to buffer overflow protection which prevents execution of code on the stack or the heap. An attacker may use buffer overflows to insert arbitrary code into the memory of a program, but with executable space protection, any attempt to execute that code will cause an exception.\n\nSome CPUs support a feature called [[NX bit|NX]] (\"No eXecute\") or [[XD bit|XD]] (\"eXecute Disabled\") bit, which in conjunction with software, can be used to mark [[paging|pages of data]] (such as those containing the stack and the heap) as readable and writable but not executable.\n\nSome Unix operating systems (e.g. [[OpenBSD]], [[macOS]]) ship with executable space protection (e.g. [[W^X]]). Some optional packages include:\n\n* [[PaX]]<ref>{{cite web |title=PaX: Homepage of the PaX team |url=http://pax.grsecurity.net |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>\n* [[Exec Shield]]<ref>{{cite web |title=KernelTrap.Org |url=http://kerneltrap.org/node/644 |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120529183334/http://kerneltrap.org/node/644 |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}</ref>\n* [[Openwall]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Openwall Linux kernel patch 2.4.34-ow1 |url=http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Kernels/Openwall-Linux-kernel-patch-16454.shtml |accessdate=2007-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111512/http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Kernels/Openwall-Linux-kernel-patch-16454.shtml |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\nNewer variants of Microsoft Windows also support executable space protection, called [[Data Execution Prevention]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Microsoft Technet: Data Execution Prevention |url=http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/en/Library/b0de1052-4101-44c3-a294-4da1bd1ef2271033.mspx?mfr=true }}</ref> [[proprietary software|Proprietary]] add-ons include:\n\n* BufferShield<ref>{{cite web |title=BufferShield: Prevention of Buffer Overflow Exploitation for Windows |url=http://www.sys-manage.com/english/products/products_BufferShield.html |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref>\n* StackDefender<ref>{{cite web |title=NGSec Stack Defender |url=http://www.ngsec.com/ngproducts/stackdefender/ |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070513235539/http://www.ngsec.com/ngproducts/stackdefender/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-13}}</ref>\n\nExecutable space protection does not generally protect against [[return-to-libc attack]]s, or any other attack which does not rely on the execution of the attackers code. However, on [[64-bit]] systems using [[ASLR]], as described below, executable space protection makes it far more difficult to execute such attacks.\n\n===Address space layout randomization===\n{{Main article|Address space layout randomization}}\n\nAddress space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security feature which involves arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the executable and position of libraries, heap, and stack, randomly in a process' address space.\n\nRandomization of the [[virtual memory]] addresses at which functions and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, but not impossible. It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of [[internet worm]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=PaX at GRSecurity.net |url=http://pax.grsecurity.net/docs/aslr.txt |accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> A similar but less effective method is to [[rebasing|rebase]] processes and libraries in the virtual address space.\n\n===Deep packet inspection===\n{{Main article|Deep packet inspection}}\n\nThe use of deep packet inspection (DPI) can detect, at the network perimeter, very basic remote attempts to exploit buffer overflows by use of attack signatures and [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]]. These are able to block packets which have the signature of a known attack, or if a long series of No-Operation instructions (known as a NOP-sled) is detected, these were once used when the location of the exploit's [[payload (software)|payload]] is slightly variable.\n\nPacket scanning is not an effective method since it can only prevent known attacks and there are many ways that a NOP-sled can be encoded. [[Shellcode]] used by attackers can be made [[alphanumeric code|alphanumeric]], [[metamorphic code|metamorphic]], or [[self-modifying code|self-modifying]] to evade detection by heuristic packet scanners and [[intrusion detection system]]s.\n\n=== Testing ===\nChecking for buffer overflows and patching the bugs that cause them naturally helps prevent buffer overflows.  One common automated technique for discovering them is [[fuzzer|fuzzing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raykoid666.wordpress.com|title=The Exploitant - Security info and tutorials|accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref>  Edge case testing can also uncover buffer overflows, as can static analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Larochelle|first=David|last2=Evans|first2=David|date=13 August 2001|title=Statically Detecting Likely Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities|url=https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec01/full_papers/larochelle/larochelle_html/|journal=USENIX Security Symposium|volume=32}}</ref>  Once a potential buffer overflow is detected, it must be patched; this makes the testing approach useful for software that is in development, but less useful for legacy software that is no longer maintained or supported.\n\n==History==\n\nBuffer overflows were understood and partially publicly documented as early as 1972, when the Computer Security Technology Planning Study laid out the technique: \"The code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user. This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine.\" (Page 61)<ref>{{cite web |title=Computer Security Technology Planning Study |url= http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/ande72.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-02}}</ref> Today, the monitor would be referred to as the kernel.\n\nThe earliest documented hostile exploitation of a buffer overflow was in 1988. It was one of several exploits  used by the [[Morris worm]] to propagate itself over the Internet. The program exploited was a [[service (computing)|service]] on [[Unix]] called [[Finger protocol|finger]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\"A Tour of The Worm\" by Donn Seeley, University of Utah |url=http://world.std.com/~franl/worm.html |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520233435/http://world.std.com/~franl/worm.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-20}}</ref> Later, in 1995, Thomas Lopatic independently rediscovered the buffer overflow and published his findings on the [[Bugtraq]] security mailing list.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bugtraq security mailing list archive |url=http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/1995_1/0403.html |accessdate=2007-06-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070901222723/http://www.security-express.com/archives/bugtraq/1995_1/0403.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-01}}</ref> A year later, in 1996, [[Elias Levy]] (also known as Aleph One) published in ''[[Phrack]]'' magazine the paper \"Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit\",<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit\" by Aleph One |url=http://www.phrack.com/issues.html?issue=49&id=14 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}</ref> a step-by-step introduction to exploiting stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.\n\nSince then, at least two major internet worms have exploited buffer overflows to compromise a large number of systems.

|Pentateuch}}\nThe '''Book of Numbers''' (from [[Biblical Greek|Greek]] \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03bf\u03af, ''Arithmoi''; {{lang-he-n|\u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05de\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8}}, '''B\u0259mi\u1e0fbar'''<!--It's B\u0259midbar (with a shewa), not Bamidbar (with a patach)-->, \"In the desert [of]\") is the fourth book of the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the fourth of five books of the Jewish [[Torah]].{{sfn|Ashley|1993|p=1}} The book has a long and complex history, but its final form is probably due to a [[Priestly source|Priestly]] redaction (i.e., editing) of a [[Yahwist]]ic source made some time in the early [[Yehud medinata|Persian period]] (5th century BCE).{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}  The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.\n\nNumbers begins at [[Mount Sinai]], where the [[Israelites]] have received their [[Covenant (biblical)|laws and covenant from God]] and God has taken up residence among them in the [[Tabernacle|sanctuary]].{{sfn|Olson|1996|p=9}} The task before them is to take possession of the [[Promised Land]]. The people are counted and preparations are made for resuming their march. The Israelites begin the journey, but they \"murmur\" at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]].  For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means.  They arrive at the borders of [[Canaan]] and send spies into the land. Upon hearing the spies' fearful report concerning the conditions in Canaan, the Israelites refuse to take possession of it. God condemns them to death in the wilderness until a new generation can grow up and carry out the task. The book ends with the new generation of Israelites in the [[Moab#Geography|Plain of Moab]] ready for the crossing of the [[Jordan River]].{{sfn|Stubbs|2009|p=19\u201320}}\n\nNumbers is the culmination of the story of [[The Exodus|Israel's exodus from oppression in Egypt]] and their [[Conquest of Canaan|journey to take possession of the land God promised their fathers]]. As such it draws to a conclusion the themes introduced in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and played out in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]]: God has promised the Israelites that they shall become a great (i.e. numerous) nation, that they will have a special relationship with [[Yahweh]] their god, and that they shall take possession of the land of [[Canaan]]. Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God's presence and [[Kohen|his priests]], Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation.{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}\n\n==Structure==\nMost commentators divide Numbers into three sections based on locale ([[Mount Sinai]], [[Kadesh-Barnea]] and the plains of Moab), linked by two travel sections;{{sfn|Ashley|1993|p=2-3}} an alternative is to see it as structured around the two generations of those condemned to die in the wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.{{sfn|Knierim|1995|p=381}}\n\n==Summary==\n[[File:Figures.jpg|thumb|[[Priest]], [[Levite]], and furnishings of the [[Tabernacle]]]]\nGod orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to number those able to bear arms\u2014of all the men \"from twenty years old and upward,\" and to appoint princes over each tribe. A total of 603,550 Israelites are found to be fit for military service. The [[Levite|tribe of Levi]] is exempted from military service and therefore not included in the census.  Moses consecrates the Levites for the service of the Tabernacle in the place of the first-born sons, who hitherto had performed that service. The Levites are divided into three families, the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites, each under a chief. The Kohathites were headed by [[Eleazar]], son of [[Aaron]], while the Gershonites and Merarites were headed by Aaron's other son, Ithamar. Preparations are then made for resuming the march to the [[Promised Land]]. Various ordinances and laws are decreed.\n\nThe Israelites set out from Sinai. The people murmur against God and are punished by fire; Moses complains of their stubbornness and is ordered to choose seventy elders to assist him in the government of the people. [[Miriam]] and Aaron insult Moses at Hazeroth, which angers God; Miriam is punished with [[leprosy]] and is shut out of camp for seven days, at the end of which the Israelites proceed to the [[desert of Paran]] on the border of Canaan. [[The Twelve Spies|Twelve spies]] are sent out into Canaan and come back to report to Moses. [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], two of the spies, report that the land is abundant and is \"flowing with milk and honey\", but the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and the Israelites refuse to enter the land.  Yahweh decrees that the Israelites will be punished for their loss of [[faith]] by having to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nMoses is ordered by God to make plates to cover the altar.  The children of Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron on account of the destruction of [[Korah#Korah.2C son of Izhar.2C leader of a rebellion against Moses|Korah]]'s men and are stricken with the plague, with 14,700 perishing. Aaron and his family are declared by God to be responsible for any iniquity committed in connection with the sanctuary. The Levites are again appointed to help in the keeping of the Tabernacle. The Levites are ordered to surrender to the priests a part of the tithes taken to them.\n\nMiriam dies at Kadesh Barnea and the Israelites set out for Moab, on Canaan's eastern border. The Israelites blame Moses for the lack of water. Moses is ordered by God to speak to a rock but initially disobeys, and is punished by the announcement that he shall not enter Canaan. The king of Edom refuses permission to pass through his land and they go around it. Aaron dies on Mount Hor. The Israelites are bitten by [[Fiery flying serpent]]s for speaking against God and Moses. A [[Nehushtan|brazen serpent]] is made to ward off these serpents.\n\nThe Israelites arrive on the plains of Moab. A new census gives the total number of males from twenty years and upward as 601,730, and the number of the Levites from the age of one month and upward as 23,000. The land shall be divided by lot. The daughters of [[Zelophehad]], their father having no sons, are to share in the allotment. Moses is ordered to appoint [[Joshua]] as his successor. Prescriptions for the observance of the feasts and the offerings for different occasions are enumerated. Moses orders the Israelites to massacre the people of [[Midian]]. The Reubenites and the Gadites request Moses to assign them the land east of the Jordan. Moses grants their request after they promise to help in the conquest of the land west of the Jordan. The land [[Transjordan (Bible)|east of the Jordan]] is divided among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Moses recalls the stations at which the Israelites halted during their forty years' wanderings and instructs the Israelites to exterminate the Canaanites and destroy their idols. The boundaries of the land are spelled out; the land is to be divided under the supervision of [[Eleazar]], Joshua, and twelve princes, one of each tribe.\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 30r 2.png|thumb|[[Balaam]] and the Angel (illustration from the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'')]]\n\nThe majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the [[Torah]] (the books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], Numbers, and [[Deuteronomy]]) reached its present form in the [[Second Temple Judaism|post-Exilic period]] (i.e., after c.520 BCE), based on pre-existing written and oral traditions and \"contemporary geographical and demographic details but even more importantly from contemporary political realities\".{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}}<ref>Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, p.68-69</ref> The five books are often described as being drawn from four \"sources\" - schools of writers rather than individuals - the [[Yahwist]] and the [[Elohist]] (frequently treated as a single source), the [[Priestly source]] and the [[Deuteronomist]].{{sfn|Coogan|Brettler|Newsom|2007|p=6}} There is ongoing dispute over the origins of the non-Priestly source(s), but it is generally agreed that the Priestly source is post-exilic.{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}} \n*[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is made up of Priestly and non-Priestly material.{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}\n*[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] is an anthology drawn from nearly all periods of Israel's history.{{sfn|Dozeman|2000|p=443}}\n*[[Leviticus]] is entirely Priestly and dates from the exilic/post-exilic period.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=102}}\n*Numbers is a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a non-Priestly original.{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}\n*[[Deuteronomy]], now the last book of the Torah, began as the set of religious laws (these make up the bulk of the book), was extended in the early part of the 6th century BCE to serve as the introduction to the [[Deuteronomistic history]] (the books from Joshua to Kings), and later still was detached from that history, extended and edited again, and attached to the Torah.{{sfn|Van Seters|2004|p=93}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Figures A Plague Inflicted on Israel While Eating the Quails.jpg|thumb|A Plague Inflicted on Israel While Eating the Quail (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\n\nDavid A. Clines, in his influential ''The Themes of the Pentateuch'' (1978), identified the overarching [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the five books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by God to the patriarchs, [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]]. The promise has three elements: posterity (i.e., descendants&nbsp;\u2013 Abraham is told that his descendants will be as innumerable as the stars), divine-human relationship (Israel is to be God's chosen people), and land (the land of Canaan, cursed by Noah immediately after the Deluge).{{sfn|Clines|1997|p=29}}\n\nThe theme of the divine-human relationship is expressed, or managed, through a series of [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]]s (meaning treaties, legally binding agreements) stretching from Genesis to Deuteronomy and beyond. The first is the covenant between God and Noah immediately after the Deluge in which God agrees never again to destroy the Earth with water. The next is between God and Abraham, and the third between God and all Israel at Mount Sinai. In this third covenant, unlike the first two, God hands down an elaborate set of laws (scattered through Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers), which the Israelites are to observe; they are also to remain faithful to Yahweh, the god of Israel, meaning, among other things, that they must put their trust in his help.{{sfn|Bandstra|2004|p=28-29}}\n\nThe theme of descendants marks the first event in Numbers, the census of Israel's fighting men: the huge number which results (over 600,000) demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham of innumerable descendants, as well as serving as God's guarantee of victory in Canaan.{{sfn|Olson|1996|p=14}} As chapters 1\u201310 progress, the theme of God's presence with Israel comes to the fore: these chapters describe how Israel is to be organised around the Sanctuary, God's dwelling-place in their midst, under the charge of the Levites and priests, in preparation for the conquest of the land.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=38}}\n\nThe Israelites then set out to conquer the land, but almost immediately they refuse to enter it, and Yahweh condemns the whole generation who left Egypt to die in the wilderness. The message is clear: failure was not due to any fault in the preparation, because Yahweh had foreseen everything, but to Israel's sin of unfaithfulness. In the final section, the Israelites of the new generation follow Yahweh's instructions as given through Moses and are successful in all they attempt.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=38}} The last five chapters are exclusively concerned with land: instructions for the extermination of the Canaanites, the demarcation of the boundaries of the land, how the land is to be divided, holy cities for the Levites and \"cities of refuge\", the problem of pollution of the land by blood, and regulations for inheritance when a male heir is lacking.{{sfn|Clines|1997|p=62}}\n\n==Weekly Torah portions==\n{{main|Weekly

In the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, it covers the time between the conquest described in the [[Book of Joshua]] and the establishment of a kingdom in the [[Books of Samuel]], during which [[Biblical judges]] served as temporary leaders.{{sfn|Niditch|pp=2\u20133}} The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to [[Yahweh]] and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"judge\"; see ''[[shophet]]''); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated.{{sfn|Soggin|p=4}} Scholars consider many of the stories in ''Judges'' to be the oldest in the [[Deuteronomistic history]], with their major redaction dated to the 8th century BCE and with materials such as the [[Deborah#The Song of Deborah|Song of Deborah]] dating from much earlier.{{sfn|Bacon|pp=563\u201366}}{{sfn|Alter|p=105}}\n\n== Contents ==\n''Judges'' can be divided into three major sections: a double prologue (chapters 1:1\u20133:6), a main body (3:7\u201316:31), and a double epilogue (17\u201321).{{sfn|Guest|p=190}}\n\n=== Prologue ===\nThe book opens with the Israelites in the land that God has promised to them, but worshiping \"foreign gods\" instead of [[Yahweh]], the God of Israel, and with the [[Canaanites]] still present everywhere.{{sfn|Spieckermann|p=341}} Chapters 1:1\u20132:5 are thus a confession of failure, while chapters 2:6\u20133:6 are a major summary and reflection from the Deuteronomists.{{sfn|McKenzie|p=14}}\n\nThe opening thus sets out the pattern which the stories in the main text will follow:{{sfn|Guest|p=190}}\n# Israel \"does evil in the eyes of Yahweh\",\n# the people are given into the hands of their enemies and cry out to Yahweh,\n# Yahweh raises up a leader,\n# the \"spirit of Yahweh\" comes upon the leader,\n# the leader manages to defeat the enemy, and\n# peace is regained.\n\nOnce peace is regained, for a time Israel does right and receives Yahweh's blessings, only to relapse later into doing evil and repeating the pattern set forth above.\n\n''Judges'' follows on from the [[Book of Joshua]] and opens with reference to [[Joshua]]'s death ({{bibleverse||Joshua|24:29|HE}}; cf. {{bibleverse||Judges|1:1|HE}}). The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] suggests that \"the death of Joshua may be regarded as marking the division between the period of conquest and the period of occupation\", the latter being the focus of the Book of Judges.<ref name = biblehub>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/judges/1.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Judges 1, accessed 9 October 2016</ref> The Israelites meet, most likely at the sanctuary at [[Gilgal]] or at [[Shechem]] (following on from {{bibleverse||Joshua|24:1\u201333|HE}}) and ask the Lord who should be first (in order of time, not of rank) to secure the land they are to occupy.<ref name = biblehub/>\n\n=== Main text ===\n[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|235px|Map of the tribes of Israel.]]\nThe main text ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|3:11\u201316:31|HE}}) gives accounts of six '''major judges''' and their struggles against the oppressive kings of surrounding nations, as well as the story of Abimelech, an Israelite leader (a judge [shofet] in the sense of \"chieftain\") who oppresses his own people.  The cyclical pattern set out in the prologue is readily apparent at the beginning, but as the stories progress it begins to disintegrate, mirroring the disintegration of the world of the Israelites.{{sfn|Guest|p=190}} Although some scholars consider the stories not to be presented in chronological order,{{sfn|Amit|p=508}} the judges [[Fabula and syuzhet|in the order in which they appear in the text]] are:\n* [[Othniel]] (3:9\u201311) vs. [[Chushan-Rishathaim]], King of [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]]; Israel has 40 years peace until the death of Othniel. (The statement that Israel has a certain period of peace after each judge is a recurrent theme.)\n* [[Ehud]] (3:11\u201329) vs. [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]] of [[Moab]]\n* [[Deborah]] the prophetess, accompanied by [[Barak]] the army leader (4\u20135), vs. [[Jabin]] of [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] (a city in [[Canaan]]) and [[Sisera]], his captain\n* [[Gideon]] (6\u20138) vs. [[Midian]], [[Amalek]], and the \"children of the East\" (apparently desert tribes)\n* [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] (9) (who is traditionally counted as a king not a judge, and is considered evil) vs. all the Israelites who oppose him\n* [[Jephthah]] (11\u201312:7) vs. the [[Ammon]]ites\n* [[Samson]] (13\u201316) vs. the [[Philistines]]\n\nThere are also brief glosses on six '''minor judges''': [[Shamgar]] (3:31), [[Tola (biblical figure)|Tola]] and [[Jair]] (10:1\u20135), [[Ibzan]], [[Elon (Judges)|Elon]], and [[Abdon (Judges)|Abdon]] (12:8\u201315).{{sfn|Bacon|pp=563\u201365}} Some scholars have inferred that the minor judges were actual adjudicators, whereas the major judges were leaders and did not actually make legal judgements.{{sfn|Bacon|p=564}} The only major judge described as making legal judgments is Deborah (4:4).{{sfn|Bacon|p=561}}\n\n=== Epilogue ===\nBy the end of Judges, the Israelites are in a worse condition than they were at the beginning, with Yahweh's treasures used to make idolatrous images, the Levites (priests) corrupted, the [[tribe of Dan]] conquering a remote village instead of the Canaanite cities, and the [[tribes of Israel]] making war on the [[tribe of Benjamin]], their own brothers.{{sfn|Guest|pp=202\u201304}} The book concludes with two appendices ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|17\u201321|HE}}), stories which do not feature a specific judge:{{sfn|Soggin|p=5}}\n* [[Micah's Idol]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|17\u201318|HE}}), how the tribe of Dan conquers its territory in the north\n* [[Battle of Gibeah]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Judges|19\u201321|HE}}), a war between Benjamin and the other tribes.\nDespite their appearance at the end of the book, certain characters (like [[Jonathan (Judges)|Jonathan]], the grandson of [[Moses]]) and idioms present in the epilogue show that the events therein \"must have taken place ... early in the period of the judges.\"{{sfn|Davis|pp=328\u201361}}\n\n=== Chronology ===\nJudges contains a chronology of its events. It is overtly schematic and, according to biblical scholar Jeremy Hughes, shows signs of having been introduced at a later period.{{sfn|Hughes|pp=70\u201377}}\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Maarten van Heemskerck 024.jpg|thumb|\"Gideon thanks God for the miracle of the dew\", painting by [[Maarten van Heemskerck]] ([[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg]])]]\n\nIt is unclear if any of the people named as judges existed.<ref name=\"Thompson2000\">{{cite book|author=Thomas L.

More recently, this view has been challenged, and there is an increasing willingness to see Judges as the work of a single individual, working by carefully selecting, reworking and positioning his source material to introduce and conclude his themes.{{sfn|Guest|pp=201\u201302}}\n\n=== The Deuteronomistic history ===\nA statement repeated throughout the book, \"In those days there was no king in Israel\" ({{bibleverse||Judges|17:6|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|18:1|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|19:1|HE}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|21:25|HE}}) implies a date in the monarchy for the redaction (editing) of Judges.{{sfn|Malamat|p=132}} Twice this statement is accompanied with the statement that \"every man did that which was right in his own eyes\", implying that the redactor is pro-monarchy, ({{bibleverse||Judges|17:6|HE}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|21:25|HE}}) and the epilogue, in which the [[tribe of Judah]] is assigned a leadership role, implies that this redaction took place in Judah.{{sfn|Davis|p=328}}\n\nSince the second half of the 20th century most scholars have agreed with [[Martin Noth]]'s thesis that the books of [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], Judges, [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] form parts of a single work.{{sfn|Knoppers|2000a|p=1}} Noth maintained that the history was written in the early [[Babylonian captivity|Exilic period]] (6th century BCE) in order to demonstrate how Israel's history was worked out in accordance with the theology expressed in the book of Deuteronomy (which thus provides the name \"Deuteronomistic\").{{sfn|Walton|pp=169\u201370}} Noth believed that this history was the work of a single author, living in the mid-6th century BCE, selecting, editing and composing from his sources to produce a coherent work.{{sfn|Knoppers|2000b|p=119}} Frank Moore Cross later proposed that an early version of the history was composed in Jerusalem in [[Josiah]]'s time (late 7th century BCE); this first version, Dtr1, was then revised and expanded to create a second edition, that identified by Noth, and which Cross labelled Dtr2.{{sfn|Eynikel|p=14}}\n\nScholars agree that the Deuteronomists' hand can be seen in ''Judges'' through the book's cyclical nature: the Israelites fall into idolatry, God punishes them for their sins with oppression by foreign peoples, the Israelites cry out to God for help, and God sends a judge to deliver them from the foreign oppression. After a period of peace, the cycle recurs. Scholars also suggest that the Deuteronomists also included the humorous and sometimes disparaging commentary found in the book such as the story of the [[tribe of Ephraim]] who could not pronounce the word \"''[[shibboleth]]''\" correctly (12:5\u20136).{{sfn|Bacon|p=562}}\n\n== Themes and genre ==\n[[File:Judges Bib Germ 1485 d.1 375.jpg|thumbnail|right|Illustrated page from the Book of Judges in a German bible dated 1485 (Bodleian Library)]]\nThe essence of Deuteronomistic theology is that Israel has entered into a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] (a treaty, a binding agreement) with the God Yahweh, under which they agree to accept Yahweh as their god (hence the phrase \"God of Israel\") and Yahweh promises them a land where they can live in peace and prosperity. Deuteronomy contains the laws by which Israel is to live in the promised land, Joshua chronicles the conquest of [[Canaan]], the promised land, and its allotment among the tribes, Judges describes the settlement of the land, Samuel the consolidation of the land and people under [[David]], and Kings the destruction of kingship and loss of the land.{{sfn|Knight|p=61}} The final tragedy described in Kings is the result of Israel's failure to uphold its part of the covenant: faithfulness to Yahweh brings success, economic, military and political, but unfaithfulness brings defeat and oppression.{{sfn|Niditch|p=11}}\n\nThis is the theme played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.{{sfn|Soggin|p=4}}\n\nFurther themes are also present: the \"sovereign freedom of Yahweh\" (God does not always do what is expected of him); the \"[[satire|satirisation]] of foreign kings\" (who consistently underestimate Israel and Yahweh); the concept of the \"flawed agent\" (judges who are not adequate to the task before them) and the disunity of the Israelite community (which gathers pace as the stories succeed one another).{{sfn|Guest|pp=193\u201394}}\n\nThe book is as intriguing for the themes it leaves out as for what it includes: the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which is given so much importance in the stories of [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]], is almost entirely missing,<ref>The ark of the covenant is mentioned in passing in {{bibleverse||Judges|20:27|HE}}</ref> cooperation between the various tribes is limited, and there is no mention of a central shrine for worship and only limited reference to a [[High Priest of Israel]] (the office to which [[Aaron]] was appointed at the end of [[the Exodus]] story).<ref>[[Phinehas]] the son of [[Eleazar]], the son of Aaron is mentioned in passing in {{bibleverse||Judges|20:28|HE}}</ref>{{sfn|Matthews|p=4}}\n\nAlthough ''Judges'' probably had a monarchist redaction (see above), the book contains passages and themes that represent anti-monarchist views.  One of the major themes of the book is Yahweh's sovereignty and the importance of being loyal to Him and His laws above all other gods and sovereigns.  Indeed, the authority of the judges comes not through prominent dynasties nor through elections or appointments, but rather through the spirit of God.{{sfn|Alter|p=106}} Anti-monarchist theology is most apparent toward the end of the Gideon cycle in which the Israelites beg Gideon to create a dynastic monarchy over them and Gideon refuses.{{sfn|Davis|p=326\u201327}} The rest of Gideon's lifetime saw peace in the land, but after Gideon's death, his son Abimelech ruled [[Shechem]] as a [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] tyrant guilty for much bloodshed (see chapters 8 and 9).  However, the last few chapters of ''Judges'' (specifically, the stories of Samson, Micah, and Gibeah) highlight the violence and [[anarchy]] of decentralized rule.{{sfn|Alter|pp=107\u201309}}\n\n''Judges'' is remarkable for the number of female characters who \"play significant roles, active and passive, in the narratives.\"{{sfn|Bacon|p=561}} Rabbi [[Joseph Telushkin]] wrote,\n{{quote|Most of the great women in the Bible either are married to a great man or related to one.  ... A rare exception to this tradition is the prophetess and judge Deborah, perhaps the Bible's greatest woman figure.  Deborah stands exclusively on her own merits.

For purposes of chapter and verse numbering, the book is treated as divided into two parts: 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel.}} '''1 Samuel''' and '''2 Samuel''', form part of the narrative history of [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] in the [[Nevi'im]] or \"prophets\" section of the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]], called the [[Deuteronomistic history]], a series of books ([[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], Samuel and [[Books of Kings|Kings]]) that constitute a theological history of the [[Israelites]] and aim to explain [[Torah|God's law for Israel]] under the guidance of the prophets.{{sfn|Gordon|1986|p=18}} According to Jewish tradition, the book was written by [[Samuel]], with additions by the prophets [[Gad (prophet)|Gad]] and [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|29:29|9}}</ref> Modern scholarly thinking is that the entire Deuteronomistic history was composed in the period c. 630\u2013540&nbsp;BC by combining a number of independent texts of various ages.{{sfn|Knight|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=197}}\n\nSamuel begins with the prophet [[Samuel]]'s birth<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|1:1-20|NKJV}}</ref> and [[Yahweh|God]]'s call to him as a boy. The story of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] that follows tells of Israel's oppression by the [[Philistines]], which brought about Samuel's anointing of [[Saul]] as Israel's first king. But Saul proved unworthy and God's choice turned to [[David]], who defeated Israel's enemies and brought the Ark to Jerusalem. God then promised David and his successors an everlasting dynasty.{{sfn|Spieckerman|2001|p=348}}\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Ernst Josephson. - David och Saul.JPG|thumb|[[Ernst Josephson]], ''David and Saul'', 1878.]]\n\nThe childless [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] vows to [[Yahweh|Yahweh of hosts]] that if she has a son, he will be dedicated to him. [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]], the priest of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] (where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] is located), blesses her, and a child named [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] is born. Samuel is dedicated to the Lord as a [[Nazirite]] \u2013 the only one beside [[Samson]] to be identified in the Bible. Eli's sons, [[Hophni and Phinehas]], prove unworthy of the priesthood and are killed in battle during the [[Battle of Aphek]], but the child Samuel grows up \"in the presence of the Lord.\"\n\nThe [[Philistines]] [[Philistine captivity of the Ark|capture the Ark of the Covenant]] from Shiloh and take it to the temple of their god [[Dagon]], who recognises the supremacy of Yahweh. The Philistines are afflicted with plagues and return the ark to the Israelites, but to the territory of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] rather than to Shiloh. The Philistines attack the Israelites gathered at [[Mizpah in Gilead (Judges)|Mizpah]] in Benjamin. Samuel appeals to Yahweh, the Philistines are decisively beaten, and the Israelites reclaim their lost territory.\n\nIn Samuel's old age, he appoints his sons [[Joel (son of Samuel)|Joel]] and [[Abijah]] as judges, but they are unworthy, and so the people clamour for a king. God directs Samuel to grant them a king despite his concerns, and gives them [[Saul]] of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul defeats the enemies of the Israelites, but sins against Yahweh.\n\nYahweh tells Samuel to anoint [[David]] of [[Bethlehem]] as king, and David enters Saul's court as his [[Squire|armour-bearer]] and [[harp]]ist. Saul's son and heir [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] befriends David and recognises him as rightful king. Saul plots David's death, but David flees into the wilderness, where he becomes a champion of the Hebrews. David joins the Philistines, but continues secretly to champion his own people, until Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle at [[Mount Gilboa]]. At this point, David offers a majestic eulogy, where he praises the bravery and magnificence of both his friend Jonathan and King Saul.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|1:17\u201327|9}}</ref>\n\nThe elders of Judah anoint David as king, but in the north Saul's son [[Ish-bosheth]], or Ishbaal, rules over the northern tribes. After a long war, Ishbaal is murdered by [[Rechab]] and [[Baanah]], two of his captains who hope for a reward from David; but David has them killed for killing God's anointed. David is then anointed King of all Israel. David captures Jerusalem and brings the Ark there. David wishes to build a temple, but [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] tells him that one of his sons will be the one to build the temple. David defeats the enemies of Israel, slaughtering Philistines, [[Moab]]ites, [[Edom]]ites, Syrians and [[Arameans]].\n\nDavid commits adultery and has sex with [[Bathsheba]] and plots the death of her husband, [[Uriah the Hittite]]; for this [[Yahweh]] sends disasters against his house. Nathan tells David that the sword shall never depart from his house. For the remainder of his reign there are problems. [[Amnon]] (one of David's sons) rapes his half-sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]] (one of David's daughters). [[Absalom]] (another son of David) kills Amnon, rebels against his father, and David flees from Jerusalem. Absalom is killed following the [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim]], David is restored as king, and he returns to his palace. Finally only two contenders for the succession remain, [[Adonijah]] and Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]].\n\nThe Second Book of Samuel concludes with four chapters (chapters 21 to 24) which lie outside the chronological narrative of Saul and David. The narrative is resumed with the [[first Book of Kings]], which relates how, as David lies dying, Bathsheba and Nathan ensure Solomon's elevation to the throne.\n\nThe four supplementary<ref>Sub-heading in [[Jerusalem Bible]]</ref> chapters cover a great famine during David's reign,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:1|NKJV}}</ref> the execution of seven of Saul's remaining descendants, only [[Mephibosheth]] being saved,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|21:2-9|NKJV}}</ref> David's [[2 Samuel 22|song of thanksgiving]],<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|22:1-51|NKJV}}</ref> which is almost identical to [[Psalm 18]], his last words,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:1-7|NKJV}}</ref> a list of David's \"[[David's Mighty Warriors|mighty warriors]]\",<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:8-39|NKJV}}</ref> an offering made by David using water from the well of Bethlehem,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|23:13-17|NKJV}}</ref> David's sinful [[Census#Ancient Israel|census]],<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:1-9|NKJV}}</ref> a plague over Israel which David opted for as preferable to either famine or oppression,<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:10-17|NKJV}}</ref> and the construction of an altar on land he purchased from [[Araunah the Jebusite]].<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|24:18-25|NKJV}}</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:David and Bathsheba by Artemisia Gentileschi.jpg|thumb|''David and Bathsheba'', by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]].

Critical scholars from the 19th century onward have rejected this idea. [[Martin Noth]] in 1943 theorized that Samuel was composed by a single author as part of a history of Israel: the [[Deuteronomistic history]] (made up of [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], Samuel and [[Books of Kings|Kings]]).{{sfn|Klein|2003|p=316}} Although Noth's belief that the entire history was composed by a single individual has been largely abandoned, his theory in its broad outline has been adopted by most scholars.{{sfn|Tsumura|2007|pp=15\u201319}}\n\nThe most common view today is that an early version of the history was composed in the time of king [[Hezekiah]] (8th century BC); the bulk of the first edition dates from his grandson [[Josiah]] at the end of the 7th BC, with further sections added during the [[Babylonian exile]] (6th century BC) and the work was substantially complete by about 550 BC.{{sfn|Walton|2009|pp=41\u201342}} Further editing was apparently done even after then:  for example, the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the Persian or [[Hellenistic period]]s.{{sfn|Auld|2003|p=219}}\n\nThe 6th century BC authors and editors responsible for the bulk of the history drew on many earlier sources, including (but not limited to) an \"ark narrative\" (1 Samuel 4:1\u20137:1 and perhaps part of 2 Samuel 6), a \"Saul cycle\" (parts of 1 Samuel 9\u201311 and 13\u201314), the \"history of David's rise\" (1 Samuel 16:14-2 Samuel 5:10), and the \"succession narrative\" (2 Samuel 9\u201320 and 1 Kings 1\u20132).{{sfn|Knight|1991|p=853}} The oldest of these, the \"ark narrative,\" may even predate the Davidic era.{{sfn|Tsumura|2007|p=11}}\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe sources used to construct 1 and 2 Samuel are believed to include the following:<ref>Jones, pp. 197\u201399</ref>\n*''Call of Samuel'' or ''Youth of Samuel'' (1 Samuel 1\u20137): From Samuel's birth his career as Judge and prophet over Israel.

This source first describes Samuel as decisively ridding the people of the Philistines, and begrudgingly appointing an individual chosen by God to be king, namely Saul. David is described as someone renowned for his skill at playing the harp, and consequently summoned to Saul's court to calm his moods. Saul's son Jonathan becomes friends with David, which [[David and Jonathan|some commentators view as romantic]], and later acts as his protector against Saul's more violent intentions. At a later point, having been deserted by God on the eve of battle, Saul consults a [[Mediumship|medium]] at [[Witch of Endor|Endor]], only to be condemned for doing so by Samuel's ghost, and told he and his sons will be killed. David is heartbroken on discovering the death of Jonathan, tearing his clothes as a gesture of grief.\n*''Monarchial source'': a source with a pro-monarchial bias and covering many of the same details as the ''republican source''. This source begins with the divinely appointed birth of Samuel. It then describes Saul as leading a war against the Ammonites, being chosen by the people to be king, and leading them against the Philistines. David is described as a shepherd boy arriving at the battlefield to aid his brothers, and is overheard by Saul, leading to David challenging [[Goliath]] and defeating the Philistines. David's warrior credentials lead to women falling in love with him, including [[Michal]], Saul's daughter, who later acts to protect David against Saul. David eventually gains two new wives as a result of threatening to raid a village, and Michal is redistributed to another husband. At a later point, David finds himself seeking sanctuary amongst the Philistine army and facing the Israelites as an enemy. David is incensed that anyone should have killed Saul, even as an act of mercy, since Saul was anointed by Samuel, and has the individual responsible, an [[Amalekite]], killed.\n*''[[Court History of David]]'' or ''Succession narrative'' (2 Samuel 9\u201320 and 1 Kings 1\u20132): a \"[[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]]\", in [[Alberto Soggin]]'s phrase, telling the story of David's reign from his affair with [[Bathsheba]] to his death. The theme is of retribution: David's sin against [[Uriah the Hittite]] is punished by God through the destruction of his own family,{{sfn|Soggin|1987|pp=216\u201317}} and its purpose is to serve as an apology for the coronation of Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]] instead of his older brother [[Adonijah]].{{sfn|Klein|2003|p=316}} Some textual critics have posited that given the intimacy and precision of certain narrative details, the Court Historian may have been an eyewitness to some of the events he describes, or at the very least enjoyed access to the archives and battle reports of the royal house of David.<ref name=Kirsch>{{cite book|last=Kirsch|first=Jonathan|title=King David: The Real Life of the Man Who Ruled Israel|year=2009|publisher=Random House LLC|isbn=9780307567819|pages=307\u201309}}</ref> \n*''Redactions'': additions by the redactor to harmonize the sources together; many of the uncertain passages may be part of this editing.\n*''Various'': several short sources, none of which have much connection to each other, and are fairly independent of the rest of the text. Many are poems or pure lists.\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Hannah VICTORS, Jan.jpg|thumb|[[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]] presenting [[Samuel (Biblical figure)|Samuel]] to [[Eli (Bible)|Eli]], by [[Jan Victors]], 1645.]]\n\nThe Book of Samuel is a theological evaluation of kingship in general and of dynastic kingship and [[David]] in particular.{{sfn|Klein|2003|p=312}} The main themes of the book are introduced in the opening poem (the \"[[Song of Hannah]]\"): (1), the sovereignty of [[Yahweh]], God of Israel; (2), the reversal of human fortunes; and (3), kingship.{{sfn|Tsumura|2007|p=68}} These themes are played out in the stories of the three main characters, [[Samuel]], [[Saul]] and [[David]].\n\n=== Samuel ===\n{{main|Samuel}}\nSamuel answers the description of the \"prophet like Moses\" predicted in Deuteronomy 18:15\u201322: like Moses, he has direct contact with [[Yahweh]], acts as a judge, and is a perfect leader who never makes mistakes.{{sfn|Beytenbrach|2000|pp=53\u201355}} Samuel's successful defence of the Israelites against their enemies demonstrates that they have no need for a king (who will, moreover, introduce inequality), yet despite this the people demand a king. But the king they are given is Yahweh's gift, and Samuel explains that kingship can be a blessing rather than a curse if they remain faithful to their God. On the other hand, total destruction of both king and people will result if they turn to wickedness.{{sfn|Klein|2003|p=316}}\n\n=== Saul ===\n{{main|Saul}}\nSaul is the chosen one, tall, handsome and \"goodly\",<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|9:2|KJV}}: King James Version</ref> a king appointed by Yahweh, and anointed by Samuel, Yahweh's prophet, and yet he is ultimately rejected.{{sfn|Hertzberg|1964|p=19}} Saul has two faults which make him unfit for the office of king: he carries out a sacrifice in place of Samuel (1 Samuel 13:8\u201314), and he fails to complete the genocide of the [[Amalekites]] as God has ordered (1 Samuel 15).{{sfn|Klein|2003|p=319}}\n\n=== David ===\n{{main|David}}\nOne of the main units within Samuel is the \"History of David's Rise\", the purpose of which is to justify David as the legitimate successor to Saul.{{sfn|Dick|2004|pp=3\u20134}} The narrative stresses that he gained the throne lawfully, always respecting \"the Lord's anointed\" (i.e. Saul) and never taking any of his numerous chances to seize the throne by violence.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=198}} As God's chosen king over Israel, David is also the son of God (\"I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me...\" \u2013 2 Samuel 7:14).{{sfn|Coogan|2009|pp=216, 229\u201333}} God enters into an eternal covenant (treaty) with David and his line, promising divine protection of the dynasty and of Jerusalem through all time.{{sfn|Coogan|2009|p=425}}\n\n2 Samuel 23 contains a prophetic statement described as the \"last words of [[David]]\" (verses 1-7) and details of the 37 \"[[David's mighty men|mighty men]]\" who were David's chief warriors (verses 8-38). The [[Jerusalem Bible]] states that last words were attributed to David in the style of [[Jacob]] (see [[Jacob's Blessing]], Genesis 49) and [[Moses]] (see [[Blessing of Moses]], Deuteronomy 33). Its editors note that \"the text has suffered considerably and reconstructions are conjectural\".<ref>Jerusalem Bible, footnote at 2 Samuel 23:1</ref>\n\n{{bibleverse|1|Kings|2:1-9|NKJV}} contains David's final words to [[Solomon]], his son and successor as [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|king]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Biblical judges]]\n* [[Midrash Shmuel (aggadah)]]\n* [[The Bible and history]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]]\n* [[Kingdom of Judah]]\n\n== Notes == \n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Translations of 1 and 2 Samuel ===\n*[http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=samuel&qs_version=31 Samuel 1 and 2 at Bible Gateway]\n\n=== Commentaries on Samuel ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15830/showrashi/true Shmuel I \u2013 Samuel I (Judaica Press)] translation [with [[Rashi]]'s commentary] at Chabad.org\n* [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15861/showrashi/true Shmuel II \u2013 Samuel II (Judaica Press)] translation [with [[Rashi]]'s commentary] at Chabad.org\n*{{Cite book|last=Auld|first=Graeme|chapter=1 & 2 Samuel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=There+are+two+common+types+of+strategy+for+reading+the+books+of+Samuel#v=onepage&q=There%20are%20two%20common%20types%20of%20strategy%20for%20reading%20the%20books%20of%20Samuel&f=false|editor=James D.

It occupies a central place in [[Christian eschatology]]. Its title is derived from the [[Incipit|first word]] of the text, written in [[Koine Greek]]: ''apokalypsis'', meaning \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\" (before title pages and titles, books were commonly known by their first words, as is also the case of the Hebrew [[Five Books of Moses]] ([[Torah]])). The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament [[Biblical canon|canon]] (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in [[the Gospels]] and the [[Epistles]]).{{Efn | Other apocalypses popular in the [[early Christian]] era did not achieve canonical status, except [[2 Esdras]] (also known as the Apocalypse of Ezra), which is recognized as canonical in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Churches.}}\n\nThe author names himself in the text as \"John\", but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second-century Christian writers such as [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Melito]] the bishop of Sardis, and [[Clement of Alexandria]] and the author of the [[Muratorian fragment]] identify [[John the Apostle]] as the \"John\" of Revelation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Don|title=An Introduction to the New Testament|date=2005|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|isbn=0-310-51940-3|pages=465ff|edition=2nd}}</ref> Modern scholarship generally takes a different view,{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=28}} and many consider that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet.{{sfn|Bauckham|1992|p=2}}{{citation not found}} Some modern scholars characterise Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call \"[[John of Patmos]]\". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396), and the evidence tends to confirm this.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp=1535\u20131536}}\n\nThe book spans three literary genres: the [[letter (message)|epistolary]], the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]], and the [[prophetic]].{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1536}} It begins with John, on the island of [[Patmos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], addressing a letter to the \"[[seven churches of Asia|Seven Churches of Asia]]\". He then describes a series of prophetic [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], including figures such as the Seven Headed Dragon, [[Serpents in the Bible#Ancient serpent|The Serpent]] and [[The Beast (Revelation)|the Beast]], culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nThe obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations: [[Historicism (Christianity)|historicist]] interpretations see in Revelation a broad view of history; [[preterist]] interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic era (1st century)]], or, at the latest, the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]; [[Futurism (Christianity)|futurists]] believe that Revelation describes future events; and [[Idealism (Christian eschatology)|idealist or symbolic]] interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an [[allegory]] of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\n\n== Composition and setting ==\n[[File:Johannes op Patmos Saint John on Patmos Berlin, Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin, Gemaldegalerie HR.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'' by [[Hieronymous Bosch]], circa 1489]]\n\n=== Title, authorship, and date ===\n[[File:ApocalypseStSeverFol026vJohnRecievesRev.jpg|thumb|St. John receives his Revelation. [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], 11th century.]]\n{{Main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}\nThe title is taken from the first word of the book in [[Koine Greek]]: \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 ''apokalypsis'', which means \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\". The author names himself as \"John\", but it is currently considered unlikely that the author of Revelation was also the author of the [[Gospel of John]]. Some of the evidence for this was set out as early as the second half of the 3rd century by [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]], who noted that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=28\u201329}}\n\nTradition links him to [[John the Apostle]], but it is unlikely that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus.{{sfn|Collins|1984|pp=26\u201327}} All that is known is that this John was a [[Jewish Christian]] prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter.{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp=1535\u20131536}}{{sfn||1992|pp=2, 24\u201325}}{{citation not found}} His precise identity remains unknown,{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|p=1535}} and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as [[John of Patmos]] {{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=}} (Rev. 1:9 \u2013 \"I was put on the Island of Patmos\").\n\nEarly Church tradition dates the book to end of the emperor [[Domitian]] (reigned AD 81\u201396), and most modern scholars agree, although the author may have written a first version after [[Nero]]'s Great Fire in Rome (AD 64) under [[Vespasian]] (AD 69\u201379) and updated it under [[Domitian]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=503\u2013504}}{{citation not found}} The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor [[Nero]] (reigned AD 54\u201368), but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that Nero would return.{{sfn|Collins|2002|p=100}}{{citation not found}}{{sfn|Stuckenbruck|2003|pp=1535\u20131536}}\n\n=== Genre ===\nRevelation is an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} \"Apocalypse\" means the revealing of divine mysteries;{{sfn|McKim|2014|p=16}} John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} The entire book constitutes the letter\u2014the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=2}} While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other [[New Testament]] book.{{sfn|Couch|2001|p=81}}\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe predominant view is that Revelation alludes to the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars to agree on the exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fekkes|first1=Jan|title=Isaiah and Prophetic Traditions in the Book of Revelation: Visionary Antecedents and their Development (The Library of New Testament Studies)|date=1994|publisher=Bloomsbury T&T Clark|isbn=185075456X|pages=61\u201363}}</ref> Revelation rarely quotes directly from the [[Old Testament]], yet almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.{{sfn|Beale|McDonough|2007|pp=1081\u20131084}}{{qn|date=December 2015}}\n\nAccording to several studies including a review by Dr [[James Tabor]] and Dr J. Massyngberde Ford, the Book of Revelation contains ancient pre-Christian texts of Jewish origin dating back to the time of John the Baptist and the communities of Qumran as well as antique Jewish texts. In several verses one can identify the ancient texts and that attributed to John, the latter having just added in the original text the words \"Jesus Christ\" (Rev 1: 1), \"testimony of Jesus Christ\" (Rev. 1: 2) or even  \"Jesus\" (Rev 1: 9), and similar words in dozens of other verses.\n\n=== Setting ===\nConventional understanding until recent times was that the Book of Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a [[megalomania]]cal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: [[Emperor Domitian|Domitian]] is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|pp=143\u2013145}}{{Additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation chastises those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with the Roman cult of empire.{{sfn|Stephens|2011|p=152}} This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from, and defiance against, the wider Roman society, which imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered a victory over this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor Adela Yarbro Collins, \"What ought to be was experienced as a present reality.\"{{sfn|Collins|1984|p=154}}\n\n=== Canonical history ===\n{{see|Development of the New Testament canon}}\nRevelation was the last book accepted into the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], and to the present day some churches that derive from the [[Church of the East]] reject it.{{sfn|Wall|2011|p=no page number}}<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Taylor\n| first1                = David G.

It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim \"He is here!\" prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come (\"as a thief in the night\"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last =Averky (Taushev)\n | first =Archbishop\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1996\n | publication-date=\n | title =The Apocalypse: In the Teachings of Ancient Christianity\n | editor-last =Eng. tr.

Christian Gnostics \"believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice.\"<ref>R.

He began his work, \"The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy.\"<ref>James M. Pryse ''Apocalypse Unsealed'' London: Watkins (1910). The theory behind the book is given in [[Arthur Avalon]] (Sir John Woodroffe) ''The Serpent Power'' Madras (Chennai): Ganesh & Co (1913).

This perspective is explained in ''The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse'' (new edition, 2004) by [[Massey H. Shepherd]], an Episcopal scholar, and in [[Scott Hahn]]'s ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'' (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.<ref>Scott Hahn, ''The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth'', {{ISBN|0-385-49659-1}}. New York City: Doubleday, 1999.</ref>\n\nThey believe the Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book ''Eucharist and Eschatology'' (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to [[Pope Benedict XVI]] some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAccordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.<ref>{{cite web |author=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |title=Pope Benedict: Read Book of Revelation as Christ's victory over evil \u2013 International \u2013 Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010122/http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=20995 |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Radical discipleship ====\nThe radical discipleship interpretation asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i.&nbsp;e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values \u2013 [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[civil religion]] being the most dangerous and insidious.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThis perspective (closely related to [[liberation theology]]) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as [[Ched Myers]], [[William Stringfellow]], [[Richard Horsley]], [[Daniel Berrigan]], Wes Howard-Brook,<ref>{{cite book|title=Unveiling Empire: Reading Revelation Then and Now|last= Howard-Brook|first=Wes|author2=Gwyther, Anthony|publisher=[[Orbis Books]]|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57075-287-2}}</ref> and [[Joerg Rieger]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Christ & Empire: From Paul to Postcolonial Times |last=Rieger| first=Joerg |publisher=[[Fortress Press]]| year=2007| isbn=978-0-8006-2038-7}}</ref> Various [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Jacques Ellul]], have identified the [[State (polity)|State]] and [[political power]] as [[The Beast (Bible)|the Beast]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page= |pages=123\u2013126 |url=|quote=Revelation}}</ref>\n\n==== Seventh-day Adventist ====\n{{main|Historicism (Christianity)#Seventh-day Adventists}}\nAdventists maintain a historicist interpretation of the Bible's predictions of the apocalypse.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holbrook|first1=Frank|title=What prophecy means to this church|journal=Ministry, International Journal for Pastors|volume=56|issue=7|page=21|date=July 1983|url=https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1983/07/what-prophecy-means-to-this-church|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeventh-day Adventists believe the Book of Revelation is especially relevant to believers in the days preceding the second coming of Jesus Christ. \"The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Seventh-day Adventist 28 Fundamental Beliefs|url=https://www.adventist.org/fileadmin/adventist.org/files/articles/official-statements/28Beliefs-Web.pdf|website=The Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist World Church|publisher=General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref>  \"Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=Revelation 14:12|url=https://biblia.com/books/nkjv/Re14.12|website=Biblia.com|publisher=Logos Research Systems|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> As participatory agents in the work of salvation for all humankind, \"This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent.\" <ref>{{cite web|title=The Remnant and its Mission|url=https://www.adventist.org/en/beliefs/church/the-remnant-and-its-mission/|website=The Official Site of the Seventh-day Adventist World Church|publisher=General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> The three angels of Revelation 14 represent the people who accept the light of God\u2019s messages and go forth as His agents to sound the warning throughout the length and breadth of the earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Councils to the Church pg.58|url=https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/19.422|website=Ellen G.

Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish [[Midrash]]. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]]. In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Charles Cutler Torrey]] taught [[Semitic languages]] at [[Yale University]]. His lasting contribution has been to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose.<ref>Charles C. Torrey ''The Apocalypse of John'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1958). Christopher R. North in his ''The Second Isaiah'' London: OUP (1964) p. 23 says of Torrey's earlier Isaiah theory, \"Few scholars of any standing have accepted his theory.\" This is the general view of Torrey's theories. However, Christopher North goes on to cite Torrey on 20 major occasions and many more minor ones in the course of his book. So, Torrey must have had some influence and poetry is the key.</ref> Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 7</ref>\n\nThis was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that \"The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic.\" Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues,<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 37</ref> the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else \"he would have had no hearing.\"<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 8</ref> Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6\u20138) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 137</ref> Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6:16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.<ref>''Apocalypse of John'' p. 140</ref>\n\n[[Christina Rossetti]] was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God.<ref>\"Flowers preach to us if we will hear\", begins her poem 'Consider the lilies of the field' ''Goblin Market'' London: Oxford University Press (1913) p. 87</ref> Her ''The Face of the Deep'' is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience.<ref>Ms Rossetti remarks that patience is a word which does not occur in the Bible until the New Testament, as if the usage first came from Christ's own lips. Christina Rossetti ''The Face of the Deep'' London: SPCK (1892) p. 115</ref> Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows.<ref>\"Christians should resemble fire-flies, not glow-worms; their brightness drawing eyes upward, not downward.\" ''The Face of the Deep'' p. 26</ref> Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions<ref>'vision' lends the wrong emphasis as Ms Rossetti sought to minimise the distinction between John's experience and that of others. She quoted 1 John 3:24 \"He abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us\" to show that when John says, \"I was in the Spirit\" it is not exceptional.</ref> belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. \"That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... \u2013 who can bear it?\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 301</ref> She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. \"A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 292</ref> Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as \"representative of all his brethren\" so they should \"hope as he hoped, love as he loved.\"<ref>''The Face of the Deep'' p. 495</ref>\n\nRecently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. [[Elisabeth Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza]] wrote ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' from the viewpoint of rhetoric.<ref>Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza ''Revelation: Vision of a Just World'' Edinburgh: T&T Clark (1993). The book seems to have started life as ''Invitation to the Book of Revelation'' Garden City: Doubleday (1981)</ref> Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\">Tina Pippin ''Death & Desire: The rhetoric of gender in the Apocalypse of John'' Louisville: Westminster-John Knox (1993) p. 105</ref>\n\nProfessor Sch\u00fcssler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes \"[[Horror fiction|horror literature]]\" and \"the [[misogyny]] which underlies the narrative is extreme.\"<ref name=\"Tina Pippin 1993 p. 105\"/>\n\n[[D. H. Lawrence]] took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, ''Apocalypse''.<ref>D H Lawrence ''Apocalypse'' London: Martin Secker (1932) published posthumously with an introduction (p. v \u2013 xli) by Richard Aldington which is an integral part of the text.</ref> He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called \"the sovereignty of the intellect\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. xxiii</ref> which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled \"vulgarity\"<ref>''Apocalypse'' p. 6</ref> and that was what he found in Revelation. \"It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.\"<ref>Apocalypse p. 11 Lawrence did not consider how these two types of Christianity (good and bad in his view) might be related other than as opposites. He noted the difference meant that the John who wrote a gospel could not be the same John that wrote Revelation.</ref>\n\nHis specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like \"the wrath of the Lamb\" were \"ridiculous.\" He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in \"great Chaldean sky-spaces\", which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and \"flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.\" Lawrence coined the term \"Patmossers\" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.<ref name=\"Lawrence1995\">{{cite book|author=D.

Dah\u0101g is mentioned as wreaking much evil in the world until at last chained  up and imprisoned  on the mythical Mt. Dam\u0101vand. The Middle Persian sources  prophesy that at the end of the world, Dah\u0101g will at last burst his bonds and ravage the world, consuming one in three humans and livestock, until the ancient hero [[Garshasp|Kirs\u0101sp]] returns to life to kill Dah\u0101g.  Whitlock wrote: \"Zoroastrianism, the state religion of the Roman Empire's main rival,  was part of the intellectual millieu in which Christianity came into being, just as were Judaism, the Greek-Roman religion, and the worship of Isis and Mithras.

For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871<ref>Anon ''An exposition of the Apocalypse on a new principle of literal interpretation'' Aberdeen: Brown (1871)</ref> prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (\"Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of \"the Satan\" in the [[Book of Job]]. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSteve Moyise<ref>S. Moyise ''The Old Testament in the Book of Revelation'' Sheffield: [[Sheffield Academic Press]] (1995) p. 31</ref> uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that \"Revelation contains more Old Testament [[allusion]]s than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.\" Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nYet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40\u201348 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall<ref>Ian Boxall The Revelation of St John London: Continuum & Peabody MA: Hendrickson (2006) p. 254</ref> writes that Revelation \"is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.\" In trying to identify this \"something new\", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nSome commentators argue that it is these purposes \u2013 and not the structure \u2013 that really matter. G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of [[Daniel 7]].<ref>G. K. Beale John's use of the Old Testament in Revelation Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press (1998) p. 109</ref> [[Richard Bauckham]] has argued that John presents an early view of the Trinity through his descriptions of the visions and his identifying Jesus and the Holy Spirit with YHWH.{{sfn|Bauckham|1993|p=}} Brandon Smith has expanded on both of their proposals while proposing a \"trinitarian reading\" of Revelation, arguing that John uses Old Testament language and allusions from various sources to describe a multiplicity of persons in YHWH without sacrificing monotheism, which would later be codified in the trinitarian doctrine of [[Nicene Christianity]].<ref>Brandon D. Smith, \"The Identification of Jesus with YHWH in the Book of Revelation, Criswell Theological Review (2016)</ref>\n\nOne theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, sees the book of Revelation constructed by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5\u201328; Rev 4:2\u20137; note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1\u20138; Rev 6:1\u20138). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8\u201310; Rev 6:1\u201317; 8:1\u20139:21; 11:15\u201319). The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2\u20138; Rev 13:1\u20137). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|last=Lewis|first=Kim|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|year=2015|isbn=1943325006|location=Lorton, Virginia|pages=216, 226}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revelationdrafthypothesis.info/|title=Revelation Draft Hypothesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Figures in Revelation ==\nIn order of appearance:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# [[John of Patmos]]\n# The [[angel]] who reveals the Revelation of Jesus Christ\n# The One who sits on the [[Throne of God#Revelation|Throne]]\n# Twenty-four crowned [[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]\n# Four [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]\n# The [[Lion of Judah]] who is the seven horned Lamb with seven eyes\n# [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]\n# the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, each given a white robe\n# Four angels holding the four winds of the Earth\n# The seal-bearer angel (144,000 of Israel sealed)\n# A great multitude from every nation \n# [[Seven trumpets|Seven angelic trumpeters]]\n# The star called [[Wormwood (star)|Wormwood]]\n# Angel of Woe\n# [[Scorpion]]-tailed [[Locust]]s\n# [[Abaddon]]\n# Four angels bound to the great river [[Euphrates]]\n# Two hundred million lion-headed [[cavalry]]\n# The mighty angel of Seven [[thunder]]s\n# The [[Two witnesses]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)|Beast of the Sea]] having seven heads and ten horns\n# [[Woman of the Apocalypse|The woman]] and her child\n# The [[Dragon]], fiery red with seven heads\n# [[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]]\n# Lamb-horned [[The Beast (Revelation)#Beast from the earth|Beast of the Earth]]\n# [[The Beast (Revelation)#Image of the beast|Image of the Beast]] of the sea\n# Messages of the three angels\n# The angelic reapers and the grapes of wrath\n# Seven plague angels\n# Seven bowls of wrath\n# The [[False Prophet]]\n# [[Whore of Babylon]]\n# The rider on a white horse\n# The first resurrection and the thousand years\n# [[Gog and Magog]]\n# Death and [[Hades]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Book of Revelation}}\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alpha and Omega]]\n* [[Apocalypse of John \u2013 dated astronomically]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Peter]]\n* [[Apocalypse of Zerubbabel]]\n* [[Apocalypticism]]\n* [[Arethas of Caesarea]]\n* [[Biblical cosmology]]\n* [[Biblical numerology]]\n* [[Book of Ezekiel]]\n* [[Christian eschatological differences]]\n* [[Day-year principle]]\n* [[English Apocalypse manuscripts]]\n* [[Horae Apocalypticae]]\n* [[Maccabees]]\n* [[Masada]]\n* [[Number of the Beast]]\n* [[Patmos]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Book of Revelation|Textual variants in the Book of Revelation]]\n* [[The Apocalypse (2000 film)|''The Apocalypse'']] \u2013 2000 film\n* [[The New Earth]]\n* [[Vespasian]]\n* [[Woman of the Apocalypse]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n<!-- this verifies what precisely? academic boosterism? self-published?{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Kim Mark|title=How John Wrote the Book of Revelation: From Concept to Publication|date=2015|publisher=Kim Mark Lewis|location=Lorton, VA|isbn=978-1943325009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ajYCgAAQBAJ}}-->\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last = Ammannati\n|first = Renato\n|title = Rivelazione e Storia.

At length God brings the [[Assyria]]ns to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise.\n\n[[Hezekiah]], the 14th king of Judah, does \"what [is] right in the Lord\u2019s sight just as his ancestor David had done\" <ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:3|HCSB}}</ref> and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods. Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria. But [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], the next king, reverses the reforms, and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king. Manasseh's righteous grandson [[Josiah]] reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess [[Huldah]], affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed after the death of Josiah.\n\nIn the final chapters, God brings the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] of [[King Nebuchadnezzar]] against Jerusalem; Yahweh deserts his people, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity. The final verses record how [[Jehoiachin]], the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Kings|25:27-30|NKJV}}</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Jeremia treurend over de verwoesting van Jeruzalem - Google Art Project.jpg|250px|right|thumbnail|[[Rembrandt]], ''Jeremiah Lamenting the Destruction of Jerusalem'', c. 1630]]\n\n=== Textual history ===\nIn the Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by Jews), First and Second Kings are a single book, as are the First and Second [[Books of Samuel]]. When this was translated into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the last few centuries BCE, Kings was joined with Samuel in a four-part work called the [[Books of the Kingdoms|Book of Kingdoms]]. Orthodox Christians continue to use the Greek translation (the [[Septuagint]]), but when a Latin translation (called the [[Vulgate]]) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually both Kings and Samuel were separated into two books each.<ref>Tomes, p. 246</ref>\n\nThen, what it is now commonly known as 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel are called by [[the Vulgate]], in imitation of [[Septuagint|the Septuagint]], 1 Kings and 2 Kings respectively. What it is now commonly known as 1 Kings and 2 Kings would be 3 Kings and 4 Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516 such as the Vulgate and the Septuagint respectively.<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_%281913%29/Third_and_Fourth_Books_of_Kings Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) Third and Fourth Books of Kings called in our days as First and Second of Kings]</ref> The division we know today, used by Protestant Bibles and adopted by Catholics, came into use in 1517. Some Bibles still preserve the old denomination, for example, the [[Douay Rheims bible]].<ref>[http://www.drbo.org/ Douay Rheims bible]</ref>\n\n=== The Deuteronomistic history ===\nAccording to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was [[Jeremiah]], who would have been alive during the fall of Jerusalem in 586&nbsp;BCE.<ref>Spieckermann, p. 337</ref> The most common view today accepts [[Martin Noth]]'s thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]], and which biblical scholars therefore call the [[Deuteronomistic history]].<ref>Perdue, xxvii</ref> Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century BCE, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers,<ref>Wilson, p. 85</ref> a first edition from the time of [[Josiah]] (late 7th century BCE), promoting Josiah's religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century BCE.<ref name=\"Fretheim\">Fretheim, p. 7</ref><ref name=\"Grabbe\"/> Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century BCE edition pointing to [[Hezekiah]] of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century BCE version with a similar message but identifying [[Jehu]] of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.<ref>Sweeney, p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Sources ===\nThe editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a \"[[Acts of Solomon|Book of the Acts of Solomon]]\" and, frequently, the \"[[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah|Annals of the Kings of Judah]]\" and a separate book, \"[[Chronicles of the Kings of Israel]]\". The \"Deuteronomic\" perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon's speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example.<ref name=\"Fretheim\" /> The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda,<ref>Van Seters, p. 307</ref> but in the broadest sense they appear to have been:\n\n* For the rest of Solomon's reign the text names its source as \"the book of the acts of Solomon\", but other sources were employed, and much was added by the redactor.\n* Israel and Judah: The two \"chronicles\" of Israel and Judah provided the chronological framework, but few details apart from the succession of monarchs and the account of how the [[Temple of Solomon]] was progressively stripped as true religion declined. A third source, or set of sources, were cycles of stories about various prophets ([[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]], [[Isaiah]], [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] and [[Micaiah]]), plus a few smaller miscellaneous traditions. The conclusion of the book (2 Kings 25:18\u201321, 27\u201330) was probably based on personal knowledge.\n* A few sections were editorial additions not based on sources. These include various predictions of the downfall of the northern kingdom, the equivalent prediction of the downfall of Judah following the reign of [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], the extension of [[Josiah]]'s reforms in accordance with the laws of [[Deuteronomy]], and the revision of the narrative from [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] concerning Judah's last days.<ref>McKenzie, pp. 281\u201384</ref>\n\n== Themes and genre ==\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|300px|thumb|right|The [[kings of Israel and Judah]]]]\n\nKings is \"history-like\" rather than history in the modern sense, mixing legends, folktales, miracle stories and \"fictional constructions\" in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God's offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history.<ref name=\"Nelson, pp.1-2\">Nelson, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RCgUvQOIvD0C&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=%22fictional%20constructions%22&f=false 1\u20132]</ref> The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (none do, and therefore all are \"evil\"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the \"[[high place]]s\" (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like [[Omri]] and [[Jeroboam II]] and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel's history, the [[battle of Qarqar]].<ref>Sutherland, p. 489</ref>\n\nThe major themes of Kings are God's promise, the recurrent [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostasy]] of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel:<ref>Fretheim, pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n* Promise: In return for Israel's promise to worship Yahweh alone, Yahweh makes promises to David and to Israel \u2013 to David, the promise that his line will rule Israel forever, to Israel, the promise of the land they will possess.\n* Apostasy: the great tragedy of Israel's history, meaning the destruction of the kingdom and the Temple, is due to the failure of the people, but more especially the kings, to worship Yahweh alone (Yahweh being the God of Israel).\n* Judgement: Apostasy leads to judgement. Judgement is not punishment, but simply the natural (or rather, God-ordained) consequence of Israel's failure to worship Yahweh alone.\n\nAnother and related theme is that of prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophecies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.<ref>Sutherland, p. 490</ref>\n\n== Textual features ==\n[[File:Tissot The Flight of the Prisoners.jpg|thumb|250px|[[James Tissot]], ''The Flight of the Prisoners'' \u2013 the fall of Jerusalem, 586&nbsp;BCE]]\n\n=== Chronology ===\n{{main|Chronology of the Bible}}\nThe standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology.<ref>Sweeney, p. 43</ref> To take just a single example, [[Omri]]'s accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of [[Asa of Judah]] (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor [[Zimri (king)|Zimri]] in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15).<ref>Sweeney, pp. 43\u201344</ref> The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version.<ref>Nelson, p. 44</ref> A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none has achieved consensus status.<ref>Moore & Kelle, pp. 269\u201371</ref>\n\n=== Kings and 2 Chronicles ===\nThe book 2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] covers much the same time-period as the books of Kings, but it ignores the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, [[Hezekiah]] is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and [[Manasseh of Judah]] is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign.<ref name=\"Sutherland\">Sutherland, p. 247</ref> It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and re-wrote history as he would have liked it to have been.<ref name=\"Sutherland\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Bible and history]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[Kingdom of Judah]]\n* [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]\n* [[Kings of Israel and Judah]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Commentaries on Kings ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Fretheim|first=Terence E|title=First and Second Kings|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1997|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ODLAo9QouEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Terence+E.+Fretheim+First+and+Second+Kings#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-664-25565-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Richard Donald|author-link=Richard D.

Elimelech died, and the sons married two Moabite women: Mahlon married [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and Chilion married [[Orpah]].\n\nAfter about ten years, the two sons of Naomi also died in Moab ([[Ruth 1#Verse 4|1:4]]). Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem. She told her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers and remarry. Orpah reluctantly left; however, Ruth said, \"Intreat me not to leave thee, ''[or]'' to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people ''[shall be]'' my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the {{LORD}} do so to me, and more also, ''[if aught]'' but death part thee and me.\" (Ruth 1:16\u201317 KJV)\n\nThe two women returned to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, Ruth went to the fields to [[gleaning|glean]]. As it happened, the field she went to belonged to a man named [[Boaz]], who was kind to her because he had heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law. Ruth told Naomi of Boaz's kindness, and she gleaned in his field through the remainder of barley and wheat harvest.\n\nBoaz was a close relative of Naomi's husband's family. He was therefore obliged by the [[Yibbum|Levirate]] law to marry Mahlon's widow, Ruth, in order to carry on his family's inheritance. Naomi sent Ruth to the threshing floor at night and told her to go where he slept, and \"uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do\" ([[Ruth 3#Verse 4|3:4]]). Ruth did so. Boaz asked her who she was, and she replied: \"I ''[am]'' Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou ''[art]'' a near kinsman.\" (3:9) Boaz blessed her and agreed to do all that is required, and he noted that, \"all the city of my people doth know that thou ''[art]'' a virtuous woman.\" (3:11) He then acknowledged that he was a close relative, but that there was one who was closer, and she remained in submission at his feet until she returned into the city in the morning.\n\nEarly that day, Boaz went to the city gate to meet with the other male relative before the town elders. The relative is not named: Boaz addresses him as ''[[Ploni Almoni|ploni almoni]]'', literally \"so and so\". The unnamed relative is unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so relinquished his right of redemption, thus allowing Boaz to marry Ruth. They transferred the property and redeemed it, ratified by the nearer kinsman taking off his shoe and handing it over to Boaz. [[Ruth 4#Verse 7|Ruth 4:7]] notes for later generations that:\n:''This was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel.''\n\nBoaz and Ruth were then married and have a son. The women of the city celebrate Naomi's joy, for Naomi found a redeemer for her family name, and Naomi takes the child and places it in her bosom.\n\nThe child is named [[Obed (biblical figure)|Obed]], who we discover is \"the father of Jesse, the father of David\" (Ruth 4:13\u201317), that is, the grandfather of [[King David]].\n\nThe book concludes with an appendix which traces the Davidic genealogy all the way back from [[Perez (son of Judah)|Perez]], \"whom [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] bore to [[Judah (son of Jacob)|Judah]]\", through to Obed, down to David.\n\n==Composition==\nThe book does not name its author.{{sfn|Hubbard|1988|p=23}} It is traditionally ascribed to the prophet [[Samuel]], but Ruth's identity as a non-Israelite and the stress on the need for an inclusive attitude towards foreigners suggests an origin in the fifth century BC, when [[Exogamy|intermarriage]] had become controversial (as seen in [[Ezra-Nehemiah|Ezra]] 9:1 and [[book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 13:1).{{sfn|Leith|2007|p=391}} A substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian period]] (6th\u20134th centuries BC).{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=105}} The genealogy that concludes the book is believed to be a post-exilic [[Priestly source|Priestly]] addition, as it adds nothing to the plot; nevertheless, it is carefully crafted and integrates the book into the [[history of Israel]] running from Genesis to Kings.{{sfn|West|2003|p=211}}\n\n==Themes and background==\n[[Image:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld- Ruth im Feld des Boaz.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]]: \"Ruth in Boaz's Field\", 1828]]\n===<span id=\"Levirate\"></span> Levirate marriage and the \"redeemers\"===\nThe Book of Ruth illustrates the difficulty of trying to use laws given in books such as [[Deuteronomy]] as evidence of actual practice.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=105}} Naomi plans to provide security for herself and Ruth by arranging a [[Levirate marriage]] with Boaz. Her plan is overtly sexual: Ruth is to go to the threshing floor (a place associated with sexual activity), wait until Boaz has finished eating and drinking (a possible allusion to the story of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and [[Lot's daughters|his daughters]], ancestors through incest of the Moabites), and to lie at his uncovered \"feet\" (a [[euphemism]] for genitals).{{sfn|West|2003|p=210}}<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"Genitals\">For \"feet\" as a euphemism for genitals see, for example, Amy-Jill Levine, \"Ruth,\" in Newsom and Ringe (eds.), ''The Women's Bible Commentary'', pp.78-84. The usual interpretation, as given here, is that Ruth is told to uncover Boaz's genitals, but see Kirsten Nielsen, \"Other Writings,\" in McKenzie and Graham (eds.), ''The Hebrew Bible Today'', pp.175-176, where it is argued that Ruth is to uncover herself.</ref>\n\nSince there was no heir to inherit Elimelech's land, custom required a close relative (usually the dead man's brother) to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line ([[Deuteronomy]] 25:5\u201310). This relative was called the [[go'el]], the \"kinsman-redeemer\". As Boaz is not Elimelech's brother, nor is Ruth his widow, scholars refer to the arrangement here as \"Levirate-like\".{{sfn|Allen|1996|p=521-522}} A complication arises in the story: another man is a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz and has first claim on Ruth. It is resolved through the custom that required land to stay in the family: a family could mortgage land to ward off poverty, but the law required a kinsman to purchase it back into the family (Leviticus 25:25ff). Boaz meets the near kinsman at the city gate (the place where contracts are settled); the kinsman first says he will purchase Elimelech's (now Naomi's) land, but, upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife, withdraws his offer. Boaz thus becomes Ruth and Naomi's \"kinsman-redeemer.\"{{sfn|Allen|1996|p=521-522}}\n\n===Mixed marriage===\nThe book can be read as a political parable relating to issues around the time of [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] (the 4th century BCE).{{sfn|West|2003|p=209}} The fictional nature of the story is established from the start through the names of the participants: the husband and father is Elimelech, meaning \"My God is King\", and his wife is Naomi, \"Pleasing\", but after the deaths of her sons Mahlon, \"Sickness\", and Chilion, \"Wasting\", she asks to be called Mara, \"Bitter\".{{sfn|West|2003|p=209}} The reference to [[Moab]] raises questions, since in the rest of the biblical literature it is associated with hostility to Israel, sexual perversity, and [[idolatry]], and {{bibleref2|Deut.|23:3\u20136|9|Deuteronomy 23:3\u20136}} excluded an Ammonite or a Moabite from \"the congregation of the {{LORD}}; even to their tenth generation\".{{sfn|West|2003|p=209}} Despite this, Ruth the Moabitess married a Judahite and even after his death still regarded herself a member of his family; she then married another Judahite and bore him a son who became an ancestor of [[David]].{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=312}} Contrary to the message of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]], where marriages between Jewish men and non-Jewish women were broken up, Ruth teaches that foreigners who convert to Judaism can become good Jews, foreign wives can become exemplary followers of Jewish law, and there is no reason to exclude them or their offspring from the community.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=312}}\n\n===Contemporary interpretations===\nScholars have increasingly explored Ruth in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues. [[feminism|Feminists]], for example, have recast the story as one of the [[dignity of labour]] and female self-sufficiency, and even as a model for [[lesbianism|lesbian]] relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women. Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing. Others again have seen it as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples.{{sfn|Irwin|2008|p=699}}\n\n==Genealogy: the descent of David from Ruth==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | |F|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|7| | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELI |y| NAO | | | | ELI=[[Elimelech]]| NAO=[[Naomi (biblical figure)|Naomi]]|}}\n{{familytree | |:| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|.| | }}\n{{familytree | BOA |~|y|~| RUT |~|~|~| MAH | | | | ORP |~|~|~| CHIL | BOA=[[Boaz]]| RUT='''Ruth'''| MAH=[[Mahlon and Chilion|Mahlon]]| ORP=[[Orpah]]| CHIL=[[Mahlon and Chilion|Chilion]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | | OBE | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | OBE=[[Obed (biblical figure)|Obed]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | | JES | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | JES=[[Jesse]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | | DAV | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | DAV=[[David]]|}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Goel]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist |group=\"Note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Allen |first=Leslie C. |chapter=Ruth |editor1-last=LaSor |editor1-first=William Sanford |editor2-last=Hubbard |editor2-first=David Allan  |editor3-last=Bush |editor3-first=Frederic William |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Allen |editor4-first=Leslie C. |title=Old Testament Survey: The Message, Form, and Background of the Old Testament |year=1996 |publisher=Eerdmans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&pg=PA521#v=snippet&q=%22Talmud%20credits%20the%20book%20to%20Samuel%22|ref=harv |isbn=9780802837882}}\n* {{cite book |last=Atteridge |first=Harold W. |title=The HarperCollins Study Bible |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |url= |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Coogan |first=Michael D. |authorlink=Michael D.

This is appropriate given that Esther describes the origin of a Jewish feast, the feast of [[Purim]], but Purim itself is not the subject and no individual feast in the book is commemorated by Purim. The book's theme, rather, is the reversal of destiny through a sudden and unexpected turn of events: the Jews seem destined to be destroyed, but instead are saved. In literary criticism such a reversal is termed \"peripety\", and while on one level its use in Esther is simply a literary or aesthetic device, on another it is structural to the author's theme, suggesting that the power of God is at work behind human events.{{sfn|Jobes|2011|p=40-41}}\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Megillat Esther (1).jpg|thumb|235px|The opening chapter of a hand-written scroll of the Book of Esther, with reader's pointer]]\nKing Ahasuerus, ruler of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], holds a lavish 180-day banquet, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards a seven day banquet for all inhabitants of the capital city, [[Susa|Shushan]]. (Esther 1:1-9.) On the seventh day of the latter banquet, Ahasuerus orders the queen, [[Vashti]], to display her beauty before the guests by coming before them wearing her crown. (1:10-11.) She refuses, infuriating Ahasuerus, who on the advice of his counselors removes her from her position as an example to other women who might be emboldened to disobey their husbands. (1:12-19.) A decree follows that \"that every man should bear rule in his own house.\" (1:20-22.) \n\nAhasuerus then makes arrangements to choose a new queen from a selection of beautiful young women from throughout the empire. (2:1-4.) Among these women is a Jewish [[orphan]] named [[Esther]], who was raised by her cousin or uncle, [[Mordecai]]. (2:5-7.) She finds favour in the King's eyes, and is crowned his new queen, but does not reveal her Jewish heritage. (2:8-20.) Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, [[Bigthan and Teresh]], to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is recorded. (2:21-23.)\n\nAhasuerus appoints [[Haman]] as his [[viceroy]]. (3:1.) Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him. (3:2-5.) Haman discovers that Mordecai refused to bow on account of his Jewishness, and in revenge plots to kill not just Mordecai, but all the Jews in the empire. (3:6.) He obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand [[talent (measurement)|talent]]s of silver, and casts lots (\"purim\") to choose the date on which to do this{{snd}} the thirteenth of the month of [[Adar]]. (3:7-12.)  A royal decree is issued throughout the kingdom to slay all Jews on that date. (3:13-15.)\n\nWhen Mordecai discovers the plan, he goes into mourning and implores Esther to intercede with the King. (4:1-5) But she is afraid to present herself to the King unsummoned, an offense punishable by death. (4:6-12.) Instead, she directs Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days for her, and vows to fast as well.  (4:15-16.)  On the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her to indicate that she is not to be punished. (5:1-2.)  She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. (5:3-5.) During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. (5:6-8.) Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and, at his wife's suggestion, has a [[gallows]] built to hang him. (5:9-14.)\n\nThat night, Ahasuerus cannot sleep, and orders the court records be read to him. (6:1.) He is reminded that Mordecai interceded in the previous plot against his life, and discovers that Mordecai never received any recognition. (6:2-3.) Just then, Haman appears to request the King's permission to hang Mordecai, but before he can make this request, Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the King wishes to honor. (6:4-6.) Assuming that the King is referring to Haman himself, Haman suggests that the man be dressed in the King's royal robes and led around on the King's royal horse, while a [[herald]] calls: \"See how the King honours a man he wishes to reward!\" (6:7-9.) To his surprise and horror, the King instructs Haman to do so to Mordecai. (6:10-11.)\n\nImmediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet. The King promises to grant her any request, and she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. (7:1-6.)  Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. (7:7.) The King returns in at this very moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier and he orders Haman hanged on the very gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai. (7:8-10.)\n\nUnable to annul a formal royal decree, the King instead adds to it, permitting the Jews to join together and destroy any and all of those seeking to oppress them.<ref>https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16481/jewish/Chapter-8.htm</ref> <ref>https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/esther-bible</ref> (8:1-14.) On 13 Adar, Haman's ten sons and 500 other men are killed in Shushan. (9:1-12.) Upon hearing of this Esther requests it be repeated the next day, whereupon 300 more men are killed. (9:13-15.) Over 75,000 people are slaughtered by the Jews, who are careful to take no plunder. (9:16-17.)  Mordecai and Esther send letters throughout the provinces instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called [[Purim]] (lots). (9:20-28.) Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues his reign, with Mordecai assuming a prominent position in his court.

The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who [[Ahasuerus#Historical_identification|amongst others]] has been identified as the 5th-century Persian king [[Xerxes I]] (reigned 486\u2013465 BC).<ref name=\"Between\"/> The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces.<ref name=\"ISBE\"/> However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact.<ref name=\"Coogan, Michael David Coogan 2009\"/> [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]] has questioned the reliability of other historical sources, such as [[Herodotus]], to which Esther has been compared. Yamauchi wrote, \"[Herodotus] was, however, the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible.\"<ref name=\"Yamauchi, Edwin M., 1980\">\"The archaeological background of Esther: archaeological backgrounds of the exilic and postexilic era, pt 2\". ''Bibliotheca sacra'' 137, no. 546 (1980), 102.</ref> The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period, and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther's account.\n\n== Historical reading ==\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:The Feast of Esther - Jan Lievens - Google Cultural Institute.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''The Feast of Esther'' (''Feest van Esther'', 1625) by [[Jan Lievens]], held at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]].]]\n\nThose arguing in favour of a historical reading of Esther most commonly identify Ahasuerus with [[Xerxes I]] (ruled 486\u2013465&nbsp;BC),<ref name=\"Between\"/> although in the past it was often assumed that he was [[Artaxerxes II]] (ruled 405\u2013359&nbsp;BC). The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''Ahasuerus'' (''\u0294a\u1e25a\u0161w\u0113r\u014d\u0161'') is most likely derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'', the origin of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Xerxes''. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Xerxes sought his [[Harem (household)|harem]] after being defeated in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering [[Queen consort]] named [[Amestris]], whose father, [[Otanes]], was one of Xerxes's generals. (In contrast, the Greek historian [[Ctesias]] refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.) Amestris has often been identified with [[Vashti]], but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, [[Artaxerxes I]], whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with [[Esther]], although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail.\n\nAs for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names ''Marduka'' and ''Marduku'' have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in over thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father [[Darius I]], and may refer to up to four individuals, one of which might after all be Mordecai.\n\nThe \"Old Greek\" Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as ''Artaxerxes'',<ref>http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/17-esther-nets.pdf Note on two Greek versions of the book of Esther</ref> a Greek name derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u03d1ra''. [[Josephus]] too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the [[Midrash]]ic text, ''Esther Rabba'' also makes the identification. [[Bar-Hebraeus]] identified Ahasuerus explicitly as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]; however, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name ''Artaxerxes'' distinct from ''Ahasuerus'', and a direct Greek rendering of ''Ahasuerus'' is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther. Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also ''Ar\u0161u'', understood as a shortening of ''A\u1e2b\u0161iyar\u0161u'' the Babylonian rendering of the Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew ''\u0294a\u1e25a\u0161w\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Ahasuerus) is derived.<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref> [[Ctesias]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' that is applied to shortened names. [[Deinon]] related that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Oarses'' which is also understood to be derived from ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a''.<ref name=\"Hosch\"/>\n\nAnother view attempts to identify him instead with [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]] (ruled 465\u2013424&nbsp;BC), whose Babylonian concubine, [[Kosmartydene]], was the mother of his son [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (ruled 424\u2013405&nbsp;BC). Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene.\n\nBased on the view that the Ahasuerus of the [[Book of Tobit]] is identical with that of the Book of Esther, some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally [[Cyaxares]] (ruled 625\u2013585&nbsp;BC). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called ''Achiachar'', which, like the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Cyaxares'', is thought to be derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Huwax\u0161a\u03d1ra''. Depending on the interpretation of Esther 2:5\u20136, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from [[Jerusalem]] with [[Jeconiah]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]], in 597&nbsp;BC. The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.\n\nJacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in ''Omanus'' and ''Anadatus'' mentioned by [[Strabo]] as being honoured with Anahita in the city of [[Zile|Zela]]. Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of \"Haman\" and \"Hamedatha\" who were being worshipped as martyrs. The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 61b) and [[Rashi]] both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped.<ref name=\"Hosch\"/> Attempts have been made to connect both \"Omanus\" and \"Haman\" with the Zoroastrian term [[Vohu Mana]]; however this denotes the principle of \"Good Thoughts\" and is not the name of a deity.)\n\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] identified Ahasuerus (Esther 1:1) as [[Artaxerxes III]] who reconquered Egypt.<ref>https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.</ref>\n\n== Interpretation ==\n[[Christine Hayes]] contrasts the Book of Esther with [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic writings]], the [[Book of Daniel]] in particular: both Esther and Daniel depict an existential threat to the Jewish people, but while Daniel commends the Jews to wait faithfully for God to resolve the crisis, in Esther the crisis is resolved entirely through human action and national solidarity. God, in fact, is not mentioned, Esther is portrayed as [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to Persian culture, and Jewish identity in the book is an [[Jewish peoplehood|ethnic category]] rather than a [[Judaism|religious one]].<ref name=\"oyc\">{{cite web |first=Christine |last=Hayes |authorlink=Christine Hayes |year=2006 |url=http://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145/lecture-24 |website=[[Open Yale Courses]] |publisher=[[Yale University]] |title=<!--RLST 145: -->Introduction to the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible): Lecture 24{{snd}} Alternative Visions: Esther, Ruth, and Jonah}}</ref>\n\nThis contrasts with traditional Jewish commentaries, such as the commentary of the [[Vilna Gaon]], which states \"But in every verse it discusses the great miracle.  However, this miracle was in a hidden form, occurring through apparently natural processes, not like the Exodus from Egypt, which openly revealed the might of God.\"<ref>Commentary of the Vilna Gaon to the Book of Esther 1:1</ref>  This follows the approach of the [[Talmud]],<ref>Chullin 139b</ref> which states that \"(The Book of) Esther is referenced in the Torah in the verse 'And I shall surely hide (in Hebrew, 'haster astir,' related to 'Esther') My Face  from them on that day.<ref>Deut. 31:18</ref>\n\n== Additions to Esther ==<!--[[Additions to the Book of Esther]] redirects here-->\nAn additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translation of the Bible. This was noted by [[Jerome]] in compiling the Latin [[Vulgate]]. Additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. Jerome recognized the former as additions not present in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Text]] and placed them at the end of his Latin translation. This placement and numbering system is used in Catholic Bible translations based primarily on the Vulgate, such as the [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]] and the [[Knox Bible]]. In contrast, the 1979 revision of the Vulgate, the [[Nova Vulgata]], incorporates the additions to Esther directly into the narrative itself, as do most modern Catholic English translations based on the original Hebrew and Greek (e.g., [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]], [[New American Bible]], [[New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]]). The numbering system for the additions differs with each translation. The Nova Vulgata accounts for the additional verses by numbering them as extensions of the verses immediately following or preceding them (e.g., Esther 11:2\u201312 in the old Vulgate becomes Esther 1:1a\u20131k in the Nova Vulgata), while the NAB and its successor, the NABRE, assign letters of the alphabet as chapter headings for the additions (e.g., Esther 11:2\u201312:6 in the Vulgate becomes Esther A:1\u201317). The RSVCE and the NRSVCE place the additional material into the narrative, but retain the chapter and verse numbering of the old Vulgate.\n\nThese additions include:<ref>see [http://www.usccb.org/bible/scripture.cfm?bk=Esther&ch= the NAB online] for the passages</ref>\n* an opening prologue that describes a dream had by Mordecai\n* the contents of the decree against the Jews\n* prayers for God's intervention offered by Mordecai and by Esther\n* an expansion of the scene in which Esther appears before the king, with a mention of God's intervention\n* a copy of the decree in favor of the Jews\n* a passage in which Mordecai interprets his dream (from the prologue) in terms of the events that followed\n* a colophon appended to the end, which reads: In the fourth year of the reign of Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who said he was a priest and Levite, and his son Ptolemy brought the present letter of Purim, saying that it was genuine and that Lysimachus, son of Ptolemy, of the community of Jerusalem, had translated it.\nBy the time Esther was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the [[Macedon]]ians of [[Alexander the Great]], who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the [[Septuagint]] version noticeably calls Haman a \"Bougaion\" (\u03b2\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd) where the Hebrew text describes him as an [[Agagite]].\n\nThe canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the [[Septuagint]]{{snd}} [[Martin Luther]], being perhaps the most vocal [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value.<ref>Frederic W. Bush, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/esther_bush.pdf \"The Book of Esther: Opus non gratum in the Christian Canon\"], ''[[Bulletin for Biblical Research]]'' 8 (1998), p. 39</ref> Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.\n\nThe [[Council of Trent]], the summation of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Counter-Reformation]], reconfirmed the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, as canonical. The Book of Esther is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic [[Lectionary]]. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of [[Mordecai]], and nothing of [[Esther]]'s own words is ever used. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] uses the Septuagint version of Esther, as it does for all of the Old Testament.

This has coincided with the [[privatisation of British Rail]], but the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of this is disputed]].

These wagonways soon spread out across the country. The system was later built as patchwork of local lines operated by small private railway companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see [[Railway Mania]]). The entire network was brought under government control during the [[First World War]] and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the [[nationalisation]] of the network (first proposed by 19th century [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as early as the 1830s). Instead, from 1 January 1923, almost all the remaining companies were [[Railways Act 1921|grouped]] into the \"big four\": the [[Great Western Railway]], the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] companies (there were also a number of other [[joint railway]]s such as the [[Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway]] and the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] as well as special joint railways such as the [[Forth Bridge]] Railway, [[Ryde Pier]] Railway and at one time the [[East London Railway]]). The \"Big Four\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.\n\nThe growth in road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced revenue for the rail companies. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the subsidised construction of roads. The railways entered a slow decline owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles. During the [[Second World War]] the companies' managements joined together, effectively forming one company. A maintenance backlog developed during the war and the private sector only had two years to deal with this after the war ended. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the [[public sector]].\n\n===Nationalisation===\n{{Main article|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948 - 1994}}\nFrom the start of 1948, the \"big four\" were [[nationalised]] to form [[British Railways]] (latterly \"British Rail\") under the control of the [[British Transport Commission]]. Although BR was a single entity, it was divided into six (later five) regional authorities in accordance with the existing areas of operation. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and railway stations was completed by 1954. In the same year, changes to the British Transport Commission, including the privatisation of road haulage, ended the coordination of transport in Great Britain. Rail revenue fell and in 1955 the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock, but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.\n\n[[File:Beeching2 clear.svg|thumb|left|The national network might have looked like this by the 1980s if the lines not proposed for development in Beeching II had closed.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}{{original research inline|date=July 2016}}]]\n\nThe desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s, with [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] manager Dr. [[Richard Beeching]] commissioned by the government under [[Ernest Marples]] with reorganising the railways. Many branch lines (and a number of main lines) were closed because they were deemed uneconomic (\"the [[Beeching Axe]]\" of 1963), removing much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. In the second Beeching report of 1965, only the \"major trunk routes\" were selected for large-scale investment, leading many to speculate the rest of the network would eventually be closed. This was never implemented by BR.\n\nPassenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the [[InterCity 125]] trains in the 1970s. Passenger levels fluctuated since then, increasing during periods of economic growth and falling during recessions. The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-[[inflation]] increases in fares,<ref>{{cite book|title=British Rail 1974\u20131997: From Integration to Privatisation |last=Gourvish |first=Terry |page=277}}</ref> and the service became more cost-effective{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In the early 1990s, the five geographical Regions were replaced by a Sectored organisation, in which passenger services were organised into [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]], [[Network SouthEast]] and [[Regional Railways]] sectors.\n\n===Privatisation===\n{{Main article|Privatisation of British Rail|Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1995 to date}}\n[[Privatisation of British Rail|British Rail operations were privatised]] during 1994\u20131997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to [[Railtrack]], whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the goods services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer). The government said privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services and satisfaction (according to the National Rail Passenger survey) has indeed gone up from 76% in 1999 (when the survey started) to 83% in 2013 and the number of passengers not satisfied with their journey dropped from 10% to 6%.<ref name=gbraildataset19978>{{cite web|url=http://www.atoc.org/download/clientfiles/files/Rail%20industry%20dataset%20-RDG%20-%20with%20cover.pdf|title=GB rail: Dataset on financial and operational performance 1997\u201398 \u2013 2012-13|access-date=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706124300/http://www.atoc.org/download/clientfiles/files/Rail%20industry%20dataset%20-RDG%20-%20with%20cover.pdf|archive-date=6 July 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since privatisation, passenger levels have more than doubled, and have surpassed their level in the late 1940s.

These companies bid for seven- to eight-year contracts to run individual franchises. Most contracts are awarded by the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT), with the exception of [[Merseyrail]], where the franchise is awarded by [[Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]], and [[ScotRail (brand)|ScotRail]], where the DfT awards on the advice of the [[Scottish Government]]. Initially, there were 25 franchises, but the number of different operating companies is smaller as some firms, including [[FirstGroup]] and [[Stagecoach Group]], run more than one franchise. In addition, some franchises have since been combined. There are also a number of local or specialised rail services operated on an 'open access' basis outside the franchise arrangements. Examples include [[Heathrow Express]] and [[Hull Trains]].\n\nIn the 2015&ndash;16 operating year, franchised services provided 1,718 million journeys totalling (64.7 billion billion passenger km) of travel, an increase over 1994&ndash;5 of 117% in journeys (from 761 million) and just over doubling the passenger miles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/18095/passenger-rail-usage-2014-15-q4.pdf |title=Passenger Rail Usage 2014-15 Quarter 4 Statistical Release}}</ref> The passenger-miles figure, after being flat from 1965 to 1995, surpassed the 1947 figure for the first time in 1998 and continues to rise steeply.\n\nThe key index used to assess passenger train performance is the [[Public Performance Measure]], which combines figures for punctuality and reliability.

Some other places expanded into towns and cities because of the railway network. [[Swindon]], for example, was little more than a village before the [[Great Western Railway]] chose to site its locomotive works there.

BR had pursued two development projects in parallel, the development of a [[tilting train]] technology, the '[[Advanced Passenger Train]]' (APT), and development of a conventional high-speed diesel train, the 'High Speed Train' (HST). The APT project was abandoned, but the HST design entered service as the [[British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255]] trains. The prototype HST, the [[British Rail Class 252]], reached a world speed record for diesel trains of 143.2&nbsp;mph, while the main fleet entered service limited to a service speed of 125&nbsp;mph, and were introduced progressively on main lines across the country, with a rebranding of their services as the ''[[InterCity 125]]''. With electrification of the [[East Coast Main Line]], high-speed rail in Great Britain was augmented with the introduction of the [[British Rail Class 91]], intended for passenger service at up to 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), and thus branded as the ''[[InterCity 225]]''. The Class 91 units were designed for a maximum service speed of 140&nbsp;mph, and running at this speed was trialled with a 'flashing green' signal aspect under the [[UK railway signalling|British signalling system]]. The trains were eventually limited to the same speed as the HST, to 125&nbsp;mph, with higher speeds deemed to require [[cab signalling]], which as of 2010 was not in place on the normal British railway network (but was used on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link). A final attempt by the nationalised British Rail at High Speed Rail was the cancelled [[InterCity 250]] project in the 1990s for the West Coast Main Line.\n\nPost privatisation, a plan to upgrade the [[West Coast Main Line]] to speeds of up to 140&nbsp;mph with infrastructure improvements were finally abandoned, although the tilting train [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] ''Pendolino'' fleet designed for this maximum speed of service were still built and entered service in 2002, and operates limited to 125&nbsp;mph. Other routes in the UK were upgraded with trains capable of top speeds of up to 125&nbsp;mph running with the introduction between 2000 and 2005 of [[British Rail Class 180|Class 180]] ''Adelante'' DMUs and the [[Bombardier Voyager family]] of DEMUs (Classes 220, 221 and 222).\n\n====High Speed 1====\n{{Main article|HS1}}\nThe first implementation of high-speed rail up to 186&nbsp;mph in regular passenger service in Great Britain was the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (now known as High Speed 1), when its first phase opened in 2003 linking the British end of the [[Channel Tunnel]] at Folkestone with [[Fawkham Junction]] in Kent. This is used by international only passenger trains for the [[Eurostar]] service, using [[British Rail Class 373]] trains. The line was later extended all the way into [[London St Pancras]] in 2007.\n\nAfter the building of the first of a new [[British Rail Class 395]] train fleet for use partly on High Speed 1 and parts of the rest of the UK rail network, the first domestic high-speed running over 125&nbsp;mph (to about 140&nbsp;mph) began in December 2009, including a special Olympic Javelin shuttle for the [[2012 Olympics]].

In 2009 it was announced the preferred rolling stock option for this project was the [[Hitachi Super Express]] family of multiple units, and they are expected to enter service from 2017 on the Great Western Main Line and 2018 on the East Coast Main Line. The trains will be capable of a maximum speed of 140&nbsp;mph with \"minor modifications\", with the necessary signalling modifications required of the [[Network Rail]] infrastructure in Britain likely to come from the phased rollout of the Europe-wide [[European Rail Traffic Management System]] (ERTMS).\n\n====High Speed 2====\n{{Main article|High Speed 2}}\nFollowing several studies and consultations on high-speed rail, in 2009 the UK Government formally announced the [[High Speed 2]] project, establishing a company to produce a feasibility study to examine route options and financing for a new high-speed railway in the UK. This study began on the assumption the route would be a new purpose-built high-speed line connected to High-Speed 1 to the Channel tunnel and from London to the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], via [[London Heathrow]], relieving traffic on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. Conventional high-speed rail technology would be used as opposed to [[Maglev (transport)|Maglev]]. The rolling stock would be capable of travelling on the existing [[Network Rail]] infrastructure if required, with the route intersecting with the existing West Coast Main Line (WCML) and the East Coast Main Line (ECML). A second phase of the project is planned to reach further north to Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, as well as linking into the [[Midland Main Line]].\n\n====High Speed 3====\n{{Main article|High Speed 3}}\nIn June 2014, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]] proposed a high-speed rail link [[High Speed 3]] (HS3) between Liverpool and Newcastle/Sheffield/Hull. The line would utilise the existing route between Liverpool and Newcastle/Hull and a new route from to Sheffield will follow the same route to Manchester Victoria and then a new line from Victoria to Sheffield, with additional tunnels and other infrastructure.\n\n====High-speed rolling stock====\nIn August 2009 the speeds of the fastest trains operating in Great Britain capable of a top speed of over 125&nbsp;mph were as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n!|Name\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" |Locomotive class\n!|Type\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" |Max. recorded speed (mph (km/h))\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" |Max. design speed (mph (km/h))\n!data-sort-type=\"number\" |Max. speed in service (mph (km/h))\n|-\n||[[Eurostar|Eurostar, e320]]\n||[[British Rail Class 374|374]]\n||EMU\n||219 (352)\n||200 (320)\n||N/A\n|-\n||[[Eurostar|Eurostar, e300]]\n||[[British Rail Class 373|373]]\n||EMU\n||209 (334.7)\n||186 (300)\n||186 (300)\n|-\n||[[Javelin (train)|Javelin]]\n||[[British Rail Class 395|395]]\n||EMU\n||157 (252)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.railnews.co.uk/news/2008/06/10-hitatchi-hs-milestone.html|title=Bullet train in milestone run on HS1|date=10 June 2008|quote=earlier successful 'overspeed' test to check train stability and ride on 18th April, when the train achieved a maximum speed of 252 km/h|accessdate=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n||140 (225)\n||140 (225)\n|-\n||[[InterCity 225]]\n||[[British Rail Class 91|91]]\n||Electric Loco\n||162 (261)\n||140 (225)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||[[Pendolino#United Kingdom|Pendolino]]\n||[[British Rail Class 390|390]]\n||EMU\n||162 (261)<ref>{{cite news |work =Rail |location =Peterborough |date= 25 February 2009 |issue= 612}}</ref><!---INADEQUATE REFERENCE: needs page number and title of article---->\n||140 (225)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||[[InterCity 125]]\n||[[British Rail Class 43 (HST)|43 (HST)]]\n||Diesel Loco\n||148 (~240)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||Adelante\n||[[British Rail Class 180|180]]\n||DMU\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||Voyager\n||[[British Rail Class 220|220]]\n||DEMU\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||Super Voyager\n||[[British Rail Class 221|221]]\n||DEMU\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||Meridian/Pioneer\n||[[British Rail Class 222|222]]\n||DEMU\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||Class 67\n||[[British Rail Class 67|67]]\n||Diesel Loco\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n||125 (200)\n|-\n||[[Intercity Express Programme|Hitachi Super Express]]\n||[[British Rail Class 800|800]], [[British Rail Class 801|801]], [[British Rail Class 802|802]]\n||EMU\n||???\n||140 (225)\n||125 (200)\n|}\nIn 2011 the fastest timetabled start-to-stop run by a UK domestic train service was the Hull Trains 07.30 King's Cross to Hull, which covered the 125.4&nbsp;km (78 miles) from Stevenage to Grantham in 42 minutes at an average speed of 179.1&nbsp;km/h (111.4&nbsp;mph).

[[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]] has the one remaining traditional tram system. Monorails, heritage tramways, miniature railways and funiculars also exist in several places. In addition, there are a number of heritage (mainly steam) standard and narrow gauge railways, and a few industrial railways and tramways. Some lines which appear to be heritage operations sometimes claim to be part of the public transport network; the [[Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway]] in Kent regularly transports schoolchildren.\n\nMost major cities have some form of [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom|commuter rail network]].

[[Travelling Post Office|Mail trains]] had long been part of the tradition of the railways in Great Britain, famously celebrated in the film ''[[Night Mail]]'', for which [[W. H. Auden]] wrote the poem of the same name. Although Royal Mail suspended the [[Travelling Post Office|Mail train]] in January 2004, this decision was reversed in December of the same year, and [[British Rail Class 325|Class 325s]] are now used on some routes including between London, Warrington and Scotland.\n\n==Train leasing services==\n{{anchor|Leasing services}}\n[[File:Class 47 railway locomotive - Fragonset Black livery - Virginia Water railway station - 280404.jpg|thumb|Fragonset Railways class 47 railway locomotive, Virginia Water railway station, April 2004]]\nAt the time of privatisation, the rolling stock of [[British Rail]] was sold to the new operators, as in the case of the freight companies, or to the three ROSCOs ([[rolling stock operating company|rolling stock operating companies]]) which lease or hire stock to passenger and freight train operators. Leasing is relatively commonplace in transport, since it enables operating companies to avoid the complication associated with raising sufficient capital to purchase assets; instead, assets are leased and paid for from ongoing revenue. Since 1994 there has been a growth in smaller spot-hire companies that provide rolling stock on short-term contracts. Many of these have grown thanks to the major selling-off of locomotives by the large freight operators, especially EWS.\n\nUnlike other major players in the privatised railway system of Great Britain, the ROSCOs are not subject to close regulation by the economic regulatory authority. They were expected to compete with one another, and they do, although not in all respects.\n\n===Competition codes of practice===\nSince privatisation in 1995, the ROSCOs have faced criticism from several quarters - including passenger train operating companies such as GNER, Arriva and FirstGroup - on the basis they are acting as an [[oligopoly]] to keep lease prices higher than they would be in a competitive market. In 1998, [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[John Prescott]] asked [[Rail Regulator]] [[John Swift QC]] to investigate the market's operation and make recommendations. Many believed Prescott favoured much closer regulation of the ROSCOs, perhaps bringing them into the net of contract-specific regulation, i.e., requiring every rolling stock lease to be approved by the Rail Regulator before it could be valid. Swift's report did not find major problems with the operation of what was then an infant market, and instead recommended the ROSCOs sign up to voluntary, non-binding codes of practice in relation to their future behaviour. Prescott did not like this, but he did not have the legislative time allocation to do much about it. Swift's successor as Rail Regulator, [[Tom Winsor]], agreed with Swift and the ROSCOs were happy to go along with codes of practice, coupled with the Rail Regulator's new powers to deal with abuse of dominance and anti-competitive behaviour under the [[Competition Act 1998]]. In establishing these codes, the Rail Regulator made it clear he expected the ROSCOs to adhere to their letter and spirit. The codes of practice were duly put in place and for the next five years the Rail Regulator received no complaints about ROSCO behaviour.\n\n===White paper 2004===\n[[File:Virgin Pendolino at Euston.jpg|thumb|right|A Virgin Pendolino train]]\nIn July 2004, the Department for Transport's White Paper on the future of the railways contained a statement it was dissatisfied with the operation of the rolling stock leasing market and believed there may have been excessive pricing on the part of the ROSCOs.\n\nIn June 2006, [[Gwyneth Dunwoody]], the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Transport Committee]] chair, called for an investigation into the companies.<ref>{{cite news |title= Review of train leasing urged |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/real_story/3434369.stm |date =6 June 2006 |work=BBC News}}</ref> Transport commentator [[Christian Wolmar]] has asserted the high cost of leasing is due to the way the franchises are distributed to the train operating companies. While the TOCs are negotiating for a franchise they have some freedom to propose different rolling stock options. It is only once they have won the franchise, however, they start negotiating with the ROSCOs. The ROSCO will know the TOC's requirements and also knows the TOC has to obtain a fixed mix of rolling stock which puts the train operating company at a disadvantage in its negotiations with the ROSCO.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wolmar |first=Christian  |title=On the Wrong Line |page=289 }}</ref>\n\n===Competition Commission===\nOn 29 November 2006, following a June 2006 complaint by the [[Department for Transport]] alleging excessive pricing by the ROSCOs, the [[Office of Rail and Road|Office of Rail Regulation]] (as it was then called) announced it was minded to refer the operation of the market for passenger rolling stock to the [[Competition Commission]], citing, amongst other factors, problems in the DfT's own franchising policy as responsible for what may be regarded as a dysfunctional market. ORR said it will consult the industry and the public on what to do, and will publish its decision in April 2007. If the ORR does refer the market to the Competition Commission, there may well be a hiatus in investment in new rolling stock whilst the ROSCOs and their parent companies wait to hear what return they will be allowed to make on their train fleets. This could have the [[unintended consequence]] of intensifying the problem of overcrowding on some routes because TOCs will be unable to lengthen their trains or acquire new ones if they need the ROSCOs to co-operate in their acquisition or financing. Some commentators have suggested that such an outcome would be detrimental to the public interest. This is especially striking since the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]], in its November 2006 report on the renewal and upgrade of the [[West Coast main line]], said that the capacity of the trains and the network will be full in the next few years and advocated train lengthening as an important measure to cope with sharply higher passenger numbers.\n\nThe Competition Commission conducted an investigation and published provisional findings<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/press_rel/2008/aug/pdf/22-08.pdf |publisher=Competition Commission |title=Rolling stock leasing market investigation: Provisional findings |date=7 August 2008 |access-date=26 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023151028/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/press_rel/2008/aug/pdf/22-08.pdf |archive-date=23 October 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on 7 August 2008.

This will encourage a wider choice of rolling stock to be considered in franchise proposals, irrespective of franchise length\n* ensure franchise invitations to tender (ITTs) are specified in such a way franchise bidders are allowed a choice of rolling stock\n* requiring the ROSCOs to remove non-discrimination requirements from the Codes of Practice, which would provide greater incentives for the TOCs to seek improved terms from the ROSCOs\n* requiring rolling stock lessors to provide TOCs with a set list of information when making a lease rental offer for used rolling stock, which would give TOCs the ability to negotiate more effectively\n\n===Leasing companies (ROSCO)===\n:''See also [[Rolling stock operating company]]''\n\nThree companies took over [[British Rail]]'s rolling stock on privatisation:\n* '''[[Angel Trains]]''' - owned by a consortium of private equity investors, mainly comprising pension funds and insurance companies, and has 4,400 vehicles in the UK.\n* '''[[Eversholt Rail Group]]''' - owns a fleet of over 4,000 vehicles and is owned by a consortium including [[3i Infrastructure]] and [[Morgan Stanley]].\n* '''[[Porterbrook]]''' - leases some 3,500 locomotives, trains and freight wagons; owned by a consortium including [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Lloyds TSB]] (who withdrew in October 2010) and [[BNP Paribas]].\n\nA number of other companies have since entered the leasing market:\n* '''[[Sovereign Trains]]''' - a company that forms part of the same group as the open-access operator [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]].

The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees. Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet. Some franchises receive a subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract.

that operated most of the overground [[rail transport in Great Britain]] between 1948 and 1997. It was formed from the [[nationalisation]] of the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|\"Big Four\" British railway companies]] and lasted until the gradual [[privatisation of British Rail]], in stages between 1994 and 1997. Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the [[British Transport Commission]], it became an independent [[statutory corporation]] in 1962 designated as the [[British Railways Board]].<ref>s.1 Transport Act 1962</ref>\n\nThe period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network. A process of [[dieselisation]] and [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for one [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] tourist line the [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]]. [[Passenger train|Passengers]] replaced [[freight train|freight]] as the main source of business, and one-third of the network was closed by the [[Beeching Axe]] of the 1960s in an effort to reduce [[rail subsidies]].\n\nOn privatisation, responsibility for track, signalling and stations was transferred to [[Railtrack]] (which was later brought under public control as [[Network Rail]]) and that for trains to the [[train operating companies]].\n\nThe British Rail \"double arrow\" logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a [[double track]] railway and was nicknamed \"the arrow of indecision\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://madebysix.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/the-arrow-of-indecision/ |title=The Arrow of Indecision |website=madebysix.wordpress.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Shannon |first=Paul |title=Blue Diesel Days |work=<!--This webpage is actually a publisher's advert for the book (ISBN 978-0-7110-3225-5), but shows online the usage of the phrase referenced.

This had very little to do with BR and was financed by private money. However, the rail network in Britain was finally connected to the railways on the continent. The Channel Tunnel Rail Link CTRL now usually known as [[High Speed 1]] or HS1 was built a little later. \n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Great Britain 1948\u20131994}}\n[[File:British Railways filmstrip (2).jpg|thumb|British Rail filmstrip showing how the railways were unified under BR.]]\n\n=== Nationalisation in 1948 ===\n{{Anchor|Nationalisation in 1948}}<!-- backup anchor for section links \u2013 do not rename -->\n[[File:70013 Oliver Cromwell Carlisle Kingmoor.jpg|thumb|BR steam locomotive: number 70013 ''Oliver Cromwell'']]\n[[File:Bishops Lydeard - D832 and D821 side by side.JPG|thumb|As BR modernised, diesel and electric locomotion gradually replaced steam. Pictured: two preserved 'Warship' class diesel-hydraulics]]\nThe rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the [[Railways Act 1921]], there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS), the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) and the [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] (SR). During [[World War I]] the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete [[nationalisation]] had been considered, and the [[Railways Act 1921]]<ref>{{cite hansard |title=The State and the Railways |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1920/aug/03/the-state-and-the-railways |publisher=[[Hansard]] |house=[[House of Lords]] |date=1920-08-03 |accessdate=2009-07-18 |column_start=711 |column_end=713}}</ref> is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected. Nationalisation was subsequently carried out after [[World War II]], under the [[Transport Act 1947]]. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government. British Railways came into existence as the [[business name]] of the [[Railway Executive]] of the [[British Transport Commission]] (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=67 |title=Transport Act 1947 |author=Her Majesty's Government |year=1947 |work=The Railways Archive |publisher=(originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office) |accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref>\n\nThere were also [[joint railway]]s between the Big Four and a few light railways to consider (see [[list of constituents of British Railways]]). Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the [[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway]]. The [[London Underground]] \u2013 publicly owned since 1933 \u2013 was also nationalised, becoming the [[London Transport Executive]] of the British Transport Commission. The [[Bicester Military Railway]] was already run by the government. The electric [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]] was also excluded from nationalisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citymetric.com/transport/liverpool-overhead-railway-was-legendary-it-worth-rebuilding-3575|title=The Liverpool Overhead Railway was legendary \u2013 but is it worth rebuilding? {{!}} CityMetric|website=www.citymetric.com|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}\n\nThe Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==== Regions ====\nBritish Railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former Big Four operated in; later, several lines were transferred between regions. Notably, these included the former [[Great Central Railway|Great Central]] lines from the Eastern Region to the London Midland Region, and the [[West of England Main Line]] from the Southern Region to Western Region\n* [[Southern Region of British Railways]]: former Southern Railway lines.\n* [[Western Region of British Railways]]: former Great Western Railway lines.\n* [[London Midland Region of British Railways]]: former London Midland and Scottish Railway lines in England and Wales.\n* [[Eastern Region of British Railways]]: former London and North Eastern Railway lines south of York.\n* [[North Eastern Region of British Railways]]: former London and North Eastern Railway lines in England north of York.\n* [[Scottish Region of British Railways]]: all lines, regardless of original company, in Scotland.\n\nThe North Eastern Region was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967. In the 1980s, the regions were abolished and replaced by \"business sectors\", a process known as [[sectorisation]].\n\nThe Anglia Region was created in late 1987, its first General Manager being John Edmonds, who began his appointment on 19 October 1987. Full separation from the Eastern Region \u2013 apart from engineering design needs \u2013 occurred on 29 April 1988.

It was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century. A government [[White Paper]] produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962, but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis.<ref name=\"last trains\">Loft, Charles (2013) Last Trains \u2013 Dr Beeching and the Death of Rural England {{ISBN|9781849545006}}</ref> The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety, and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic lost to the roads. Important areas included:\n* [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] of principal main lines, in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways|Eastern Region]], [[Kent]], Birmingham to Liverpool/Manchester and Central [[Scotland]]\n* Large-scale [[dieselisation]] to replace [[steam locomotives of British Railways|steam locomotives]]\n* New passenger and freight [[rolling stock]]\n* [[Railway signalling|Resignalling]] and track renewals\n* Modern [[marshalling yard]]s\n* The closure of an unspecified, but relatively small, number of lines\n\nThe government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme (costing \u00a31.2&nbsp;billion), but did so largely for political reasons.<ref name=\"last trains\" /> This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs.

One-third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic. Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less.

A main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500V DC-electrified [[Woodhead Line]] between Manchester and Sheffield: passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981.\n\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the Beeching Axe a generation earlier, but which had seen passenger services withdrawn. This included the bulk of the [[Chester and Connah's Quay Railway]] in 1992, the [[Brierley Hill]] to [[Walsall]] section of the [[South Staffordshire Line]] in 1993, while the [[Birmingham]] to [[Wolverhampton]] section of the Great Western Railway was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992.\n\nA further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by Sir David Serpell, was published in 1983. The [[Serpell Report]] made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km. This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf. Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors.{{Citation needed|date = December 2015}} This process, known as \"sectorisation\", led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.\n\n[[File:Charing Cross station geograph-3300926-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|[[Network SouthEast]] with a [[Networker (train)|Networker]] at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] serving [[Kent]]]]\nUpon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]], operating principal express services; London & South East (renamed [[Network SouthEast]] in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed [[Regional Railways]] in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services.<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] local services were managed by the [[Passenger Transport Executive]]s.

Initially, a [[Great Western Railway|GWR]]-style [[Brunswick green]] was used on passenger locomotives, and [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]]-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives, but later green was more widely adopted.<ref>Brian Haresnape ''Railway Liveries. BR Steam 1948\u20131968''</ref>{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}\n\nDevelopment of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the [[British Transport Commission]] and the [[Railway Executive]]. The Executive attempted to introduce a modern, curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems. Due to its similarity to a [[hot dog]], it became known as the \"flying sausage\". BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, an [[Art Deco]]-style motif of a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] astride a spoked wheel, designed for the BTC by [[Cecil Thomas (sculptor)|Cecil Thomas]]; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words \"British Railways\". This logo, nicknamed the \"Cycling Lion\", was applied from 1948 to 1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}\n\nIn 1956, the BTC was granted a [[Achievement (heraldry)|heraldic achievement]] by the [[College of Arms]] and the [[Lord Lyon]], and then BTC chairman [[Brian Robertson, 1st Baron Robertson of Oakridge|Brian Robertson]] wanted a grander logo for the railways. BR's second corporate logo (1956\u20131965), designed in consultation with [[Charles Franklyn]], adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a [[Crown (heraldry)|heraldic crown]] and holding a spoked wheel, all enclosed in a roundel with the \"British Railways\" name displayed across a bar on either side. This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the \"Ferret and Dartboard\". A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:British Railways London Midland Region station totem for Liverpool Central Low Level.jpg|Liverpool Central station sign using the \"Flying Sausage\" format\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1960s ===\n\nThe zeal for modernisation in the Beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise, and BR management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic, heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of [[London Transport Board|London Transport]]. BR's design panel set up a working party led by [[Milner Gray (designer)|Milner Gray]] of the [[Design Research Unit]]. They drew up [[British Rail Corporate Identity Manual|a Corporate Identity Manual]] which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying [[Rail Blue]] and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; [[Rail Alphabet]] as the standard corporate typeface, designed by [[Jock Kinneir]] and [[Margaret Calvert]]; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the \"Double Arrow\" logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to a bolt of [[lightning]] or [[barbed wire]], and also acquired a nickname: \"the arrow of indecision\". A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the [[port side]] of BR-owned [[Sealink]] ferry funnels.  The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to \"British Rail\".{{sfn|Jackson|2013}}{{sfn|Height|Cresswell|1979}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Good old British Rail logo (7417051300).jpg|The British Rail \"Double Arrow\" (1965)\nFile:40128 LLG 070882.jpg|Rail Blue colours \u2013 [[British Rail Class 40|Class 40]] 40128 with blue and grey coaching at [[Llandudno railway station|Llandudno]] in 1982\n</gallery>\n\n=== Post-1960s ===\n\nThe uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of [[sectorisation]] was introduced in the 1980s. Certain BR operations such as Inter-City, Network SouthEast or Railfreight began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a [[generic trademark]] to denote railway services across Great Britain.{{sfn|Jackson|2013}} The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British [[design history]] and there are plans for it to be re-published.<ref>{{cite web |title=Is the British Rail logo a design icon? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220132046/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35144496 |archivedate=20 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Finances ==\n[[File:19960604 02 Inverness railway station (5459979006).jpg|thumb|alt=Rail station with two trains|[[Inverness railway station|Inverness station]] with [[British Rail Class 158]]s]]\nDespite its nationalisation in 1947 \"as one of the 'commanding heights' of the economy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/british-railways/ |title=History of Railways in Britain |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> according to some sources British Rail was not profitable for most (if not all)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rail.co.uk/british-railway-history/ |title=History of the British Railway |work=Rail.co.uk |accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> of its history.<ref>{{cite book |title=British Railways 1948\u201373: A Business History |first=T.

However, in England passenger trains have returned to Mansfield, [[Corby railway station|Corby]], [[Chandlers Ford railway station|Chandlers Ford]], the reopened line to [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]] and there are numerous other proposals to restore services, such as Oxford-Milton Keynes/Aylesbury, [[Wealden Line|Lewes-Uckfield]], Bristol-Portishead and Plymouth-Tavistock. In London, Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Nottingham urban light-rail systems have taken over the routes of some former BR routes.\n\nIn Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government successfully supported the reopening to passenger services, of the [[Vale of Glamorgan Line]] between Barry and Bridgend in 2005. In 2008 the [[Ebbw Valley Railway]] reopened between [[Ebbw Vale Parkway railway station|Ebbw Vale Parkway]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]], with services to Newport scheduled to commence by 2011. (The Barry-Bridgend route was included in the closures proposed in the Beeching report of March 1963 and its services were duly withdrawn in June 1964, but Ebbw Vale had already been closed to passengers before the report was published.)\n\nIn Scotland, the Scottish Government have reinstated the lines between [[Argyle Line#Extensions|Hamilton and Larkhall]], [[Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine rail link|Stirling and Alloa]], and [[Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link|Airdrie to Bathgate]]. The biggest line reinstatement project was the rebuilding of part of the former [[Waverley Route]] from Edinburgh to Carlisle as the [[Borders Railway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waverleyrailwayproject.co.uk/route.php |title=Waverley Rail Project route}}</ref>\n\n== Preserved lines ==\nThe narrow-gauge [[Vale of Rheidol Railway]] in Ceredigion, Wales became part of British Railways at nationalisation. Although built as a working railway, in 1948 the line was principally a [[tourist attraction]]. British Rail operated the line using steam locomotives, long after the withdrawal of standard-gauge steam. The line's three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive [[TOPS]] serial numbers and be painted in BR Rail Blue livery with the double arrow logo. The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway.\n\nOther preserved lines, or [[heritage railways]], have reopened  lines previously closed by British Rail. These range from picturesque rural branch lines like the [[Keighley and Worth Valley Railway]] to sections of mainline such as the [[Great Central Railway]]. Many have links to the National Rail network, both at station interchanges, for example the [[Severn Valley Railway]] between {{stnlnk|Kidderminster}} and [[Kidderminster Town]], and physical rail connections like the [[Watercress Line]] at {{stnlnk|Alton}}.\n\nAlthough most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources, and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry.\n\n== Marine services ==\n\n=== Ships ===\n{{Main|British Railways ships}}\n[[File:Gb~brail.png|thumb|Sealink house flag]]\nBritish Railways operated ships from its formation in 1948 on several routes. Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, [[Sealink]]. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under [[TOPS]] as [[British Rail Class 99|Class 99]].\n[[File:Larne harbour (1984) - geograph.org.uk - 1158519.jpg|thumb|[[Sealink]] MV ''St David'' berthed in [[Larne]]]]\n\n=== Sealink ===\n{{Main|Sealink}}\nSealink was a ferry company based in the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1984, operating services to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Channel Islands, Isle of Wight and Ireland.\n\n=== Hovercraft ===\n{{Main|Seaspeed}}\nThe joint [[hovercraft]] services of British Rail (under '''British Rail Hovercraft Limited''') in association with the French [[SNCF]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1981/fulltext/138c03.pdf |title=Chapter 3: British Rail Hovercraft Ltd |website=competition-commission.org.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050302103859/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1981/fulltext/138c03.pdf |archivedate=2005-03-02}}</ref> British Rail Hovercraft Limited was established in 1965, under authority given to it by the British Railways Act 1967 and started its first service in 1966.

The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by [[Railtrack]]. The Telecomms infrastructure and [[British Rail Telecommunications]] was sold to [[Racal]], which in turn was sold to [[Global Crossing]] and merged with [[Thales Group]]. The rolling stock was transferred to three private [[rolling stock operating company|ROSCOs]] (rolling stock companies). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.\n\nBritish Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of [[ScotRail (British Rail)|ScotRail]]; the final train that the company operated was a [[Railfreight Distribution]] goods train in autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the [[Strategic Rail Authority]].\n\nSince privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured. Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include:\n\n*[[Midland Mainline]]\u2014superseded in 2007 by [[East Midlands Trains]]\n*[[Great North Eastern Railway]]\u2014superseded in 2007 by [[National Express East Coast]], brought back into public ownership with the creation of the new government-controlled [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] operator; the East Coast franchise was transferred to [[Virgin Trains East Coast]] in 2015 who had their franchise terminated 5 years early in 2018, and the East Coast Mainline was brought back into public ownership with the creation of the new government-controlled [[London North Eastern Railway]]. \n*[[Virgin Trains West Coast]]\n*[[Virgin CrossCountry]]\u2014superseded in 2007 by [[CrossCountry]]\n*[[ScotRail (National Express)|ScotRail]]\u2014operated by National Express, superseded in 2004 by [[First ScotRail]]; control of the franchise has since passed to [[Abellio ScotRail]]\n*Great Western Trains\u2014became First Great Western in 2008, renamed to [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] in 2015\n*[[Wales & West]]\u2014became [[Wessex Trains]] and [[Wales & Borders]] (including the [[Valley Lines (train operating company)|Cardiff Railway Company]] services operated as Valley Lines) in 2001, after being split into two separate franchises, and now run by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[Arriva Trains Wales]]\n*[[Arriva Trains Northern]]\u2014originally Northern Spirit, succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]]\n*[[First North Western]]\u2014originally North Western Trains, succeeded in 2004 by [[First TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]]\n*[[Anglia Railways]], Great Eastern (later [[First Great Eastern]]), and the West Anglia section of [[West Anglia Great Northern|WAGN]] were merged to become One, later renamed [[National Express East Anglia]], superseded in 2012 by [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Abellio Greater Anglia]], now known as Greater Anglia\n*[[Thameslink (train operating company 1997\u20132006)|Thameslink]]\u2014succeeded by [[First Capital Connect]] in 2006, combined at the same time with [[West Anglia Great Northern]] to form the Thameslink Great Northern franchise; succeeded by [[Govia Thameslink Railway]] in 2014, augmented by [[South Central rail franchise|South Central]] and [[Gatwick Express]] to form the [[Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise|Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern]] franchise in 2015\n*LTS (London, Tilbury & Southend)\u2014rebranded as [[c2c]] in 2000\n*[[Connex South Eastern]] became [[South Eastern Trains]], then [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]]\n*[[Connex South Central]] became South Central and later renamed [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]]\n*Merseyrail Electrics superseded by [[Arriva Trains Merseyside]] and now [[Merseyrail]]\n*[[South West Trains]] then South Western Railway operated by FirstGroup and MTR Corporation,  in 2017\n*[[Central Trains]]\u2014divided in 2007 between [[London Midland]], [[CrossCountry]] and [[East Midlands Trains]]\n*[[London Underground]] for the short underground [[Waterloo & City line]]\n*[[Silverlink]]\u2014divided in 2007 between [[London Overground]] and [[London Midland]]\n\n== Future ==\n{{See also|Renationalisation of British Rail}}\nSince privatisation, many groups have campaigned for the renationalisation of British Rail, most notably 'Bring Back British Rail'. Various interested parties also have views on the [[privatisation of British Rail]].\n\nThe renationalisation of the railways of Britain continues to have popular support.

The scene shifts to heaven, where God asks [[Satan]] (''ha-satan'', literally \"the accuser\") for his opinion of Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job had, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill all of his children and servants,<ref>{{Bibleref2|Job|1:12}}.</ref> but Job nonetheless praises God: \"Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\" God allows Satan to afflict his body with [[boil]]s.

Job responds with scorn: his interlocutors are \"miserable comforters\" ([[Vulgate]] {{lang-la|consolatores onerosi}}),<ref>{{bibleref2|Job 16:2||NIV;VULGATE}}.</ref> since a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=190}}\n\n=== Three monologues: Poem to Wisdom, Job's closing monologue, and Elihu's speeches ===\n[[File:Job and his friends.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.3|''Job and His Friends'' by [[Ilya Repin]] (1869)]]\n\nThe dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem (the \"hymn to wisdom\") on the inaccessibility of wisdom: \"Where is wisdom to be found?\" it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man (chapter 28).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=33\u201334}} Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain.

His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor enter into the courtroom confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=339}} Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?\" Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=28}} In 42:1\u20136 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge \"of things beyond me which I did not know\". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and \"therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes.\"{{sfn|Habel|1985|p=575}}\n\n===Epilogue===\nGod tells Eliphaz that he and his three friends \"have not spoken of me what is right as my servant Job has done\". The three (Elihu, the fourth friend introduced in chapter 32 is not mentioned here) are told to make [[Burnt offering (Judaism)|a burnt offering]] with Job as their intercessor, \"for only to him will I show favour\". Job is restored to health, riches and family, and lives to see his children to the fourth generation.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=33}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:LB100fol165.JPG|fol.165-Job.XXXVIII|thumb|Anonymous Byzantine illustration.<br>The [[Incarnation (Christianity)|pre-incarnate]] Christ speaks to Job]]\n\n===Authorship, language, texts===\nRabbinic tradition ascribes the authorship of Job to [[Moses]], but scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=193}} The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern [[Edom]] or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as [[Mesopotamia]] and Egypt.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=44}} According to the 6th-century BCE prophet [[book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], Job was a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness,{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=1}} and the book's author has chosen this legendary hero for his [[parable]].{{sfn|Fokkelman|2012|p=20}}\n\nThe language of Job stands out for its conservative spelling and for its exceptionally large number of words and forms not found elsewhere in the Bible.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=17}} The 12th century Jewish scholar [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] concluded that the book must have been written in some other language and translated into Hebrew, and many later scholars down to the 20th century looked for an [[Aramaic]], [[Arabic]] or [[Edomite language|Edomite]] original, but a close analysis suggests that the foreign words and foreign-looking forms are literary affectations designed to lend authenticity to the book's distant setting.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=21\u201324}}\n\nJob exists in a number of forms: the Hebrew [[Masoretic Text]], which underlies many modern Bible translations; the Greek [[Septuagint]] made in Egypt in the last centuries BCE; and Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=1\u201316}}\n\n===Job and the wisdom tradition===\nJob, [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Book of Proverbs]] belong to the genre of [[wisdom literature]], sharing a perspective that they themselves call the \"way of wisdom\".{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=129}} Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety \u2013 except by God.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=129\u201330}} The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|pp=130\u201331}} Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=84}} Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job,{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=346}} and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.{{sfn|Hartley|2008|p=360}}\n\n==Themes==\n[[File:Destruction of Leviathan.png|thumb|''The Destruction of Leviathan'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1865)]]\n\nJob is an investigation of the problem of divine justice.{{sfn|Bullock|2007|p=82}} This problem, known in theology as [[theodicy]], can be rephrased as a question: \"Why do the righteous suffer?\"{{sfn|Lawson|2005|p=11}} The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin (the principle known as \"[[retributive justice]]\").{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=58}} This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering is frequently unmerited.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|p=201}}\n\nThe biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy.{{sfn|Brueggemann|2002|pp=177\u201378}} Satan raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.{{sfn|Walton|2008|pp=336\u201337}}\n\nThe book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient \"God's eye perspective\" which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, \"blameless and upright\", who \"fears God\" and \"shuns evil\".{{sfn|Hooks|2006|p=57}}{{sfn|O'Dowd|2008|pp=242\u201343}} God is seen initiating the discussion with Satan and approving Job's suffering, a device which serves three purposes: the usual explanations for suffering, that the sufferer has committed some sin of which he is unaware or that God's actions are inscrutable, are eliminated; it makes clear that it is not Job who is on trial, but God's policy of retribution; and the reader sees that God himself bears responsibility for Job's suffering{{sfn|Barton|2008|p=336}} \"without any reason\".<ref>{{bibleref2|Job|2:3|NIV}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=De Lafayette |first=Maximillien |title=The 3 most evil, savage and deceptive inventions in history.

Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust.{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=97\u201398}} He retains his piety throughout the story (belying Satan's suspicion that his righteousness is due to the expectation of reward), but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=194}} Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may \"rescue the afflicted from their affliction\" and make them more amenable to revelation \u2013 literally, \"open their ears\" (36:15).{{sfn|Seow|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nChapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom. The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom.{{sfn|Dell|2003|p=356}} Wisdom cannot be invented or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him.{{sfn|Hooks|2006|pp=329\u201330}} God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world (Job 28:24\u201326) \u2013 a theme which looks forward to God's speech in chapters 38\u201341 with its repeated refrain \"Where were you when...?\"{{sfn|Fiddes|1996|p=174}}\n\nWhen God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Job's suffering (revealed to the reader in the prologue in heaven) nor defends his justice. The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom. Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it. The second speech concerns God's role in controlling [[behemoth]] and [[leviathan]], sometimes translated as the hippopotamus and crocodile, but more probably representing primeval cosmic creatures, in either case demonstrating God's wisdom and power.{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=338}} Job's reply to God's final speech is longer than his first and more complicated. The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents \"in dust and ashes\" (42:6), but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments.{{sfn|Sawyer|2013|p=34}} In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged.{{sfn|Barton|2008|pp=338\u201339}}\n\n==Later interpretation and influence==\n[[File:Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750-1850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London.jpg|thumb|left|Carved wooden figure of Job. Probably from Germany, 1750\u20131850 CE. The Wellcome Collection, London]]\n===History of interpretation===\nIn the [[Second Temple]] period (500 BCE \u2013 70 CE) Job began being transformed into something more patient and steadfast, with his suffering a test of virtue and a vindication of righteousness for the glory of God.{{sfn|Seow|2013|p=111}} The process of \"sanctifying\" Job began with the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation (c. 200 BCE) and was furthered in the [[Testament of Job]] (1st century BCE \u2013 1st century CE), which makes him the hero of patience.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=362\u201363}} This reading pays little attention to the Job of the dialogue sections of the book,{{sfn|Dell|1991|pp=6\u20137}} but it was the tradition taken up by the [[Epistle of James]] in the [[New Testament]], which presents Job as one whose patience and endurance should be emulated by believers (James 5:7\u201311).{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=362}}\n\nJewish interpretation of Job was initially positive. He was seen as a righteous Gentile who acknowledged God.{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=364}} Very early, however, Christianity began interpreting Job 19:23\u201329 (verses concerning a \"redeemer\" whom Job hopes can save him from God) as a prophecy of Christ,{{sfn|Simonetti|Conti|Oden|2006|pp=105\u201306}} although the major view among scholars is that Job's \"redeemer\" is either an angelic being or God himself.{{sfn|Hooks|2006|pp=250\u201351}} With Job viewed by Christians as a witness to the coming Christ, the predominant Jewish view became \"Job the blasphemer\", with some rabbis even saying that he was rightly punished by God because he had stood by while Pharaoh massacred the innocent Jewish infants.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=361\u201362}}{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}\n\n[[Saint Augustine]] recorded that Job had prophesied the coming of Christ, and [[Gregory the Great]] offered him as a model of right living worthy of respect. The medieval Jewish scholar [[Maimonides]] declared his story a parable, and the medieval Christian [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history. In the Reformation [[Martin Luther]] explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and [[John Calvin]]'s Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.{{sfn|Allen|2008|pp=368\u201371}}\n\nThe contemporary movement known as creation theology, an [[Environmental theology|ecological theology]] valuing the needs of all creation, interprets God's speeches in Job 38\u201341 to imply that his interests and actions are not exclusively focused on humankind.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=150}}\n\n===Liturgical use===\nJewish liturgy does not use readings from the Book of Job in the manner of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]], [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], or [[Five Megillot]], although it is quoted at funerals and times of mourning. However, there are some Jews, particularly the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], who do hold public readings of Job on the [[Tisha B'Av]] fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple|Second]] [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] and other tragedies). The [[cantillation]] signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] reads from Job and Exodus during [[Holy Week]]. Exodus prepares for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation; Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] reads from Job during [[Matins]] in the first two weeks of September and in the Office of the Dead, and in the revised [[Liturgy of the Hours]] Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in [[Ordinary Time]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===In music, art, literature, and film===\n[[File:Georges de La Tour 044.jpg|thumb|[[Georges de La Tour]],<br />''Job Mocked by his Wife'']]\n\nThe Book of Job has been deeply influential in Western culture, to such an extent that no list could be more than representative. Musical settings from Job include [[Orlande de Lassus]]'s 1565 cycle of motets, the ''Sacrae Lectiones Novem ex Propheta Job'', and [[George Frideric Handel]]'s use of Job 19:25 (\"I know that my redeemer liveth\") as an aria in his 1741 oratorio ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. Modern works based on the book include [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Job: A Masque for Dancing]]'', French composer [[Darius Milhaud]]'s ''Cantata From Job'', and Joseph Stein's Broadway interpretation ''[[The Fiddler on the Roof]]'', based on an earlier Yiddish memoir by Sholem Alchem in 1894. Neil Simon wrote ''[[God's Favorite]]'' which is a modern retelling of the Book of Job. Breughel and [[Georges de la Tour]] depicted Job visited by his wife, and [[William Blake's Illustrations of the Book of Job|William Blake produced an entire cycle of illustrations for the book]]. Writers Job has inspired or influenced include{{original research inline|date=May 2015}} [[John Milton]] (''[[Samson Agonistes]]''), Dostoevsky (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''), Franz Kafka (''[[The Trial]]''), [[Carl Jung]] (''[[Answer to Job]]''), [[Joseph Roth]] (''[[Job (novel)|Job]]''), and Bernard Malamud. Archibald MacLeish's drama, ''[[J.B. (play)|JB]]'', one of the most prominent uses of the Book of Job in modern literature, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959. Job's influence can also be seen in the [[Coen brothers]]' 2009 film, ''[[A Serious Man]]'', which was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. [[Terrence Malick]]'s 2011 film ''[[The Tree of Life (film)|The Tree of Life]]'', which won the [[Palme d'Or]], is heavily influenced by the themes of the Book of Job, as the film starts with a quote from the beginning of God's speech to Job. A 2014 Malayalam film called \"[[Iyobinte Pusthakam]]\" tells the story of a man who is losing everything in his life and also has parallels with Dostoevsky's (''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''). The Russian film ''[[Leviathan (2014 film)|Leviathan]]'' also draws themes from the Book of Job.

His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side.{{sfn|Noegel|Wheeler|2010|p=171}}{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|p=8}}\n\nIn [[Palestinian folklore]] Job's place of trial is [[Al-Jura|Al-Joura]], a village outside the town of Al Majdal ([[Ashkelon]]). It was there that God rewarded him with a [[Fountain of Youth]] that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth. Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring. In Lebanon the Muwahideen (or [[Druze]]) community have a shrine built in the Shouf area that allegedly contains Job's tomb. In [[Turkey]], Job is known as ''Ey\u00fcp'', and he is supposed to have lived in [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]].

Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of \"sayings\" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include \"instructions\" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the \"words of the wise\" sayings, longer than the Solomonic \"sayings\" but shorter and more diverse than the \"instructions\".{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=17\u201320}}\n\nThe first section (chapters 1\u20139) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten \"instructions\", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=48}} Proverbs 10:1\u201322:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second addressing wise and foolish speech.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=58}} Chapters 25\u201329, attributed to editorial activity of \"the men of [[Hezekiah]],\" contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=67}} Chapter 30:1\u20134, the \"sayings of Agur\", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.{{sfn|Perdue|2007|p=68}}\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Dore Solomon Proverbs.png|thumb|235px|Solomon writing Proverbs ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9]])]]\n\nIt is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a \"collection of collections\" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=438}} The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, ''mishley shelomoh'', Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.{{sfn|Farmer|1991|p=25}}\n\nThe book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1\u20139, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rogers |first=Robert William  |date=1912 |title=Cuneiform parallels to the Old Testament |edition=1st | chapter = 8. Fragment of Wisdom Literature | publisher= Eaton and Mains|  place = New York | url=https://archive.org/details/cunciformparalle00roge |access-date=March 13, 2016}}</ref> The second, chapters 10\u201322:16, carries the superscription \"the proverbs of Solomon\", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed \"bend your ear and hear the words of the wise\": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the [[Instruction of Amenemope]], and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, \"these too are from the wise.\" The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed \"by the men of [[Hezekiah]]\", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 (the \"words of Agur,\" the \"words of Lemuel,\" and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183\u201385}}\n\nThe \"wisdom\" genre was widespread throughout the [[ancient Near East]], and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom.{{sfn|Smothers|2000|pp=167\u201368, 174}} The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction;{{sfn|Tucker|2000|pp=163\u201366}} nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.{{sfn|Crenshaw|2000|p=217}}\n\n== Themes ==\n[[Image:Proverbs 3- 5,6 IMG 3141.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Excerpt from Proverbs 3 displayed at [[Portland International Jetport]] in [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]]]]\n[[File:Incunabulum Blackletter Bible 1497.jpg|right|thumb|A page of the Book of Proverbs from a [[Bible]] from 1497]]\n\nAlong with the other examples of the Biblical [[wisdom tradition]] \u2013 [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] and some other writings \u2013 Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=xiii\u2013xvii}}\n\nProverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies). The reader is told, for example, both to \"not answer a fool according to his folly\", according to 26:4, and to \"answer a fool according to his folly\", as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1\u20139) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1\u201314, the \"words of Agur,\" we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.{{sfn|Alter|2010|pp=183\u201385}}\n\n\"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10 \u2013 the phrase implies submission to God's will{{sfn|Longman|Garland|2009|p=}}). Wisdom is praised for her role in creation (\"God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens\" \u2013 Proverbs 3:19). God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos (\"When [God] established the heavens...when he drew a circle on then face of the [[Tehom|Deeps]]...when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him\" \u2013 Proverbs 8:27\u201331). Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.{{sfn|Boccaccini|2002|p=106}} Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a \"fool\" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful).\n\nFor the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast, [[Book of Job|Job]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the \"wise\".{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=183}} Noteworthy also is the fact that the \"mighty acts of God\" ([[the Exodus]], the giving of the [[Torah]] at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.) which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority (\"Thus says the Lord!\"), wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.{{sfn|Farmer|1998|p=130}}\n\n==Later interpretation and influence==\nThe pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an [[Heavenly host|assembly of subordinate servant-deities]].{{sfn|Page Lee|1990|pp=176\u201377}} The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe:{{sfn|Berlin|2011|p=188}} \"Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields.\"{{sfn|Parrish|1990|p=183}} Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}} Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the [[Epistle to the Colossians]] calls Jesus \"...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...\", while the [[Gospel of John]] identifies him with the creative word (\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\").{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183\u201384}} \n\nIn the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, {{Bibleverse|Proverbs|8:22|NASB}} was used both to support and refute the claims of the [[Arian controversy|Arians]]. The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the \"Wisdom of God\" ({{Bibleverse|1 Corinthians|1:24}}), argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was \"created\" (Proverbs 8:22), and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as \"begot\", won the debate, and the [[Nicene Creed]] declared that the Son was \"begotten, not made\", meaning that God and Christ were [[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]].{{sfn|Farmer|1991|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n== See also ==\n* \"[[As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly]]\"\n* [[Proverbs 31]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--READ ME!!

The first four are written as [[acrostic]]s \u2013 chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have 22 verses, corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the first lines beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, the second with the second letter, and so on. Chapter 3 has 66 verses, so that each letter begins three lines, and the fifth poem is not acrostic but still has 22 lines.{{sfn|Clines|2003|p=617}} The purpose or function of this form is unknown.{{sfn|Hillers|1993|p=420}}\n\nUnlike standard alphabetical order, the middle chapters in Lamentations have the letter Pe (the 17th letter) comes before Ayin (the 16th). The first chapter uses standard alphabetical order.\n\n==Summary==\nThe book consists of five separate poems. In the first (chapter 1), the city sits as a desolate weeping widow overcome with miseries. In Chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with national sins and acts of God. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God: the chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation of the city and temple, but traces it to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.\n\n==Composition==\nLamentations has traditionally been ascribed to [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], probably on the grounds of the reference in 2 Chronicles 35:25 to the prophet composing a lament on the death of King [[Josiah]], but there is no reference to Josiah in the book and no reason to connect it to Jeremiah.{{sfn|Clines|2003|p=617}} \nThe language fits an [[Babylonian Exile|Exilic]] date (586\u2013520&nbsp;BCE), and the poems probably originated from Judeans who remained in the land.{{sfn|Dobbs-Allsopp|2002|pp=4\u20135}} Scholars are divided over whether they are the work of one or multiple authors.{{sfn|Dobbs-Allsopp|2002|pp=4\u20135}} One clue pointing to multiple authors is that the gender and situation of the first-person witness changes \u2013 the narration is feminine in the first and second lamentation, and masculine in the third, while the fourth and fifth are eyewitness reports of Jerusalem's destruction;{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=566\u2013567}} conversely, the similarities of style, vocabulary, and theological outlook, as well as the uniform historical setting, are arguments for one author.<ref>F. B. Huey, Jeremiah, Lamentations, vol. 16, The New American Commentary (Nashville: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1993), 443.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nLamentations combines elements of the ''qinah'', a funeral dirge for the loss of the city, and the \"communal lament\" pleading for the restoration of its people.{{sfn|Berlin|2004|pp=23\u201324}} It reflects the  view, traceable to [[Sumer]]ian literature of a thousand years earlier, that the destruction of the holy city was a punishment by God for the communal sin of its people.{{sfn|Hillers|1993|p=420}}\n\nBeginning with the reality of disaster, Lamentations concludes with the bitter possibility that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22). Sufferers in the face of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, there is no guarantee that he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22\u201333).{{sfn|Clines|2003|pp=617\u2013618}}\n\n==Later interpretation and influence==\nThe Book of Lamentations is recited annually by Jews on Tisha b'Av (Ninth of Av), the anniversary of the destruction of both of the Jewish Temples.\n\nIn [[Western Christianity]], readings, chantings, and choral settings of the book are used in the [[Lent]]en religious service known as the [[Tenebrae (Maundy)|Tenebrae]] (Latin for ''darkness''). In the [[Church of England]], readings are used at [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] on the [[Holy Monday|Monday]] and [[Holy Tuesday|Tuesday]] of [[Holy Week]], and at Evening Prayer on [[Good Friday]].\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], the book's third chapter is chanted on the twelfth hour of the Good Friday service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Berlin\n|first                             = Adele\n|title                             = Lamentations: A Commentary\n|publisher                         = Westminster John Knox Press\n|year                              = 2004\n|url                               = https://books.google.com/?id=iTH9qth5cbEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Berlin+Lamentations\n|ref                               = harv\n|isbn                             = 9780664229740\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n|last                              = Clines\n|first                             = David J.A.\n|chapter                           = Lamentations\n|editor1-last                      = Dunn\n|editor1-first                     = James D.

Most scholars today accept the basic authenticity of the book, but see in it significant additions by a \"school\" of later followers of the original prophet. While the book exhibits considerable unity and probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet.{{sfn|Joyce|2009|p=16}}\n\nAccording to the book that bears his name, Ezekiel ben-Buzi was born into a priestly family of Jerusalem c.623&nbsp;BC, during the reign of the reforming king [[Josiah]]. Prior to this time, Judah had been a vassal of the [[Assyria]]n empire, but the rapid decline of Assyria after c. 630 led Josiah to assert his independence and institute a religious reform stressing loyalty to [[Yahweh]], the national God of Israel. Josiah was killed in 609 and Judah became a vassal of the new regional power, the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]]. In 597, following a rebellion against Babylon, Ezekiel was among the large group of Judeans taken into [[Babylonian captivity|captivity by the Babylonians]]. He appears to have spent the rest of his life in [[Mesopotamia]]. A further deportation of Jews from Jerusalem to Babylon occurred in 586 when a second unsuccessful rebellion resulted in the destruction of the city and its Temple and the exile of the remaining elements of the royal court, including the last scribes and priests. The various dates given in the book suggest that Ezekiel was 25 when he went into exile, 30 when he received his prophetic call, and 52 at the time of the last vision c.571.{{sfn|Drinkard|1995|pp=160\u201361}}\n\n=== Textual history ===\nThe Jewish scriptures were translated into Greek in the two centuries immediately before the birth of Christ. The Greek version of these books is called the [[Septuagint]]. The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the [[Masoretic text]] (meaning ''passing down'' after a Hebrew word ''Masorah''; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text). The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version \u2013 it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we have today (according to the masoretic tradition) \u2013 while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=130}}\n\n=== Critical history ===\nThe first half of the 20th century saw several attempts to deny the authorship and authenticity of the book, with scholars such as [[Charles Cutler Torrey|C.C. Torrey]] (1863\u20131956) and [[Morton Smith]] placing it variously in the 3rd century BC and in the 8th/7th. The pendulum swung back in the [[post-war period]], with an increasing acceptance of the book's essential unity and historical placement in the Exile. The most influential modern scholarly work on Ezekiel, [[Walther Zimmerli]]'s two-volume commentary, appeared in German in 1969 and in English in 1979 and 1983. Zimmerli traces the process by which Ezekiel's oracles were delivered orally and transformed into a written text by the prophet and his followers through a process of ongoing re-writing and re-interpretation. He isolates the oracles and speeches behind the present text, and traces Ezekiel's interaction with a mass of mythological, legendary and literary material as he developed his insights into Yahweh's purposes during the period of destruction and exile.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|pp=165\u201366}}\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:Yad Vashem Memorial to survivors by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Monument to [[Holocaust survivors]] at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]; the quote is Ezekiel 37:14]]\n\nAs a priest, Ezekiel is fundamentally concerned with the ''[[K-B-D|Kavod YHWH]]'', a technical phrase meaning the presence (shekhinah) of  [[YHWH]] (i.e., one of the [[Names of God in Judaism|Names of God]]) among the people, in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, and normally translated as \"glory of God\".{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=91}} In Ezekiel the phrase describes God mounted on his throne-chariot as he departs from the Temple in chapters 1\u201311 and returns to what Marvin Sweeney describes as a portrayal of \"the establishment of the new temple in Zion as YHWH returns to the temple, which then serves as the center for a new creation with the tribes of Israel arrayed around it\" in chapters 40\u201348.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=92}} The vision in chapters 1:4\u201328 reflects common mythological/Biblical themes and the imagery of the Temple: God appears in a cloud from the north \u2013 the north being the usual home of God/the gods in ancient mythology and Biblical literature \u2013 with four living creatures corresponding to the two [[cherubim]] above the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant and the two in the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Temple; the burning coals of fire between the creatures perhaps represents the fire on the sacrificial altar, and the famous \"wheel within a wheel\" may represent the rings by which the Levites carried the Ark, or the wheels of the cart.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=92}}\n\nEzekiel depicts the destruction of Jerusalem as a purificatory sacrifice upon the altar, made necessary by the \"abominations\" in the Temple (the presence of idols and the worship of the god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]]) described in chapter 8.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|pp=92\u201393}} The process of purification begins, God prepares to leave, and a priest lights the sacrificial fire to the city.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=93}} Nevertheless, the prophet announces that a small remnant will remain true to Yahweh in exile, and will return to the purified city.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=93}} The image of the valley of dry bones returning to life in chapter 37 signifies the restoration of the purified Israel.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=93}}\n\nPrevious prophets had used \"Israel\" to mean the northern kingdom and its tribes; when Ezekiel speaks of Israel he is addressing the deported remnant of Judah; at the same time, however, he can use this term to mean the glorious future destiny of a truly comprehensive \"Israel\".{{sfn|Goldingay|2003|p=624}} In sum, the book describes God's promise that the people of Israel will maintain their covenant with God when they are purified and receive a \"new heart\" (another of the book's images) which will enable them to observe God's commandments and live in the land in a proper relationship with Yahweh.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nThe theology of Ezekiel is notable for its contribution to the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God \u2013 each man would be held responsible only for his own sins. This is in marked contrast to the [[Deuteronomist]]ic writers, who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of [[retributive justice]] and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the [[Zadokite]]s over the [[Levite]]s (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the [[Holiness Code]] and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8\u201311, are the reasons God's [[Shekhinah]] left his city and his people.{{sfn|Kugler|Hartin|2009|p=261}}\n\n== Later interpretation and influence ==\n\n=== Second Temple and rabbinic Judaism (c. 515 BC\u2013500 AD) ===\n{{See also|Merkabah mysticism}}\nEzekiel's imagery provided much of the basis for the [[Second Temple]] mystical tradition in which the visionary ascended through the [[Seven Heavens]] in order to experience the presence of God and understand his actions and intentions.{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=88}} The book's literary influence can be seen in the later [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] writings of Daniel and Zechariah. He is specifically mentioned by Ben Sirah (a writer of the Hellenistic period who listed the \"great sages\" of Israel) and 4 Maccabees (1st century AD). In the 1st century AD the historian [[Josephus]] said that the prophet wrote two books: he may have had in mind the [[Apocryphon of Ezekiel]], a 1st-century BC text that expands on the doctrine of resurrection. Ezekiel appears only briefly in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], but his influence there was profound, most notably in the [[Temple Scroll]] with its temple plans, and the defence of the [[Zadok]]ite priesthood in the [[Damascus Document]].{{sfn|Block|1997|p=43}} There was apparently some question concerning the inclusion of Ezekiel in the canon of scripture, since it is frequently at odds with the [[Torah]] (the five \"Books of Moses\" which are foundational to Judaism).{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=88}}\n\n=== Christianity ===\nEzekiel is referenced more in the [[Book of Revelation]] than in any other New Testament writing.{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|p=165}} To take just two well-known passages, the famous [[Gog and Magog]] prophecy in Revelation 20:8 refers back to Ezekiel 38\u201339,{{sfn|Buitenwerf|2007|pp=165 ff}} and in Revelation 21\u201322, as in the closing visions of Ezekiel, the prophet is transported to a high mountain where a heavenly messenger measures the symmetrical new Jerusalem, complete with high walls and twelve gates, the dwelling-place of God where his people will enjoy a state of perfect well-being.{{sfn|Block|1998|p=502}} Apart from Revelation, however, where Ezekiel is a major source, there is very little allusion to the prophet in the New Testament; the reasons for this are  unclear, but it can be assumed that not every Christian or [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] community in the 1st century would have had a complete set of (Hebrew) scripture scrolls, and in any case Ezekiel was under suspicion of encouraging dangerous mystical speculation, as well as being sometimes obscure, incoherent, and pornographic.{{sfn|Muddiman|2007|p=137}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Secondtempleplan.jpg|The Visionary Ezekiel Temple plan drawn by the 19th-century French architect and Bible scholar [[Charles Chipiez]].\nFile:The Vision of The Valley of The Dry Bones.jpg|''The Vision of The Valley of The Dry Bones'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1866\nFile:Marten de Vos 001.jpg|''Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones'' by [[Maerten de Vos]], c. 1600\nFile:Quinten Massys Vision des Propheten Ezechiels.jpg|''Ezekiel's Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones'' by [[Quentin Metsys the Younger]], c. 1589\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Wikisource|Ezekiel (Bible)}}\n{{Commons category|Book of Ezekiel}}\n*[[Biblical numerology]]\n*[[Temple in Jerusalem]]\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Bandstra\n|first                      =Barry L\n|title                      =Reading the Old Testament: an introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n|publisher                  =Wadsworth\n|year                       =2004\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/books?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA489 \n|isbn                       =9780495391050\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Blenkinsopp|first=Joseph\n|title                      =A history of prophecy in Israel\n|publisher                  =Westminster John Knox Press\n|year                       =1996\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/?id=6P9YEd9lXeAC&pg=PA166 \n|isbn                       =9780664256395\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Blenkinsopp\n|first                      =Joseph\n|title                      =Ezekiel\n|publisher                  =Westminster John Knox\n|year                       =1990\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/?id=8Cneqfa8VJ0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=commentary+Ezekiel#v=onepage&q=commentary%20Ezekiel&f=false\n|isbn                       =9780664237554\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Block\n|first                      =Daniel I.\n|title                      =The Book of Ezekiel: chapters 1\u201324, Volume 1\n|publisher                  =Eerdmans\n|year                       =1997\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/books?id=0GF0EUpEAkEC&pg=PA606&lpg=PA606&dq=The+Book+of+Ezekiel:+chapters+1-24++By+Daniel+Isaac+Block#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn                       =9780802825353\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Block\n|first                      =Daniel I.\n|title                      =The Book of Ezekiel: chapters 25\u201348, Volume 2\n|publisher                  =Eerdmans\n|year                       =1998\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/books?id=uYemhagtCpgC&pg=PA478&lpg=PA478&dq=The+Book+of+Ezekiel:+chapters+25-48+Daniel+Isaac+Block#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn                       =9780802825360\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Brueggemann\n|first                      =Walter\n|title                      =Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes\n|publisher                  =Westminster John Knox\n|year                       =2002\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/books?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=theological+handbook+of+Old+Testament+themes#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn                       =9780664222314\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Buitenfwerf\n|first                      =Riuewerd\n|chapter                    =The Gog and Magog Tradition in Ezekiel 20:8\n|editor1-last               =De Jonge\n|editor1-first              =H.J.\n|editor2-last               =Tromp\n|editor2-first              =Johannes\n|title                      =The Book of Ezekiel and Its Influence\n|publisher                  =Ashgate Publishing\n|year                       =2007\n|url                        =https://books.google.com/?id=DAyzzK7COmoC&pg=PA139&dq=The+So-Called+Bridal+Bath#v=onepage&q=The%20So-Called%20Bridal%20Bath&f=false\n|isbn                       =9780754655831\n|ref                        =harvref\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last                       =Bullock\n|first                      =C.

Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.\n\nEnglish-language editions of the program are often referred to as \"BB\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706http:/www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706|title=Celebrity Big Brother|website=www.channel5.com}}</ref> Many Spanish-language editions of the program are called ''Gran Hermano'' (GH).\n\n== Premise ==\nAt regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endemol.com/programme/big-brother|title=Big Brother|publisher=''[[Endemol]]''|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for the nominee they wish to be evicted or saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.\n\nSome more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of ''Big Brother'' follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.\n\nThe contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Big Brother\"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Name ===\nThe term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell|George Orwell's]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]],'' with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance.<ref name=\"Nordicom 1\" /> The program also relies on other techniques, such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'', and the \"Diary Room\" (or \"Confession Room\") where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction.\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. In the first season of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, [[loft]] and other luxuries.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nThe format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones, and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.\n\nMost international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other: their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants usually are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the [[Big Brother (U.S. TV series)|US version]] adopted a different format during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. In 2011, the [[Big Brother (UK TV series)|UK version]] controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb13/features/0608/poll-big-brother-2012-housemates-discuss-nominations | title=POLL: Should housemates be able to talk nominations? | publisher=''BBSpy'' | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=23 May 2014 | author=Scott, Matt}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nFrom a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react{{citation needed|reason=Unclear whether any general conclusions can be made: as the environment is odd and created for entertainment, the reactions probably say little about how people react in normal situations.|date=March 2016}} when forced into close confinement with people outside of their [[comfort zone]] (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).\n\nThe show is notable for involving the [[Internet]]. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers),<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb110/issue110.pdf | title=Complaint by Ms Dawn Blake | author=Blake, Dawn | journal=[[Ofcom|Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin]] | date=27 May 2008 | issue=110 | type=PDF}}</ref> viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and [[Text messaging|SMS]]. The house is shown live on [[satellite television]], although in some countries there is a 10\u201315 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to having personal information broadcast) to be removed.\n\nContestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.\n\n=== Isolation ===\n''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the [[Bible]], [[Tanakh]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.\n\nContestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the \"Big Brother\" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.\n\n== Format changes and twists ==\n\n=== Regional versions ===\n[[File:Big brother countries.PNG|430px|thumbnail|alt=World map, with different shading for \"Big Brother\" versions|Locations of ''Big Brother'' versions:\n{{legend|blue|With individual franchises}}\n{{legend|#ADFF2F|Part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#568203|Part of ''Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique''; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|green|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother Africa''}}\n{{legend|#ADD8E6|Part of ''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633}}\n{{legend|pink|Part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|red|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico''}}\n{{legend|maroon|Part of ''Veliki brat''}}\n{{legend|#FEDF00|With individual franchises; Also part of ''Big Brother'' of Scandinavia}}]]\nDue to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All of these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: ''[[Big Brother (Albanian TV series)|Big Brother Albania]]'' of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]], ''[[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|Big Brother Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique]]'' of [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' of Africa (includes Angola, [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], Mozambique, [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Rwanda]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Big Brother: The Boss|''Big Brother:'' \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633]] of the Middle East (includes [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]]), ''[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Gran Hermano del Pac\u00edfico]]'' of South America (includes [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]), ''[[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Big Brother]]'' of Scandinavia (includes [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]) and ''[[Veliki brat 2011|Veliki brat]]'' of the Balkans (includes [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]). The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available; {{as of|2015|lc=yes}} the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show.\n\nOn the other hand, some countries have multiple franchises based on language.  India has the most regional based versions Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Malyalam language versions; Canada has French- and English-language versions; and the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.\n\n=== Twists involving single franchises ===\n\n==== Multiple areas and houses ====\nIn 2001, ''[[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 3|Big Brother 3]]'' of the Netherlands introduced the \"Rich and Poor\" concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|fourth season]]. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 5)|2010]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 6)|2011]], [[Big Brother Africa (season 7)|2012]] and [[Big Brother Africa (season 8)|2013]]), [[Big Brother (Albania)|Albania]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Australia]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|2003]] and [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|2013]]), [[Veliki Brat|Balkan States]] (in [[Veliki Brat VIP 4|VIP 2010]] and [[Veliki brat 2011|2011]]), [[Big Brother Brasil|Brazil]] (in [[Big Brother Brasil 9|2009]], [[Big Brother Brasil 10|2010]], [[Big Brother Brasil 11|2011]], [[Big Brother Brasil 13|2013]] and [[Big Brother Brasil 14|2014]]), [[Big Brother (Canada)|Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|2013]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother (Denmark)|Denmark]] (in [[Big Brother (Denmark)#Big Brother 3|2003]]), [[Big Brother (Finland)|Finland]] (in [[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|2009]] and [[Big Brother 2014 (Finland)|2014]]), [[France]] (in [[Secret Story 3 (France)|2009]], [[Secret Story 5 (France)|2011]]\u2013present), [[Big Brother Germany|Germany]] (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 4)|2003]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 5)|2004\u201305]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005\u201306]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 8)|2008]] and [[Big Brother Germany (Season 9)|2008\u201309]]), [[Big Brother (Greece)|Greece]] (in [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 3|2003]]), [[Bigg Boss|India]] (in [[Bigg Boss 6|2012]] and [[Bigg Boss 7|2013]]), [[HaAh HaGadol|Israel]] (in [[HaAh HaGadol 2|2009]]), [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] (in [[Grande Fratello Season 6|2006]] and [[Grande Fratello Season 7|2007]]), [[Big Brother Norway|Norway]] (in [[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 3 - Next Generation|2003]]), [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippines]] (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 3|Teen 2010]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|2011]]), [[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland]] (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 3|2002]]), [[Big Brother (Portugal)|Portugal]] (in [[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|VIP 2013]] and [[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|Slovakia]] (in [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|2005]]), [[Big Brother (Slovenia)|Slovenia]] (in [[Big Brother Slovenia Season 2|2008]], [[Big Brother 3 (Slovenia)|2015]] and [[Big Brother 4 (Slovenia)|2016]]), [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]] (in [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season one|2005]]), [[Big Brother (South Africa)|South Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|2014]]), [[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain]] (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 1)|VIP 2004]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 10)|2008]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 11)|2009\u201310]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 12)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (UK)|United Kingdom]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|2002]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity 2007]], [[Big Brother 9 (UK)|2008]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 11 (UK)|Celebrity 2013]] and [[Big Brother 17 (UK)|2016]]) and [[Big Brother (U.S.)|United States]] ([[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|2009]]\u2013present).\n\nIn 2011&ndash;12, the [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh Argentine series]] added ''La Casa de al Lado'' (\"The House Next Door\"), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).<ref>[[:es:Anexo:S\u00e9ptima temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)#Casa de al lado]]</ref>\n\nThe [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the \"Bubble\": a glass house in a [[shopping mall]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 11|eleventh season]], featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth season]], with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the [[Big Brother Brasil 14|fourteenth Brazilian season]], when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for [[International Women's Day]] and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|fourth English-Canadian season]], two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the house guests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.\n\n==== Evil Big Brother ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|fifth UK series]] introduced a villainous Big Brother with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[South America]],{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Scandinavia]],{{clarify|date=November 2017}} [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]] and [[Mexico]].\n\n==== Twin or triplet housemates ====\nIn 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|fifth US season]] introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for five weeks. This twist was reused in the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|seventeenth US season]] with an easier task of successfully changing places for five weeks without being ''evicted''.\n\nThis twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in [[Big Brother 5 (Australia)|2005]]), Germany (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005&ndash;06]]), Bulgaria (in [[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|2006]], [[Big Brother All Stars 2012 (Bulgaria)|2012]] and [[VIP Brother 9|VIP 2017]]), United Kingdom (in [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|2007]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 8 (UK)|Celebrity 2011]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 9 (UK)|Celebrity 2012]], [[Big Brother 14 (UK)|2013]], [[Big Brother 16 (UK)|2015]], [[Big Brother 17 (UK)|2016]] and [[Celebrity Big Brother 19 (UK)|Celebrity 2017]]), France (in [[Secret Story 2007 (France)|2007]], [[Secret Story 2011 (France)|2011]], [[Secret Story 7 (France)|2013]], [[Secret Story 9 (France)|2015]] and [[Secret Story 10 (France)|2016]]), Spain (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|2007]] and [[Gran Hermano 14 (Spain)|2013]]), Poland (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 4|2007]]), India (in [[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|2008]]), Africa (in [[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|2009]]), Balkan Region (in [[Veliki brat 2009|2009]] and [[Veliki Brat VIP 5|2013]]), Philippines (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4|Teen 2012]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|2014]]), Portugal (in [[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|2010]] and [[Secret Story 3 (Portugal)|2012]]), Israel (in [[HaAh HaGadol 3|2011]]), Ukraine (in [[Big Brother (Ukraine)|2011]]), Argentina (in [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|2011]] and [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 9)|2016]]) and Albania (in [[Big Brother 6 (Albania)|2013]]).\n\n==== Pairs competitions ====\nDuring the tenth week of the [[Big Brother 7 (UK)|seventh UK series]], the housemates were paired with their \"best friend\" in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. The [[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|ninth US season]] added a romantic theme by pairing up the housemates and having them compete as couples. In the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2|second celebrity edition]] of the Philippine version, two housemates related by profession or family played as one, while on their [[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7|seventh season]], {{clarify span|text = one housemate related by profession played as one.|explain = Related by profession to whom? And what does it mean for one person play as one?|date = April 2017}} The second season of the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|Philippine teen edition]] also featured the parents or guardians of the teens staying in the house; if a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent or guardian would also be evicted.  The [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|13th US season]] introduced Dynamic Duos, where contestants formed pairs that would be nominated together; the nominee not evicted would be immune from further nomination until the final 10 when pairs were dissolved. The [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 4 (2005)|fourth Greek season]] was dubbed \"Big Mother\", and featured nine housemates accompanied by their mothers. In the ninth season of Indian ''Big Brother'', \"Big Boss: Double Trouble\", contestants entered the house tied up in pairs by the waist. They had joint chairs, beds, spoons, and even mugs.The upcoming twelfth season of Indian Big Brother \"Bigg Boss\n12\"will  also feature pairs 'jodis' who can be mother-daughter,boss-employee,brother-sister etc. In the [[Big Brother 9 (Albania)|ninth Albania series]] all the housemates wherever were in couples and for the first time in the history of ''Big Brother'', the winner was a couple (Danjel Dedndreaj and Fotini Derxho).\n\n==== Secret missions ====\nSecret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the [[Big Brother 6 (UK)|sixth UK series]]. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from Big Brother with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of Big Brother have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from BB Canada) and Surly the Fish (from BB Australia).\n\nThe [[Big Brother 8 (U.S.)|eighth US season]] introduced \"America's Player\", where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|tenth US season]] for a week. The [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|eleventh US season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with [[unintended consequences]] for the house. The [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|twelfth US season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|sixteenth US season]] featured \"Team America\", in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.\n\nThe [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|fourth Argentine series]] added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear).  The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.<ref>[[:es:Anexo:Cuarta temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)#Cambios en el Juego]]</ref>\n\n==== Opening night twists ====\nSince ''[[Big Brother 2 (UK)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (UK)|UK series]] has opened with a twist. This has included having three finalists (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother 4 (UK)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother 9 (UK)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother 10 (UK)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother 11 (UK)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Pamela Anderson]] entering as a guest for 5 days ([[Big Brother 12 (UK)|Big Brother 12]]); first-night nominations and a public vote for a wildcard to become a housemate ([[Big Brother 13 (UK)|Big Brother 13]]); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants ([[Big Brother 14 (UK)|Big Brother 14]]); one contestant gets a pass to the final ([[Big Brother 15 (UK)|Big Brother 15]]); first night eviction ([[Big Brother 16 (UK)|Big Brother 16]]); two houses with \"the other house\" featuring enemies from the main house housemates past ([[Big Brother 17 (UK)|Big Brother 17]]); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife [[Brigitte Nielsen]] (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 3 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]''); a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]'') and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands - 3am & Mirror Online | publisher=''[[Daily Mirror]]'' | date=25 January 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Bryant, Tom}}</ref> with the last housemate becoming the Head of House (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 6 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'').\n\nA common opening twist is to only introduce cast of a single sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|eighth UK series]] first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the ([[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|fourth Bulgarian series]]), and an all-male premiere was used on ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|Big Brother Africa 4]]''.\n\n==== Fake evictions ====\nThe fifth UK series introduced fake evictions, where Big Brother misleads housemates that an eviction has taken place, only for the \"evicted\" housemate to reenter the house sometime later.\n\nIn the eighth UK series one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.\n\nIn the [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|fifth Philippine edition]], four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called ''bodega''.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|tenth Australian season]], Benjamin Zabel was fake-evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the [[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|eleventh Australian season]] Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother Brasil 13|thirteenth Brazilian series]], Anamara Barreira was fake-evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 16|sixteenth Brazilian series]], Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week. In the [[Big Brother Brasil 18|eighteen Brazilian series]], Gleici Damasceno was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 72 hours with immunity from eviction and with the power to put someone to eviction.\n\nIn the [[Big Brother T\u00fcrkiye|first Turkish series]], there is a fake eviction in week 10.\n\nThe Indian version ''[[Bigg Boss (franchise)|Bigg Boss]]'' sees frequent fake evictions.\n\n==== Coaches ====\n[[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|The fourteenth US season]] had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.\n\n==== Red button ====\nThe seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house.<ref>[[:es:Anexo:S\u00e9ptima temporada de Gran Hermano (Argentina)#Bot.C3.B3n rojo]]</ref> A red button is also used in ''[[Secret Story (France)|Secret Story]]'' series, however in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.\n\n==== Legacy rewards or penalties ====\nIn ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'', evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a \"ninja\" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the [[Big Brother 8 (Australia)|eighth Australian series]] introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.\n\n==== Most valuable player ====\nThe [[Big Brother 15 (U.S.)|fifteenth US season]] allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third house guest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household).  In a further twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.\n\n==== Multiple heads of household ====\nThe [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|sixteenth US season]] and [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|seventeenth US season]] featured two Heads of Household every week and had four house guests nominated for eviction. There was also a \"Battle of the Block\" competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It was also used on ''Big Brother Brasil 16'', ''Big Brother Brasil 17'' and ''Big Brother Brasil 18'' where the HOH's had to nominate one person and they had to choose between 10 thousand dollars or immunity.\n\n==== Multiple winners ====\nIn 2011, ''[[Big Brother Africa (season 6)]]'' was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting US$200,000. In 2015, the [[Pinoy Big Brother: 737|sixth Philippine season]], also had two winners; one from the teens and one from the regular adults. Each of which received PHP1,000,000.\n\n[[''Bigg Boss 8'']] (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions'. The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) as a spin off called ''Bigg Boss: Halla Bol'', where ex contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.\n\nIn 2016, on season 4 of ''[[Big Brother Canada]]'' brothers Nick and Phil Paquette won the season, playing together as one.\n\n==== Reserve house mates ====\nThe [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] introduced reserved housemates, short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. This was also done in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]] and Brazil's [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth season]].\n\n=== Twists involving multiple franchises ===\n\n==== Housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2002, the [[Big Brother M\u00e9xico|Mexican]] and Spanish editions ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 1|BBM1]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 3)|GH3]]) made temporary housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andr\u00e9s Barreiro for 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemate exchange was held by Spain and [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 11)|GH11]] and [[Grande Fratello (season 10)|GF10]]). Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from Spain were swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of Italy for 7 days.\n\nIn later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 3|GH3]]) and [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 4)|GH4]]), [[Ecuador]] ([[Gran Hermano (Ecuadorian TV series)|GH1]]) and [[Mexico]] ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother 2|BBM2]]), and [[Africa]] ([[Big Brother Africa (season 1)|BBA1]]) and [[United Kingdom]] ([[Big Brother 4 (UK)|BB4]]) in 2003; [[Scandinavia]] ([[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season two|BB2]]) and [[Thailand]] ([[Big Brother Thailand (season 2)|BBT2]]) in 2006; [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)|PBB2]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Slovenia)|BB1]]), and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 5|GH5]]) and [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) in 2007; [[Africa]] ([[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) and [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|BB4]]) in 2008; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|BB5]]) and [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2009; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2010 (Finland)|BB6]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother Slavnih|BBS1]]) in 2010; [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 12)|GH12]]) and [[Israel]] ([[HaAh HaGadol 3|HH3]]) in 2010&ndash;11; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2011 (Finland)|BB7]]) and [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 7|GH7]]) and [[Israel]] ([[HaAh HaGadol 4|HH4]]) in 2012; and [[Mexico]] ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BB4]]) and [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano 16 (Spain)|GH16]]) in 2015; [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 5)|GHVIP5]]) and [[Brazil]] ([[Big Brother Brasil 17|BBB17]]) in 2017.\n\n==== Evicted housemate exchanges ====\nIn 2003, [[Mexico]]'s Isabel Madow ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico#Big Brother VIP 2|BB VIP2]]) and Spain's A\u00edda N\u00edzar ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]]) were swapped for 7 days. This twist was also done between Russia ([[Big Brother (Russia)|BBR1]]) and Pacific (GHP1) in 2005, and Argentina ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) and [[Brazil]] ([[Big Brother Brasil 7|BBB7]]) in 2007.\n\n==== Other exchanges ====\nIn 2009, as part of the casting process for Italy's [[Grande Fratello Season 9|GF9]], Doroti Polito and Leonia Coccia visited Spain's [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 10)|GH10]].\n\nIn 2012, four contestants from Denmark's [[Big Brother 4 (Denmark)|BB4]] visited Sweden's [[Big Brother 2012 (Sweden)|BB6]] and competed in a Viking-themed challenge. The Danish team won and 'kidnapped' Swedish contestant Annica Englund to the Denmark house for the following week.\n\nIn 2012, evicted housemate Laisa Portella of Brazil (from [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) was a guest on Spain's ''[[Gran Hermano 13 (Spain)|Gran Hermano 13]]'' for a week; the following week, non-evicted Noem\u00ed Merino of GH13 stayed in the Brazilian Big Brother house for 5 days.\n\nIn 2016, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Nikki Graham]] and ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother Australia]]'' housemate Tim Dormer were voted in by Canada to be houseguests on the 4th season of ''[[Big Brother Canada]]''. Similarly, ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' housemate [[Jade Goody]] appeared as a housemate on [[Bigg Boss]] India.\n\n''Big Brother Australia'' (2015) contestant Priya Malik joined ''Bigg Boss 9'' (India) the same year as a wild card.\n\n==== Evicted housemate visits ====\nAnouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from the United Kingdom (housemate from [[Big Brother 4 (UK)|BB4]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|BB3]]) in 2003. In 2005, United Kingdom (Nadia Almada of [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|BB5]]) visited Australia ([[Big Brother 5 (Australia)|BB5]]) again. In 2006, United Kingdom ([[Chantelle Houghton]] of [[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|CBB4]]) visited Germany ([[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|BBG6]]). This twist was used in later years by other countries: Africa (Ricardo Ferreira of [[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|BBA3]]) visited Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 9|BBB9]]) in 2009; Germany (Annina Ucatis and Sascha Schwan of [[Big Brother Germany (season 9)|BBG9]]) visited the Philippines ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]), and Italy (George Leonard and Veronica Ciardi of [[Grande Fratello Season 10|GF10]]) visited Albania ([[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|BB3]]) in 2010; Sweden (Martin Granetoft and Peter OrrmyrSara Jonsson of [[Big Brother 2011 (Sweden)|BB5]]) visited Norway ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; Brazil (Rafael Cordeiro of [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) visited Spain ([[Gran Hermano 12 (Spain)|GH12]]), and Argentina (Agust\u00edn Belforte of [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) visited Colombia ([[Gran Hermano 2 (Colombia)|GH2]]) in 2012; United States (Dan Gheesling of [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|BB10]]/[[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|BB14]]) visited Canada ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]] and the [[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]] Jury) in 2013; Canada (Emmett Blois of [[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]]) visited South Africa ([[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|BBM3]]) in 2014; and Spain (Paula Gonzalez of [[Gran Hermano 15 (Spain)|GH 15]]) visited Mexico ([[Big Brother M\u00e9xico 2015 (Season 4)|BBM4]]) in 2015.\n\nA similar event took place between the United States and Canada in 2014 wherein [[Rachel Reilly]] (from [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|BB12]]/[[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|BB13]]) made a video chat to Canada ([[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]]). Rachel Reilly also appeared on ''Big Brother Canada''{{'}}s side show, which airs after the eviction episode.\n\n==== Housemates competing in another country ====\nThere were occasions that a former housemate from one franchise participated and competed in a different franchise: Daniela Martins of France (SS3) competed in Portugal (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of France (SS5) competed in Italy (GF12); [[Brigitte Nielsen]] of Denmark (BB VIP) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB3); [[Jade Goody]] of the United Kingdom (BB3, BB Panto, and CBB5) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 2|BB2]]); Sava Radovi\u0107 of Germany (BB4) competed in the [[Balkan States]] (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the Balkan States (VB4) competed in Bulgaria (BB All-Stars 1); \u017darko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); \u017deljko Stojanovi\u0107 of France ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the Balkan States ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); Kelly Baron of Brazil ([[Big Brother Brasil 13|BBB13]]) competed in Portugal ([[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|BB VIP]]); [[Lucy Diakovska]] of Bulgaria ([[VIP Brother 4|VIP B4]]) competed in Germany ([[Promi Big Brother (season 1)|PBB1]]); Leila Ben Khalifa of Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 6)|GF6]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 8 (France)|SS8]]); Priya Malik of Australia ([[Big Brother 11 (Australia)|BB11]]) competed in India ([[Bigg Boss 9|BB9]]); Tim Dormer of Australia ([[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|BB10]]) and [[Nikki Grahame]] of the United Kingdom ([[Big Brother 7 (UK)|BB7]], [[Ultimate Big Brother|UBB]]) competed in Canada ([[Big Brother Canada (season 4)|BB4]]); Leonel Estevao-Luto of Africa ([[Big Brother Africa (season 4)|BB4]]) competed in Angola & Mozambique ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); [[Frankie Grande]] of the United States ([[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|BB16]]) competed in the United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother 18 (UK)|CBB18]]); Fanny Rodrigues of Portugal ([[Secret Story 2 (Portugal)|SS2]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 10 (France)|SS10]]); and Tucha Anita of Angola ([[Big Brother Angola & Mozambique|BB3]]); Amor Romeira of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) competed in Portugal ([[Secret Story 6 (Portugal)|SS6]]) and Alain Rochette of Spain ([[Gran Hermano 17 (Spain)|GH17]]) competed in France ([[Secret Story 11 (France)|SS11]]); Despite being American Brandi Glanville competed first in United Kingdom ([[Celebrity Big Brother 20 (UK)|CBB20]]) then later competed in first Celebrity series in the United States ([[Celebrity Big Brother (U.S.)|CBBUS]]); A\u00edda Nizar of Spain ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]] and [[Gran Hermano VIP 5|GHVIP5]]) competed in Italy ([[Grande Fratello (season 15)|GF15]]),\n\n=== Multiple-franchise competitions ===\n\n==== Eurovision Song Contest ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Team and Song\n! colspan=\"4\" | Jury's points\n! colspan=\"5\" | Dates\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Winner\n|-\n! {{flagicon|Italy}} GF11\n! {{flagicon|Greece}} BB5\n! {{flagicon|Argentina}} GH6\n!

The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.\n\n==== Variations ====\nThe 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.\n\nAnother variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]]''. Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers \"Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary\" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was \u00a350,000.<ref name=\"celebhijack\">{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 | title=BB Celebrity Hijack - NEWS | publisher=''[[Channel 4]]'' | access-date=24 May 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621073443/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 | archivedate=21 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[VIP Brother 3|VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria]]'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. Nine out of ten seasons of ''[[Bigg Boss]]'' (the Indian version of ''Big Brother'') have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of ''Big Boss'' had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.\n\n=== US and English-Canadian formats ===\n{{Details|topic=these Big Brother versions|Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother Canada}} \nThe US and Canadian versions of ''Big Brother'' differ from most global versions of the series. The US series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format\u2014i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the US, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the [[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|second season]], with HouseGuests encouraged to openly strategize and form alliances to survive eviction, with evictions being determined by the HouseGuests themselves.\n\nIn this format, HouseGuests vote each other out and choose the winner. Each week, one HouseGuest is chosen (usually by competition) as the Head of Household (HoH), who sleeps in a luxurious bedroom and nominates two fellow HouseGuests for eviction in a formal Nomination Ceremony. HoH also chooses Haves, who enjoy luxury foods and other special privileges, and Have-Nots, who must eat \"slop\" (a fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds, and take cold showers. Before the sixteenth US season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on ''Big Brother UK'' and other international editions.\n\nThe winner of the Power of Veto (PoV), introduced in the third US season, has the option to save one nominee (including him/herself) from eviction, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest in the former nominee's place. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees. When only two contestants remain, a jury formed of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) votes which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) US season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house.\n\nIn 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel [[Slice (TV channel)|Slice]]; the series moved to [[Global TV]] for its third (2015) season. The show followed the US format, but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, \"Marsha the Moose\"; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. The [[Big Brother (Quebecer TV series)|French Canadian version]] mostly followed the US/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.\n\n''[[Big Brother Brasil]]'' combines the US/Canada and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Haves/Have-Nots. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. Power of Immunity is similar to the US/Canada PoV, with the winner getting to choose not only someone to \"take off the block\" but also someone to punish.\n\nThe pilot for ''[[Big Brother China: Pilot Season|Big Brother China]]'', which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/cbb16/news/1121/big-brother-china-pilot-season-premieres-online-youku-tudou-housemates-lets-stay-together-india-house-bigg-boss|title=Big Brother China launches with twelve-day \u2018pilot series\u2019|first=|last=bbspy|publisher=}}</ref> The same format was used for ''[[Big Brother: Over the Top]]'', an online-only spinoff of the US series that ran in 2016.\n\n=== Other editions ===\nThe ''Big Brother'' format has been otherwise modified in some countries:\n* ''Big Brother: All-Stars'' (Belgium, 21 days; [[Bulgaria]]: Season 1\u20135, 27\u201329 days; United States, 72 days; United Kingdom, 18 days; [[Loft Story (Canadian TV series)#Season 6|French Canada]], 64 days; [[Africa]], 91 days; Spain, 56 days; [[Portugal]] ''Secret Story'': Season 1\u20134, 22\u201350 days): Previous housemates from previous seasons compete.

Portugal was the first country to complete 4 All-Stars seasons (2015). Portugal was the first country to complete 5 All-Stars seasons (2017). Portugal was the first country to complete 6 All-Stars seasons (2018).\n* ''Big Brother: Reality All-Stars'' ([[Sweden]], 6 days; [[Denmark]], 32 days; Spain, 56 days): Contestants from different reality shows, including ''Big Brother'', compete.\n* ''Big Brother: You Decide / Big Brother: Back in the House / Big Brother: Try Out'' ([[Poland]]: Season 1\u20132, 7\u201313 days; [[Norway]], 9 days; [[Serbia]], 7 days): Housemates, new or old, compete for a spot in the next regular season without nominations or evictions.\n* ''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment|Teen Big Brother]]'' (United Kingdom, 10 days; [[Philippines]]: Season 1\u20134, 42\u201391 days): Teenagers 13 and older compete.\n* ''[[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|Big Brother: All In]]'' (Philippines: Season 11,13): A mix of teenagers, regular adults, and celebrities compete in one season. A variation, [[Pinoy Big Brother: Lucky 7|Big Brother: Lucky 7]], has three batch of housemates stay inside until a number for each batch is left, and is joined by other members of other batches to form one new batch.\n* ''[[Secret Story (disambiguation)#Television|Secret Story]]'' (France, [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]], [[Peru]] and [[Albania]]): Each housemate has a secret.\n* ''[[Big Brother Panto (UK)|Big Brother Panto]]'' (United Kingdom, 11 days): Housemates from previous series spent time in the Big Brother House to perform a [[pantomime]] at the series' end.\n* ''[[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|Big Brother &ndash; The Village]]'' (Germany: Season 6, 363 days): The village had a class system of bosses, assistants and servants, living in separate houses, who competed in mixed teams; winning bosses could promote employees, while losing bosses became servants.  Cash prizes were awarded weekly in an ongoing contest.\n* ''[[Big Brother Family]]'' (Bulgaria: 81 days): Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment.\n\nThere are also \"test runs\", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in [[Argentina]], Bulgaria, the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the US edition, it is used as a promotional tool.\n\n== Versions ==\nAs of 10 September 2018, ''Big Brother'' has produced 426 winners in

Founded in 1894, they have played their home games at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] since 1904.\n\nInitially contesting games in the Southern League, the club has spent most of its history in the second and third tiers of English football. They have spent eight seasons in the top flight, finishing second in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1906-07, their highest finish to date. Bristol City have won the [[Football League Second Division]] once, the [[Football League Third Division]] once, the [[Football League Third Division South]] once, the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] once, and a record three [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophys]]. They were [[FA Cup]] runners-up once and, despite being an English team, have also won the [[Welsh Cup]].\n\nThe club's home colours are red and white, and their nickname is The Robins - a [[European robin|robin]] featured on the club's badge from 1976 to 1994. The team's main rivals are [[Bristol Rovers]], with whom they contest the [[Bristol derby]], and [[Cardiff City]], with whom they contest the [[Severnside derby]].\n\nBristol City's current manager is [[Lee Johnson (footballer)|Lee Johnson]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|section=y|\n{{very long|section|date=July 2013}}\n{{Recentism|section|date=July 2013}}\n}}\n\n===Early years and early successes (1894\u20131911)===\nThe club was founded in 1894 as Bristol South End and changed their name to Bristol City on adopting professionalism three years later when they were admitted into the Southern League. Finishing as runners-up in three of the first four seasons, in 1900 the club amalgamated with local Southern League rivals [[Bedminster F.C.]], who had been founded as Southville in 1887. City joined the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1901 when they became only the third club south of Birmingham (following in the footsteps of [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]]) to perform in the competition. Their first game in the Football League was on 7 September 1901 at [[Bloomfield Road]], when [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] were beaten 2\u20130.<ref>Calley, Roy (1992). ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992'', Breedon Books Sport</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote=A scheme has been informally approved by the parties interested for the amalgamation of the Bristol City and Bedminster Association Football Clubs. The leading conditions are that the name and colours of Bristol City shall be retained, that matches shall be played alternately on the ground of each club for one season, and that five directors shall be nominated by each club.

Nicknamed the Bristol Babe at this time, they finished as runners-up in their inaugural First Division campaign (1906\u201307) as the only southern club to finish in the top two prior to World War I. Three years later they won through to their only FA Cup Final, though they were somewhat fortunate that a last gasp spot-kick saved them from defeat in the semi-final versus Derby County at Stamford Bridge. Unfortunately, there was no such similar award to help them in the Final at the Crystal Palace (now the National Sports Centre) as Manchester United took the honours 1\u20130. After a five-season stay in the top flight, despite winning 1\u20130 at Newcastle at the start of the 1910\u201311 campaign, failure to beat Everton in the season's finale brought City's first ever taste of relegation and it was to be 65 years before top flight status would be regained.<ref>Bristol City The Early Years 1894\u20131915 by David Woods published by Desert Island Books 2004; The Bristol Babe by David Woods published by Yore Publications 1994; Bristol City The Complete Record 1894\u20131987 by David Woods with Andrew Crabtree published by Breedon Books 1987; David Woods the Official Bristol City Club Historian.</ref>\n\n===10-year stay in the Second Division (1912\u201322)===\nBristol City would then go on to stay in Division 2 until 3 years after the First World War had ended, and in that time they reached the Semi-finals of the [[1919\u201320 FA Cup]] before being beaten 2-1 by [[Huddersfield Town F.C.]] and finished third in the Second Division in the [[1920\u201321 Football League|1920-21 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/eng-fa-cup-1919-1920-halbfinale/0/|title=FA Cup 1919/1920 - Semi-finals|website=worldfootball.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://melaman2.com/premierleague/championship/1920-21_english-football-league.html|title=Millennium 1920-21 English Football League Season & Lower Division Tables|first=Michael|last=Appert|website=melaman2.com}}</ref> However, in the next season they were relegated to the 3rd Division South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://melaman2.com/premierleague/championship/1921-22_english-football-league.html|title=Millennium 1921-22 English Football League Season & Lower Division Tables|first=Michael|last=Appert|website=melaman2.com}}</ref>\n\n===The yo-yo era (1922\u201365)===\n[[File:BristolCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Bristol City in the Football League.]]\n\nThe 1920s were a rocky time as City bounced between the Second Division and the Southern Section of the Third Division. The season after City were relegated, they achieved promotion back to the Second Division, before being relegated back to the Southern Section of the Third Division again the following season. After successive high finishes in the league, they were promoted again in 1926-27. However, by the 1930s they had slumped into the lower division and stayed that way until over 10 years after the Second World War. During this stay in the Third Division South, they won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1934, beating Tranmere Rovers in the final. However, in the same year they also suffered their biggest ever league defeat, a 9-0 loss to [[Coventry City F.C.]] The 1937-38 season was the most successful season for City since they were relegated to the Third Division, coming 2nd in the league and reaching the final of the [[Football League Third Division South Cup|Third Division South Cup]], before losing 6-2 to Reading on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bcfc.co.uk/fanzone/club-history/potted-history/|title=Club Legends|website=Bristol City}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fchd.info/cups/div3scupsummary.htm|title=Football Club History Database - Football League Division Three South Cup Summary|website=fchd.info}}</ref> They then came 8th in the Third Division South in the final full season before the war, in which the Grandstand of Ashton Gate was destroyed by a German air raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/nov/10/blitz-football-grounds-bomb-damage|title=Memories of the Blitz bombers and a damaging time for sport - Frank Keating|first=Frank|last=Keating|date=10 November 2010|website=the Guardian}}</ref> In 1946-47, City recorded a record league win by beating [[Aldershot F.C.]] 9-0, although despite [[Don Clark (footballer)|Don Clark]] scoring 36 goals in the League, City failed to get promoted that season.  [[Harry Dolman]] became chairman in 1949, a post he would hold for over 30 years. An engineer who had bought out the firm he worked for, he designed the first set of floodlights installed at Ashton Gate in the early 1950s. The late 1950s were a better time for City, with a five-year stay in the Second Division, a league they returned to for a further spell in 1965.\n\n===Back among the elite (1966\u201380)===\nIn 1967, [[Alan Dicks]] was appointed manager, and things gradually began to improve, with promotion to the First Division in 1976, ending a 65-year exile from the top flight.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1981 City were regular participants in the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]], winning the trophy in 1977\u201378, beating Hibernian in the semi-finals, and winning 3\u20132 on aggregate in the final against St Mirren (managed at the time by a relatively new manager, Alex Ferguson). St Mirren had their revenge two seasons later, with an aggregate 5\u20131 victory over City to become the only Scottish team to win the trophy.\n\nCity's second stint in the top flight was less successful than the club's first, with thirteenth position in 1979 being their highest finish during this era. Stars of this era included [[Peter Cormack]], [[Geoff Merrick]], [[Tom Ritchie]], [[Clive Whitehead]], [[Gerry Gow]], [[Trevor Tainton]] and [[Jimmy Mann (footballer)|Jimmy Mann]].\n\n===Decline and financial ruin (1980\u201382)===\nIn 1980, the City team went back to the Second Division in the first of three relegations, their debt mounted and their financial losses increased, with two successive relegations following. Thus, in 1982, they fell into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], and were declared bankrupt. A new club was formed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bcfc.co.uk/fanzone/club-history/potted-history/|title=Club Legends|website=Bristol City|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> and BCFC (1982) Ltd acquired the club's player contracts. The highly paid senior players Julian Marshall, [[Chris Garland]], [[Jimmy Mann (footballer)|Jimmy Mann]], [[Peter Aitken]], [[Geoff Merrick]], [[David Rodgers]], [[Gerry Sweeney]] and [[Trevor Tainton]], who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due. The club's previous owners has failed to pay its debts to many local businesses which left the new owners difficulty in obtaining credit because of bad feeling toward the club.\n\n===Revival (1982\u201390)===\nCity spent two seasons in the Fourth Division before winning promotion under [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] in 1984. They consolidated themselves in the Third Division during the latter part of the 1980s, and in 1990 Cooper's successor [[Joe Jordan (footballer)|Joe Jordan]] achieved promotion as Third Division runners-up to local rivals Bristol Rovers.\n\nThere was a tragedy for the club, however, in that promotion campaign. In March 1990, two months before the club sealed promotion, striker [[Dean Horrix]] was killed in a car crash barely two weeks after joining the club, and having played three league games for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royals.org/deano.html|title=Hob Nob Anyone? \u2013 Reading FC \u2013 The Royals \u2013 Articles|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Second tier (1990\u201395)===\nJordan moved to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] in September 1990, and his successor [[Jimmy Lumsden]] remained in charge for 18 months before making way for [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]]. Smith's first signing was the 20-year-old [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] striker [[Andy Cole]], who was an instant hit with fans. He was sold to Newcastle United in February 1993 and later established himself as a world class goalscorer, most prominently with Manchester United, where he collected five [[Premier League]] titles, two [[FA Cup]]s and the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].\n\nMeanwhile, City remained in the new [[Football League First Division|Division One]] (no longer the Second Division after the creation of the Premier League in 1992) and Smith moved to [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in November 1993. His successor [[Russell Osman]] was sacked within a year, being an unpopular figure with fans. One of Osman's few successful moments with City came in January 1994 when he led them to a shock 1\u20130 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] in a third round replay in the FA Cup, a result that would cause the Liverpool manager at the time, [[Graeme Souness]], to resign.\n\nJoe Jordan was brought back to [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]] in September 1994, but was unable to prevent relegation to Division Two.\n\n===Promotion and relegation (1995\u20132000)===\nJordan remained at the helm for two seasons after City's relegation, but left in March 1997 after failing to get them back into Division One. Former Bristol Rovers manager [[John Ward (footballer, born 1951)|John Ward]] took over, and achieved promotion in 1998 as Division Two runners-up. But City struggled back in Division One, and Ward stepped down in October 1998 to be succeeded by [[Benny Lennartsson]], their first non-British manager. City were relegated in bottom place and Lennartsson was dismissed in favour of [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]'s [[Tony Pulis]], who lasted six months before leaving to take over at Portsmouth. During his time at Ashton Gate he was manager of perhaps the worst City side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost 20 years earlier.\n\nCoach Tony Fawthrop took over until the end of the season, when [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] was appointed. Wilson was arguably the most prominent manager to take charge of a City side since [[Denis Smith (footballer, born 1947)|Denis Smith]], as he had guided [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] to promotion to the Premier League in 1997 and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] to a 12th-place finish in 1999.\n\n===Stuck in the Third Tier (2000\u201305)===\nThe early 2000s were a frustrating time for Bristol City. They were regular Division Two playoff contenders during Wilson's spell as manager. They just missed out on the playoffs in 2002, finishing 7th. The following year, Wilson almost took them to automatic promotion, finishing 3rd and winning the [[Football League Trophy]] in Cardiff in 2003. The taste of the play-offs was bitter though, losing to rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-final. In his final year&nbsp;\u2013 2004&nbsp;\u2013 they finished in 3rd place again, and this time they reached the playoff final, but lost to [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]]. He was sacked within days and replaced by veteran player [[Brian Tinnion]].\n\nCity just failed to make the playoffs in [[2004\u201305 in English football|Tinnion's first season]] as manager, finishing seventh, and he stepped down in September 2005 after a poor start to the season. City's form had slumped despite the addition of high-profile players, including [[Marcus Stewart]] and [[Michael Bridges]]. [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] manager [[Gary Johnson (footballer, born 1955)|Gary Johnson]] was recruited as his successor.\n\n===Gary Johnson (2005&nbsp;\u2013 2010)===\n[[File:Ashton Gate invasion.jpg|thumb|Pitch invasion at [[Ashton Gate stadium|Ashton Gate]] after securing promotion in 2007]]\nJohnson arrived in September 2005, making the move from Yeovil Town, with whom he had gained two promotions. Initial results were poor, but Johnson was soon able to recover the season and finish in a comfortable 9th place.\n\nIn the [[2006-07 Football League One|2006\u201307 season]], Bristol City finally achieved the elusive promotion that had evaded them in their 8 years in the third tier. Promotion to the Championship was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 3\u20131 win against already relegated [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]], securing the runners-up place in the division and resulting in automatic promotion and joyous scenes of celebration.\n\nAfter a good start in the Championship, City established themselves as real contenders, sitting in 3rd place at Christmas. By the start of March, City were top of the Championship, making an improbable 2nd successive promotion a possibility. However, a poor run ended City's chances of an automatic promotion place but qualified for the play-offs with a 4th place finish, their highest finish since 1980. City overcame [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] 4\u20132 on aggregate to progress to the play-off final at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]], where they were beaten 1\u20130 by [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].\n\nAfter a poor start in the first half of the 2008\u201309 season, City recovered after Christmas, peaking at 4th place in late February. After a lot of draws, the season eventually petered out and City finished the season in tenth place. The [[2009\u201310 in English football|2009\u201310 season]] saw some good results in the autumn, but heavy defeats by local rivals [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (0\u20136) and [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] (2\u20135) in early 2010 led to much dissatisfaction amongst fans,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/bristolcity/news/Race-Bristol-City-Gary-Johnson-s-successor/article-1923578-detail/article.html|title=Race is on to find Bristol City Gary Johnson's successor|work=Bristol Evening Post|location=Bristol|publisher=Bristol News and Media|date=18 March 2010|last=Staff writer|accessdate=18 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505092648/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/bristolcity/news/Race-Bristol-City-Gary-Johnson-s-successor/article-1923578-detail/article.html|archivedate=5 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and Johnson left the club on 18 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1997573,00.html\n|title= Gary Johnson Leaves City\n|work= Bristol City F.C.\n|date= 18 March 2010\n|accessdate= 18 March 2010\n|deadurl= yes\n|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20100322190221/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~1997573,00.html\n|archivedate= 22 March 2010\n|df= dmy-all\n}}</ref> Assistant manager [[Keith Millen]] took charge as caretaker manager, and led a series of good results, resulting in a second successive tenth place finish.\n\n===Succession of managers and steady decline (2010\u20132013)===\n[[Steve Coppell]] became manager in 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~2031194,00.html|title=Coppell New City Boss|publisher=Bristol City FC|accessdate=22 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426010334/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10327~2031194%2C00.html|archivedate=26 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but resigned after just two matches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/8908308.stm|title= Steve Coppell quits as Bristol City manager|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=12 August 2010|accessdate=14 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-Coppel-Resign\">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/8908308.stm |title= Steve Coppell quits as Bristol City manager\n |work=BBC Sport  |publisher=BBC  |last=Staff |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Longtime assistant manager [[Keith Millen]] was announced as Coppell' successor<ref name=\"BBC-Coppel-Resign\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10327~2119553,00.html |title=Keith Millen Appointed City Boss |work=Bristol City Football Club |accessdate=12 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324015413/http://www.bcfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10327~2119553%2C00.html |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and City laboured to a 15th place finish in [[2010-11 Football League Championship|2010\u201311]].

This steady decline would continue and after a poor start to the 2012\u201313 season, McInnes was sacked in January 2013 with City bottom of the Championship.

When he joined, the club were bottom of League One. Cotterill guided the club to safety and finished the season 12th. Had the season started when Steve Cotterill joined the club, Bristol City would have finished 5th, showing the scale of the turnaround.\n\nBristol City were promoted back to Championship for [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|2015\u201316 season]] after securing the [[2014\u201315 Football League One]] title, their first league title since [[1954\u201355 Football League|1955]]. In their last home game, against Walsall, they finished the season in style, winning 8\u20132. Bristol City finished the season with 99 points, the most points in a single season in the club's history, and only 5 losses. In the same season, they also won the [[2014-15 Football League Trophy|2015 Johnstone's Paint Trophy]] after a win over Walsall, which finished 2\u20130 and their third league trophy, a record held by the club for having the most wins in that competition.\n\nDespite huge success in the previous season, the club struggled on their return to the second tier. Steve Cotterill was relieved of his duties in January 2016 after a poor run of form which had seen Bristol City slip to 22nd in the Championship table. [[Lee Johnson (footballer)|Lee Johnson]], former player and son of former manager, [[Gary Johnson (footballer, born 1955)|Gary Johnson]], was appointed as Bristol City's new head coach on 6 February 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/news/article/lee-johnson-appointed-new-head-coach-2941479.aspx|title=BCFC.co.uk: Lee Johnson Appointed New Head Coach|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Bristol City eventually finished in 18th-place.\n\nBristol City started the [[2016\u201317 EFL Championship|2016\u201317 season]] well, and after 11 games they were 5th in the league table,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37458625|title=Bristol City 2-1 Nottingham Forest|date=1 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and City also appeared in the Last 16 of the [[League Cup]] for the first time since the 1988\u201389 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37686652|title=Bristol City 1-2 Hull City|date=25 October 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> However, a sharp downturn in fortunes followed over the winter, and City were only just able to accumulate enough points to ensure survival at the end of the season.\n\nLee Johnson remained at the helm for the following season, again making a good early start. At the midpoint of the season, after 24 league games, they sat 2nd in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], whilst also knocking out [[Premier League]] opposition in [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Stoke

Since then, it has become an often used chant at [[Ashton Gate stadium]] by the fans, and City manager Gary Johnson has even joined in with the bouncing himself.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article2261840.ece|title=Reading 0 Bristol C 2|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=News Group Newspapers|last=Dillon|first=Andrew|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=20 January 2010}}</ref>\nIt was also sometimes used by supporters of Gary Johnson's former side [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], primarily at away matches.\nWhen Gary Johnson's son, [[Lee Johnson (footballer)|Lee Johnson]] returned to his former club in 2016 as their new manager, he stated that he wished to inherit the chant and keep the fans singing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcfc.co.uk/news/article/lets-get-the-gate-bouncing-johnson-2945705.aspx|title=Let's get the Gate bouncing \u2013 Johnson|first=Adam|last=Baker|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{Further|Bristol derby|Severnside derby}}\n\nBristol City's traditional rivals are [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]. The clubs have met 105 times, with the first meeting in 1897. Bristol City have the most wins on 43. However, the clubs have not been in the same league for a number of years; they were last in the same division in the [[2000\u201301 Football League|2000\u201301 Season]]. Since then, they have only met three times; in the two-legged southern final of the 2006\u201307 [[Football League Trophy]], which Rovers won 1\u20130 on aggregate, and in the first round of the 2013\u201314 Johnstone's Paint Trophy, which City won 2\u20131 at Ashton Gate.\n\nCity's other main rivals are [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], who play in nearby [[Cardiff]]. Despite being a local derby, it crosses the [[Wales-England border]], making it one of the few international club derbies in the United Kingdom. The two clubs have been at similar levels in recent years, being in the same division for 10 of the last 16 seasons. This has meant frequent meetings in the league including in the semi-finals of the [[Football League One play-offs#2003|2003 Second Division play-offs]].\n\nOther clubs have been seen as 'third rivals' by the fans and media. [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] are seen by many as rivals, nicknamed 'Swindle' by City fans. This rivalry was most recently relevant in the [[2014-15 Football League One|2014\u201315 Season]], when the two clubs were rivals for promotion to the Championship. [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] have also previously been considered rivals despite a distance of over 100 miles. The rivalry was especially relevant in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] when the two clubs were the highest ranking [[West Country]] clubs for a number of years, and meetings were seen as a decider of the 'Best in the West'. [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and even [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] have previously been mentioned as rivals, but very rarely.\n\n==Shirt sponsors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to distribute vaccines as well\u201d and \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to track viruses\u201d.

The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how \u201cbiological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse\u201d. Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places.

He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/biological-threats/19645-rands-gerstein-u-s-needs-biodefense-strategy-protect-terror-threats/|title=RAND\u2019s Gerstein: U.S. needs biodefense strategy to protect against terror threats|last=Rozens|first=Tracy|date=2016-09-02|website=Homeland Preparedness News|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nGerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014.

Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).\n\nData which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, [[electronic health record]] systems, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by [[ranching]] and [[feedlot]] operations, food processors, [[drinking water]] systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.<ref name=\"WangerMAvailabilityAndComparativeValueOfData\" /> Intuitively, one would expect systems which collect more than one type of data to be more useful than systems which collect only one type of information (such as single-purpose laboratory or 911 call-center based systems), and be less prone to [[false alarms]], and this appears to be the case.\n\nIn [[Europe]], disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency.

This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene]] (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department\u2014based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address\u2014and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily.<ref>Chen, H, D Zeng, and Y Pan. \"Infectious Disease Informatics: Syndromic Surveillance for Public Health and Bio-Defense.\" 20120, XXII, 209p. 68 illus.., Hardcover.</ref> This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.\n\n==Response to bioterrorism incident or threat==\n{{Globalize/US|section|date=June 2012}}\nGovernment agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials/decontamination units and emergency medical units, if they exist.\n\nThe US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[Chemical Biological Incident Response Force]] and the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[20th Support Command (CBRNE)]], which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and [[decontamination|decontaminate]] victims exposed to bioterror agents.

The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed [[radar]] signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, their relatively short detection range allowed most aircraft to fly undetected, especially at night.<ref>Rao, G.A. and S.P. Mahulikar. \"Integrated review of stealth technology and its role in airpower\". ''Aeronautical Journal'', v. 106 (1066), 2002, pp. 629\u2013641.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, [[DARPA]] requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest [[radar cross-section]] of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars.<ref>Crickmore and Crickmore 2003, p. 9.</ref> Initially, [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]] were selected for further development. [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] had experience in this field due to developing the [[Lockheed A-12]] and [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]], which included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in [[Radar-absorbent material|radar-absorbing paint]]. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a \"faceted\" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with \"the hopeless diamond\", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.<ref>[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm \"Stealth Aircraft.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721035221/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/Stealth_aircraft/Tech31.htm |date=21 July 2011}} ''U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission'', 2003. Retrieved: 5 November 2012.</ref>\n\nPlans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed (XST) project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing.  Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the [[Have Blue]] program and eventually the [[F-117]] stealth attack aircraft.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffin|Kinnu|2007|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>  Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the [[Tacit Blue]] in development in 1979 at [[Area 51]].  It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), [[fly-by-wire]], curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence (ELINT), and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental (BSAX).  \"The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber\".<ref>[the integrator, Northrop Grumman (newspaper), Volume 8, No. 12, June 30, 2006, page 8 article author: Carol Ilten].</ref>\n\n===ATB program===\nBy 1976, these programs had progressed to a position in which a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter became aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled.<ref>{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=7}}</ref> Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts.

They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the [[capybara]]). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6\u201312 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.<ref name=\"MotW5\">Nowak, Ronald M. 1991. pp. 364\u2013367. ''Walker's Mammals of the World'' Fifth Edition, vol. I. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.</ref>\n\n==General==\nBeavers, along with [[Geomyidae|pocket gophers]] and [[Heteromyidae|kangaroo rats]], are [[Castorimorpha|castorimorph]] rodents, a suborder of rodents mostly restricted to North America. Although just two closely related species exist today, beavers have a long fossil history in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in the [[Eocene]], and many species of giant beaver existed until quite recently, such as ''[[Trogontherium]]'' in Europe, and ''[[Castoroides]]'' in North America.\n\nBeavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as \"lodges\") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials that are difficult to haul over land.<ref name=Salvesen>{{cite journal|last1=Salvesen|first1=Sigvald|title=The Beaver in Norway |date=May 1928|pages=99\u2013104 |doi=10.2307/1373424|volume=9|journal=Journal of Mammalogy}}<!--|accessdate=2 April 2015--></ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animaltrial.com/beaver/beaverdamandcanals.html|title=Beaver Dams and Canals|publisher=animaltrail|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.\n\n[[File:Beaverbones.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A beaver skeleton]]\n\n[[File:Beaver skeleton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A beaver skeleton]]\n\nThey are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.\n\nBeavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.\n\nBeavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch.

[[Cognate]]s in other [[Germanic languages]] include the [[Old Saxon]] ''bibar'', the [[Old Norse]] ''bjorr'', the [[Middle Dutch]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''bever'', the [[Low German]] ''bever'', the [[Old High German]] ''bibar'' and the [[German language|Modern German]] ''Biber''. The Proto-Germanic word in turn came from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) word ''*bhebhrus'', a reduplication of the PIE root ''*bher-'', meaning \"brown\" or \"bright\", whose own descendants now include the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''bebras'' and the [[Czech language|Czech]] ''bobr'', as well as the Germanic forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=beaver|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Species==\n[[File:beaver tracks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[North American]] beaver tracks]]\nThe North American and Eurasian beavers are the only [[extant taxon|extant]] members of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Castoridae]], contained in a single [[genus]], '''''Castor'''''. [[genetics|Genetic]] research has shown the modern European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization is unlikely. Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be slightly larger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the former, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race, which is square. The ''[[foramen magnum]]'' is rounded in the Eurasian beaver and triangular in the North American. The [[anal gland]]s of the Eurasian beaver are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American species. The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.<ref name=\"andy\">{{cite book |author=Kitchener, Andrew |url= |title=Beavers |year=2001 |isbn=1-873580-55-X |page=144 |publisher=Whittet |location=Stowmarket }}</ref>\n\nThe two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 [[chromosomes]], while Eurasian beavers have 48. More than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in a single stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n\n===Eurasian beaver===\n{{Main|Eurasian beaver}}\n\n[[File:Beaver pho34.jpg|thumb|A Eurasian beaver]]\nThe Eurasian beaver (''Castor fiber'') was nearly hunted to [[extinction]] in Europe, both for fur and for ''[[castoreum]]'', a secretion from its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties.

They fell large mature trees, usually in strategic locations, to form the basis of a dam, but European beavers tend to use small diameter (<10&nbsp;cm) trees for this purpose. Beavers fell small trees, especially young second-growth trees, for food.\n\nBroadleaved trees re-grow as a [[coppice]], providing easy-to-reach stems and leaves for food in subsequent years.

Beavers always work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, though they may not defend secondary dams as vigorously. Beavers may create a series of dams along a river.\n\n===Lodges===\n{{redirect|Beaver lodge|the town in Alberta, Canada|Beaverlodge}}\n\nThe ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, which are called ''lodges''. These are created from severed branches and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late each autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when frosts arrive. The mud becomes almost as hard as stone, thereby preventing [[gray wolf|wolves]] and [[wolverine]]s from penetrating the lodge.\n[[File:Beaver lodge.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration of beaver lodge]]\n[[File:Beaverlodge.JPG|thumb|right|Beaver lodge, approx. {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.]]\nThe lodge has underwater entrances, which makes entry nearly impossible for any other animal, although [[muskrats]] have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made them.<ref>''The Life of Mammals'' Episode 4, \"Chisellers\".</ref> Only a small amount of the lodge is actually used as a living area. Beavers dig out their dens with underwater entrances after they finish building the dams and lodge structures. There are typically two dens within the lodge, one for drying off after exiting the water and another, drier one, in which the family lives.\n\nBeaver lodges are constructed with the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure. They seldom house more than four adults and six or eight juveniles. Some larger lodges have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof. Usually, the dens have no connection with each other except by water.\n\nWhen the ice breaks up in spring, beavers usually leave their lodges and roam until just before autumn, when they return to their old lodges and gather their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the lodges until the frost sets in, and rarely finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new lodge, they fell the wood early in summer but seldom begin building until nearly the end of August.<ref name=\"EB11\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Beaver |volume=3 |page=600 |first=Richard |last=Lydekker |authorlink=Richard Lydekker}}</ref>\n\n===Water quality and beavers===\nBeaver ponds, and the wetlands that succeed them, remove sediments and pollutants from waterways, including total suspended solids, total nitrogen, phosphates, carbon and silicates.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Beaver pond biogeochemical effects in the Maryland Coastal Plain |journal=Biogeochemistry |date=June 2000 |pages=217\u2013239 |jstor=1469618 |author1=David L.

Groups this size or close to this size build more lodges to live in while smaller families usually need only one.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/> However, large families in the Northern Hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge. Beaver pairs mate for life; however, if a beaver's mate dies, it will partner with another one. Extra-pair copulations also occur.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/> In addition to being monogamous, both the male and female take part in raising offspring. They also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/> When young are born, they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory. In the time after they leave the lodge for the first time, yearlings will help their parents build food caches in the fall and repair dams and lodges. Still, adults do the majority of the work and young beavers help their parents for reasons based on natural selection rather than kin selection. They are dependent on them for food and for learning life skills.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/> Young beavers spend most of their time playing but also copy their parents' behavior. However, while copying behavior helps imprint life skills in young beavers, it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parents as the young beaver do not perform the tasks as well as the parents.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/>\n\nOlder offspring, which are around two years old, may also live in families and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds will also help in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring.<ref name= \"Lixing 2003\"/> Beavers also practice [[Alloparenting|alloparental care]], in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them.

To avoid such situations, a beaver marks its territory with as many scent mounds as possible, signaling to intruders that the territory holder has enough energy to maintain its territory and is thus able to put up a good defense. As such, territories with more scent mounts are avoided more often than ones with fewer mounts.<ref name= \"Rosell 1997\"/> Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories.<ref name= \"Rosell 1997\"/> Beavers also exhibit a behavior known as the \"[[dear enemy effect]]\".

Eventually, the [[fur trade]] declined due to decreasing demand in Europe and the takeover of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector.

They are classified as [[caniformia|caniforms]], or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight [[species]] of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of [[habitat]]s throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, [[plantigrade]] paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.\n\nWhile the [[polar bear]] is mostly [[carnivore|carnivorous]], and the [[giant panda]] feeds almost entirely on [[bamboo]], the remaining six species are [[omnivore|omnivorous]] with varied diets. With the exception of [[courting]] individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically [[solitary animals]]. They may be [[diurnality|diurnal]] or [[nocturnal]] and have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]]. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of [[hibernation]], up to 100 days.\n\nBears have been hunted since [[prehistoric]] times for [[bear meat|their meat]] and fur; they have been used for [[bear-baiting]] and other forms of entertainment, such as being [[tame bear|made to dance]]. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in [[the arts]], [[mythology]], and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian [[bile bear]] market. The [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] lists six bear species as [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] or [[endangered species|endangered]], and even [[least concern]] species, such as the [[brown bear]], are at risk of [[Local extinction|extirpation]] in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word \"bear\" comes from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|bera}}'' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in [[Germanic languages]], such as Swedish ''{{lang|sv|[[bjorn|bj\u00f6rn]]}}'', also used as a first name, that originate from an adjective meaning \"brown\". \"Bear\" therefore originally meant \"the brown one.\" This terminology for the animal originated as a [[Avoidance speech|taboo avoidance]] term: proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear \u2013 ''arkto'' \u2013 with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal's true name might cause it to appear.<!--<ref name=\"indo-european1959\">{{cite book |author=Pokorny, Julius |authorlink=Julius Pokorny |title=Indogermanisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch |publisher=Francke |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/natlang/ie/pokorny.html |date=1959}}</ref>--><ref>{{cite web |title=bear (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bear |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Postma|first1=Laura|title=The word for \"bear\"|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/qsonhist/bearetymologyslovakenglishwelsh.html|website=University of Pittsburgh Slovak Studies Program|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nBear taxon names such as [[Arctoidea]] and ''[[Helarctos]]'' come from the ancient Greek word \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (''arktos''), meaning bear,<ref>{{cite dictionary |author1=Liddell, Henry George|author2=Scott, Robert |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 |title=Arktos |work=A Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Perseus Digital Library}}</ref> as do the names \"[[arctic]]\" and \"[[antarctic]]\",  from the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Major]], the \"Great Bear\", prominent in the northern sky.<ref name=UrsaMajor>{{cite web |url=http://www.souledout.org/nightsky/ursamandm/ursamajorandminor.html |title=The Great Bear Constellation Ursa Major |accessdate=12 January 2017 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101130031637/http://souledout.org/nightsky/ursamandm/ursamajorandminor.html | archivedate= 30 November 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nBear taxon names such as Ursidae and ''Ursus'' come from Latin ''Ursus/Ursa'', he-bear/she-bear.<ref name=UrsaMajor/> The female first name \"Ursula\", originally derived from a Christian [[St. Ursula|saint]]'s name, means \"little she-bear\" (diminutive of Latin ''ursa'').

Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the [[karyotype]] of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 [[chromosome]]s, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in [[Procyonidae]], where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.<ref name=Servheen1999>{{cite book |author1=Servheen, C. |author2=Herrero, S. |author3=Peyton, B. |title=Bears: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1999-004.pdf |year=1999 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=978-2-8317-0462-3 |pages=26\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n[[File:Plithocyon armagnacensis.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Plithocyon|Plithocyon armagnacensis]]'' skull, a member of the extinct subfamily Hemicyoninae from the [[Miocene]]]]\n\nThe earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including ''[[Parictis]]'' (late [[Eocene]] to early middle [[Miocene]], 38\u201318 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) and the slightly younger ''Allocyon'' (early [[Oligocene]], 34\u201330 Mya), both from North America.

The [[Scapula|shoulder blades]] and the [[pelvis]] are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the [[big cat]]s as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/>\n\n[[File:Black bear large.jpg|thumb|upright|Despite being [[quadruped]]s, bears can stand and sit as humans do.]]\nUnlike most other land carnivorans, bears are [[plantigrade]]. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping [[bamboo]] shoots as the animals feed.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/>\n\nMost mammals have [[Agouti (coloration)|agouti]] hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to two different types of [[melanin]] pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/> Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.<ref name=\"Ward124\"/>\n\nBears have small rounded ears so as to minimise heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have [[colour vision]], perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive [[whiskers]] on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent [[olfaction|sense of smell]], better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\"/>\n\n[[File:Ursus arctos 01 MWNH 145 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Brown bear skull]]\nThe [[skull]]s of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful [[Masseter muscle|masseter]] and [[temporal muscle|temporal]] jaw muscles. The [[canine tooth|canine teeth]] are large but mostly used for display, and the [[molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most other members of the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped [[carnassial]] teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter.<ref name=\"Marshall Cavendish\">{{cite book |author=Anon |title=Mammal Anatomy: An Illustrated Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTPI_d9fyLAC&pg=PA104 |year=2010 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7882-9 |pages=104\u2013123}}</ref> Considerable variation occurs in [[dentition|dental formula]] even within a given species.

of prey]] found in [[North America]]. A [[sea eagle]], it has two known subspecies and forms a [[Species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''). Its range includes most of [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.\n\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight. [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.\n\nBald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white headed\". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.\n\nThe bald eagle is both the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and [[List of national animals|national animal]] of the [[United States|United States of America]]. The bald eagle appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]'s list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Continental United States|Lower 48]] States on June 28, 2007.\n\n==Description==\nThe [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.<ref name=hbw/> The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].<ref name=\"Cornell\"/> The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''H. vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Head details]]\nThe plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.<ref name=hbw/><ref name=\"ADW\"/> Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its [[nape]] and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.<ref name=\"sibley\"/> Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black,  yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak.\n\nThe bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the [[California condor]] (''Gymnogyps californianus''), a [[New World vulture]] which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> However, the [[golden eagle]], averaging {{convert|4.18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord length]] in its American race (''A. c. canadensis''), is merely {{convert|455|g|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/><ref name= Watson/> Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed [[white-tailed eagle]] and the overall larger [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''H. pelagicus''), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/>\n\n[[File:Bald Eagle, wings and tail feathers.jpg|thumb|This eagle has a sizeable wingspan]]\nThe bald eagle has a body length of {{convert|70|\u2013|102|cm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}. Typical wingspan is between {{convert|1.8|and|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and mass is normally between {{convert|3|and|6.3|kg|lb|sp=us|abbr = on}}.<ref name= Ferguson-Lees/> Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging {{convert|5.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and against the males' average weight of {{convert|4.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=hbw/><ref name=b1/><ref name=r1/><ref name=b2/>\n\nThe size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with [[Bergmann's rule]], since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from [[South Carolina]] average {{convert|3.27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in mass and {{convert|1.88|m|ft|abbr=on}} in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/> One field guide in [[Florida]] listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about {{convert|4.13|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>Maehr, D.

It is found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.<ref name=hbw/><ref name=\"ESRP\"/>\n\nThe bald eagle forms a [[species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] of [[Eurasia]]. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early [[Miocene]] (c. 10&nbsp;[[Ma (unit)|Ma BP]]) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle [[Oligocene]], 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this [[genus]].<ref name=j2/>\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Bald-Eagle-9114-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Bald eagle in flight at [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wyoming]]]]\nThe bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of [[Canada]], all of the [[continental United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is the only sea eagle [[endemism|endemic]] to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] to the [[Sonoran Desert]] and the eastern deciduous forests of [[Quebec]] and [[New England]], northern birds are [[bird migration|migratory]], while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], northern and eastern Canada, and [[Florida]].<ref name=\"Bull87\"/> Today, they are much more common, and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> \n\nThe majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the [[British Columbia]] coast while large populations are found in the forests of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/animal-facts-bald-eagle |title=Animal Facts: Bald Eagle |date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=2018-10-22}}</ref> Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in [[Squamish, British Columbia]], about halfway between [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. The birds primarily gather along the [[Squamish River|Squamish]] and [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] Rivers, attracted by the [[salmon]] spawning in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle1.html |title=Bald Eagle Viewing Directory |accessdate=2007-08-20}}</ref>\n\nIt has occurred as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in [[Fermanagh]] on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a [[white-tailed eagle]]), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] on November 15, 1987.<ref>[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Bald-Eagle-Lands-Exhausted-in-Ireland/id-fd7744016cc242f2c23ec570762c136a Bald Eagle Lands Exhausted in Ireland], Associated Press, 15 December 1987.</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Bald Eagle, Ontario forest.jpg|thumb|In flight during a licensed performance in Ontario, Canada]]\n[[File:Bald Eagle, training for falconry.jpg|thumb|During training at the Canadian Raptor Conservancy, a facility license by the province of [[Ontario]]]]\nThe bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American [[wetland]] habitat such as [[Coast|seacoasts]], [[river]]s, large [[lake]]s or [[marsh]]es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.<ref name=\"Gov\"/>\n\nThe bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=j3/><ref name=j4/> Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.<ref name=\"Swenson, J.

The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\nIn Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove|mangrove swamps]], the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.<ref name=\"FPL\"/> In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect.

Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.<ref name=\"Suring\"/> Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.<ref name=\"FPL\"/>\n\n[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]\nThe bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.<ref name=\"Gov\"/> However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.<ref name=r3/><ref name=r4/> Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in [[New York City]] in 2010.<ref name=r5/>\n\nWhile wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/><ref name=\"Suring\"/>\n\n==Behavior==\nThe bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|\u2013|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.<ref name=\"Terres\"/> Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.<ref name=r17/> Regarding their flying abilities, the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast.<ref name= Palmer/> It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.<ref name=r8/> The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.<ref name=\"ADW\"/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey.

Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of [[polygyny]].<ref name=bent/> Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs.<ref name=j10/> It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.<ref name=\"Travsky\"/> However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other \"eagle\" species such as some in the genus ''Aquila'', in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid.<ref name=\"Brown\"/> Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).<ref name=\"Travsky\"/>\n\n[[File:Back to the Six Mile Lake eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus).\"feed me mom\".

Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large [[gull]]s, [[corvid]]s (including [[raven]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crows]] and [[magpie]]s), [[wolverine]]s (''Gulo gulo''), [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus''), [[American black bear]]s (''Ursus americanus'') and [[raccoon]]s.<ref name=\"Hensel, R.

DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.<ref name=\"Bull87\"/> It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000\u2013500,000,<ref name=r16/> but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/support/adopt/adopt-bald-eagle|title=Adopt a Bald Eagle|publisher=Smithsonian's National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute|access-date=2018-08-04|date=2016-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/wildlife/baldeagle/pastsurveys.html|title=South Carolina's Bald Eagles \u2013 Past Surveys|publisher=South Carolina Department of Natural Resources|date=2015|access-date=2018-08-04}}</ref>\nOther factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA62 \"American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction.\"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1930, p. 62.</ref> Later illegal shooting was described as \"the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles,\" according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.<ref name=r15/>\n\nThe species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]], approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds.<ref name=r13/> DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.<ref name=r14/>\n[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year]]\n\nWith regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000\u2013115,000 by 1992;<ref name=hbw/> the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000\u201350,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000\u201330,000 in 1992.<ref name=hbw/> Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult.

That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests.

These populations are divided into those carrying an eastern lineage (clade IIIa, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of Russian, northern Scandinavian and eastern European populations, and those carrying a western lineage (clade I, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of two subgroups, one believed to originate from the Iberian Peninsula, including southern Scandinavian bears and the Pyrenean populations; and the other from the Italian\u2013Balkan peninsulas (Taberlet et al. 1994; see however Kohn et al. 1995).

Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.

If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible.

It is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=A.|title=High Temperature Superconductivity at 25: Still In Suspense|journal=Nature|date=July 2011|volume=475|doi=10.1038/475280a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110720/full/475280a.html|accessdate=November 18, 2012|pmid=21776057|bibcode = 2011Natur.475..280M|issue=7356|pages=280\u20132}}</ref> These effects are still not yet fully understood; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.\n\n==Overview==\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the [[Fermi surface]] become unstable against the formation of [[Cooper pair]]s. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from the condensation of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, and bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]]. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], by means of the [[Bogoliubov transformation]]s.\n\nIn many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the [[phonon]]s). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:\n\n<blockquote>An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this \"condensed\" state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break ''all'' of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual \"member pair\" within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.</blockquote>\n\n===Details===\nBCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the [[Coulomb repulsion]]. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the [[crystal lattice]] (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do ''not'' depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. For instance, Cooper pairs have been observed in [[Ultracold atom|ultracold gases]] of [[fermion]]s where a homogeneous [[magnetic field]] has been tuned to their [[Feshbach resonance]]. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an [[Atomic orbital|s-wave]] superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the [[Atomic orbital|d-wave]] high-temperature superconductors.\n\nExtensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.\n\nBCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is\nnow known as the BCS state. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electrons' attraction. Within this potential, a variational [[ansatz]] for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.\n\n=== Underlying evidence ===\nThe hyperphysics website pages at [[Georgia State University]] summarize some key background to BCS theory as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/bcs.html|title=BCS Theory of Superconductivity|author=|date=|website=hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n* '''Evidence of a [[band gap]] at the Fermi level''' (described as \"a key piece in the puzzle\")\n: the existence of a critical temperature and critical magnetic field implied a band gap, and suggested a [[phase transition]], but single [[electron]]s are forbidden from condensing to the same energy level by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The site comments that \"a drastic change in conductivity demanded a drastic change in electron behavior\". Conceivably, pairs of electrons might perhaps act like [[boson]]s instead, which are bound by [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics|different condensate rules]] and do not have the same limitation. \n*'''Isotope effect on the critical temperature, suggesting lattice interactions'''\n: The [[Debye frequency]] of phonons in a lattice is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the mass of lattice ions. It was shown that the superconducting transition temperature of mercury indeed showed the same dependence, by substituting natural mercury <sup>202</sup>Hg with a different isotope <sup>198</sup>Hg.<ref name=maxwell1950>{{cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=Emanuel|title=Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury|journal=Physical Review|volume=78|issue=4|pages=477\u2013477|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.477|url=http://journals.aps.org/archive/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.78.477|accessdate=27 July 2014|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..477M }}</ref>\n* '''An [[Exponential growth|exponential rise]] in [[heat capacity]] near the critical temperature for some superconductors'''\n: An exponential increase in heat capacity near the critical temperature also suggests an energy bandgap for the superconducting material. As superconducting [[vanadium]] is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases massively in a very few degrees; this suggests an energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.\n* '''The lessening of the measured energy gap towards the critical temperature'''\n: this suggests a type of situation where some kind of [[binding energy]] exists but it is gradually weakened as the critical temperature is approached. A binding energy suggests two or more particles or other entities that are bound together in the superconducting state. This helped to support the idea of bound particles - specifically electron pairs - and together with the above helped to paint a general picture of paired electrons and their lattice interactions.\n\n==Implications==\nBCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called weak-coupling case. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:\n* The electrons are bound into Cooper pairs, and these pairs are correlated due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for the electrons, from which they are constructed. Therefore, in order to break a pair, one has to change energies of all other pairs. This means there is an energy gap for single-particle excitation, unlike in the normal metal (where the state of an electron can be changed by adding an arbitrarily small amount of energy). This energy gap is highest at low temperatures but vanishes at the transition temperature when superconductivity ceases to exist. The BCS theory gives an expression that shows how the gap grows with the strength of the attractive interaction and the (normal phase) single particle [[density of states]] at the [[Fermi level]]. Furthermore, it describes how the density of states is changed on entering the superconducting state, where there are no electronic states any more at the Fermi level. The energy gap is most directly observed in tunneling experiments<ref name=\"Giaever\">Ivar Giaever - Nobel Lecture. Nobelprize.org.

However, before reaching the transition temperature, the specific heat of the superconductor becomes even higher than that of the normal conductor (measured immediately above the transition) and the ratio of these two values is found to be universally given by 2.5.\n* BCS theory correctly predicts the Meissner effect, i.e. the expulsion of a magnetic field from the superconductor and the variation of the penetration depth (the extent of the screening currents flowing below the metal's surface) with temperature. This had been demonstrated experimentally by [[Walther Meissner]] and [[Robert Ochsenfeld]] in their 1933 article [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1933NW.....21..787M Ein neuer Effekt bei Eintritt der Supraleitf\u00e4higkeit].\n* It also describes the variation of the [[upper critical field|critical magnetic field]] (above which the superconductor can no longer expel the field but becomes normal conducting) with temperature. BCS theory relates the value of the critical field at zero temperature to the value of the transition temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level.\n* In its simplest form, BCS gives the superconducting transition temperature ''T''<sub>c</sub> in terms of the electron-phonon coupling potential ''V'' and the [[Debye frequency|Debye]] cutoff energy ''E''<sub>D</sub>:<ref name=BCS_theory/>\n::<math>k_B\\,T_c = 1.13E_D\\,{e^{-1/N(0)\\,V}},</math>\n:where ''N''(0) is the electronic density of states at the Fermi level. For more details, see [[Cooper pairs]].\n* The BCS theory reproduces the '''isotope effect''', which is the experimental observation that for a given superconducting material, the critical temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the [[isotope]] used in the material. The isotope effect was reported by two groups on 24 March 1950, who discovered it independently working with different [[mercury (element)|mercury]] isotopes, although a few days before publication they learned of each other's results at the ONR conference in [[Atlanta]]. The two groups are [[Emanuel Maxwell]], who published his results in [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v78/i4/p477_1 Isotope Effect in the Superconductivity of Mercury] and C. A. Reynolds, B. Serin, W. H. Wright, and L. B. Nesbitt who published their results 10 pages later in [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v78/i4/p487_1 Superconductivity of Isotopes of Mercury]. The choice of isotope ordinarily has little effect on the electrical properties of a material, but does affect the frequency of lattice vibrations.  This effect suggests that superconductivity is related to vibrations of the lattice. This is incorporated into BCS theory, where lattice vibrations yield the binding energy of electrons in a Cooper pair.\n* [[Little-Parks effect|Little-Parks experiment]]<ref name=Little>W. A.

It is treated as a race where the contestant with the shortest total time wins. Depending on the competition, missed shots result in extra distance or time being added to the contestant's total.\n\n==History==\nAccording to ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', the biathlon \"is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the [[Ullr|Norse god Ullr]] as both the ski god and the hunting god\".\nIn modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for [[Norway|Norwegian]] people that was an alternative training for the [[army|military]]. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying rifle and military pack. In modern terminology these military contests included downhill, slalom, biathlon, and cross-country skiing.<ref name=Bergsland>Bergsland, Einar (1946): ''P\u00e5 ski.'' Oslo: Aschehoug.</ref> One of the world's first known ski clubs, the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club, was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level. 20th century variants include {{lang|no|Forsvarsrennet}} (the military contest) \u2013 a 17&nbsp;km cross-country race with shooting, and the military cross-country race at 30&nbsp;km including marksmanship. The modern biathlon is a civilian variant of the old military combined exercise.<ref>B\u00f8, Olav: ''Skiing throughout history'', translated by W. Edson Richmond. Oslo: Samlaget, 1993.</ref> In Norway, the biathlon was until 1984 a branch of {{lang|no|Det frivillige Skyttervesen}}, an organization set up by the government to promote civilian marksmanship in support of national defense. In Norwegian, the biathlon is called {{lang|no|skiskyting}} (literally ''ski shooting'').<ref name=Idrettsleksikon>''Kunnskapsforlagets idrettsleksikon'' (Encyclopedia of Sports), Oslo: Kunnskapsforlaget, 1990</ref> In Norway there are still separate contests in {{lang|no|skifeltskyting}}, a cross-country race at 12&nbsp;km with large-caliber rifle shooting at various targets with unknown range.<ref>https://snl.no/skifeltskyting</ref>\n\nCalled [[military patrol]], the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Military patrol at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], and then [[demonstration sport|demonstrated]] in [[Military patrol at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]], [[Military patrol at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], and [[Military patrol at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], but did not regain Olympic recognition then because the small number of competing countries disagreed on the rules. During the mid-1950s, however, the biathlon was introduced into the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits and was widely enjoyed by the public. This newfound popularity aided the effort of having the biathlon gain entry into the Winter Olympics.\n\nThe first [[Biathlon World Championship]] was held in 1958 in [[Austria]], and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the [[1960 Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]].<ref name=Idrettsleksikon/> At [[1992 Winter Olympics|Albertville]] in 1992, women were first allowed in the Olympic biathlon.\n\nThe competitions from 1958 to 1965 used high-power [[centerfire]] [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], such as the [[.30-06&nbsp;Springfield]] and the [[7.62\u00d751mm&nbsp;NATO]], before the [[.22&nbsp;Long Rifle]] [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] cartridge was standardized in 1978.

The target distance was reduced to {{convert|150|m}} with the addition of the relay in 1966.

Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total skiing distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.\n\nFor each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets or receive a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules, as follows:<ref name = IBU/>\n* Skiing around a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj = on}} penalty loop\u2014typically taking 20\u201330 seconds for elite biathletes to complete, depending on weather and snow conditions.\n* Adding one minute to the skier's total time.\n* Use of an extra cartridge (placed at the shooting range) to hit the target; only three such extras are available for each round, and a penalty loop must be done for each target left standing.\n\nIn order to keep track of the contestants' progress and relative standing throughout a race, [[Fully automatic time|split time]]s (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round.

Additional rounds can be kept on the stock of the rifle for a relay race. \n\nThe target range shooting distance is {{convert|50|m|ft}}. There are five circular targets to be hit in each shooting round. When shooting in the [[prone position]], the target diameter is {{convert|45|mm|in}}; when shooting in the standing position, the target diameter is {{convert|115|mm|in}}. On all modern biathlon ranges, the targets are self-indicating, in that they flip from black to white when hit, giving the biathlete, as well as the spectators, instant visual feedback for each shot fired.\n\n==Competition format==\n\n===Individual===\nThe {{convert|20|km}} individual race ({{convert|15|km}} for women) is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane,<ref>Even in English-speaking countries such as Canada and the United States each country may use different terms for the same thing in biathlon. For example: Stage (USA) vs. Bout (Canada), Shooting Point (USA) vs. Shooting Lane (Canada)</ref> in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors' starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.\n\n===Sprint===\nThe sprint is {{convert|10|km|mi}} for men and {{convert|7.5|km|mi}} for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete shoots twice at any shooting lane, once prone and once standing, for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop of {{convert|150|m}} must be skied before the race can be continued. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in intervals.\n\n===Pursuit===\n[[File:Biathlon Oberhof 2013-039.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic gold medalists Olga Zaitseva and Andrea Henkel at the World Cup pursuit race in Oberhof, 2013.]]\n\n{{main article|Pursuit racing}}\nIn a pursuit, biathletes' starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race,<ref>To be precise; the pursuit competition start intervals are determined by [[Rounding#Rounding to integer|common rounding]] to the nearest whole second of the biathletes' time differences from the previous race{{spaced ndash}} the amount of time each biathlete lagged after the winner to the finish line.</ref> most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} for men and {{convert|10|km|mi}} for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order), and each miss means a penalty loop of {{convert|150|m}}. To prevent awkward or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops, and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts.\n\n===Mass start===\nIn the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time and the first across the finish line wins. In this {{convert|15|km|mi}} for men or {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (If a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one {{convert|150|m}} penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).\n\n===Mass start 60===\n\nStarting in the 2018/2019 season, the Mass Start 60 becomes part of the [[International Biathlon Union]] (IBU) competition formats. The Mass Start with 60 starters does not replace the current Mass Start with 30 starters.<ref>http://www.biathlonworld.com/news/detail/new-season-new-rules</ref>\n\nEveryone skis the first lap together, but then only the first 30 stop to shoot and the second 30 keep skiing. At the end of the second lap the second 30 stop to shoot and the first 30 continue to ski. After the first two shoots are over (everyone\u2019s first prone) then the race continues like a normal one and they all shoot the other prone and two stands together. Or more simply:\n\nBib 1-30 = lap-shoot1-lap-lap-shoot2-lap-shoot3-lap-shoot4-lap.\n\nBib 31-60 = lap-lap-shoot1-lap-shoot2-lap-shoot3-lap-shoot4-lap.<ref>https://biathlon23.wordpress.com/tag/ibu-cup-martell/</ref>\n\n===Relay===\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski {{convert|7.5|km|mi}} (men) or {{convert|6|km|mi}} (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150&nbsp;m (490&nbsp;ft) penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).\n\n===Mixed relay===\nThe most recent addition to the number of biathlon competition variants, the mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay but the teams are composed of two women and two men.  Legs 1 and 2 are done by the women, legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are {{convert|6|km}} and men's legs are {{convert|7.5|km}} as in ordinary relay competitions.\n\nIn 2014, single mixed relay was introduced by the IBU. Each team has a man and a woman, and each runs two {{convert|3.0|km}} legs, except the last leg where the man completes {{convert|4.5|km}} for a total {{convert|13.5|km}}.\n\nThis event was first held at the [[Biathlon World Championships 2005]] in Khanty-Mansiysk, and it was added to the [[Biathlon at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay|2014 Winter Olympics]].\n\n===Team (obsolete)===\nA team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150&nbsp;m (490&nbsp;ft). The skiers must enter the shooting area together, and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nBiathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely Germany ([[Das Erste|ARD]], [[ZDF]]), Austria ([[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]), Norway ([[Norsk Rikskringkasting|NRK]]), France ([[L'\u00c9quipe (TV channel)|L'\u00c9quipe 21]]), Finland ([[Yleisradio|YLE]]), [[Estonia]] ([[ETV (Estonia)|ETV]]), [[Latvia]] ([[LTV 7|LTV]]), [[Lithuania]] ([[Lithuanian National Radio and Television|LRT]]), [[Croatia]] ([[Hrvatska radiotelevizija|HRT]]), Poland ([[Polsat]]), Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]), Russia ([[Russia-2]], [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]]), [[Belarus]] ([[TVR (Belarus)|TVR]]), [[Slovenia]] ([[RTV Slovenia|RTV]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Radio-televizija Bosne i Hercegovine|BHRT]]), [[Bulgaria]] ([[Bulgarian National Television|BNT]]), and [[South Korea]] ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]]);<!--sequence held in same order as on biathlonworld.com--> it is broadcast on European-wide [[Eurosport]], which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region.

In modern times it is a dish made with the shallow-fried [[leftovers|leftover]] vegetables from a [[roast dinner]]. The main ingredients are [[potato]] and [[cabbage]] but [[carrot]]s, [[pea]]s, [[Brussels sprout]]s, or any other leftover vegetables may be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process.<ref>{{citation |author=Pickett, Joseph P. |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> It is often served with cold meat from the [[Sunday roast]], and pickles or [[brown sauce]], or as an accompaniment to a [[full breakfast|full English breakfast]].\n\nThe meat was traditionally added to the bubble and squeak itself, although nowadays it is more commonly made without meat.

He was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to a musical family during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by [[gospel music]], [[country music]], and [[rhythm and blues]] acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group \"Buddy and Bob\" with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]], he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].\n\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]]. Unhappy with Bradley's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there, he went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to \"[[The Crickets]]\", which became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US \"Best Sellers in Stores\"]] chart and the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"[[Peggy Sue]]\".\n\nThe album ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets|Chirping Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after, toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\".\n\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. He was a major influence on later [[popular music]] artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Weezer]], and [[Elton John]]. He was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of \"100 Greatest Artists\".\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life and career (1936\u20131955)===\nHolly was born Charles Hardin Holley on September 7, 1936, in [[Lubbock, Texas]]; he was the fourth child of Lawrence Odell \"L.O.\" Holley (1901\u20131985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902\u20131990). His elder siblings were Larry (born in 1925), Travis (1927\u20132016),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/interact/blog-post/william-kerns/2016-12-02/travis-holley-one-buddys-brothers-passes-away-thursday|title=Travis Holley, one of Buddy's brothers, dies Thursday (Playbill by Kerns blog) - Lubbock Online - Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|website=lubbockonline.com}}</ref> and Patricia Lou (1929\u20132008).  Buddy Holly was of mostly English and Welsh descent but also had small amounts of Native American ancestry as well.<ref>Buddy Holly: A Biography By Ellis Amburn pg. 10</ref> From early childhood, he was nicknamed \"Buddy\".{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=12}} During the Great Depression, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O. changed jobs several times. Buddy Holly was baptized a [[Baptist]], and the family were members of the [[Tabernacle Baptist Church]].{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=12}}\n\nThe Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the strings so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=13}} During [[World War II]], Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought the guitar from a pawnshop, and Travis taught him to play it.{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=14}}\n\nDuring his early childhood, Holley was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, he became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by the [[Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] , ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holley played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952, Holley and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as \"Buddy and Jack\" in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Montgomery and they were billed as \"Buddy and Bob\". The two soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holley was influenced by late-night radio stations that played [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]] (R&B). Holley would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=7|2003}} Holley then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western (C&W) influence with R & B.{{sfn|Wishart, David|p=540|2004}}\n\nBy 1955, after graduating from high school, Holley decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley performing live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holley opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, he had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from C&W to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded Grand Ole Opry manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holley's last name as \"Holly\"; from then on, he was known as \"Buddy Holly\".{{sfn|MacDonald, Les|p=17|2010}}\n\nOn January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released \"[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]\" as a single, with \"Love Me\" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as \"Buddy Holly and the Two Tones\", while later Decca called them \"Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes\".{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single \"Modern Don Juan\", backed with \"You Are My One Desire\". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan, Michael|Solomon, Bruce|1981|p=49}}\n\n===The Crickets (1956\u20131957) ===\n[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]\n\nHolly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca; he was inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s \"[[Party Doll]]\" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s \"[[I'm Stickin' with You]]\", and visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name \"Crickets\". Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release \"That'll Be the Day\", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101|page=101|title=Buddy Holly: A Biography|first =Ellis|last =Amburn|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|date=April 22, 2014|isbn=9781466868564}}</ref> Impressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. \"I'm Looking for Someone to Love\" was the B-side; the single was credited to the [[The Crickets|Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}\n\n\"That'll Be the Day\" was released on May 27, 1957.

He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., [[Baltimore]], and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16\u201322. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included \"[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]]\" in their shows. By the end of their run at the Apollo, \"That'll Be the Day\" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26.

While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", with \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&B chart.{{sfn|Gribbin, John|2012|p=57}} Holly and the Crickets performed \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"Peggy Sue\" on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on December 1, 1957.

Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released ''[[That'll Be the Day (album)|That'll Be the Day]]'', featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.{{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=90}}\n\nA new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired [[Tommy Allsup]] to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of \"[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]\" and \"[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]]\". Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording \"Now We're One\" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s \"[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]]\".{{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=91}}\n\nDuring a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-South]], Holly met [[Mar\u00eda Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Petty disapproved of the marriage and advised Holly to keep it secret to avoid upsetting Holly's female fans. Petty's reaction created friction with Holly, who had also started to question Petty's bookkeeping. The Crickets, frustrated because he controlled all of the proceeds from the band, were also in conflict with Petty.{{sfn|Scott Schinder, Andy Schwartz|2007|p=92}}\n\nHolly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[The Village Gate|Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. He also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=281}}\n\nSantiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of their habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, executive of the Latin American music department at [[Peer-Southern]], convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled. Petty then could not complete the transfers to Holly, who considered him responsible for the missing profit.{{sfn|Laing, Dave|p=153|2010}}\n\nIn September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded \"Reminiscing\" and \"Come Back Baby\". During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single \"Jole Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins)\" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Santiago and he settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including \"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]\" and \"What to Do\".{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=274\u2013278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber, Julian|2015}} In October, Holly recorded tracks for Coral; these were backed by saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]] and an 18-piece orchestra composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]]. The three-and-a-half-hour session produced \"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\", \"[[Raining in My Heart]]\", \"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]\" (written by Petty), and \"[[True Love Ways]]\".{{sfn|Norman, Philip|2011|p=276\u2013278}}\n\nHolly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager, and Holly also split from the Crickets.

The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer Carl Bunch was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (suffered while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} Before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], on February 2, Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], for Jennings, Allsup, and himself. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid a rigorous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with Valens. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life,\" Allsup later opened a restaurant in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] called Heads Up.<ref>Galloway, P.

In June 1959, Coral Records overdubbed two of them with backing vocals by the [[Ray Charles Singers]] and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established Crickets sound. The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, \"[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]\"/\"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]\".

During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (The Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of \"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\" \u2013 which Holly popularized but did not write \u2013 with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin, Phillipe|Guesdon, Jean-Michael|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of \"Peggy Sue\" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalogue.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}\n\nTwo nights before Holly's death, on January 31, 1959, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in Duluth. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: \"&nbsp;...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;...&nbsp;and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was&nbsp;...&nbsp;with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way\".{{sfn|Shelton, Robert|p=37|2011}}\n\n[[Mick Jagger]] saw Holly performing live in [[Woolwich]], London, during a tour of England; Jagger particularly remembered Holly's performance of \"Not Fade Away\" \u2013 a song that also inspired [[Keith Richards]], who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman, Philip|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, \"[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody\".{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}\n\n[[Don McLean]]'s popular 1971 [[ballad (music)|ballad]] \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\" was inspired by Holly's death and the day of the plane crash. The song's lyric, which calls the incident \"The Day the Music Died\", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, \"Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed\".{{sfn|McLean, Don|2015}}\n\n[[Elton John]] was musically influenced by Holly. At age 13, although he did not require them, John started wearing horn-rimmed glasses to imitate Holly.{{sfn|Goldrosen, John|1979|p=8}} [[The Clash]] were also influenced by Holly, and referenced him in their song \"Corner Soul\" from the ''[[Sandinista!]]'' album.{{sfn|Fletcher, Tony|p=174|2012}} ''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, \"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future \u2013 that's what I want'\".{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}}\n\nThe launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly's profound influence on Vee's singing style can be heard in the songs \"[[Rubber Ball]]\" \u2013 the B-side of which was a cover of Holly's \"Everyday\" \u2013 and \"Run to Him.\"{{sfn|Dean, Maury|2003|p=73}} The name of the British rock band [[the Hollies]] is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962.{{sfn|Eder, Bruce|1996}} In an August 24, 1978, interview with ''Rolling Stone'', [[Bruce Springsteen]] told [[Dave Marsh]], \"I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest\".{{sfn|Deardorff II, Donald|p=16|2013}} The [[Grateful Dead]] performed the song \"Not Fade Away\" in concerts.{{sfn|Meriwether, Nicholas|p=134|2013}}\n\nIn 2016, [[Richard Barone]] released his album ''Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s'', paying tribute to the new wave of singer-songwriters in the Village during that pivotal, post-Holly era. The album opens with Barone's version of \"Learning the Game\", one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village, a week before his death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Richard Barone Breathes New Life Into the Golden Age of Village Folk|url=http://observer.com/2016/08/richard-barone-breathes-new-life-into-the-golden-age-of-village-folk/|publisher=Observer|date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Film and musical depictions===\nHolly's life story inspired a Hollywood [[biographical film]], ''[[The Buddy Holly Story]]'' (1978); its lead actor [[Gary Busey]] received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly's friends and family, for its inaccuracies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flippo |first=Chet |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-buddy-holly-story-19780921 |title=The Truth Behind 'The Buddy Holly Story' |work=Rolling Stone |date=September 21, 1978 |accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref> This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly's song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled ''The Real Buddy Holly Story''. This video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly's family, and McCartney, among others.{{sfn|Lehmer, Larry|2003|p=174\u2013176}}\n\nIn 1987, musician [[Marshall Crenshaw]] portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]'', which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw's version of \"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\" is featured on the ''La Bamba'' original motion picture soundtrack.{{sfn|Green, Stanley|p=267|1999}} ''[[Buddy \u2013 The Buddy Holly Story]]'', a [[jukebox musical]] depicting Holly's life, is credited for being the first of its kind. It spawned the genre that later included ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' and ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''. The musical opened in the late 1980s and its most recent UK tour occurred in February 2011.{{sfn|Eiss, Harry|p=154|2013}}\n\n[[Steve Buscemi]] appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's orders (portrayed respectively by [[Uma Thurman]] and [[John Travolta]]).\n\nHolly was depicted in an episode of the science-fiction television program ''[[Quantum Leap]]'' titled \"How the Tess Was Won\"; Holly's identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. [[Sam Beckett]] ([[Scott Bakula]]) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from \"piggy, suey\" to \"Peggy Sue\", setting up Holly's future hit song.{{sfn|Phillips, Mark|Garcia, Frank|1996|p=358}} Holly's follow up to that hit song is featured in the 1986 [[Francis Ford Coppola]] film ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by [[Kathleen Turner]] is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Buddy Holly discography}}\n\n;The Crickets\n* ''[[The

The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process.<ref>[[s:en:1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry.

This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the [[Mashing|mashed]] barley grains to form the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]]) but also as a rich source of [[amylase]], a [[digestion|digestive]] [[enzyme]] that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and [[rye]], and, less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used.

Care must be taken when milling to ensure that the starch reserves are sufficiently milled without damaging the husk and providing coarse enough grits that a good filter bed can be formed during lautering.   Grains are typically dry-milled with [[roller mill]]s or [[hammer mill]]s.   Hammer mills, which produce a very fine mash, are often used when mash filters are going to be employed in the lautering process because the grain does not have to form its own filter bed. In modern plants, the grain is often conditioned with water before it is milled to make the husk more pliable, thus reducing breakage and improving lauter speed.\n\n[[Mashing]] converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a [[mash tun]]. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This \"conversion\" is called [[saccharification]] which occurs between the temperatures 140 - 158 degrees F.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Palmer|url=http://howtobrew.com/book/section-3/the-methods-of-mashing/single-temperature-infusion |title=Single Temperature Infusion |publisher=How to Brew |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}</ref> The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [[Wort (brewing)|\"wort\"]], which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as [[lautering]].

The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to [[dextrin]]s and then to fermentable sugars such as [[maltose]]. A mash rest from {{convert|49|-|55|C|F}} activates various [[protease]]s, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as [[maize|corn]] and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at {{convert|60|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} activates \u03b2-[[glucanase]], which breaks down gummy \u03b2-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based \u03b2-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of {{convert|65|-|71|C|F}} is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours [[\u03b2-amylase]] enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like [[maltotriose]], [[maltose]], and [[glucose]] which are more fermentable by the [[yeast]]. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours [[\u03b1-amylase]] enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and [[dextrin]]s which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and [[pH]] variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.<ref>Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) \"Technology Brewing and Malting\" [[VLB Berlin]], {{ISBN|3-921690-49-8}} pp. 214\u2013218</ref>\n\n===Lautering===\n{{Main|Lautering}}\nLautering is the separation of the [[Wort (brewing)|wort]] (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hui|Smith|2004}}</ref> This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter.

In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate [[heat exchanger]]. A plate heat exchanger has many ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop {{Convert|95|\u00b0C}} wort to {{Convert|20|\u00b0C}} while warming the cooling medium from about {{Convert|10|\u00b0C}} to {{Convert|80|\u00b0C}}. The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the [[freezing point]], which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around {{Convert|10|\u00b0C}}. After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction.\n\nWhile boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary.<ref name=Kunze>Kunze, Wolfgang (2004) \"Technology Brewing and Malting\" VLB Berlin, {{ISBN|3-921690-49-8}}, p.302</ref> Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.<ref name=\"Kunze\"/>\n\n==Fermenting {{anchor|Brewing#Fermenting}}==\n[[File:Cuves de fermentations.jpg|thumb|left|Modern closed fermentation vessels]]\n\n[[Fermentation]] takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats.<ref name=ferm1>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oWQdjnVo2B0C&pg=PA347&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|chapter=Fermentation vessels|authors=Anders Brinch Kissmeyer, Garrett Oliver|pages=347\u2013351|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 9 Sep 2011}}</ref><ref name=ferm2>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWXcajHd3W0C&pg=PA236&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=236|title=Encyclopaedia of Brewing|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date= 20 May 2013|author=Chris Boulton}}</ref><ref name=ferm3>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpDVsu-vaBcC&pg=PT294&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=294|title=Brewing Yeast and Fermentation|authors=Chris Boulton, David Quain|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|date= 25 Apr 2013}}</ref> After the wort is cooled and [[aerated]] \u2013 usually with [[Asepsis|sterile]] air \u2013 yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the [[malt]] are converted into alcohol and [[carbon dioxide]], and the product can be called beer for the first time.\n\nMost breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's [[aperture]] is typically around 60\u00b0, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.<ref name=ferm1/><ref name=ferm2/><ref name=ferm3/>\n\n===Fermentation methods===\n{{See also|Beer style}}\n[[File:Anchor Brewing Company fermentation tank.JPG|thumb|right|Open vessel showing fermentation taking place]]\n\nThere are three main fermentation methods, [[#Warm fermentation|warm]], [[#Cool fermentation|cool]] and [[#Spontaneous fermentation|wild or spontaneous]]. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the [[cask ale|cask]] or in the [[#Bottle conditioning|bottle]].\n\nBrewing yeasts are traditionally classed as \"top-cropping\" (or \"top-fermenting\") and \"bottom-cropping\" (or \"bottom-fermenting\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Priest|Stewart|2006|p=84}}</ref> Yeast were termed top or bottom cropping, because in traditional brewing yeast was collected from the top or bottom of the fermenting wort to be reused for the next brew.<ref name=\"Tom Colicchio 2011\">{{cite book|author= Tom Colicchio|title= The Oxford Companion to Beer|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2011}}</ref> This terminology is somewhat inappropriate in the modern era; after the widespread application of brewing mycology it was discovered that the two separate collecting methods involved two different yeast species that favoured different temperature regimes, namely ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' in top-cropping at warmer temperatures and ''Saccharomyces pastorianus'' in bottom-cropping at cooler temperatures.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emil Christian Hansen|title=Practical studies in fermentation: being contributions to the life history of micro-organisms|publisher= E. & FN Spon|year= 1896}}</ref> As brewing methods changed in the 20th century, cylindro-conical fermenting vessels became the norm and the collection of yeast for both ''Saccharomyces'' species is done from the bottom of the fermenter. Thus the method of collection no longer implies a species association. There are a few remaining breweries who collect yeast in the top-cropping method, such as Samuel Smiths brewery in Yorkshire, Marstons in Staffordshire and several German hefeweizen producers.<ref name=\"Tom Colicchio 2011\"/>\n\nFor both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally [[yeast flocculation|flocculate]] (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate [[dough]] in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12\u201315% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%).<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oWQdjnVo2B0C&pg=PA331#v=onepage&q&f=false |page= 331 |author1= Charles W.

A sample of these Bavarian yeasts was sent from the Spaten brewery in Munich to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen in 1845 who began brewing with it. In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1.

Not all beer is filtered. When tax determination is required by local laws, it is typically done at this stage in a calibrated tank. There are several forms of filters, they may be in the form of sheets or \"candles\", or they may be a fine powder such as [[diatomaceous earth]], also called kieselguhr. The powder is added to the beer and recirculated past screens to form a filtration bed.\n\nFilters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms.\n\n;Sheet (pad) filters\nThese filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sanitized (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked. The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.\n\nPre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.\n\nSheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.\n;Kieselguhr filters\n\t \t\nFilters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include [[diatomaceous earth]] and [[perlite]].\n\n==Packaging==\n{{See also|Beer bottle|Beverage can|Widget (beer)|Draught beer|Cask ale}}\n\nPackaging is putting the beer into the containers in which it will leave the brewery. Typically, this means putting the beer into bottles, aluminium cans, [[keg]]s, or casks, but it may include putting the beer into bulk tanks for high-volume customers.\n\n==By-products==\n{{anchor|Brewer's spent grain}}\n[[File:Spent grain.jpg|thumb|right|Spent grain, a brewing by-product]]\n\nBrewing by-products are \"spent grain\" and the sediment (or \"[[Sediment#Dregs|dregs]]\") from the filtration process which may be dried and resold as \"brewers dried yeast\" for poultry feed,<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9WZ9LJLoCZIC&pg=PA79 |title=Nutrition and Feeding of Organic Poultry |author=Robert Blair |page=79|publisher=CABI|year= 2008  |accessdate=8 April 2013}}</ref> or made into [[yeast extract]] which is used in brands such as [[Vegemite]] and [[Marmite]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=V3Sr4bbTH5oC&pg=PT174#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Beer: Tap into the Art and Science of Brewing|author= Charles Bamforth |page=174|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 6 March 2009 |accessdate=8 April 2013 |isbn= 9780199756360}}</ref> The process of turning the yeast sediment into edible yeast extract was discovered by German scientist [[Justus Liebig]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=azXx4cbrMZMC&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Vitamin discoveries and disasters: history, science, and controversies |author= Frances R.

It involves using [[autologous]] tissue or [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking [[areola]] and [[nipple]]. This procedure involves the use of [[breast implant|implants]] or tissue taken from other parts of the woman's body.\n\nGenerally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive [[pain]] caused by [[burn]]s and other injuries.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/well/live/after-mastectomies-an-unexpected-blow-numb-new-breasts.html|title=After Mastectomies, an Unexpected Blow: Numb New Breasts|last=Rabin|first=Roni Caryn|date=2017-01-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-31|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Timing ==\nThe primary part of the procedure can often be carried out immediately following the [[mastectomy]]. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities ([[high blood pressure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes]]) and [[Tobacco smoking|smokers]] are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk. There is little evidence available from randomised studies to favour immediate or delayed reconstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008674.pub2 |pmid=21735435 |title=Immediate versus delayed reconstruction following surgery for breast cancer |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=7 |pages=CD008674 |year=2011 |last1=d'Souza |first1=Nigel |last2=Darmanin |first2=Geraldine |last3=Fedorowicz |first3=Zbys }}</ref> The infection rate may be higher with primary reconstruction (done at the same time as mastectomy), but there are psychologic and financial benefits to having a single primary reconstruction.  Patients expected to receive [[radiation therapy]] as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients.  Waiting for six months to a year following may decrease the risk of complications, but this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDelayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction.  Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored.  Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction.  In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast Reconstruction: Immediate or Delayed|url=http://www.drdec.com/#!immediate-or-delayed/c1blj}}</ref>\n\nBreast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually takes multiple operations. Sometimes these follow-up surgeries are spread out over weeks or months. If an implant is used, the individual runs the same risks and complications as those who use them for [[breast augmentation]] but has higher rates of [[capsular contracture]] (tightening or hardening of the scar tissue around the implant) and revisional surgeries.<ref>\"Breast reconstruction using body tissue.\" Breast cancer | Lets Beat Cancer!

Over the course of a few months saline solution is injected into a tube inside of the expander, which allows for the expansion of the tissue until the tissue is stretched to the appropriate size.  Following operations provide for the removal of the expander, placement of a permanent implant and areolar reconstruction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/breast_center/treatments_services/reconstructive_breast_surgery/tissue_expanders.html|title=Tissue Expanders|last=|first=|date=|website=hopkinsmedicine.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* '''Flap reconstruction''' The second most common procedure uses tissue from other parts of the patient's body, such as the [[human back|back]], [[buttocks]], [[thigh]] or [[human abdomen|abdomen]]. This procedure may be performed by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site to retain its blood supply (the vessels are tunnelled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or it may be cut off and new blood supply may be connected.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breast cancer {{!}} Breast reconstruction using body tissue {{!}} Cancer Research UK|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/breast-cancer/treatment/surgery/breast-reconstruction/using-body-tissue#collapseListRefeferences|website=www.cancerresearchuk.org|language=en}}</ref>\n** '''The [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] flap ''' is the donor tissue available on the back. It is a large flat muscle which can be employed without significant loss of function. It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is usually used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant. Enough volume can be recruited occasionally to reconstruct small breasts without an implant. The latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back). The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1445-2197.2012.06292.x |pmid=23088555 |title=Avoiding back wound dehiscence in extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction |journal=ANZ Journal of Surgery |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=359\u201364 |year=2013 |last1=Mannu |first1=Gurdeep S. |last2=Farooq |first2=Naheed |last3=Down |first3=Sue |last4=Burger |first4=Amy |last5=Hussien |first5=Maged I. }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blausen 0140 BreastReconstruction TRAM.png|thumb|Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap (TRAM).]]\n[[File:Blausen 0141 BreastReconstruction TRAM PostOp.png|thumb|Post-operative state after Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap(TRAM).]]\n** '''Abdominal flaps''' The abdominal flap for breast reconstruction is the TRAM flap (Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous flap) or its technically distinct variants of microvascular \"perforator flaps\" like the DIEP/SIEA flaps. In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdomen tissue group, including skin, adipose tissues, minor muscles and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted onto the breast site.  Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus and the pubis. The [[DIEP flap]] and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because they result in an [[abdominoplasty]] (tummy tuck), and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a foreign implant.  TRAM flap procedures may weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but are tolerated well in most patients. To prevent muscle weakness and incisional hernias, the portion of abdominal wall exposed by reflection of the [[rectus abdominis]] muscle may be strengthened by a piece of surgical mesh placed over the defect and sutured in place. Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle, and purport the advantage of less weakening of the abdominal wall, though rectus abdominis muscle function may still be compromised. Other total autologous tissue breast reconstruction donor sites include the buttocks (superior or inferior gluteal artery perforator flaps (SGAP or IGAP)). The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing morbidity from harvesting the underlying muscles. DIEP reconstruction generally produces the best outcome for most women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eri\u0107|first=M.|last2=Mihi\u0107|first2=N.|last3=Krivoku\u0107a|first3=D.|date=2009-03-01|title=Breast reconstruction following mastectomy; patient's satisfaction|journal=Acta Chirurgica Belgica|volume=109|issue=2|pages=159\u2013166|issn=0001-5458|pmid=19499674}}</ref>  See [[free flap breast reconstruction]] for more information.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n** '''Mold-assisted reconstruction''' Made using laser scanning and 3D printing, a patient-specific silicone mold can be used as an aid during surgery. It is used as a guide for orienting and shaping the flap to improve accuracy and symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1758-5082/3/3/034114 |pmid=21900731 |title=CAD/CAM-assisted breast reconstruction |journal=Biofabrication |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=034114 |year=2011 |last1=Melchels |first1=Ferry |last2=Wiggenhauser |first2=Paul Severin |last3=Warne |first3=David |last4=Barry |first4=Mark |last5=Ong |first5=Fook Rhu |last6=Chong |first6=Woon Shin |last7=Hutmacher |first7=Dietmar Werner |last8=Schantz |first8=Jan-Thorsten |bibcode=2011BioFa...3c4114M }}</ref>\n** '''Direct to Implant (\"One-Step\") Breast Reconstruction''' Post-mastectomy reconstruction with a direct to implant, or \"one-step\" approach allows for a single-stage reconstruction of the breast mound in select patients. This approach is best suited for patients with good preservation of the breast skin after mastectomy. A permanent implant is inserted immediately following the mastectomy, forgoing the initial placement of a tissue expander and subsequent expansion process.  At the time of the initial post mastectomy reconstruction operation, the implant is positioned on the chest wall behind the pectoralis major muscle. Today, with the use of a dermal matrix (such as AlloDerm\u00ae), the surgeon can frequently use a permanent implant of the desired definitive volume during the initial surgery, provided the amount and quality of the breast skin remaining after mastectomy can accommodate the volume. The patient will have the definitive breast volume and approximate shape after the first operation. Depending on the quality of the result after allowing the initial reconstruction to settle and heal for a few months, a second stage reconstruction creating a more refined breast shape may still be desirable. This is an outpatient procedure that involves minor refinements in contour and symmetry potentially without exchanging the implant. The initial implant placement, and possible second stage, each take about one hour in the operating room.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cassileth|first1=Lisa|last2=Kohanzadeh|first2=Soma|last3=Amersi|first3=Farin|title=One-Stage Immediate Breast Reconstruction With Implants: A New Option for Immediate Reconstruction|journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery|date=August 2012|pages=134\u20138|doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e3182250c60|pmid=21734545}}</ref>\n\nA [[Cochrane review]] published in 2016 concluded that implants for use in breast reconstructive surgery have not been adequately studied in good quality clinical trials. \"These days - even after a few million women have had breasts reconstructed - surgeons cannot inform women about the risks and complications of different implant-based breast reconstructive options on the basis of results derived from [[Randomized Controlled Trial]]s.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010895.pub2 |pmid=27182693 |title=Different types of implants for reconstructive breast surgery |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |issue=5 |pages=CD010895 |year=2016 |last1=Rocco |first1=Nicola |last2=Rispoli |first2=Corrado |last3=Moja |first3=Lorenzo |last4=Amato |first4=Bruno |last5=Iannone |first5=Loredana |last6=Testa |first6=Serena |last7=Spano |first7=Andrea |last8=Catanuto |first8=Giuseppe |last9=Accurso |first9=Antonello |last10=Nava |first10=Maurizio B }}</ref>\n\n==Other considerations==\n[[File:Blausen 0139 BreastReconstruction Prosthesis.png|thumb|Breast Reconstruction using a Prosthesis]]\n\nTo restore the appearance of the breast with surgical reconstruction, there are a few options regarding the nipple and areola.\n*A [[nipple prosthesis]] can be used to restore the appearance of the reconstructed breast. Impressions can be made and photographs can be used to accurately replace the nipple lost with some types of mastectomies. This can be instrumental in restoring the psychological well-being of the breast cancer survivor. The same process can be used to replicate the remaining nipple in cases of a single mastectomy. Ideally, a prosthesis is made around the time of the mastectomy and it can be used just weeks after the surgery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n*Nipple reconstruction is usually delayed until after the breast mound reconstruction is completed so that the positioning can be planned precisely. There are several methods of reconstructing the nipple-areolar complex, including:\n** ''Nipple-Areolar Composite Graft (Sharing)'' - if the contralateral breast has not been reconstructed and the nipple and areolar are sufficiently large, tissue may be harvested and used to recreate the nipple-areolar complex on the reconstructed side.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n** ''Local Tissue Flaps'' - a nipple may be created by raising a small flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin. To create an areola, a circular incision may be made around the new nipple and sutured back again. The nipple and areolar region may then be tattooed to produce a realistic colour match with the contralateral breast.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n** ''Local Tissue Flaps With Use of AlloDerm'' - as above, a nipple may be created by raising a small flap in the target area and producing a raised mound of skin. AlloDerm (cadaveric dermis) can then be inserted into the core of the new nipple acting like a \"strut\" which may help maintain the projection of the nipple for a longer period of time. The nipple and areolar region may then be tattooed later.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000258831.38615.80 |pmid=17440338 |title=Use of AlloDerm in Primary Nipple Reconstruction to Improve Long-Term Nipple Projection |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1663\u20138 |year=2007 |last1=Garramone |first1=Charles E. |last2=Lam |first2=Benjamin }}</ref> There are however some important issues in relation to NAC Tattooing that should be considered prior to opting for tattooing, such as the choice of pigments and equipment used for the procedure.<ref>[http://www.cosmetictattoo.org/article/3d-nipple-tattooing-a-new-service.html A.

This strain is further increased by fusion to a second ring, as found in most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. This trend is due to the amide character of the \u03b2-lactam being reduced by the [[Plane (geometry)|aplanarity]] of the system. The nitrogen atom of an ideal amide is [[Orbital hybridisation|sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized]] due to [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]], and sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized atoms have [[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|trigonal planar bond geometry]]. As a [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramidal]] bond geometry is forced upon the nitrogen atom by the ring strain, the resonance of the amide bond is reduced, and the carbonyl becomes more [[ketone]]-like. [[Nobel laureate]] [[Robert Burns Woodward]] described a parameter ''h'' as a measure of the height of the trigonal pyramid defined by the nitrogen (as the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]]) and its three adjacent atoms. ''h'' corresponds to the strength of the \u03b2-lactam bond with lower numbers (more planar; more like ideal amides) being stronger and less reactive.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woodward | first1 = R.B. | year = 1980 | title = Penems and related substances | url = | journal = Phil.

({{lang-la|Episcopatus Brandenburgensis}} or ''Dioecesis Brandenburgensis'') was a [[Roman Catholic]] [[diocese]] established by King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I of Germany]] in 948, in the territory of the ''[[Marca Geronis]]'' ([[Saxon Eastern March]]) east of the [[Elbe]] river. The bishopric was a [[suffragan diocese]] of the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]], its seat was [[Brandenburg an der Havel]]. \n\nThe [[Prince-bishop]]ric of Brandenburg ({{lang-de|Hochstift Brandenburg}}) was a [[Imperial State|state]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for some time, probably starting about 1161/1165. However, the Brandenburg bishops never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on the ''Dominsel'' (Cathedral Island), which formed a prince-episcopal [[Domfreiheit|cathedral immunity district]] (''Domfreiheit''), distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Brb dom 19jh.jpg|thumb|left|The Cathedral of Ss. Peter and Paul in Brandenburg, 19th century]] \nThe foundation charter of the Brandenburg diocese is dated 1 October 948, though the actual founding date remained disputed among historians. The medieval chronicler [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] mentions the year 938; the bishopric may also have been established in the course of the partition of the vast ''Marca Geronis'' and the emergence of the [[Northern March]] after Margrave [[Gero]]'s death in 965. With the foundation, King Otto ([[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 962) aimed at the [[Christianization]] of the [[Polabian Slavs]] ([[Wends]]) and the incorporation of their territory into the [[East Francia|East Frankish]] realm.\n\nBrandenburg was originally a suffragan of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], but in 968 it came under the jurisdiction of the Magdeburg archbishops. The [[Great Slav Rising]] of 983 practically annihilated it, when revolting [[Lutici]] tribes conquered Brandenburg and the neighbouring [[Bishopric of Havelberg]]. Brandenburg bishops continued to be appointed, but they were merely titular, residing in Magdeburg or acting as [[auxiliary bishop]]s in the western territories of the Empire. Not until the final subjugation of the Wends in the 12th century by Margrave [[Albert the Bear]], the [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward settlement]] (''Ostsiedlung'') in the diocesan region revived the bishopric. \n\nBishop Wigers of Brandenburg (acting 1138\u201360), an adherent of [[Norbert of Xanten]], was the first of a series of bishops of the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] Order, which chose the occupants of the [[episcopal see]] until 1447; in that year a bull of [[Pope Nicholas V]] gave the right of nomination to the Brandenburg [[Prince-elector|elector]], with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation. Bishop Wigers also established a Premonstratensian convent at [[Gommern|Leitzkau]] (today part of Gommern, Saxony-Anhalt). Probably at the request of the [[Hevelli]]an prince [[Pribislav-Henry]], he established another convent at the Slavic ''Parduin'' settlement in present-day Brandenburg an der Havel, which became the nucleus of the revived Brandenburg cathedral chapter. The incorporation into the Premonstratensian Order was confirmed by [[Pope Clement III]] in 1188.\n[[File:Burg Ziesar 14.jpg|thumb|left|Ziesar Castle, now a museum also showing the history of the Prince-Bishopric of Brandenburg]] \nAs rulers of [[imperial immediacy]], regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks ({{lang-de|\u00c4mter}}) of Brandenburg/Havel, [[Ketzin]], [[Teltow]] and [[Ziesar]]. The prince-bishops from the early 14th century onwards resided in their fortress in Ziesar on the road to [[Magdeburg]]. The last actual bishop was [[Matthias von Jagow]] (d. 1544), who took the side of the [[Protestant Reformation]], married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] elector [[Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]].\n\nThere were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg|John George of Brandenburg]] appointed in 1560, the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished in 1571, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the prince-bishopric within the Empire and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the 17th century.\n\n==Bishops of Brandenburg==\n*

is [[parachuting]] or [[wingsuit flying]] from a fixed structure or cliff. \"BASE\" is an [[acronym]] that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: [[building]], [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], [[Span (architecture)|span]], and earth ([[cliff]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=BASENumbers.org |publisher=BASENumbers.org

the lower altitudes of the jumps, BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than [[skydiving]] from a plane. In the U.S., BASE jumping is currently regarded by many as a fringe [[extreme sport]] or [[stunt]].<ref name=ch-trib-thrill>{{cite news |last=Dizikes |first=Cynthia |title=BASE jumpers fall for thrill-seeking lifestyle |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-04-22/news/ct-met-basejumping-20110421_1_base-jumpers-thrill-arrest |accessdate=15 March 2012 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=April 22, 2011}}</ref> In some jurisdictions or locations, BASE jumping is prohibited or illegal; however, in some places it is permitted such as [[Perrine Bridge]] in Twin Falls, Idaho. BASE jumping became known to the wider public through depictions in a number of action movies and being featured in the 2014 documentary [[Sunshine Superman (film)|''Sunshine Superman'']].\n\n==History==\nThe acronym \"B.A.S.E.\" (now more commonly \"BASE\") was coined by filmmaker [[Carl Boenish]], his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=Roger|title=The Whole World Is Jumpable|journal=Time|date=July 1999|volume=154|issue=3|page=94|issn=0040-781X}}</ref> Carl Boenish was the catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978, he filmed the first BASE jumps to be made using ram-air parachutes and the [[Tracking (freeflying)|freefall tracking technique]] (from [[El Capitan]] in [[Yosemite National Park]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Jack|title=Who Needs An Airplane?|date=August 26, 1985|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|volume=63|issue=9}}</ref> While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.\n\nBASE numbers are awarded to those who have made at least one jump from each of the four categories (buildings, antennas, spans and earth). When Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981, they became the first to attain the exclusive BASE numbers (BASE #1 and #2, respectively), having already jumped from an antenna, [[span (architecture)|spans]], and earthen objects. Jean and Carl Boenish qualified for BASE numbers 3 and 4 soon after. A separate \"award\" was soon enacted for Night BASE jumping when Mayfield completed each category at night, becoming Night BASE #1, with Smith qualifying a few weeks later.\n\n[[Fausto Veranzio]] is widely believed to have performed a parachute jumping experiment for real<ref>\nFrancis Trevelyan Miller, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=viUBTKObG4my-Aaik-m2Dw&ct=result&hl=en&id=MdDNAAAAMAAJ&dq=Veranzio+Fausto&q=%22Fausto+Veranzio%22#search_anchor The world in the air: the story of flying in pictures], G.P.

After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as a publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the [[Troll Wall]]. By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.\n\nDuring the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.\n\n[[File:04KJER0243.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Jumpers from a cliff]]\nUpon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a \"BASE number\", awarded sequentially.<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=Base Numbers |publisher=Base Numbers |accessdate=2010-05-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511195457/http://www.basenumbers.org/| archivedate= 11 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt \"Harley\" Moilanen of Grand Rapids, Michigan. {{As of|2017|05}}, over 2,000 BASE numbers have been issued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basenumbers.org/ |title=BASENumbers.org |publisher=BASENumbers.org |accessdate=2017-05-19}}</ref>\n\n''[[Guinness World Records]]'' first listed a BASE jumping record with [[Carl Boenish]]'s 1984 leap from Trollveggen ([[Troll Wall]]) in Norway. It was described as the highest BASE jump.<ref name=\"record\">Here meaning \"greatest vertical descent,\" not \"highest starting elevation.\"</ref> (The jump was made two days before Boenish's death at the same site.) This record category is still in the ''Guinness'' book and is currently held by Valery Rozov. On 5 October 2016, Russia\u2019s [[Valery Rozov]] leapt from a height of around 7,700 m (25,262&nbsp;ft) from Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the Himalayas, located on the China/Nepal border. He fell for around 90 seconds before opening his parachute, landing on a glacier approximately two minutes later at an altitude of around 6,000 m (19,685&nbsp;ft).  On July 8, 2006 Captain Daniel G. Schilling set the Guinness World Record for the most BASE jumps in a twenty-four-hour period. Schilling jumped off the [[Perrine Bridge]] in Twin Falls, Idaho, a record 201 times.\n\nBASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the {{convert|452|m|feet}} high [[Petronas Towers]] in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://base-jumping.eu/what-is-base-jumping/|title=Base Jumping - history, informations and facts|website=base-jumping.eu|access-date=2016-10-10}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn 2018 at Eikesdalen, Norway a world record was sat with 69 BASE jumpers jumping from the cliff Katthammaren.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Notable jumps==\n* In 1912, [[Franz Reichelt]], tailor, jumped from the first deck of the [[Eiffel Tower]] testing his invention, the coat parachute.

BASE jumps are generally made from much lower altitudes than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform. Because BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach [[terminal velocity]]. Because higher airspeeds enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, as well as more positive and quick parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as [[skydiving]] from aircraft.<ref name=\"ch-trib-thrill\"/>\n\nSkydivers use the air flow to stabilize their position, allowing the parachute to deploy cleanly. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control, and may tumble. The [[aircraft attitude|attitude]] of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight, so if a poor \"launch\" leads into a tumble, the jumper may not be able to correct this before the opening. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is tumbling, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.\n\nAt an altitude of {{convert|600|m}}, having been in free-fall for at least {{convert|300|m}}, a skydiver is falling at approximately {{convert|55|m/s|mph}}, and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than {{convert|600|m}}. For example, a BASE jump from a {{convert|150|m}} object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and parachute containers, with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since there would be little time to utilize a reserve parachute. In the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the deployment bag and [[slider (parachuting)|slider]], stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as \"line-overs\" and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.\n\nAnother risk is that most BASE jumping venues have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after parachute deployment, may have a three-minute or more parachute ride to the ground. A BASE jump from {{convert|150|m}} will have a parachute ride of only 10 to 15 seconds.\n\nOne way to make a parachute open very quickly is to use a [[static line]] or direct bag. These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps\u2014below {{convert|60|m}}\u2014to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the [[paratrooper]]'s deployment system, also called a PCA (short for pilot chute assist).\n\n==Legality==\n[[File:BASE jumping - Perrine Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|A BASE jumper leaving the [[Perrine Bridge]] in [[Idaho]]]]\nBASE jumping itself is generally not illegal in most places. However, in many cases such as building and antenna jumps, jumping is done covertly, because the owners of these objects are generally reluctant to allow their object to be used as a platform. Jumpers who are caught can expect to be charged with trespassing, as well as having charges like breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, vandalism, or other such charges pressed against them. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. [[Perrine Bridge]] in [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], is an example of a manmade structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.\n[[File:Bridge day exit.jpg|alt=BASE jump on Bridge Day|thumb|A BASE jumper makes a legal jump on Bridge Day at the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[Fayetteville, West Virginia]].]]\n\nOnce a year, on the third Saturday in October (\"[[Bridge Day]]\"), permission to BASE jump has explicitly been granted at the [[New River Gorge Bridge]] in [[Fayetteville, West Virginia]]. The New River Gorge Bridge deck is 876 feet (267 m) above the river. This annual event attracts about 450 BASE jumpers and nearly 200,000 spectators.<ref name=bridge-day>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeday.info |title=Bridge Day 2013 - BASE Jumping Registration and Event Information |publisher=Bridgeday.info |accessdate=2014-02-04}}</ref> 1,100 jumps may occur during the six hours that it's legal provided good conditions. On October 21, 2006, veteran BASE jumper [[Brian Lee Schubert]] of [[Alta Loma, Rancho Cucamonga, California|Alta Loma, California]], died while jumping from the New River Gorge Bridge during Bridge Day activities because his parachute opened late; he plummeted to his death in the waters below. Jumps continued after the recovery of his body.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-21-wv-jump_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=BASE jumper dies at bridge event in West Virginia | date=22 October 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> He and his friend [[Michael Pelkey]] were the first to make a BASE jump from [[El Capitan]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] in 1966.\n\nThe [[National Park Service]] has the authority to ban specific activities in [[US National Parks|U.S. National Parks]] and has done so for BASE jumping. The authority comes from 36 CFR 2.17(3), which prohibits, \"Delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit.\" Under that Regulation, BASE is not banned, but is allowable if a permit is issued by the Superintendent, which means that a mechanism to allow BASE in National Parks was always in place. The 2001 National Park Service Management Policies state that BASE \"is not an appropriate public use activity within national park areas ...\" (2001 Management Policy 8.2.2.7.)  However, Policy 8.2.2.7 in the 2006 volume of National Park Service Management Policies, which superseded the 2001 edition, states \"Parachuting (or BASE jumping), whether from an aircraft, structure, or natural feature, is generally prohibited by 36 CFR 2.17(a)(3). However, if determined through a park planning process to be an appropriate activity, it may be allowed pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit.\"\n\nDuring the early days of BASE jumping, the NPS issued permits that authorized jumps from [[El Capitan]]. This program ran for three months in 1980 and then collapsed amid allegations of abuse by unauthorized jumpers. The NPS has since vigorously enforced the ban, charging jumpers with \"aerial delivery into a National Park\".  One jumper drowned in the [[Merced River]] while evading arresting park rangers, having declared \"No way are they gonna get me. Let them chase me\u2014I'll just laugh in their faces and jump in the river\".<ref>{{cite news| url= http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/page/Mag15lastbase/frank-gambalie-lived-died-base-jumping-espn-magazine-archives | work= ESPN Magazine | title= Frank Gambalie Lived and Died for BASE Jumping | date= 2000-02-21}}</ref> Despite incidents like this one, illegal jumps continue in Yosemite at a rate estimated at a few hundred per year, often at night or dawn.

For example, in Norway's [[Lysefjord]] (from the mountain [[Kjerag]]), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near [[Chamonix]] and on the [[Eiger]], are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the [[Troll Wall]], are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past. In Austria, jumping from mountain cliffs is generally allowed, whereas the use of bridges (such as the [[Europabruecke]] near [[Innsbruck]], [[Tirol (state)|Tirol]]) or dams is generally prohibited. Australia has some of the toughest stances on BASE jumping: it specifically bans BASE jumping from certain objects, such as the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/bridge-base-jumper-faces-charges-if-he-lives-20050415-gdl4r7.html|title=Bridge BASE jumper faces charges if he lives|date=2005-04-14|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref>\n\n==Fatalities==\nA study of BASE jumping fatalities estimated that the overall annual fatality risk during the year 2002 was one fatality per 60 participants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Westman |first=A |author2=Rosen, M |author3=Berggren, P |author4=Bjornstig, U |title=Parachuting from fixed objects: descriptive study of 106 fatal events in BASE jumping 1981-2006 |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |date=7 April 2008 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=431\u2013436 |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.046565 |pmid=18523039 |url=http://bjsportmed.com/content/42/6/431.abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301214219/http://bjsportmed.com/content/42/6/431.abstract |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df= }}</ref> A study of 20,850 BASE jumps from the same site (the Kjerag Massif in Norway) reported nine fatalities over the 11-year period from 1995 to 2005, or one in every 2,317 jumps.<ref name=\"Soreide 2007 1113\u20137\">{{cite journal|last=Soreide|first=K|last2=Ellingsen |first2=CL |last3=Knutson |first3=V|title=How dangerous is BASE jumping?

The 2002 [[Vin Diesel]] film ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]'' includes a scene where Diesel's character catapults himself off the [[Foresthill Bridge]] in an open-topped car, landing safely as the car crashes on the ground. The movie ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]'' includes a scene in which the main characters jump with [[wingsuit]]s from the [[Shanghai IFC|IFC Tower]] in [[Hong Kong]] and fly over the Bank of China, finally opening their parachutes to land on a moving freighter. The stunt was done live, with no special effects, by base jumpers Martin Ros\u00e9n and Per Eriksson, members of the Swedish \"Team Bautasten\". The scene was filmed by air-to-air cameraman Mikael Nordqvist, from the same team. Since the 1976 [[Mount Asgard]] jump featured in the pre-credit sequence to ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', James Bond movies have featured several BASE jumps, including one from the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1985's ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] in 1987's ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', and in 2002's ''[[Die Another Day]]'', [[Pierce Brosnan]] as [[James Bond]] jumps from a melting iceberg. Of the James Bond jumps, only the Mount Asgard and Eiffel Tower jumps were filmed live; the rest were special effects. In 2005's ''[[Batman Begins]]'', Bruce Wayne uses BASE jumping as inspiration for his memory cloth cape.

An \"ideal beauty\" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.\n\n[[Unattractiveness|Ugliness]] is considered to be the opposite of beauty.\n\nThe experience of \"beauty\" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and [[harmony]] with [[nature]], which may lead to feelings of [[sexual attraction|attraction]] and [[emotional well-being]].

However, ''kalos'' may and is also translated as \u2033good\u2033 or \u2033of fine quality\u2033 and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, ''kallos'' was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Konstan|first1=David|title=Beauty - The Fortunes of an Ancient Greek Idea|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-992726-5|pages=30\u201335}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Koine Greek]] word for beautiful was \u1f61\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, ''h\u014draios'',<ref>Matthew 23:27, Acts 3:10, Flavius Josephus, 12.65</ref> an adjective etymologically coming from the word \u1f65\u03c1\u03b1, ''h\u014dra'', meaning \"hour\". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with \"being of one's hour\".<ref name=\"Euripides, Alcestis 515\">Euripides, ''Alcestis'' 515.</ref> Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, ''h\u014draios'' had many meanings, including \"youthful\" and \"ripe old age\".<ref name=\"Euripides, Alcestis 515\"/>\n\nThe [[Beauty (ancient thought)|earliest Western theory of beauty]] can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the [[pre-Socratic]] period, such as [[Pythagoras]]. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between [[mathematics]] and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the [[golden ratio]] seemed more attractive.<ref>Seife, Charles (2000). ''[[Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea]]''. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-029647-6}}. p. 32</ref> [[Ancient Greek architecture]] is based on this view of symmetry and [[ratio|proportion]].\n\nPlato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas.<ref>Phaedrus</ref> Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful (''to kalon'') and virtue, arguing that \"Virtue aims at the beautiful.\"<ref>Nicomachean Ethics</ref>\n\n[[Classical philosophy]] and sculptures of men and women produced according to the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]]' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in [[Renaissance]] Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a \"classical ideal\". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose [[human physical appearance|appearance]] conforms to these tenets is still called a \"classical beauty\" or said to possess a \"classical beauty\", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, [[Renaissance]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his \"Lives of Artists\") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of [[Gothic art]] lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.\n\n==The Age of Reason==\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'', by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

For example, Scottish philosopher [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] argued that beauty is \"unity in variety and variety in unity\".<ref>An Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue; In Two Treatises</ref> The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of beauty, with [[John Keats]] arguing in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that\n\n:  Beauty is truth, truth beauty, \u2014that is all.\n:  Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\n\n==The Romantic period==\nIn the Romantic period, [[Edmund Burke]] postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==The 20th century and after==\nThe 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in [[postmodernism]]'s anti-aesthetics.<ref>The Anti-Aesthetic: Essays on Postmodern Culture by Hal Foster</ref> This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.<ref>The Will to Power</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher [[Guy Sircello]] proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept.<ref>A New Theory of Beauty.

Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume.  This pattern describes a fluid at [[thermal equilibrium]], defined by a given [[temperature]]. Within such fluid there exists no preferential direction of flow as in [[transport phenomena]].  More specifically the fluid's overall [[Linear momentum|linear]] and [[Angular momentum|angular]] momenta remain null over time.  It is important also to note that the [[Kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations [[Equipartition theorem|sum up to the caloric component]] of a fluid\u2019s [[internal energy]].\n\nThis motion is named after the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]], who was the most eminent microscopist of his time. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant Clarkia Pulchella immersed in water, the triangular shaped pollen burst at the corners, emitting particles which he noted jiggled around in the water in random fashion. He was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion. [[Atomic theory|Atoms and molecules]] had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and [[Albert Einstein]] published [[\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|a paper in 1905]] that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first big contributions to science. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by [[Jean Baptiste Perrin|Jean Perrin]] in 1908. Perrin was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1926 \"for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter\". The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.\n\nThe [[Many-body problem|many-body interactions]] that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. In consequence only probabilistic models applied to [[Statistical ensemble|molecular populations]] can be employed to describe it.  Two such models of the [[statistical mechanics]], due to Einstein and Smoluchowski are presented below.  Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the [[stochastic process]] models.  There exist both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which in extreme (\"taken to the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]\") may describe the Brownian Motion (see [[random walk]] and [[Donsker's theorem]]).\n\n==History==\n\nThe Roman [[Lucretius]]'s scientific poem \"[[On the Nature of Things]]\" (c. 60 BC) has a remarkable description of Brownian motion of dust particles in verses 113\u2013140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:\n[[File:PerrinPlot2.svg|thumb|Reproduced from the book of [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]], ''Les Atomes'', three tracings of the motion of colloidal particles of radius 0.53&nbsp;\u00b5m, as seen under the microscope, are displayed. Successive positions every 30 seconds are joined by straight line segments (the mesh size is 3.2&nbsp;\u00b5m).<ref>{{cite book |last=Perrin |first=Jean |year=1914 |title=Atoms |url=https://archive.org/stream/atomsper00perruoft#page/115/mode/1up |page=115}}</ref>]]\n\n\"Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.\"\n\nAlthough the mingling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, tumbling motion of small dust particles is, indeed, caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics.\n\nWhile [[Jan Ingenhousz]] described the irregular motion of [[coal]] [[dust]] particles on the surface of [[ethanol|alcohol]] in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] in 1827. Brown was studying [[pollen]] grains of the plant ''[[Clarkia pulchella]]'' suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.\n\nThe first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was [[Thorvald N. Thiele]] in a paper on the method of [[least squares]] published in 1880. This was followed independently by [[Louis Bachelier]] in 1900 in his PhD thesis \"The theory of speculation\", in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian motion model of the [[stock market]] is often cited, but [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=B.\n |last2=Hudson |first2=R.\n |year=2004\n |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward\n |publisher=[[Basic Books]]\n |isbn=978-0-465-04355-2\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] (in one of his [[\u00dcber die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der W\u00e4rme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Fl\u00fcssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen|1905 papers]]) and [[Marian Smoluchowski]] (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of [[Jean Baptiste Perrin]] in 1908.\n\n==Statistical mechanics theories==\n\n=== Einstein's theory ===\nThere are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the [[mean squared displacement]] of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities.<ref name=Eistein1956>\n{{cite book\n |last=Einstein |first=Albert\n |year=1956 |origyear=1926\n |title=Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement\n |url=http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf\n |publisher=Dover Publications\n |accessdate=2013-12-25\n}}</ref> In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |editor-last=Stachel |editor-first=J.\n |year=1989\n |chapter=Einstein's Dissertation on the Determination of Molecular Dimensions\n |chapter-url=http://www.csun.edu/~dchoudhary/Physics-Year_files/ed_diss.pdf\n |title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, Volume 2\n |publisher=Princeton University Press\n}}</ref> In accordance to [[Avogadro's law]] this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as [[Avogadro constant|Avogadro's constant]], and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by Avogadro's constant.\n\n[[File:Diffusion of Brownian particles.svg|thumb|300px|The characteristic bell-shaped curves of the diffusion of Brownian particles.

The integral in the first term is equal to one by the definition of probability, and the second and other even terms (i.e. first and other odd moments) vanish because of space symmetry. What is left gives rise to the following relation:\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\rho}{\\partial x^2} \\cdot \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2\\, \\tau} \\cdot \\varphi(\\Delta) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\Delta + \\text{higher-order even moments}\n</math>\n\nWhere the coefficient before the Laplacian, the second moment of probability of displacement <math>\\Delta</math>, is interpreted as [[mass diffusivity]] ''D'':\n\n:<math> D = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{\\Delta^2}{2\\, \\tau} \\cdot \\varphi(\\Delta) \\, \\mathrm{d} \\Delta </math>\n\nThen the density of Brownian particles \u03c1 at point ''x'' at time ''t'' satisfies the [[diffusion equation]]:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t}=D\\cdot \\frac{\\partial^2\\rho}{\\partial x^2},</math>\n\nAssuming that N particles start from the origin at the initial time t=0, the diffusion equation has the solution\n\n:<math>\\rho(x,t)=\\frac{N}{\\sqrt{4\\pi Dt}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{4Dt}}.</math>\n\nThis expression (which is a [[normal distribution]] with the mean <math> \\mu=0</math> and variance <math> \\sigma^2=2Dt</math> usually called Brownian motion <math> B_t</math>) allowed Einstein to calculate the [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] directly. The first moment is seen to vanish, meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing, being given by\n\n:<math>\\overline{x^2}=2\\,D\\,t.</math>\n\nThis expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time, but rather to its square root.<ref name=Eistein1956/> His argument is based on a conceptual switch from the \"ensemble\" of Brownian particles to the \"single\" Brownian particle: we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Lavenda |first=Bernard H.\n |year=1985\n |title=Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics\n |page=20\n |publisher=John Wiley & Sons\n |isbn=978-0-471-90670-4\n}}</ref>\n\nThe second part of Einstein's theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the experimental determination of Avogadro's number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.\n\nIn his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways.\n\nConsider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of ''v'' = \u03bc''mg'', where ''m'' is the mass of the particle, ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity, and \u03bc is the particle's [[Einstein relation (kinetic theory)|mobility]] in the fluid. [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Stokes]] had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius ''r'' is <math>\\mu=\\tfrac{1}{6\\pi\\eta r}</math>, where \u03b7 is the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, and under the hypothesis of isothermal fluid, the particles are distributed according to the [[Barometric formula|barometric distribution]]\n\n:<math>\\rho=\\rho_0e^{-\\frac{mgh}{k_BT}},</math>\n\nwhere \u03c1\u2212\u03c1<sub>0</sub> is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference of ''h'', ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]] (namely, the ratio of the [[universal gas constant]], ''R'', to Avogadro's number, ''N''), and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].  Avogadro's number is to be determined.\n\n[[File:Brownian motion gamboge.jpg|thumb|The equilibrium distribution for particles of [[gamboge]] shows the tendency for granules to move to regions of lower concentration when affected by gravity.]]\n[[Dynamic equilibrium]] is established because the more that particles are pulled down by [[gravity]], the greater the tendency for the particles to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fick's law]],\n\n:<math>J=-D\\frac{d\\rho}{dh},</math>\n\nwhere ''J'' = \u03c1''v''. Introducing the formula for \u03c1, we find that\n\n:<math>v=\\frac{Dmg}{k_BT}.</math>\n\nIn a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must also be equal to ''v'' = \u03bc''mg''. Notice that both expressions for ''v'' are proportional to ''mg'', reflecting that the derivation is independent of the type of forces considered. Similarly, one can derive an equivalent formula for identical [[Charged particle|charged particles]] of charge q in a uniform [[electric field]] of magnitude ''E'', where ''mg'' is replaced with the [[electrostatic force]] ''qE''.  Equating these two expressions yields a formula for the diffusivity, independent of ''mg'' or ''qE'' or other such forces:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\overline{x^2}}{2t}=D=\\mu k_BT=\\frac{\\mu RT}{N}=\\frac{RT}{6\\pi\\eta rN}.</math>\n\nHere the first equality follows from the first part of Einstein's theory, the third equality follows from the definition of [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]] as ''k<sub>B</sub>'' = ''R / N'', and the fourth equality follows from Stokes's formula for the mobility. By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant ''R'', the temperature ''T'', the viscosity \u03b7, and the particle radius ''r'', Avogadro's number ''N'' can be determined.\n\nThe type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by [[J. J. Thomson]]<ref name=Electricity>\n{{cite book\n |last=Thomson |first=J. J.\n |year=1904\n |title=Electricity and Matter\n |pages=80\u201383\n |publisher=Yale University Press\n}}</ref> in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a [[concentration gradient]] given by Fick's law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion \"gives us a method of determining Avogadro's Constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other\".<ref name=Electricity/>\n\nAn identical expression to Einstein's formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by [[Walther Nernst]] in 1888<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Nernst |first=Walther\n |year=1888\n |title=Zur Kinetik der in L\u00f6sung befindlichen K\u00f6rper\n |language=de\n |journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]]\n |volume=9 |pages=613\u2013637\n}}</ref> in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the [[osmotic pressure]] to the ratio of the [[Friction|frictional force]] and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the [[Van 't Hoff factor|law of van 't Hoff]] while the latter was given by [[Stokes's law]]. He writes <math>k'=p_0/k</math> for the diffusion coefficient ''k\u2032'', where <math>p_0</math> is the osmotic pressure and ''k'' is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes's formula for the viscosity.

Clark 1976, p. 97</ref> But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory of heat]]. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of [[thermal equilibrium]]. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the [[Second law of thermodynamics|second law]] of [[thermodynamics]] as being an essentially statistical law.<ref>See P.

Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be ''mu''/''M''. This ratio is of the order of 10<sup>\u22127</sup>&nbsp;cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 10<sup>16</sup> collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 10<sup>20</sup> collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000&nbsp;cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.\n\nThese orders of magnitude are not exact because they don't take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, ''U'', which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger ''U'' is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, <math>MU^2/2</math>, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, <math>mu^2/2</math>.\n\nIn 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=von Smoluchowski |first=M.\n |year=1906\n |title=Zur kinetischen Theorie der Brownschen Molekularbewegung und der Suspensionen\n |language=de\n |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]]\n |volume=326 |issue=14 |pages=756\u2013780\n |bibcode=1906AnP...326..756V\n |doi=10.1002/andp.19063261405\n}}</ref> The model assumes collisions with ''M''&nbsp;\u226b&nbsp;''m'' where ''M'' is the test particle's mass and ''m'' the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of \u0394''V''. If ''N<sub>R</sub>'' is the number of collisions from the right and ''N<sub>L</sub>'' the number of collisions from the left then after ''N'' collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by \u0394''V''(2''N''<sub>R</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''N''). The [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] is then simply given by:\n\n:<math> \\binom{N}{N_R} = \\frac{N!}{N_R!(N-N_R)!}</math>\n\nand the total number of possible states is given by 2<sup>''N''</sup>. Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right ''N<sub>R</sub>'' times is:\n\n:<math>P_N(N_R)=\\frac{N!}{2^NN_R!(N-N_R)!}</math>\n\nAs a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible \u0394''V''s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.\n\n===Other physics models using partial differential equations===\nThe [[diffusion equation]] yields an approximation of the time evolution of the [[probability density function]] associated to the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on [[Langevin equation|short]] timescales.\n\nThe time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself is best described using [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the particle.\n\nThe displacement of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the [[diffusion equation]] under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the [[root mean square|rms]] of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave nonsensical results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.\n\nAt very short time scales, however, the motion of a particle is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: \u0394''x'' = ''v''\u0394''t''. So the instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as ''v'' = \u0394''x''/\u0394''t'', when \u0394''t'' << ''\u03c4'', where ''\u03c4'' is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical tweezer) was measured successfully.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Li |first=Tongcang\n |last2=Kheifets |first2=Simon\n |last3=Medellin |first3=David\n |last4=Raizen |first4=Mark\n |year=2010\n |title=Measurement of the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=328 |issue=5986 |pages=1673\u20131675\n |bibcode=2010Sci...328.1673L\n |doi=10.1126/science.1189403\n |pmid=20488989\n|url=http://chaos.utexas.edu/wp-uploads/2010/06/science.1189403v1.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.167.8245\n }}</ref> The velocity data verified the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution]], and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.\n\n===Astrophysics: star motion within galaxies===\nIn [[stellar dynamics]], a massive body (star, [[black hole]], etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to [[gravitational|gravitational forces]] from surrounding stars.<ref name=Merritt>\n{{cite book\n |last=Merritt |first=David\n |year=2013\n |title=Dynamics and Evolution of Galactic Nuclei\n |page=575\n |publisher=Princeton University Press\n |isbn=9781400846122\n |ol=16802359W\n}}</ref> The rms velocity ''V'' of the massive object, of mass ''M'', is related to the rms velocity <math>v_\\star</math> of the background stars by\n:<math> MV^2 \\approx m v_\\star^2 </math>\nwhere <math>m\\ll M</math> is the mass of the background stars.

In the [[scaling limit]], random walk approaches the Wiener process according to [[Donsker's theorem]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], Brownian motion is described by the '''Wiener process'''; a continuous-time [[stochastic process]] named in honor of [[Norbert Wiener]]. It is one of the best known [[L\u00e9vy process]]es ([[c\u00e0dl\u00e0g]] stochastic processes with [[stationary process|stationary]] [[independent increments]]) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, [[economy|economics]] and [[physics]].\n[[File:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|A single realisation of three-dimensional Brownian motion for times 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;2]]\n\nThe Wiener process ''W<sub>t</sub>'' is characterized by four facts{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}:\n#''W''<sub>0</sub> = 0\n#''W<sub>t</sub>'' is [[almost surely]] continuous\n#''W<sub>t</sub>'' has independent increments\n#<math>W_t-W_s\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t-s)</math> (for <math>0 \\leq s \\le t</math>).\n<math>\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)</math> denotes the [[normal distribution]] with [[expected value]] \u03bc and [[variance]] \u03c3<sup>2</sup>.

This representation can be obtained using the [[Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem]].\n\nThe Wiener process can be constructed as the [[scaling limit]] of a [[random walk]], or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as [[Donsker's theorem]]. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is [[scale invariance|scale invariant]].\n\nThe time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself can be described approximately by a [[Langevin equation]], an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the [[thermal fluctuations]] of the solvent on the Brownian particle. On long timescales, the mathematical Brownian motion is well described by a Langevin equation. On small timescales, [[inertia]]l effects are prevalent in the Langevin equation. However the mathematical ''Brownian motion'' is exempt of such inertial effects. Note that inertial effects have to be considered in the Langevin equation, otherwise the equation becomes singular.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} so that simply removing the [[inertia]] term from this equation would not yield an exact description, but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesn't move at all.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}}\n\n===Statistics===\nThe Brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Weiss |first=G.

In [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and [[edge detection]]. This observation is useful in defining Brownian motion on an ''m''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] (''M'',&nbsp;''g''): a '''Brownian motion on''' ''M'' is defined to be a diffusion on ''M'' whose characteristic operator <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> in local coordinates ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>, 1&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''m'', is given by \u00bd\u0394<sub>LB</sub>, where \u0394<sub>LB</sub> is the [[Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator]] given in local coordinates by\n\n:<math>\\Delta_{\\mathrm{LB}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\sum_{j=1}^m g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\right),</math>\n\nwhere [''g''<sup>''ij''</sup>]&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>]<sup>\u22121</sup> in the sense of [[Invertible matrix|the inverse of a square matrix]].\n\n==Narrow escape==\nThe '''[[narrow escape problem]]''' is a ubiquitous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation: a Brownian particle ([[ion]], [[molecule]], or [[protein]]) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape.

Many enterprises and public services were \"collectivized\" by the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of [[anarchist]] groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of [[Catalonia]] were abolished,<ref>Decree of 5 April 1938.</ref> and the use of the [[Catalan language]] in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]]. The result was a large-scale [[immigration]] from poorer regions of Spain (particularly [[Andalusia]], [[Murcia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n===Late twentieth century===\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]]. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53030/Barcelona Barcelona (Spain)]\".

There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as ''escoles concertades'', they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (''escoles privades'').\n\nThe language of instruction at public schools and ''escoles concertades'' is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or ''escola concertada'' in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or ''escola concertada'' offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Barcelona}}\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years.

Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\n\n[[File:14-08-06-barcelona-RalfR-222.jpg|thumb|Two typical Barcelona taxis]]\n\nBarcelona has a [[taxicab|metered taxi]] fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars.

Catalan ''[[Modernisme|modernista]]'' architecture (related to the movement known as [[Art Nouveau]] in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are [[World Heritage Site]]s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]], which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the [[Sagrada Fam\u00edlia]], which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. {{As of|2015}}, completion is planned for 2026.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/sagrada-familia-reaches-its-final-stage-of-construction/413476/ | title = Gaud\u00ed's Barcelona Basilica, La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, Reaches Its Final Stage of Construction - The Atlantic | publisher = The Atlantic | accessdate = 1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBarcelona was also home to [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s [[Barcelona Pavilion]].

Like football, the game is normally played in halves of 45 minutes each, there are eleven players on each team, and the bandy field is about the same size as a football pitch. It is played on ice like ice hockey, but like field hockey, players use bowed sticks and a small ball.\n\nA variant of bandy, [[rink bandy]], is played to the same rules but on a field the size of an ice hockey rink, with ice hockey goal cages and with six players on each team, or five in [[USA Rink Bandy League#League play|USA Rink Bandy League]]. Traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy are recognised by the [[International Olympic Committee]]. More informal varieties also exist, like seven-a-side bandy with normally sized goal cages but without corner strokes. Those rules were applied at [[Davos Cup]] in 2016.\n\nRink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport [[rinkball]]. Bandy is also the predecessor of [[floorball]], which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy-shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls.\n\nBased on the number of participating athletes, bandy is the world's second-most participated winter sport after [[ice hockey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldbandy.com/news/bandy-versus-the-50-olympic-winter-games-disciplines/|title=Bandy versus the 50 Olympic Winter Games Disciplines|date=4 December 2015|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141905/http://worldbandy.com/news/bandy-versus-the-50-olympic-winter-games-disciplines/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=FIBOct16>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_7640.html|title=Bandy destined for the Olympic Winter Games!|publisher=Federation of International Bandy|date=21 October 2016}}</ref><ref>''Bandyportf\u00f6ljen'' magazine, no. 4 20017/18, pp. 12-13</ref> Bandy is also ranked as the number two winter sport in terms of tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship.<ref name=FIBOct16/>\n\nHowever, compared with the seven [[Winter Olympic sports]], bandy's popularity [among other winter sports] across the globe is considered by the [[International Olympic Committee]] to have a, \"gap between popularity and participation and global audiences\", which is a roadblock into future Olympic inclusion.<ref name=bid>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1061027/new-sports-face-struggle-to-be-added-to-winter-olympic-games-programme-ioc-warn|title=New sports face struggle to be added to Winter Olympic Games programme, IOC warn|last=Butler|first=Nick|date=4 February 2018|website=Insidethegames.biz|publisher=Dunsar Media|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Earliest background===\nThe earliest origin of the sport is debated.

Tebbutt]</ref>\n\n===The early days===\nEnglish bandy developed as a winter sport in [[the Fens]] of [[East Anglia]]. Large expanses of ice would form on the flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters, and skating has been a tradition.

The first international match took place in 1891 between Bury Fen and the then Haarlemsche Hockey & Bandy Club from the Netherlands (a club which after a couple of club fusions now is named [[HC Bloemendaal]]). The same year, the National Bandy Association was started in England.<ref name=SBF/>\n\nThe match later dubbed \"the original bandy match\", was actually held in 1875 at [[The Crystal Palace]] in [[London]].

While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a game more similar to bandy was played initially, after British soldiers introduced the game in the late 19th century. At the same time as modern ice-hockey rules were formalized in [[British North America]] (present day Canada), bandy rules were formulated in Europe. A cross between English and Russian bandy rules eventually developed, with the football-inspired English rules dominant, together with the Russian low border along most of the two sidelines, and this is the basis of the present sport since the 1950s.\n\nBefore Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the early 20th century, \"[[hockey]]\" was another name for bandy,<ref>Nordisk Familjebok 10 Hassle-Infektera, F\u00f6rlagshuset Norden AB, Malm\u00f6 1952, \"Hockey\", column 386</ref> and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nWith football and bandy being dominant sports in parts of Europe, it was common for sports clubs to have bandy and football sections, with athletes playing both sports at different times of the year. Some examples are English Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club (today known just as [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]]) and Norwegian [[Str\u00f8msgodset IF]] and [[Mj\u00f8ndalen IF]], with the latter still having an active bandy section. In Sweden, most football clubs which were active during the first half of the 20th Century, also played bandy. Later, as the season for each sport increased in time, it wasn't as easy for the players to engage in both sports, so some clubs came to concentrate on one or the other. Many old clubs still have both sports on their program.\n\nBoth bandy and ice hockey were played in Europe during the 20th century, especially in Sweden, Finland, and Norway.<ref>Nordisk Familjebok 2 Asura-Bidz, F\u00f6rlagshuset Norden AB, Malm\u00f6 1951, \"Bandy\", columns 324\u2013326</ref> Ice hockey became more popular than bandy in most of Europe mostly because it had become an Olympic sport, while bandy had not.

In Belarusian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian it is also called \"hockey with a ball\" (\u0445\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0437 \u043c\u044f\u0447o\u043c, \u0445\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0437 \u043c'\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043c and \u0445\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0439 \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0430 respectively).

Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal.<ref name=\"worldbandy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |title=Bandy Playing Rules |date=1 September 2011 |work=Federation of International Bandy |accessdate=25 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181936/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Bandyrules_FIB_Sept2011.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe game is designed to be played on a rectangle of ice the same size as a football field. Bandy also has other rules that are similar to football. Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a [[goalkeeper]]. The [[Offside (sport)|offside]] rule is also employed.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/> A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike football, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuzilogik.com/index.php/Bandy/Bandy-Glossary.html |title=Bandy Glossary |publisher=Fuzilogik.com |accessdate=3 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129095906/http://www.fuzilogik.com/index.php/Bandy/Bandy-Glossary.html |archivedate=29 January 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> All free strokes are \"direct\" and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball.\n\nThe team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. If both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a [[tie (draw)|draw]].<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nThe primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball results in a five-minute penalty.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nIn typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a teammate, and taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the [[referee]]. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nThe rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/> but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who take the ball from the opposition and pass it to the forwards. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's ''formation'', and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s).\n\n==Rules==\n;Overview\n[[File:Hammarby vs GAIS 2012-02-11 (14).jpg|thumb|left|Referee]]\nThere are eighteen rules in official play, designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nThe [[Bandy Playing Rules]] can be found on the official website of the [[Federation of International Bandy]],<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/> and are overseen by the [[Rules and Referee Committee]].\n\n;Players and officials\n[[File:3-4-3.jpg|thumb|Bandy positions in 3-4-3 formation]]\n[[Image:Emil Paulin Str\u00f6m 2012b.jpg|thumb|right|The goalkeeper has no stick.]]\nEach team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, and they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.<ref name=Ninh>[http://player.mashpedia.com/player.php?ref=mashpedia&q=yIl9B_L9y6I Ninh.co.uk: \"The Rules of Bandy - EXPLAINED!\"], retrieved 14 October 2017</ref>\n\nThough there are a variety of [[Position (team sports)|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nThe positions and formations of the players in bandy are virtually the same as the common [[association football positions]] and the same terms are used for the different positions of the players. A team usually consists of defenders, midfielders and forwards. The defenders can play in the form of centre-backs, full-backs and sometimes wing-backs, midfielders playing in the centre, attacking or defensive, and forwards in the form of centre forward, second strikers and sometimes a winger. Sometimes one player is also taking up the role of a libero.\n\nAny number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a five-minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is likely to be an extra goalkeeper.<ref name=Ninh/>\n\nA game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may have one or two assistant referees. A secretary outside of the field often takes care of the match protocol.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\n;Equipment\n[[Image:Bandybollar.jpg|thumb|right|Making of an historic bandy ball in stages, from the original cork on the left to the final ball painted red, with a modern [[bandy ball]] to far right]]\nThe basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of Bandy [[Ice skate|skates]], a [[helmet]], a mouth guard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a face guard.\n\nThe teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The goal keeper wears distinct colours to single him out from his or her teammates, just as in football. The [[Ice skate|skates]], sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the [[bandy ball]], which shall be orange or cerise.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned, various protections are used to protect knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.\n\n;The bandy stick;\n[[Image:Bandystick.gif|thumb|right|A bandy stick and ball]]\nThe stick used in bandy is an essential part of the sport. It should be made of an approved material such as wood or a similar material and should not contain any metal or sharp parts which can hurt the surrounding players. Sticks are crooked and are available in five angles, where 1 has the smallest bend and 5 has the most. Bend 4 is the most common size in professional bandy. The bandy stick should not have similar colours to the ball, such as orange or pink; it should be no longer than {{convert|127|cm}}, and no wider than {{convert|7|cm}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Equipment2012.pdf |title=Federation of International Bandy |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511163826/http://www.worldbandy.com/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Rules/Equipment2012.pdf |archivedate=11 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n;Field\n{{Main article|Bandy field}}\n[[Image:Bandy pitch metric.svg|510px|thumb|center|Standard field measurements]]\n[[File:Swedish bandyplayer.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Swedish U17 player on a corner stroke]]\n\nA [[bandy field]] is {{convert|45|\u2013|65|m}} by {{convert|90|\u2013|110|m}}, a total of {{convert|4050|-|7150|m2}}, or about the same size as a [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] and considerably larger than an [[ice hockey rink]]. Along the sidelines a {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end {{convert|1|\u2013|3|m}} away from the corners.\n\nCentered at each shortline is a {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|2.1|m|abbr=on}} high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} radius. A penalty spot is located {{convert|12|m}} in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} circle.\n\nA centre spot with a circle of radius {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} denotes the center of the field. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot parallel with the shortlines.\n\nAt each of the corners, a {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and {{convert|5|m}} away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a {{convert|0.5|m|adj=on}} long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, {{convert|5|m}} from the shortline.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\n;Duration and tie-breaking measures\nA standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute [[half-time]] break. The end of the match is known as full-time.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nThe referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nIf it is very cold or if it is snowing, the match can be broken into thirds of 30 minutes each. At the extremely cold [[1999 Bandy World Championship|1999 World Championship]] some matches were played in four periods of 15 minutes each and with extra long breaks in between. In the World Championships the two halves can be 30 minutes each for the nations in the B division.\n\nIn league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as \"golden goal\" which means the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.\n\n;Ball in and out of play\n{{Main article|Playing the ball in bandy}}\nUnder the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each [[playing period]] with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\n* Stroke-off\n* Goal-throw\n* Corner stroke\n* Free-stroke\n* [[Penalty shot]]\n* [[Face-off#Other sports|Face-off]]\n\nIf the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\n;Free-strokes and penalty shots\nFree-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team breaks any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on. or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nRather than stopping play, the [[referee]] may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\". The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\nIf a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, result in a penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply in the event of a red card (see below).<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\n;Warnings and penalties\n{{double image|right|Blue card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Blue: 10 minutes penalty, red: [[match penalty]]}}\n\nA ten-minute penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.\n\nThe third time a player receives a penalty, it will be a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A [[match penalty]] is indicated through the use of a red card.\n\n;Offside\nThe [[offside (bandy)|offside]] rule effectively limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in effect just like [[Offside (association football)|that of soccer]].<ref name=\"worldbandy\"/>\n\n==International==\n===International federation===\n[[Image:BandyCountries.png|thumb|World map showing the 27 [[Federation of International Bandy]] members as of May 2017]]\n\nThe [[Federation of International Bandy]] (FIB) has had 33 members at most.

Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team is welcome to take part in the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies; however, with only six nations, Sweden, [[the Soviet Union]], Russia, [[Finland]], Norway, and [[Kazakhstan]], having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia's team took over from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Bandy World Championship 1993|1993]]).

The [[Swedes]] contributed largely, and clubs sprang up around the capital of [[Oslo]]. [[Oslo]], including neighbouring towns, is still today the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.\n\nIn 1912 the [[Norwegians]] played their first [[List of Norwegian bandy champions|National Championship]], which was played annually up to 1940. During WWII, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, \u221244 and \u221245, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on. After WWII the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 80s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only 5 clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage.\n\nIn recent years, the number of artificially frozen pitches have increased in Norway, and more sports clubs have reinvigorated their bandy sections with new men's and youth teams. Because of this, as well as an increase of [[Sweden|Swedish]] players in Norway, the competitiveness of the game has risen, especially in the first division Eliteserien.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The adult men's game in Norway today consists of Eliteserien with eight teams, as well as three lower divisions. Bandy in Norway has also started to spread geographically, but some clubs in apart locations in the 3rd division only have access to ice hockey rinks and therefore play rink bandy for home games.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Compared to the past, attendance is still fairly low, but important Eliteserien matches can attract around 1000 spectators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n;Russia\n[[File:Stadium Trud Arkhangelsk.jpg|thumb|[[Trud Stadium (Arkhangelsk)|Trud Stadium]] in [[Arkhangelsk]]]]\nIn Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. A similar game became popular among the Russian nobility in the early 1700s, with the imperial court of [[Peter the Great]] playing a predecessor of modern bandy on [[Saint Petersburg]]'s frozen [[Neva]] river. Russians played this game using ordinary footwear, with sticks made out of juniper wood, only later were skates introduced. It was only in the second half of the 19th century that bandy became popular among the masses throughout the [[Russian Empire]]. Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than a hockey skate, and the \"Russian skate\" is even longer.\n\nWhen the Federation of International Bandy was formed in [[1955 in sports|1955]], with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception.

A \"bandy briefcase\" (\"bandyportf\u00f6lj\" in Swedish) is the classic accessory for spectating \u2013 it is typically made of brown leather, well worn and contains a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor.<ref name=\"briefcase\">{{cite news\n | first = Ingrid\n | last = Sundberg\n | title = Bandyportf\u00f6ljens tid \u00e4r h\u00e4r\n | url = http://www.folket.se/folket/standard_article.php?id=139481&avdelning_1=101&avdelning_2=105&t=1373991006\n | work = Folket\n | date = 10 November 2006\n | accessdate = 7 January 2007\n | language = Swedish\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928181039/http://www.folket.se/folket/standard_article.php?id=139481&avdelning_1=101&avdelning_2=105&t=1373991006 |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}</ref>\nBandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flasks or thermoses of 'warming' liquid like [[gl\u00f6gg]] is a natural effect.\n\nA notable tradition is \"[[Saint Stephen's Day bandy|annandagsbandy]]\", bandy games played on [[Saint Stephen's Day]], which for many [[Swedes]] is an important [[Christmas]] season tradition and always draws bigger crowds than usual. Games traditionally begin at 1:15&nbsp;pm.<ref name=\"annandagsbandy\">{{cite news\n |first=Berndt\n |last=Rosqvist\n |title=Festligt och fullsatt p\u00e5 stora bandydagen\n |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/festligt-och-fullsatt-pa-stora-bandydagen-1.231109\n |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130418064244/http://www.dn.se/sport/festligt-och-fullsatt-pa-stora-bandydagen-1.231109\n |dead-url=yes\n |archive-date=18 April 2013\n |work=Dagens Nyheter\n |date=22 December 2003\n |accessdate=4 February 2010\n |language=Swedish\n}}</ref>\n\n[[List of Swedish bandy champions|The final match for the Swedish Championship]] is played every year on the third Saturday of March. From 1991 to 2012, it was played at [[Studenternas IP|Studenternas Idrottsplats]] in [[Uppsala]], often drawing crowds in excess of 20,000. The reason the play-off match was set in Uppsala is because of [[IFK Uppsala Bandy|IFK Uppsala]]'s success in the beginning of the 20th century. IFK Uppsala won 11 titles in the Swedish Championships between 1907 and 1920, which made them the most successful bandy club in the entire country. Now, however, the record is held by [[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s SK Bandy|V\u00e4ster\u00e5s SK]]. A contributing factor was the poor quality of the ice at [[S\u00f6derstadion]], where the finals were held from 1967 to 1989.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 the final was played indoors in [[Friends Arena#Tournaments|Friends Arena]], the national stadium for football in [[Solna]], [[Stockholm]], with a retractable roof and a capacity of 50 000. The first final at Friends Arena in 2013 drew a record crowd of 38,474 when [[Hammarby IF Bandy]], after ending up in second place in six finals during the 2000s, won their second title. Due to declining attendance since, for 2015 through 2017 [[Tele2 Arena]] in southern [[Stockholm]] was chosen as a new venue. However, the new indoor venue failed to attract much more than half of the total capacity. In May 2017 it was announced that the finals will again be held at Studenternas IP in Uppsala from 2018 to 2021.\n\n;Switzerland\nIn the late 19th and early 20th Century, Switzerland had become a popular place for winter vacations and people went there from all over Europe. Winter sports like skiing, sledding and bandy was played in Geneva and other towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hockeygods.com/images/9923-Antique_Bandy___Shinty_Game___Caux_Jeu_de_Hockey___1906___Geneve|title=Antique Bandy / Shinty Game - Caux-Jeu de Hockey - 1906 - Geneve - HockeyGods|publisher=}}</ref> Students from Oxford and Cambridge went to Switzerland to play each other \u2013 the predecessor of the recurring [[Ice Hockey Varsity Match]] was a bandy match played in [[St. Moritz]] in 1885. This popularity for Swiss venues of winter sport may have been a reason, the European Championship was held there in 1913.\n\nBandy has mainly been played as a recreational sport in Switzerland in the last decade, but a Swiss national team took part in the [[2018 Women's Bandy World Championship]].\n\n;Ukraine\nBandy was played in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. After independence in 1991, it took some years before organised bandy formed again, but [[List of Ukrainian bandy champions|Ukrainian champions]] have been named annually since 2012.\n\n;United States\n{{Main article|Bandy in the United States}}\nBandy has been played in the United States since around 1980. The activity is mainly centred to Minnesota even if a fan interest also exists in other states. The bandy clubs in the US only have teams but the interest is stable and even if some clubs fold after only some years, other clubs have been around from the start and have a steady following. The United States national bandy team has taken part in the Bandy World Championships since 1985 and is also regularly playing friendlies against Canada.\n\n[[List of United States bandy

Three previous judges of the award, [[Malcolm Bradbury]], David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[Midnight's Children]]'', the 1981 winner, as \"the best novel out of all the winners.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Mullan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview31|title=Lives & letters, Where are they now?|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Man Booker Prize set up a 'Best of Beryl' prize, for the author [[Beryl Bainbridge]], who has been nominated five times and yet has failed to win once. The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were [[An Awfully Big Adventure]], [[Every Man for Himself (novel)|Every Man for Himself]], [[The Bottle Factory Outing]], [[The Dressmaker (Bainbridge novel)|The Dressmaker]] and [[Master Georgie]], which won.\n\nSimilarly, [[The Best of the Booker]] was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again ''Midnight's Children''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michelle| last=Pauli|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,2258500,00.html|title=Best of the Booker|work=The Guardian|publisher=|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499495.stm|title=Rushdie wins Best of Booker prize|work=|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50 anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded. One book from each decade was selected by a panel of judges: Naipaul's ''[[In a Free State]]'' (the 1971 winner), Lively's ''[[Moon Tiger]]'' (1987), Ondaatje's ''[[The English Patient]]'' (1992), Mantel's ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and Saunders' ''[[Lincoln in the Bardo]]''.

In addition, previous winners of the prize and those who have been shortlisted in the previous five years are automatically considered. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Related awards==\nA separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the [[Man Booker International Prize]] was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a \u00a350,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.\n\nA Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the [[Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize]], also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the [[Man Asian Literary Prize]], an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\n\nAs part of ''[[The Times]]''' [[Cheltenham Literature Festival|Literature Festival]] in [[Cheltenham]], a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was [[Alan Paton]]'s ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'', beating [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'', [[Graham Greene]]'s ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' and [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[The Loved One]]''. In 2015, the winner for 1915 was [[Ford Madox Ford]]'s ''[[The Good Soldier]]'', beating ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' ([[John Buchan]]), ''[[Of Human Bondage]]'' ([[W. Somerset Maugham]]), ''[[Psmith, Journalist]]'' ([[P. G. Wodehouse]]) and ''[[The Voyage Out]]'' ([[Virginia Woolf]]).<ref>[http://www.fordmadoxfordsociety.org/blog/fords-the-good-soldier-wins-the-cheltenham-booker-1915-at-2015-festival \"Ford's The Good Soldier Wins The Cheltenham Booker 1915 at 2015 Festival\"].

The main positions are:<ref>Outlined by Allen (pp. 19\u201325), who himself favours the fourth position, with the second position (early eight century) added from Patterson (pp. 231\u201332).</ref>\n* Ninth century BC, particularly in the reign of [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] \u2013 a position especially popular among nineteenth-century scholars (making Joel one of the earliest [[Literary prophets|writing prophets]])\n* Early eighth century BC, during the reign of [[Uzziah]] (contemporary with [[Hosea]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], and [[Jonah]])<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patterson|first1=Richard D.|title=The Expositor's Bible Commentary, vol. 7|publisher=Zondervan}}</ref>\n* c. 630\u2013587 BC, in the last decades of the kingdom of Judah (contemporary with [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Habakkuk]])\n* c. 520\u2013500 BC, contemporary with the return of the exiles and the careers of [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Haggai]].\n* The decades around 400 BC, during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] period (making him one of the latest writing prophets)\n\nEvidence produced for these positions are allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Other commentators, such as [[John Calvin]],<ref>Cited in Allen, p. 19, although Calvin did lean toward a later dating</ref> attach no great importance to the precise dating.\n\n== History of interpretation ==\n[[File:Tissot Joel.jpg|thumb|150px|Joel (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by [[James Tissot]])]]\nThe [[Masoretic text]] places Joel between [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the [[Septuagint]] order is Hosea\u2013Amos\u2013[[Book of Micah|Micah]]\u2013Joel\u2013[[Book of Obadiah|Obadiah]]\u2013[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]]. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from [[Textual criticism|scribal transmission]], but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, [[Peshitta|Syriac]], and [[Vulgate]] versions, or by [[conjectural emendation]].<ref>Allen 36</ref> While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as [[allegory|allegorical]] interpretations of Israel's enemies.<ref>[[Targum]] at 2:25; also margin of [[Septuagint|LXX]] manuscript Q, mid-6th century AD</ref> This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many [[church fathers]]. Calvin took a literal interpretation of chapter 1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic/ [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] interpretation.<ref>See Allen 29\u201331</ref>\n\nThe traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three-stage process of composition: 1:1\u20132:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28\u20133:21/3:1\u20134:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the [[day of the Lord]] were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4\u20138/4:4\u20138 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.\n\nThis splitting of the book's composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet.  The authenticity of 3:4\u20138 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.<ref>See Allen 25\u201329 for details and arguments.</ref>\n\n== Biblical quotes and allusions ==\n[[Image:Joel-prophet.jpg|thumb|[[Russia]]n [[icon]] of the prophet Joel ([[Iconostasis]] of [[Kizhi]] monastery, c. 1700\u20131725)]]\n\nThere are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel's literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], his prophecy of the outpouring of God's [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Holy Spirit]] upon all people was notably quoted by [[Saint Peter]] in his [[Pentecost]] sermon.<ref>{{bibleref|Acts|2|NIV}}</ref>\n\nThe table below represents some of the more explicit quotes and allusions between specific passages in Joel and passages from the Old and New Testaments.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

According to the traditional order of most Hebrew Bibles, it is the first of the twelve [[Minor Prophets]].\n\nSet around the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the Book of Hosea denounces the worship of gods other than Yahweh, metaphorically comparing Israel's abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband. According to the book's narrative, the relationship between Hosea and his unfaithful wife Gomer is comparable to the relationship between Yahweh and his unfaithful people Israel. The eventual reconciliation of Hosea and Gomer is treated as a hopeful metaphor for the eventual reconciliation between Yahweh and Israel.\n\n== Background and content ==\n\n[[Hosea]] ({{lang|he|\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7}}) prophesied during a dark and melancholic era of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]]'s history, the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall in the 8th century BC. According to the book, the [[apostasy]] of the people was rampant, having turned away from [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] in order to serve both the calves of [[Jeroboam]]<ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|8:4\u20136|JPS}}</ref> and [[Baal]], a [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god.<ref name=\"Cook, Stephen L. 1989\">Cook, Stephen L., ''HarperCollins Study Bible; New Revised Standard Version With the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books Student Edition'' (San Francisco: Harper Collins Publishers, Meeks, Wayne A. ed.,  (1989), p. 1193.</ref>\n\nThe Book of Hosea says that, during Hosea's lifetime, the kings of the Northern Kingdom, their [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] supporters, and the priests had led the people away from the [[Divine law|Law of God]], as given in the [[Pentateuch]].  It says that they forsook the worship of God; they worshiped other gods, especially [[Baal]], the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] [[Weather god|storm god]], and [[Asherah]], a [[Canaan]]ite [[List of fertility deities|fertility god]].  Other [[sin]]s followed, says the Book, including [[homicide]], [[perjury]], [[theft]], and [[Religion and sexuality|sexual sin]].<ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|4:1\u20132|JPS}}</ref>  Hosea declares that unless they repent of these sins, God will allow their nation to be destroyed, and the people will be taken into captivity by [[Assyria]],<ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|9:3|JPS}}</ref> the greatest nation of the time.\n\nThe prophecy of Hosea centers around God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over the betrayal of Israel.<ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|3:1|JPS}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|11:1|JPS}}</ref><ref>{{Bibleref|Hosea|14:4|JPS}}</ref> Stephen Cook asserts that the prophetic efforts of this book can be summed up in this passage \"I have been the Lord your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior\" ({{Bibleref|Hosea|13:4|JPS}}) Hosea's job was to speak these words during a time when they had been essentially forgotten.<ref name=\"Cook, Stephen L. 1989\"/>\n\n== Summary ==\nThe Book of Hosea contains a number of YHWH prophecies and messages for both [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Israel (Samaria)]]. These are delivered by the prophet [[Hosea]].\n\n===General outline===\nA brief outline of the concepts presented in the Book of Hosea exist below:\n* Chapters 1\u20132; Account of Hosea's marriage with  [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]] biographically which is a metaphor for the relationship with YHWH and Israel.\n* Chapter 3; Account of Hosea's marriage autobiographically.  This is possibly a marriage to different women\n* Chapters 4\u201314:9/14:10; Oracle judging Israel, Ephraim in particular, for not living up to the [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]].\nNo further breakdown of ideas is clear in 4\u201314:9/14:10.<ref>Coogan, Michael. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.'' Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 262\u201363</ref>\nFollowing this, the prophecy is made that someday this will all be changed, that God will indeed have pity on Israel.\n\nChapter two describes a divorce.  This divorce seems to be the end of the covenant between God and the Northern Kingdom.  However, it is probable that this was again a symbolic act, in which Hosea divorced Gomer for infidelity, and used the occasion to preach the message of God's rejection of the Northern Kingdom.  He ends this prophecy with the declaration that God will one day renew the covenant, and will take Israel back in love.\n\nIn Chapter three, at God's command, Hosea seeks out [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]] once more.  Either she has sold herself into slavery for debt, or she is with a lover who demands money in order to give her up, because Hosea has to buy her back.  He takes her home, but refrains from sexual intimacy with her for many days, to symbolize the fact that Israel will be without a king for many years, but that God will take Israel back, even at a cost to Himself.\n\nChapters 4\u201314 spell out the allegory at length. Chapters 1\u20133 speaks of Hosea's family, and the issues with Gomer. Chapters 4\u201310 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce).  Chapter 11 is God's lament over the necessity of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is a large part of the people of Israel, whom God loves.  God promises not to give them up entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance.  Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of [[Assyria]], because there has been no repentance.  In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.\n\nMatthew 2:13 cites Hosea's prophecy in {{Bibleverse||Hosea|11:1|HE}} that God would call His Son out of [[Egypt]] as foretelling the [[flight into Egypt]] and return to Israel of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], [[Mary (given name)|Maria]], and the infant [[Jesus]].\n\nThe capital of the Northern Kingdom fell in 722 BC.  All the members of the upper classes and many of the ordinary people were taken captive and carried off to live as prisoners of war.\n\n===A summary of Hosea's Story===\nFirst, Hosea was directed by God to marry a [[promiscuous woman]] of ill-repute, and he did so.  Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel.  However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.\n\nSecond, Hosea and his wife, [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], have a son.  God commands that the son be named Jezreel.  This name refers to a [[Jezreel Valley|valley]] in which much blood had been shed in Israel's history, especially by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. (See I Kings 21 and II Kings 9:21\u201335).  The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed. Jezreel's name means God Sows.\n\nThird, the couple have a daughter.  God commands that she be named [[Lo-ruhamah]]; Unloved, or, Pity or Pitied On to show Israel that, although God will still have pity on the [[Kingdom of Judah|Southern Kingdom]], God will no longer have pity on the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom]]; its destruction is imminent.  In the NIV translation, the omitting of the word 'him' leads to speculation as to whether Lo-Ruhamah was the daughter of Hosea or one of Gomer's lovers. [[James Luther Mays|James Mays]], however, says that the failure to mention Hosea's paternity is \"hardly an implication\" of Gomer's adultery.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mays|first=James L.|author-link=James Luther Mays|title=Hosea|year=1969|publisher=SCM|page=28}}</ref>\n\nFourth, a son is born to Gomer.  It is questionable whether this child was Hosea's, for God commands that his name be [[Lo-ammi]].  The child bore this name of shame to show that the Northern Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God's People. In other words, the Northern Kingdom had been rejected by God.\n\n== Interpretation and context ==\nIn Hosea 2, the woman in the marriage metaphor could be Hosea's wife  [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], or could be referring to the nation of Israel, invoking the metaphor of Israel as God's bride. The woman is not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2. \u201cI will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born\u201d (Hosea 2:3). \u201cUpon her children I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom\u201d (Hosea 2:4). \u201cFor she said, I will go after my lovers...\u201d (Hosea 2:5).\n\nBiblical scholar Ehud Ben Zvi reminds readers of the socio-historical context in which Hosea was composed. In his article Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2, Ben Zvi describes the role of the Gomer in the marriage metaphor as one of the \"central attributes of the ideological image of a human marriage that was shared by the male authorship and the primary and intended male readership as building blocks for their imagining of the relationship.\"<ref>Ben Zvi, Ehud. 2004. \"Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2.\" ''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'' 28, no. 3: 363\u201384.</ref>\n\nTristanne J. Connolly makes a similar observation, stating that the husband-wife motif reflects marriage as it was understood at the time.<ref>Connolly, Tristanne J. 1998. \"Metaphor and Abuse in Hosea.\" Feminist Theology no. 18: 58.</ref> Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel.<ref>Connolly, Tristanne J. 1998. \"Metaphor and Abuse in Hosea.\" Feminist Theology no. 18: 60.</ref> Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls under a unique genre called \u201ccovenant lawsuit\u201d where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God's disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.<ref>Coogan, Michael David Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 265.</ref>\n\nBrad E. Kelle has referred to 'many scholars' finding references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, to be evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two.  Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite 'apostasy'.<ref>{{cite book|title = Hosea 2: Metaphor and Rhetoric in Historical Perspective | author = Brad E. Kelle | publisher = Society of Biblical Lit | year = 2005 | page = 137}}</ref>\n\nHosea 13:1\u20133 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Yahweh for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using molten images for 'idol' worship.  Chief among these was the image of the bull at the northern shrine of Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.<ref>{{cite book|title = The Social Roots of Biblical Yahwism, Part 2 | author = Stephen L. Cook | publisher = Society of Biblical Lit | year = 2004 | page = 90}}</ref>\n\n== Contribution ==\nHosea is believed to be the first prophet to use marriage as a metaphor of the covenant between God and Israel, and he influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah. He is among the first writing prophets, and the last chapter of Hosea has a format similar to [[wisdom literature]].\n\nLike [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], Hosea elevated the religion of Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God's nature. Israel's faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled Him to punish the people because of His own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this he sets the unquenchable love of God, who, in spite of this infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will take His people unto Himself again after the judgment.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7895-hosea-book-of \"Hosea, Book of'', ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikisource|Hosea (Bible)}}\n*[[Judaism|Jewish]] translations:\n** [http://www.chabad.org/library/archive/LibraryArchive2.asp?AID=15758 Hoshea \u2013 Hosea (Judaica Press)] translation [with [[Rashi]]'s commentary] at Chabad.org\n*[[Christian]] translations:\n**[http://www.gospelhall.org/bible/bible.php?passage=Hosea+1 ''Online Bible'' at GospelHall.org]\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20050206120712/http://www.anova.org/sev/htm/hb/28_hosea.htm ''Hosea'' at The Great Books] (New Revised Standard Version)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120121113045/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/HankeHosea.pdf Isagogical Study of the Book of Hosea by: Paul R.

''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' Oxford University Press, New York (2009) p. 315</ref> The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>Nelson's Compact Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1978, p. 191, {{ISBN|0-8407-5636-4}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], its authorship is attributed to a [[prophet]] who lived in the [[Assyria]]n Period and named himself in the first verse, [[Obadiah]]. His name means \"servant of [[Yahweh]]\".\n\nIn Christianity, the Book of Obadiah is classified as a [[minor prophet]] of the [[Old Testament]], due to its short length.\n\nIn Judaism, Obadiah is considered a \"later prophet\", placed in the last section ([[Nevi'im]]) of the [[Tanakh]], where it is one of the \"Twelve Prophets.\"\n\n== Content ==\n\nThe book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of [[Edom]],{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:1,4,18|NKJ|v.1,4,18}} a mountain dwelling nation{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:8,9,19,21|NKJV|v.8,9,19,21}} whose founding father was [[Esau]].{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:6|NKJV|v.6}}{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|36:9|NKJV|Genesis 36:9}}\nObadiah describes an encounter with [[Yahweh|God]], who addresses Edom's arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of [[Jacob]] (Israel).{{Bibleref2c|Obadiah|1:10|NKJV|v.10}}\n\nThe western half of ancient Edom is the [[Negev]] desert all the way to Eilat, all part of modern Israel. The eastern half is possessed by the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan.  In the days of Obadiah, the Edomites lived along the cliffs and mountaintops of the arid land south of the Dead Sea, all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea. There was very little in the way of arable land, so the Edomites made their living supporting (and controlling) the main caravan route between [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Babylon]] that passed through their whole land.\n\nThroughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. \nAmong the region's great powers, Edom was held in low regard. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. \"'Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,' declares the Lord\" (Obadiah 1:4, NIV).\n\nIn 597 BCE, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judah, and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city.  Obadiah, writing this prophecy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. '\"On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth\nand foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them... You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.\"' (Obadiah 1:11, 13 NIV)\n\nObadiah said in  judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites' land would be possessed by Egypt and they would cease to exist as a people. But the Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and someday the children of Israel would return from their exile and possess the land of Edom.\n\n== Scholarly issues ==\n\n===Dating Obadiah===\nThe date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu. The date of composition must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. [[Edom]] is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853 \u2013 841 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of [[Jehoram of Judah]] (recorded in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 8:20\u201322 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 21:8\u201320 in the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]]) and 607 \u2013 586 BC when [[Jerusalem]] was attacked by [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] of [[Babylon]], which led to the Babylonian exile of [[Israel]] (recorded in [[Psalm]] 137). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Elijah]] as reflected in 1 Kings 18:1-16.  In particular, 1 Kings 18:7-8 reads: \"As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, 'Is it really you, my lord Elijah?' 'Yes,' he replied. 'Go tell your master, \"Elijah is here.\"'\" (NIV)\n\nThe later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a \"near consensus\" position among scholars.<ref name=\"Dykehouse2008\">{{cite book|author=Jason C. Dykehouse|title=An Historical Reconstruction of Edomite Treaty Betrayal in the Sixth Century B.C.E.

The passage in [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore Obadiah 11-14 seems to refer to the destruction of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Nebuchadrezzar II]] (586 BC). It is more likely that Obadiah and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source.<ref name=\"Zvi1996\">{{cite book|author=Ehud Ben Zvi|title=A Historical-Critical Study of the Book of Obadiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-VIjAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA104|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-080963-3|pages=104\u2013106}}</ref> There is also much material found in Obadiah 10-21 which [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably.\n\n===Contrast with Amos===\nAccording to Obadiah 18, after judgment, \"There will be no survivors from the house of Esau\" (NIV). So, according to Obadiah there will not remain even a remnant after [[Edom]]\u2019s judgment. This is in contrast to [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 9:12, where Amos refers to such a remnant; however, it is stated that their possession will be given to [[Israel]].\n\n===Sepharad===\n{{main|Sepharad}}\nThe identity of the land of \"Sepharad\", mentioned only here in this verse in the Bible, {{Bibleref2|Obadiah|1:20|NIV|Obadiah 1:20}}, is currently unknown. It is also unknown whether or not Sepharad is a city, district or territory. The only clues for its possible existence are [[Persia]]n inscriptions that refer to two places called \"[[Saparda]]\": one area in [[Medes|Media]] and another in [[Asia Minor]], arguably [[Sardis]].\n\n== Scriptural parallels ==\n\nThe exact expression \"the Day of the Lord\u201d, from Obadiah 1:15, has been used by other authors throughout the ''Old'' and ''New Testaments'', as follows:\n\n'''[[Old Testament]]:'''\n* [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] [[Isaiah 2|2,]][[Isaiah 13|13]][[Isaiah 34|, 34]][[Isaiah 58|, 58]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 46:10, [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 2:22, [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 13:5, [[Book of Joel|Joel]] 1, 2, 3, [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:18, 20, [[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 1, 2, [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 14:1, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] 4:5\n\n'''[[New Testament]]:'''\n* [[1 Thessalonians 5]]:2, [[2 Peter 3]]:10, [[Acts 2]]:20, [[1 Corinthians 5]]:5, [[2 Corinthians 1]]:14\n\nFor other parallels, compare Obadiah 1:1\u20138 with [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 49:7\u201316.\n\n== Protestant view ==\n\nThe overwhelming theme found in Obadiah is the destruction of the enemies of God's people{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}. Unlike other prophets who call the hearers to repent before they fall under [[divine judgement|judgment]], Obadiah's message is one of inevitable [[destiny|doom]] as a consequence of previous actions. A [[Christian]] with a knowledge of the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] would say that although God's grace and forgiveness abound in such situations, because [[God]] is [[Justice|just]] there are consequences for opposing [[God]] and God's people. Obadiah shows that judgment falls even within the family of God, as [[Israel]] and [[Edom]] descended from twin brothers, Jacob and Esau. His purpose{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} was to make it known that according to his God, if members of the same family were to treat each other in the same manner as [[Edom]] treated the Israelites, they too may be subject to the wrath of God.\n\nIn relating to theme of [[Obadiah]], it is important to underscore the \u201cpunishment\u201d theme this book outlines against Edom.

In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery in order to prevent the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} This tendency is evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (e.g. the [[Targum]]s) and the Greek translations (e.g. the [[Septuagint]]). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a good example of this:{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Targum Jonah====\nIn Jonah 1:6, the [[Masoretic Text]] (MT) reads, \"...perhaps God will pay heed to us....\" Targum Jonah translates this passage as: \"...perhaps there will be mercy from the Lord upon us....\" The captain's proposal is no longer an attempt to change the divine will; it is an attempt to appeal to divine mercy. Furthermore, in Jonah 3:9, the MT reads, \"Who knows, God may turn and relent [lit. repent]?\" Targum Jonah translates this as, \"Whoever knows that there are sins on his conscience let him repent of them and we will be pitied before the Lord.\" God does not change His mind; He shows pity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Dead Sea Scrolls====\nFragments of the book were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] (DSS), most of which follows the [[Masoretic Text]] closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text.<ref>David L. Washburn, ''A Catalog of Biblical Passages in the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Brill, 2003), 146.</ref> As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made as [[Argument from authority|appeals to authority]]. The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.<ref>James C. Vanderkam, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Today'' (Grand Rapids, Mich: Eerdmans, 1994), 151</ref>\n\n===Early Christian interpretation===\n\n====New Testament====\nThe earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|12:38\u201342|9}} and 16:1\u20134)</ref> and the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref>Luke 11:29\u201332</ref> Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus\u2019 interpretation of the Book of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16). As with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, Jesus\u2019 interpretation is primarily \u201ctypological\u201d (see [[Typology (theology)]]). Jonah becomes a \u201ctype\u201d for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the grave. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of [[Sheol]] found in Jonah's prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, \u201cOut of the belly of Sheol I cried,\u201d Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented, but Jesus' generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the Book of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\nThe debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In c. 409&nbsp;AD, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:\n\n{{quote|The last question proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were not from Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the Pagans; for his words are:\n\u201cIn the next place, what are we to believe concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whale\u2019s belly? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it. Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this gourd\u2019s growth?\u201d Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans amidst loud laughter, and with great scorn.|(Letter CII, Section 30)}}\n\nAugustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: \"As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the [[whale]], so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world.\" Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matt. 12:39,40), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ's.\n\n===Medieval commentary tradition===\n\nThe ''Ordinary Gloss'', or ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', was the most important Christian commentary on the Bible in the later Middle Ages. \"The Gloss on Jonah relies almost exclusively on Jerome\u2019s commentary on Jonah (c. 396), so its Latin often has a tone of urbane classicism. But the Gloss also chops up, compresses, and rearranges Jerome with a carnivalesque glee and scholastic directness that renders the Latin authentically medieval.\"<ref>Ryan McDermott, trans., \"The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah,\" PMLA 128.2 (2013): 424\u201338.</ref> \"The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah\" has been translated into English and printed in a format that emulates the first printing of the Gloss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/18871/|title=The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Jonah and his fellow Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss's tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (\u201cThe foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful\u201d), the prevailing allegorical tendency is to attribute Jonah's recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that God's promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonah's pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christ's demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (\u201cMy Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me\u201d [Matt. 26:39]) and the Gospel of Matthew's and Paul's insistence that \u201csalvation is from the Jews\u201d (Jn. 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clear\u2014as some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do not\u2014that Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence ''as Jews''.\n\n===Modern===\n[[NCSY]] director of education Dovid Bashevkin sees Jonah as a thoughtful prophet who comes to religion out of a search for theological truth and is constantly disappointed by those who come to religion to provide mere comfort in the face of adversity inherent to the human condition.  \"If religion is only a blanket to provide warmth from the cold, harsh realities of life,\" Bashevkin imagines Jonah asking, \"[D]id concerns of theological truth and creed even matter?\"<ref>Bashevkin, Dovid. [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious \"Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation.\"] ''Lehrhaus''. 9 October 2016. 2 October 2017.</ref> The lesson taught by the episode of the tree at the end of the book is that comfort is a deep human need that religion provides, but this need not obscure the role of God.\n\n== Jonah and the \"big fish\" ==\n\nThe Hebrew text of Jonah<ref>{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:1|HE}}</ref> reads ''dag gadol'' (Hebrew: \u05d3\u05d2 \u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc), which literally means \"great fish.\" The [[Septuagint]] translates this into Greek as ''ketos megas,'' (Greek: \u03ba\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2), \"huge fish\"; in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters.<ref>See http://www.theoi.com/Ther/Ketea.html for more information regarding Greek mythology and the [[Ketos]]</ref> [[Saint Jerome]] later translated the Greek phrase as ''piscis granda'' in his [[Latin Vulgate]], and as ''cetus'' in Matthew.<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|12:40|9}}</ref> At some point, ''cetus'' became synonymous with [[whale]] (cf. [[cetyl alcohol]], which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as \"greate fyshe,\" and he translated the word ''ketos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in Matthew as \"[[whale]]\".<ref>{{bibleref|Matthew|12:40|9}}</ref> Tyndale's translation was later followed by the translators of the [[King James Version]] of 1611 and has enjoyed general acceptance in English translations.\n\nIn the line 2:1 the book refers to the fish as ''dag gadol'', \"great fish\", in the masculine. However, in the 2:2, it changes the gender to ''daga,'' meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: \"And the lord provided a great fish (''dag gadol'', masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the (''daga'', female) fish, Jonah began to pray.\" The peculiarity of this change of gender led the later rabbis to reason that this means Jonah was comfortable in the roomy male fish, so he didn't pray, but that God then transferred him to a smaller, female fish, in which the prophet was uncomfortable, so that he prayed.{{sfn|Bruckner|2004|p=78}}\n\n== Jonah and the gourd vine ==\n\nThe Book of Jonah closes abruptly with an epistolary warning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08497b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Jonah|publisher=}}</ref> based on the [[emblem]]atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized in fables such as ''[[The Gourd and the Palm-tree]]'' during the Renaissance, for example by [[Andrea Alciato]].\n\n[[St. Jerome]] differed<ref>citing Peter W.

Micah describes the destruction of the lesser towns of Judah (referring to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, 701&nbsp;BC). For these passages of doom on the various cities, the device paronomasia is used. Paronomasia is a literary device which 'plays' on the sound of each word for literary effect. For example, the inhabitants of Beth-le-aphrah (\u201chouse of dust\u201d) are told to \u201croll yourselves in the dust.\u201d 1:14. Though most of the Paronomasia is lost in translation, it is the equivalent of \u2018Ashdod shall be but ashes,\u2019 where the fate of the city matches its name.<ref name=\"Rogerson704\"/>\n* '''Misuse of power denounced (2:1\u20135)''': Denounces those who appropriate the land and houses of others.

The metaphor of flesh being torn illustrates the length to which the ruling classes and socialites would go to further increase their wealth. Prophets are corrupt, seeking personal gain.

Between 734 and 727 [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] of Assyria conducted almost annual campaigns in Israel, reducing Israel, Judah and the Philistine cities to vassalage, receiving tribute from Ammon, Moab and Edom, and absorbing Damascus (the kingdom of [[Aram Damascus|Aram]]) into the Assyrian empire.<ref>King (1988), pp.31\u201333</ref> On Tiglath-Pileser's death Israel rebelled, resulting in an Assyrian counter-attack and the destruction of the capital, [[Samaria]], in 721 after a three-year siege.<ref name=\"Rogerson 2003, p.703\"/> Micah 1:2\u20137 draws on this event: Samaria, says the prophet, has been destroyed by God because of its crimes of idolatry, oppression of the poor, and misuse of power.<ref name=\"Rogerson 2003, p.703\"/> The Assyrian attacks on Israel (the northern kingdom) led to an influx of refugees into Judah, which would have increased social stresses, while at the same time the authorities in Jerusalem had to invest huge amounts in tribute and defense.<ref name=\"King 1988, p.27\"/>\n\nWhen the Assyrians attacked Judah in 701 they did so via the Philistine coast and the Shephelah, the border region which included Micah's village of Moresheth, as well as [[Lachish]], Judah's second largest city. This in turn forms the background to verses 1:8\u201316, in which Micah warns the towns of the coming disaster (Lachish is singled out for special mention, accused of the corrupt practices of both Samaria and Jerusalem). In verses 2:1\u20135 he denounces the appropriation of land and houses, which might simply be the greed of the wealthy and powerful, or possibly the result of the militarising of the area in preparation for the Assyrian attack.<ref name=\"Rogerson704\"/>\n\n===Composition===\n\nSome, but not all, scholars accept that only chapters 1\u20133 contain material from the late 8th century prophet Micah.<ref name=\"Rogerson 2003, p.703\"/> The latest material comes from the post-Exilic period after the Temple was rebuilt in 515&nbsp;BC, so that the early 5th century BC seems to be the period when the book was completed.<ref>Mays (1976), p.21</ref> The first stage was the collection and arrangement of some spoken sayings of the historical Micah (the material in chapters 1\u20133), in which the prophet attacks those who build estates through oppression and depicts the Assyrian invasion of Judah as Yahweh's punishment on the kingdom's corrupt rulers, including a prophecy that the Temple will be destroyed.<ref>Mays (1976), p.23</ref> The prophecy was not fulfilled in Micah's time, but a hundred years later when Judah was facing a similar crisis with [[Babylon]], and Micah's prophecies were reworked and expanded to reflect the new situation.<ref>Mays (1976), pp.24\u201325</ref> Still later, after Jerusalem did fall to the Babylonians, the book was revised and expanded further to reflect the circumstances of the late exilic and post-exilic community.<ref>Mays (1976), p.30</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\nMicah addresses the future of Judah/Israel after the Babylonian exile. Like [[book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], the book has a vision of the punishment of Israel and creation of a \"remnant\", followed by world peace centred on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch; the people should do justice, turn to Yahweh, and await the end of their punishment. However, whereas Isaiah sees Jacob/Israel joining \"the nations\" under Yahweh's rule, Micah looks forward to Israel ruling over the nations. Insofar as Micah appears to draw on and rework parts of Isaiah, it seems designed at least partly to provide a counterpoint to that book.<ref name=\"Sweeney 2000, pp.341-342\"/>\n\n==Quotations in the New Testament==\nIn the [[New Testament]], [[Matthew's gospel]] quotes from the Book of Micah in relation to Jesus being born in [[Bethlehem]]:\n:''For thus it is written by the prophet:''\n:''But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel''.<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|5:2|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|2:5-6|NKJV}}</ref>\nJesus quotes Micah when he warns that families will be divided by the gospel:\n:''A man\u2019s enemies will be those of his own household''.<ref>{{bibleverse||Micah|7:6|NKJV}}; {{bibleverse||Matthew|10:36|NKJV}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Zion]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Cite book|last=Allen|first=Leslie C|title=The Books of Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwTKrlvr3c0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Micah#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780802825315}}\n*{{Cite book|last= Ben Zvi|first=Ehud|title=Micah|publisher=Eerdmans|year=2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlO0kMRUuB0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Micah#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn= 9780802845993}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Coogan|first=Michael|title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Grigg|first=Donald L|title=The Bible from Scratch: The Old Testament for Beginners|publisher=Eerdmans|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUAykz2hS10C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Bible+from+Scratch:+The+Old+Testament+for+Beginners#v=onepage&q=The%20Bible%20from%20Scratch%3A%20The%20Old%20Testament%20for%20Beginners&f=false|isbn=9780664225773}}\n*{{Cite book|last=King|first=Phillip J|title=HarperCollins Study Bible: Micah|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|year=2006}}\n*{{Cite book|last=King|first=Philip J|title=Amos, Hosea, Micah: an archaeological commentary|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HS5Z4k7RiUkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Micah#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780664240776}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Limburg|first=James|title=Hosea-Micah|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1988|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAbUFlJdSgEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Micah#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780664237578}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Mays|first=James L|author-link=James Luther Mays|title=Micah|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|year=1976|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1iDaeovh1IoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Micah#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780664208172}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Rogerson|first=John W|chapter=Micah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Vo-11umIZQC&pg=PA703&dq=Micah+John+W.+Rogerson#v=onepage&q=Micah%20John%20W.%20Rogerson&f=false|editor=James D.

The book would then have been written in [[Jerusalem]], where Nahum would have witnessed the invasion of [[Sennacherib]] and the destruction of his host ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 19:35).\n\nThe scholarly consensus is that the \"book of vision\" was written at the time of the fall of [[Nineveh]] <ref name=\"Kent H.

[[Ashurbanipal]] was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, according to Nahum a \"bloody city all full of lies and robbery\" (Nahum 3:1), a reference to the Neo-Assyrian Empire's military campaigns and demand of tribute and plunder from conquered cities.\n\n[[Jonah]] had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by [[Zephaniah]], who also predicted ([[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 2:4\u201315) the destruction of the city.\n\nNineveh was destroyed apparently by fire around 625 BC, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.\nArchaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under [[Sennacherib]] (705\u2013681 BC), [[Esarhaddon]] (681\u2013669 BC), and [[Ashurbanipal]] (669\u2013633 BC).

Nineveh is compared to [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"Kent H. Richards 2006\"/> Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh's troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and [[metaphor]]s {{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Nineveh is ironically compared with a lion, in reference to the lion as an Assyrian symbol of power; Nineveh is the lion of strength that has a den full of dead prey but will become weak like the lion hiding in its den. It comes to conclusion with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the \"sleep\" or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers .\n\n== Themes ==\n\n===The fall of Nineveh===\nNahum's prophecy carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction.<ref name=\"abp\" /> One might even say that the book of Nahum is \"a celebration of the fall of Assyria.\"<ref name=\"Coogan 2009\" /> And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Nineveh, it is also a positive encouragement and \"message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the \"endless cruelty\" ([[Nahum 3:19]]) of the Assyrians.\"<ref name=\"Coogan 2009\" /> The prophet [[Jonah]] shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum's writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/nahum.html|title=Nahum|publisher=earlyjewishwritings.com}}</ref> and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to \"their cruelty\" ([[Nahum 3:19]]). The Assyrians had been used as God's \"rod of [\u2026] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation.\" (Isaiah 10:5)\n\n===The nature of God===\nFrom its opening, Nahum shows God to be slow to anger, but that God will by no means ignore the guilty; God will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass. God is presented as a God who will punish evil, but will protect those who trust in Him. The opening passage ([[Nahum 1]]:2\u20133) states: \"God is jealous, and the L<small>ORD</small> revengeth; the L<small>ORD</small> revengeth, and is furious; the L<small>ORD</small> will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. The L<small>ORD</small> is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked\". God is strong and will use means, but a mighty God doesn't need anyone else to carry out vengeance and wrath for him.\n\n[[Nahum 1]]:3 (NIV) ''The L<small>ORD</small> is slow to anger and Quick to love; the L<small>ORD</small> will not leave the guilty unpunished.''\n\n[[Nahum 1]]:7 (NIV) ''The L<small>ORD</small> is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him''\n\n== Importance ==\nGod's judgement on Nineveh is \"all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft\" (Nahum 3:4 NIV). Infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness.<ref>Centre Column Reference Bible, (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1994) 1262</ref> For example: \"the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the L<small>ORD</small>\" (Hosea 1:2 NIV). The apostle [[John the Apostle#Book of Revelation|John]] used a similar analogy in [[Revelation 17|Revelation chapter 17]].\n\nThe prophecy of Nahum was referenced in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Tobit]]. In Tobit 14:4 (KJV) a dying Tobit says to his son Tobias and Tobias' sons:\n<blockquote>\n[My son] hurry off to Media, for I believe the word of God that Nahum spoke about Nineveh, that all these things will take place and overtake Assyria and Nineveh. Indeed, everything that was spoken by the prophets of Israel, whom God sent, will occur. </blockquote>\nHowever, some versions, such as the King James Version, refer to the prophet [[Jonah]] instead.\n\n== Discourse ==\nThe book was introduced in [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s Commentary <ref>{{cite web | title=Commentaries on Twelve Minor Prophets | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom28.titlepage.html }}</ref> as a complete and finished poem:\n{{Quote|No one of the minor Prophets seems to equal the sublimity, the vehemence and the boldness of Nahum: besides, his Prophecy is a complete and finished poem; his exordium is magnificent, and indeed majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the description of its ruin, and its greatness, are expressed in most vivid colors, and possess admirable perspicuity and fulness.|Rev. John Owen, translator|Calvin's Commentary on Jonah, Micah, Nahum}}\n\nNahum, taking words from Moses himself, have shown in a general way what sort of \"Being God is\".

It is a short book, consisting of only two chapters.

There is no biographical information given about the prophet in the Book of Haggai.  Haggai's name is derived from the Hebrew verbal root ''hgg'', which means \"to make a pilgrimage.\"  W. Sibley Towner suggests that Haggai's name might come \"from his single-minded effort to bring about the reconstruction of that destination of ancient Judean pilgrims, the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].\"<ref>Towner, W. Sibley. ''The Harper Collins Study Bible''. HarperCollins Publishers. 2006. p. 1265.</ref>\n\n== Date ==\n\nThe ''Book of Haggai'' was written in 520&nbsp;BCE some 18 years after [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] had conquered [[Babylon]] and issued a decree in 538&nbsp;BCE allowing the captive Jews to return to Judea. Cyrus saw the restoration of the temple as necessary for the restoration of the religious practices and a sense of peoplehood after a long exile.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nHaggai's message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the [[Second Temple|second Jerusalem temple]]. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the people's refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to [[Jerusalem]]\u2019s glory.  The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one [[Zerubbabel]], governor of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], as the Lord\u2019s chosen leader. The language here is not as finely wrought as in some other books of the [[minor prophets]],{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} yet the intent seems straightforward.\n\nThe first chapter contains the first address (2\u201311) and its effects (12\u201315).\n\nThe second chapter contains:\n#The second prophecy (1\u20139), which was delivered a month after the first\n#The third prophecy (10\u201319), delivered two months and three days after the second; and\n#The fourth prophecy (20\u201323), delivered on the same day as the third\n\nThese discourses are referred to in [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 5:1 and 6:14. (Compare Haggai 2:7, 8 and 22)\n\nHaggai reports that three weeks after his first prophecy, the rebuilding of the Temple began on September 7 521&nbsp;BCE. \"They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the King.(Haggai 1:14\u201315) and the Book of Ezra indicates that it was finished on February 25 516&nbsp;BCE \"The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.\" (Ezra 6:15)\n\n== Outline ==\n\n#Divine Announcement: The Command to Rebuild the Temple  ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|1.1\u201315}} )\n##Introduction: Reluctant Rebuilders  ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|1.1\u20132}} )\n##Consider your ways: fruitless prosperity ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|1.3\u201312}} )\n##Promise and Progress  ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|1.13\u201315}} )\n#Divine Announcement: The Coming Glory of the Temple  ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|2.1\u20132.9}} )\n##God will fulfill his promise ({{Bibleref2-nb|Haggai|2:1\u20135}} ) <ref name=\"Achtemeier, Paul J. 1996\">Achtemeier, Paul J., and Roger S.

In the Christian ordering, the grouping of the Prophetic Books is the last section of the [[Old Testament]], making Malachi the last book before the [[New Testament]].\n\nThe book is commonly attributed to a prophet by the name of \"[[Malachi]],\" as its title has frequently been understood as a proper name, although its [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] meaning is simply \"My messenger\" (the [[Septuagint]] reads \"his messenger\") and may not be the author's name at all. The name occurs in the superscription at 1:1 and in 3:1, although it is highly unlikely that the word refers to the same character in both of these references. Thus, there is substantial debate regarding the identity of the book's author. One of the [[Targum]]s identifies [[Ezra]] (or Esdras) as the author of Malachi. Priest and Historian [[Jerome]] suggests that this may be because Ezra is seen as an intermediary between the prophets and the \"great synagogue.\" There is, however, no historical evidence yet to support this claim.\n\nSome scholars note affinities between [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9\u201314 and the Book of Malachi. Zechariah 9, Zechariah 12, and Malachi 1 are all introduced as The word of Elohim. Some scholars argue that this collection originally consisted of three independent and anonymous prophecies, two of which were subsequently appended to the Book of Zechariah as what they refer to as Deutero-Zechariah, with the third becoming the Book of Malachi. As a result, most scholars consider the Book of Malachi to be the work of a single author who may or may not have been identified by the title Malachi. The present division of the oracles results in a total of 12 books of minor prophets, a number parallelling the sons of [[Jacob]] who became the heads of the 12 [[Israelite]] tribes. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' asserts, \"We are no doubt in presence of an abbreviation of the name M\u00e1l'akh\u00eeyah, that is Messenger of Elohim.\"\n\n== Author ==\n\nLittle is known of the biography of the author of the Book of Malachi, although it has been suggested that he may have been Levitical. The books of Zechariah and Haggai were written during the lifetime of Ezra (see 5:1); perhaps this may explain the similarities in style.\n\nAccording to the editors of the 1897 [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]], some scholars believe the name \"Malachi\" is not a [[proper noun]] but rather an abbreviation of \"messenger of [[YHWH]]\".<ref name=\"Easton\">''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Malachi Malachi]'' at the [[Easton's Bible Dictionary]]</ref> This reading could be based on Malachi 3:1, \"[http://www.blueletterbible.org/tsk_b/Mal/3/1.html#MainTop Behold, I will send ''my messenger''...]\", if ''my messenger'' is taken literally as the name ''Malachi''.<ref name=\"Malachi\"/> Several scholars consider the book to be anonymous, with verse 1:1 being a later addition.<ref name=\"Malachi\">Carl Heinrich Cornill states that Zechariah 9\u201314 and Malachi are anonymous and were therefore placed at the end of the [[Book of the Twelve]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], [[Abraham Kuenen]], and Wilhelm Gustav Hermann Nowack argue that Malachi 1:1 is a late addition, pointing to [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 9:1 and 12:1.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}</ref> However, other scholars, including the editors of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', argue that the grammatical evidence leads us to conclude that Malachi is in fact a name.<ref name=\"CathMalachi\"/>\n\nAnother interpretation of the authorship comes from the [[Septuagint]] superscription, \u1f72\u03bd \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03b3\u03b3\u03ae\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6, which can be read as either \"by the hand of his messenger\" or as \"by the hand of his angel\".

But we reject this view altogether, lest we be compelled to accept the doctrine of the fall of souls from heaven.''</ref>\n\n== Period ==\n\nThere are very few historical details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating may lie in the fact that the Persian-era term for governor (peh\u00e2) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had a king before the exile.

Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position after [[Book of Haggai|Haggai]] and [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haggai-zechariah-and-malachi-back-in-the-land/|title=Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi: Back in the Land {{!}} My Jewish Learning|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hatanakh.com/en/tags/malachi|title=Malachi {{!}} \u05d4\u05ea\u05e0\u05da|website=www.hatanakh.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}</ref> close to the time of Ezra and when [[Nehemiah]]<ref name=\":0\" /> came to [[Jerusalem]] in 445&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cheyne|first=T.

Although the prophets urged the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Israel]] to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with God, it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.\n\nIn 1:2, Malachi has the people of Israel question God's love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates the severity of the situation which Malachi addresses. The graveness of the situation is also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests. While God demands animals that are \"without blemish\" ([[Leviticus]] 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were \"to determine whether the animal was acceptable\" (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.\n\nIn 2:1, Malachi states Yahweh Sabaoth is sending a curse on the priests who have not honored him with appropriate animal sacrifices: \"Now, watch how I am going to paralyze your arm and throw dung in your face--the dung from your very solemnities--and sweep you away with it. Then you shall learn that it is I who have given you this warning of my intention to abolish my covenant with Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth.\"\n\nIn 2:10, Malachi addresses the issue of divorce. On this topic, Malachi deals with divorce both as a social problem (\"Why then are we faithless to one another ... ?\" 2:10) and as a religious problem (\"Judah ... has married the daughter of a foreign god\" 2:11). In contrast to the [[book of Ezra]], Malachi urges each to remain steadfast to the wife of his youth.\n\nMalachi also criticizes his audience for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting them to be faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on to point out that the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full [[tithe]] to God. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.\n\nMalachi assures the faithful among his audience that in the [[eschatology|eschaton]], the differences between those who served God faithfully and those who did not will become clear. The book concludes by calling upon the teachings of [[Moses]] and by promising that [[Elijah]] will return prior to the [[Last Judgement|Day of Yahweh]].\n\n== Interpretations ==\n\nThe book of Malachi is divided into three chapters in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Septuagint|Greek Septuagint]] and four chapters in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The fourth chapter in the Vulgate consists of the remainder of the third chapter starting at verse 3:19.\n\n===Christianity===\nThe [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the [[Bible]] supplies headings for the book as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Verse/Chapter Headings in the NRSV\n! Verse Reference !! Heading </tr>\n| 1:1     || (Superscription) </tr>\n| 1:2\u20132:9 || Israel Preferred to [[Edom]] </tr>\n| 2:10\u201317 || The Covenant Profaned by [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] </tr>\n| 3:1\u20137   || The Coming Messenger </tr>\n| 3:8\u201315  || Do Not Rob God </tr>\n| 4:1\u20135 (3:19\u201324 in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) || The Great Day of the Lord </tr>\n|}\n\nThe majority of scholars consider the book to be made up of six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] and the various groups within the [[Israelite]] community. In the course of the book's three or four chapters, [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of [[Moses]] are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the lines of a judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenant\u2014one of the major themes throughout the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]]. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s statutes.\n\nThe Book of Malachi draws upon various themes found in other books of the Bible. Malachi appeals to the rivalry between [[Jacob and Esau]] and of [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s preference for Jacob contained in [[Book of Genesis]] 25\u201328. Malachi reminds his audience that, as descendants of Jacob ([[Israel]]), they have been and continue to be favoured by God as God's chosen people. In the second dispute, Malachi draws upon the Levitical Code (e.g. [[Leviticus]] 1:3) in condemning the priest for offering unacceptable sacrifices.\n\nIn the third dispute (concerning divorce), the author of the Book of Malachi likely intends his argument to be understood on two levels. Malachi appears to be attacking either the practice of divorcing Jewish wives in favour of foreign ones (a practice which [[Ezra]] vehemently condemns) or, alternatively, Malachi could be condemning the practice of divorcing foreign wives in favour of [[Jew]]ish wives (a practice which [[Ezra]] promoted). Malachi appears adamant that nationality is not a valid reason to terminate a marriage, \"For I hate divorce, says the Lord . . .\" (2:16).\n\nIn many places throughout the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]] \u2013 particularly the [[Book of Hosea]] \u2013 [[Israel]] is figured as [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce may also be understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could very well be urging his audience not to break faith with [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] (the God of [[Israel]]) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] were questioning [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]]'s love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the [[messiah|messianic age]] which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.\n\n[[File:Gustave Dor\u00e9 Malachi\u00e1\u0161 3.1.jpg|thumb|220px|Illustration of the coming of God's Messenger in 3:1, by [[Franciszek \u017bmurko]].]]\n\nIndeed, the fourth dispute asserts that judgment is coming in the form of a messenger who \"is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap . . .\" (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute \u2013 that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] request the people to \"Bring the full tithe . . . [and] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing\" (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of [[Israel]] illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say \"'It is vain to serve God . . . Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'\" (3:14\u201315). Once again, Malachi has [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.\n\nIn the light of what Malachi understands to be an imminent judgment, he exhorts his audience to \"Remember the teaching of my servant [[Moses]], that statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] for all [[Israel]]\" (4:4; 3:22, MT). Before the [[Last Judgment|Day of the Lord]], Malachi declares that [[Elijah]] (who \"ascended in a whirlwind into heaven . . . [,]\" 2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 2:11) will return to earth in order that people might follow in God's ways.\n\nPrimarily because of its [[Messiah|messianic]] promise, the Book of Malachi is frequently referred to in the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]]. What follows is a brief comparison between the Book of Malachi and the [[New Testament]] texts which refer to it (as suggested in Hill 84\u201388).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Use of the book of Malachi in the [[New Testament]] ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]])\n|-\n!

Eventually freedom did come to many Israelites, when [[Cyrus the Great]] overtook the Babylonians in 539&nbsp;BC.  In 538&nbsp;BC, the famous [[Cyrus in the Judeo-Christian tradition|Edict of Cyrus]] was released, and the first return took place under Sheshbazzar.  After the death of Cyrus in 530&nbsp;BC, [[Darius the Great|Darius]] consolidated power and took office in 522&nbsp;BC.  His system divided the different colonies of the empire into easily manageable districts overseen by governors. [[Zerubbabel]] comes into the story, appointed by Darius as governor over the district of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\nUnder the reign of Darius, Zechariah also emerged, centering on the rebuilding of the Temple. Unlike the Babylonians, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] went to great lengths to keep \u201ccordial relations\u201d between vassal and lord.  The rebuilding of the Temple was encouraged by the leaders of the empire in hopes that it would strengthen the authorities in local contexts.  This policy was good politics on the part of the Persians, and the Jews viewed it as a blessing from God.<ref>Meyers, pp. 31\u20132.</ref>\n\n== Prophet ==\n{{main|Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)}}\n\nThe name \"[[Zechariah (given name)|Zechariah]]\" means \"God remembered.\" Not much is known about Zechariah's life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his grandfather [[Iddo (prophet)|Iddo]] was the head of a priestly family who returned with [[Zerubbabel]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Nehemiah|12:4|HE}}</ref> and that Zechariah may himself have been a [[priest]] as well as a [[prophet]]. This is supported by Zechariah's interest in the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] and the priesthood, and from Iddo's preaching in the [[Books of Chronicles]].\n\n== Authorship ==\n\nSome scholars accept the book as the writings of one individual.  For example, George Livingstone Robinson's dissertation on chapters 9\u201314<ref>Published in ''The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures'', Vol. 12, No. 1/2 (Oct 1895 \u2013 Jan 1896), pp. 1\u201392.</ref> concluded that those chapters had their origin in the period between 518 and 516&nbsp;BC and stand in close relation to chapters 1\u20138, having most probably been composed by Zechariah himself. However, most modern scholars believe the Book of Zechariah was written by at least two different people.<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 346.</ref>\n\nZechariah 1\u20138, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC.<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 346.</ref> Zechariah 9\u201314, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars give the text a date in the fifth century BCE.<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context''. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 355.</ref> Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears to make use of the books of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], and [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]], the [[Deuteronomistic History]], and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah.<ref>Meyers, Eric. \"Zechariah Introduction.\" ''The New Interpreter's Study Bible''. (Abingdon Press: Nashville, 2003), p. 1338.</ref> There are some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9\u201311) and Third Zechariah (12\u201314) since each begins with a heading oracle.<ref>Coogan, M. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context.'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 355.</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n{{details|Babylonian captivity}}\n\nThe return from exile is the theological premise of the prophet's visions in chapters 1\u20136. Chapters 7\u20138 address the [[quality of life]] God wants his renewed people to enjoy, containing many encouraging promises to them. Chapters 9\u201314 comprise two \"[[oracle]]s\" of the future.   \n[[Image:Gustave Dor\u00e9 (1832-1883) - The Bible (1865) - Zechariah 6-5.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Zechariah's vision of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]],<ref>{{bibleverse||Zechariah|6:1\u20138|HE}}</ref> [[engraving]] by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]].]]\n\n===Chapters 1 to 6===\nThe book begins with a preface,<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|1:1\u20136|HE}}</ref> which recalls the nation's history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions,<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|1:7\u20136:8|HE}}</ref> succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolic action, the crowning of [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua]],<ref>{{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|6:9\u201315|HE}}</ref> describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's [[Messiah]].\n\n===Chapters 7 and 8===\nChapters Zechariah 7 and Zechariah 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.\n\n===Chapters 9 to 14===\nThis section consists of two \"oracles\" or \"burdens\": \n*The first oracle (Zechariah 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the coming of the Messiah.\n*The second oracle (Zechariah 12\u201314) points out the glories that await Israel in \"the latter day\", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.\n\n== Themes ==\n\nThe purpose of this book is not strictly historical but [[theological]] and [[pastoral]]. The main emphasis is that God is at work and plans to live again with His people in Jerusalem.  He will save them from their enemies and cleanse them from sin.\n\nZechariah's concern for purity is apparent in the temple, priesthood and all areas of life as the prophecy gradually eliminates the influence of the governor in favour of the high priest, and the sanctuary becomes ever more clearly the centre of messianic fulfillment. The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to \"Third Isaiah\" (chapters 55\u201366 of the [[Book of Isaiah]]), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.\n\nMost Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as [[Claimed Messianic prophecies of Jesus|Messianic prophecies]], either directly or indirectly.<ref>Petterson, A. R., ''Behold Your King: The Hope for the House of David in the Book of Zechariah'' (LHBOTS 513; London: T&T Clark, 2009).</ref> These chapters helped the writers of the [[Gospel]]s understand Jesus\u2019 suffering, death and resurrection, which they quoted as they wrote of Jesus\u2019 final days.<ref>For example, see allusion to Zechariah 9:9 in Matthew 21:5; also Zechariah 12:10 in John 19:37.

Although not as fully developed as the apocalyptic [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s described in the [[Book of Daniel]], the \"[[oracle]]s\", as they are titled in Zechariah 9\u201314, contain apocalyptic elements. One theme these oracles contain is descriptions of the [[Day of the Lord]], when \"the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle\" (Zechariah 14:3). These chapters also contain \"pessimism about the present, but optimism for the future based on the expectation of an ultimate divine victory and the subsequent transformation of the cosmos\".<ref>Coogan, Michael D. ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 2009. Pg. 353</ref>\n\nThe final word in Zechariah proclaims that on the Day of the Lord \"There will be no Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day\" (14:21), proclaiming the need for purity in the Temple, which would come when God judges at the end of time.

It is used in the [[Epistle to the Romans]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] as the starting point of the concept of [[faith]].{{sfnp|Cross|2005}}  A copy of these chapters is included in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]], found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Chapter 3 may be an independent addition, now recognized as a liturgical piece, but was possibly written by the same author as chapters 1 and 2.{{sfnp|Cross|2005}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe prophet Habakkuk is generally believed to have written his book in the mid-to-late 7th century BC, not long before the Babylonians' siege and capture of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC.\n\n===Author===\n{{main|Habakkuk}}\nHabakkuk identifies himself as a [[prophet]] in the opening verse. Due to the liturgical nature of the book of Habakkuk, there have been some scholars who think that the author may have been a temple prophet. Temple prophets are described in [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 25:1 as using [[lyre]]s, [[harp]]s and [[cymbal]]s. Some feel that this is echoed in Habakkuk 3:19b, and that Habakkuk may have been a [[Levite]] and [[singing|singer]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]].{{sfnp|Barber|1985|p=15}}\n\nThere is no biographical information on the prophet Habakkuk; in fact less is known about him than any other writer of the Bible. The only canonical information that exists comes from the book that is named for him.{{sfnp|Brownlow|1961|p=440}}  His name comes either from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word [[wikt:\u05d7\u05d1\u05e7|\u05d7\u05d1\u05e7]] (''khavak'') meaning \"embrace\" or else from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''hambakuku'' for a kind of plant.{{sfnp|Lehrman|1948|p=211}}{{sfnp|Leslie|1962|p=503}}\n\nAlthough his name does not appear in any other part of the Jewish Bible, [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinic tradition]] holds Habakkuk to be the Shunammite woman's son, who was restored to life by [[Elisha]] in [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 4:16.{{sfnp|Lehrman|1948|p=211}} The prophet Habakkuk is also mentioned in the narrative of [[Bel and the Dragon]], part of the [[deuterocanonical]] [[additions to Daniel]] in a late section of that book. In the superscription of the Old Greek version, Habakkuk is called the son of Joshua of the tribe of Levi.{{sfnp|Lehrman|1948|p=211}} In this book Habakkuk is lifted by an angel to Babylon to provide Daniel with some food while he is in the lion's den.\n\n===Historical context===\n[[File:Chaldean-empire-600BCE.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldean Empire]] around 600 BC.]]\nIt is unknown when Habakkuk lived and preached, but the reference to the rise and advance of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Chaldeans]] in 1:6\u201311 places him in the middle to last quarter of the 7th century BC.{{sfnp|Coffman|1982|p=61}}{{sfnp|Hailey|1972|pp=271\u2013272}} One possible period might be during the reign of [[Jehoiakim]], from 609\u2013598 BC. The reasoning for this date is that it is during his reign that the Neo-Babylonian Empire of the Chaldeans was growing in power. The Babylonians marched against Jerusalem in 598 BC. Jehoiakim died while the Babylonians were marching towards Jerusalem and Jehoiakim's eighteen-year-old son [[Jehoiachin]] assumed the throne. Upon the Babylonians' arrival, Jehoiachin and his advisors surrendered Jerusalem after a short time.  With the transition of rulers and the young age and inexperience of Jehoiachin, they were not able to stand against Chaldean forces. There is a sense of an intimate knowledge of the Babylonian brutality in 1:12\u201317.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe book of Habakkuk is a book of the [[Tanakh]] (the [[Old Testament]]) and stands eighth in a section known as the [[Trei Asar|12 Minor Prophets]] in the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] and [[Septuagint|Greek texts]]. In the Masoretic listing, it follows [[Nahum]] and precedes [[Zephaniah]], who are considered to be his contemporaries.\n\nThe book consists of three chapters and the book is neatly divided into three different genres:\n\n* A discussion between God and Habakkuk\n* An Oracle of Woe\n* A Psalm\n\n== Themes ==\n\nThe major theme{{Citation needed|reason=This is a strong claim about the book as a whole|date=January 2017}} of Habakkuk is trying to grow from a faith of perplexity and doubt to the height of absolute trust in God. Habakkuk addresses his concerns over the fact that God will use the Babylonian empire to execute judgment on Judah for their sins.\n\nHabakkuk openly questions the wisdom of God. In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action. ''\"1:2 Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you \u201cViolence!\u201d and will you not save?\"&nbsp;\u2013 World English Bible.''\n\nIn the middle part of [[Habakkuk 1|Chapter 1]], God explains that he will send the Chaldeans (also known as the Babylonians) to punish his people. ''1:5 \u201cLook among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you. 1:6 For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs. (World English Bible)''\n\nOne of the [[Tiqqun soferim|\"Eighteen Emendations to the Hebrew Scriptures\"]] appears at 1:12.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the professional Jewish scribes, the Sopherim, the text of 1:12 was changed from \"You [God] do not die\" to \"We shall not die.\" The Sopherim considered it disrespectful to say to God, \"''You'' do not die.\"\n\nIn the final part of the [[Habakkuk 1|first chapter]], the prophet expresses shock at God's choice of instrument for judgment. ''1:13 You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, (World English Bible [https://web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http://www.ebible.org/web/Habakkuk.htm])''\n\nIn [[Habakkuk 2|Chapter 2]], he awaits God's response to his challenge. God explains that He will also judge the Chaldeans, and much more harshly. ''2:8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men\u2019s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. 2:9 Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, (World English Bible [https://web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http://www.ebible.org:80/web/Habakkuk.htm])''\n\nFinally, in [[Habakkuk 3|Chapter 3]], Habakkuk expresses his ultimate faith in God, even if he doesn't fully understand.\n''3:17 For though the fig tree doesn\u2019t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! (World English Bible [https://web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http://www.ebible.org:80/web/Habakkuk.htm])''\n\n== Importance ==\n\nThe book of Habakkuk is accepted as [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by adherents of the Jewish and Christian faiths.  A commentary on the first two chapters of the book was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran.  Passages from Habakkuk are quoted by authors of the New Testament, and its message has inspired modern Christian hymn writers.\n\n===Judaism===\nThe Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Prophets of the [[Hebrew Bible]],{{sfnp|Cross|2005}} and this collection appears in all copies of texts of the [[Septuagint]],{{sfnp|Baker|1988|p=46}} the [[Ancient Greek]] translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by 132 BC.  Likewise, the book of [[Sirach]] (or Ecclesiasticus), also written in the 2nd century BC, mentions \"[[Trei Asar|The Twelve Prophets]]\".{{sfnp|Hirsch|Blau|Kohler|Schmidt|1906}}\n\nA partial copy of Habakkuk itself is included in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]], a ''[[pesher]]'' found among the original seven [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] discovered in 1947.  The Commentary contains a copy of the first two chapters of Habakkuk, but not of the third chapter.{{sfnp|Wise|Abegg|Cook|1996|p=115}}  The writer of the ''pesher'' draws a comparison between the Babylonian invasion of the original text and the Roman threat of the writer's own period.{{sfnp|Wise|Abegg|Cook|1996|p=115}}  What is even more significant than the commentary in the ''pesher'' is the quoted text of Habakkuk itself.  The divergences between the Hebrew text of the scroll and the standard [[Masoretic Text]] are startlingly minimal.  The biggest differences are word order, small grammatical variations, addition or omission of conjunctions, and spelling variations, but these are small enough to not to damage the meaning of the text.{{sfnp|Harris|1966|pp=22\u201330}}{{sfnp|Clark|Hatton|1989|p=65}}\n\nSome scholars suggest that Chapter 3 may be a later independent addition to the book,{{sfnp|Baker|1988|p=46}} in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls.  However, this chapter does appear in all copies of the Septuagint, as well as in texts from as early as the 3rd century BC.{{sfnp|Baker|1988|p=46}}  This final chapter is a poetic praise of God, and has some similarities with texts found in the [[Book of Daniel]]. However, the fact that the third chapter is written in a different style, as a liturgical piece, does not necessarily mean that Habakkuk was not also its author.{{sfnp|Cross|2005}}  Its omission from the Dead Sea Scrolls is attributed to the inability of the [[Qumran]] sect to fit Habakkuk's theology with their own narrow viewpoint.{{sfnp|Sz\u00e9les|1987|p=9}}\n\n===Christianity===\n[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th-century painting.]]\nHabakkuk 2:4 is well known in Christianity:\n: ''Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,''\n:: '' but the righteous shall live by his faith.''\nThe second half of this verse {{refn|group=lower-alpha|\"...but the righteous shall live by his faith.\" This translation is both that of the [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Habakkuk|ASV]] and the 1917 translation by the Jewish Publication Society of America.{{sfnp|Lehrman|1948|p=219}} The newer translation by the Jewish Publication Society (NJPS) reads as follows \"But the righteous man is rewarded with life / For his fidelity.\" }} is quoted by some of the earliest [[Christian]] writers.

See Barber (1985).{{sfnp|Barber|1985|p=38}} }} it is quoted three times in the [[New Testament]].{{sfnp|McGee|1991|p=66}} [[Paul the Apostle]] quotes this verse twice in his [[epistles]]: in [[Romans 1|Epistle to the Romans]] ([[Romans 1:17]]) and again in [[Galatians 3|Epistle to the Galatians]] ([[Galatians 3:11]]). In doing so, Paul extends Habakkuk's original concept of righteous living at the present time into a future life.{{sfnp|Johnson|1969|p=85}}  The same verse is quoted in [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]<ref>{{bibleref2|Hebrews|10:37\u201338}}</ref>, where Habakkuk's vision is tied to [[Christ]] and used to comfort the church during a period of persecution.{{sfnp|Achtemeier|1993|p=266}}  These three epistles are considered to be \"the three great doctrinal books of the New Testament,\" and Habakkuk's statement concerning faith forms the backbone of each book.{{sfnp|McGee|1991|p=64}}\n\nModern Christian [[hymn]]s have been inspired by the words of the prophet Habakkuk. The Christian hymn \"[[commons:Image:Lord is in his holy temple.ogg|The Lord is in His Holy Temple]]\", written in 1900 by [[William J. Kirkpatrick]], is based on [[Habakkuk 2#Verse 20|verse 2:20]].{{sfnp|Wiegland|1992|p=685}} The fourth verse of [[William Cowper]]'s hymn \"Sometimes a Light Surprises\", written in 1779, quotes Habakkuk 3:17\u201318.\n\n{{quote\n|text= Though vine nor fig-tree neither,<br/>Their wonted fruit shall bear,<br/>Though all the field should wither,<br/>Nor flocks nor herds be there;<br/>\nYet God the same abiding,<br/> His praise shall tune my voice,<br/> For, while in Him confiding,<br/> I cannot but rejoice.\n|sign=William Cowper, 1779{{sfnp|Whelpton|1916|p=229; song 279}} }}\n\n=== Cultural references ===\n\nIrish composer [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] set slightly revised portions of text from the first and second chapters of Habakkuk in his piece for SATB choir, Soprano and Tenor soloist and organ, \"For Lo, I Raise Up\".\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite book | last=Achtemeier | first=Elizabeth | year=1993 | chapter=Habbakuk, The Book of | title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible | editor1-last=Metzger | editor1-first=Bruce M. | editor2-last=Coogan | editor2-first=Michael D. | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-504645-5 | pages=265\u2013266 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Andersen | first=Francis I. | year=2001 | title=Habbakuk | series=The Anchor Bible | location=New York | publisher=Doubleday | isbn=0-385-08396-3 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Bailey | first=Waylon | year=1998 | chapter=Habakkuk | title=Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah | series=The New American Commentary | volume=20 | location=Nashville, TN | publisher=Broadman & Holman Publishers | isbn=0-8054-0120-2 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Baker | first=David W. | year=1988 | title=Nahum, Habakkuk and Zephaniah | series=[[Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries]] | location=Downers Grove, IL | publisher=Inter-Varsity Press | isbn=0-87784-249-3 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Barber | first=Cyril J. | year=1985 | title=Habakkuk and Zephaniah | series=Everyman's Bible Commentary | location=Chicago | publisher=Moody Press | isbn=0-8024-2069-9 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Ben Zvi | first=Ehud | editor1-last=Berlin | editor1-first=Adele | editor2-last=Brettler | editor2-first=Marc Zvi | year=2004 | chapter=Habakkuk | title=The Jewish Study Bible | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-529751-5 | pages=1226\u20131233 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite journal | last=Betteridge | first=Walter R. | year=1903 | title=The interpretation of the prophecy of Habakkuk | journal=The American Journal of Theology | volume=7 | issue=4 | pages=647\u2013661 | ref=harv | doi=10.1086/478403 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Brettler | first=Marc Zvi | editor1-last=Berlin | editor1-first=Adele | editor2-last=Brettler | editor2-first=Marc Zvi | year=2004 | chapter=Nevi'im | title=The Jewish Study Bible | location=Oxford | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-529751-5 | pages=451\u2013461 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Brownlow | first=Leroy | year=1961 | chapter=Habakkuk | title=The Old Testament Books and their Messages in the Christian Age | location=Fort Worth | series=Second Annual Fort Worth Christian College Lectureship | publisher=The Manney Company | pages=439\u2013453 | ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book | last=Bruce | first=F.

This bought time for the PS2 to grow a large installed base and developers to release more quality PS2 games for the crucial 2001 holiday season.{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Costs==\nThe associated costs of backward compatibility are a higher [[bill of materials]] if hardware is required to support the legacy systems; increased complexity of the product that may lead to longer [[time to market]], technological hindrances, and slowing innovation; and increased expectations from users in terms of compatibility.<ref name=\"Belleflamme\" />\n\nA good example is the Sony [[PlayStation 3]],{{cn|date=April 2018}} as the first PS3 iteration was expensive to manufacture in part due to including the [[Emotion Engine]] from the preceding PS2 in order to run PS2 games,{{cn|date=April 2018}} since the PS3 architecture was completely different from the PS2. Subsequent PS3 hardware revisions have eliminated the Emotion Engine as it saved production costs while removing the ability to run PS2 titles,{{cn|date=April 2018}} as Sony found out that backward compatibility was not a major selling point for the PS3 in 2006-2009,{{cn|date=April 2018}} in contrast to the PS2 in 2000-2001.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The PS3's chief competitor, the Microsoft [[Xbox 360]], took a different approach to backward compatibility by using software emulation in order to run games from the first [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]],{{cn|date=April 2018}} rather than including legacy hardware from the original Xbox which was quite different than the Xbox 360, however Microsoft stopped releasing emulation profiles after 2007.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Hardware==\nA simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] in [[stereophonic sound|stereo]]. FM radio was initially [[monaural|mono]], with only one audio channel represented by one [[signal (electrical engineering)|signal]]. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, a large number of listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.<ref>{{citation|title=Newnes Radio and RF Engineering Pocket Book|first1=Steve|last1=Winder|first2=Joseph|last2=Carr|edition=3|date=2002|publisher=Newnes|isbn=9780080497471|pp=121\u2013123}}</ref>\n\nFull backward compatibility is particularly important in computer [[instruction set]] architectures, one of the most successful being the [[x86]] family of [[microprocessor]]s. Their full backward compatibility spans back to the 16-bit [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] processors introduced in 1978. (The 8086/8088 in turn were designed with easy machine-translatability of programs written for its predecessor in mind, although they were not instruction-set compatible with the 8-bit [[Intel 8080]] processor as of 1974.

It carries its own [[origin of replication]], the ''oriV'', and an origin of transfer, or ''oriT''.<ref name=Sherris /> There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called ''F-positive'' or ''F-plus'' (denoted F<sup>+</sup>). Cells that lack F plasmids are called ''F-negative'' or ''F-minus'' (F<sup>\u2212</sup>) and as such can function as recipient cells.\n\nAmong other genetic information, the F-plasmid carries a ''tra'' and ''trb'' [[locus (genetics)|locus]], which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 [[gene]]s. The ''tra'' locus includes the ''pilin'' gene and regulatory genes, which together form [[pilus|pili]] on the cell surface. The locus also includes the genes for the [[protein]]s that attach themselves to the surface of F<sup>\u2212</sup> bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact, but then are denatured with SDS and yet DNA transformation still proceeds. Several proteins coded for in the ''tra'' or ''trb'' locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion.\n\nWhen conjugation is initiated by a signal the '''[[relaxase]]''' [[enzyme]] creates a [[nick (DNA)|nick]] in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the ''oriT''. Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a '''[[relaxosome]]'''. In the F-plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or ''T-strand'', is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the ''oriV'') or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the [[rolling circle]] replication of [[lambda phage]]). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lujan SA, Guogas LM, Ragonese H, Matson SW, Redinbo MR | title = Disrupting antibiotic resistance propagation by inhibiting the conjugative DNA relaxase | journal = PNAS | year = 2007 | volume = 104 | pages = 12282\u20137 |pmc=1916486 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0702760104 | jstor=25436291 | issue = 30 | pmid=17630285}}</ref>\n[[File:Hfr Recombination.png|thumb|1.The [[insertion sequence]]s (yellow) on both the [[Fertility factor (bacteria)|F factor]] plasmid and the chromosome have similar sequences, allowing the F factor to insert itself into the [[genome]] of the cell.

The Hfr cell ideally wants to transfer its entire genome to the recipient cell. However, due to its large size and inability to keep in contact with the recipient cell, it is not able to do so.\n\n6.a. The F- cell remains F- because the entire F factor sequence was not received.

In common laboratory strains of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via [[homologous recombination]].\n\nA cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called '''[[Hfr cell|Hfr]]''' ('''h'''igh '''f'''requency of '''r'''ecombination). The ''E. coli'' [[genome]] was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender). The genes that were transferred were then investigated.\n\nSince integration of the F-plasmid into the ''E. coli'' chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence, and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome, it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer, as it occurs in the E. coli Hfr system, is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host, nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | year = 2008 | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | url = http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf | journal = Infect Genet Evol | volume = 8 | issue = 3| pages = 267\u2013285 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | pmid = 18295550 }}</ref>\n\n==Conjugal transfer in mycobacteria==\nConjugation in ''Mycobacteria smegmatis'', like conjugation in ''E. coli'', requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination.

It is {{convert|100|-|120|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, with a wingspan of {{convert|180|-|200|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} and weighs {{convert|3.6|-|6.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=2792 Blue Crane] at [[BirdLife International]] Data Zone</ref><ref>[http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/discoverycentre/wild/biogeographic-regions/afrotropic/blue-crane/ Blue Crane] listing at the [[Melbourne Museum]] website</ref><ref>[http://www.oiseaux-birds.com/card-blue-crane.html Blue Crane] at oiseaux-birds.com</ref> Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures {{convert|51.4|-|59|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the exposed [[Culmen (bird)|culmen]] measures {{convert|8|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] measures {{convert|20.5|-|25.2|cm|in|abbr=on}}. This crane is pale blue-gray in colour becoming darker on the upper head, neck and nape. From the crown to the lores, the plumage is distinctly lighter, sometimes whitish. The [[beak|bill]] is ochre to greyish, with a pink tinge. The long wingtip [[feather]]s which trail to the ground. The primaries are black to slate grey, with dark coverts and blackish on the secondaries. Unlike most cranes, it has a relatively large head and a proportionately thin neck. Juveniles are similar but slightly lighter, with tawny coloration on the head, and no long wing plumes.\n\n==Habitat==\nBlue cranes are birds of the dry grassy uplands, usually the pastured grasses of hills, valleys, and plains with a few scattered trees. They prefer areas in the nesting season that have access to both upland and [[wetland]] areas, though they feed almost entirely in dry areas. They are altitudinal migrants, generally nesting in the lower grasslands of an elevation of around 1,300 to 2,000 m and moving down to lower altitudes for winter. Though historically found in areas of low human disturbance, the blue crane is currently thriving in the highly transformed agricultural areas of the Western Cape. This is the only portion of its range where the population is increasing, though they still face threats such as poisoning in the region.\n\n==Movements and behaviour==\nOf the 15 species of crane, the blue crane has the most restricted distribution of all. Even species with lower population numbers now (such as [[Siberian crane|Siberian]] or [[whooping crane]]s) are found over a considerable range in their migratory movements. The blue crane is migratory, primarily altitudinal, but details are little known.\n\nThe blue crane is partially social, less so during the breeding season. There is a strict hierarchy in groups, with the larger adult males being dominant. They overlap in range with 3 other crane species but interactions with these species and other \"large wader\" type birds are not known. They are relentlessly aggressive to various other animals during the nesting season, attacking non-predatory species such as cattle, [[tortoise]]s, [[plover]]s and even [[sparrow]]s. Humans are also attacked if they approach a nest too closely, with the aggressive male having torn clothes and drawn blood in such cases.\n\n==Feeding==\nBlue cranes feed from the ground and appear to rarely feed near wetland areas. Most of their diet is comprised by grasses and sedges, with many types fed on based on their proximity to the nests. They are also regularly [[Insectivore|insectivorous]], feeding on numerous, sizeable insects such as [[grasshopper]]s. Small animals such as crabs, [[snail]]s, frogs, small [[lizard]]s and snakes may supplement the diet, with such protein-rich food often being broken down and fed to the young.\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:Grus paradisea MHNT 226 Afrique du Sud.jpg|thumb|Eggs of Blue Crane [[MHNT]] ]]\nThe breeding period is highly seasonal, with eggs being recorded between October and March. Pair-formation amongst groups often beings in October, beginning with both potential parents running in circles with each other. The male then engages in a \"dance\" flings various objects in the air and then jumps. Eventually, a female from the group and the male appear to \"select\" each other and both engage in the dance of throwing objects and jumping. After the dance, mating commences in around two weeks.\n\nIn a great majority of known nests, two eggs are laid (rarely 1 or 3). Both males and females will incubate, with the male often incubating at night and, during the day, defending the nest territory while the female incubates. The incubation stage lasts around 30 days. The young are able to walk after two days and can swim well shortly thereafter. They are fed primarily by their mothers, who regurgitates food into the mouths. The chicks fledge in the age of 3\u20135 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savingcranes.org/blue-crane.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413065102/https://www.savingcranes.org/blue-crane.html |archivedate=13 April 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> The young continue to be tended to until the next breeding season, at which time they are chased off by their parents.\n\n==Decline==\nWhile it remains common in parts of its historic range, and approx. 26&nbsp;000 individuals remain, it began a sudden population decline from around 1980 and is now classified as vulnerable.\n\nIn the last two decades, the blue crane has largely disappeared from the [[Eastern Cape Province|Eastern Cape]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Swaziland]]. The population in the northern [[Free State Province|Free State]], [[Limpopo Province|Limpopo]], [[Gauteng Province|Gauteng]], [[Mpumalanga Province|Mpumalanga]] and [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West Province]] has declined by up to 90%. The majority of the remaining population is in eastern and southern South Africa, with a small and separate population in the [[Etosha Pan]] of northern [[Namibia]]. Occasionally, isolated breeding pairs are found in five neighbouring countries.\n\nThe primary causes of the sudden decline of the blue crane are human population growth, the conversion of grasslands into commercial tree plantations, and poisoning: deliberate (to protect crops)<ref name=nw>{{cite news |last1=Wildenboer |first1=Norma |title=Blue crane massacre |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/blue-crane-massacre-1.1819128 |accessdate=25 February 2015 |agency=IOL |publisher=Diamond Fields Advertiser |date=16 February 2015}}</ref> or accidental (baits intended for other species, and as a side-effect of [[crop dusting]]).\n\nThe South African government has stepped up legal protection for the blue crane. Other conservation measures are focusing on research, habitat management, education, and recruiting the help of private landowners.\n\nThe blue crane is one of the species to which the ''Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds'' ([[AEWA]]) applies.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe blue crane is culturally significant to the [[Xhosa people]], who call it ''indwe''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://indwetrust.org/about | title=Indwe Trust - About | publisher=Indwe Trust | accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Traditionally, when a man distinguished himself in battle or otherwise, he was often decorated by a chief with blue crane feathers in a ceremory called ''ukundzabela''.

Karmal was born in [[Kamari]] and educated at [[Kabul University]]. When the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to [[Marxism]] by [[Mir Akbar Khyber]] during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government. He eventually became the leader of the [[Parcham]] faction when the PDPA split in 1967, with their ideological nemesis being the [[Khalq]] faction. Under Karmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]]'s rise to power [[1973 Afghan coup|in 1973]], and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977, and Karmal played a major role in the 1978 [[Saur Revolution]] when the PDPA took power, though in later years he denounced it.\n\nKarmal was appointed Deputy Chairman of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]], synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] meeting voted in favor of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which [[Hafizullah Amin]], a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to [[Prague]]. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of Amin's government) to stabilize the country. The Soviet troops staged a [[Operation Storm-333|coup]] and assassinated Amin. Karmal had always been highly critical of his Khalqist predecessors [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and Amin's ultra-left radicalism.\n\nKarmal was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]] on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by [[Sultan Ali Keshtmand]]. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the [[Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]]'s and Amin's rule. He also replaced the red Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people and the [[mujahideen]] rebels.\n\nThese policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of Karmal's leadership. Under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the Soviet Union deposed Karmal in 1986 and replaced him with [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to [[Moscow]]. It was [[Anahita Ratebzad]] who persuaded Najibullah to allow Babrak Karmal to return to Afghanistan in 1991, where Karmal became an associate of [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and possibly helped remove the Najibullah government from power in 1992. He eventually left Afghanistan again for Moscow. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from [[liver cancer]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nKarmal was born Sultan Hussein{{#tag:ref|His birthname has also been recorded as Sultan Hashem by certain historians.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA19 19]}}|group=note}} on 6 January 1929,{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA19 19]}} was the son of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a [[Major General]]{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4hzxpo424C&pg=PA141 141]}} in the [[Afghan National Army|Afghan Army]] and former governor of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA19 19]}} His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was [[Tajik people|Tajik]] who represented himself as a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] but others claim that he descended from [[Hindu]] ancestors of [[Kashmir]].{{sfn|Wahab|Youngerman|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y20MTE0C9kwC&pg=PA156 156] }} In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the [[Mullakhel]] branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry comes from the fact that his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA65 65]}} To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]] (Persian) and not [[Pashto language|Pashto]].{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA21 21]}}\n\nKarmal was born in [[Kamari]], a village close to [[Kabul]].{{sfn|H.

In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by [[Muhammad Daoud Khan]]. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Education]]. From 1961 to 1963 he worked in the [[Ministry of Planning (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Planning]].{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4hzxpo424C&pg=PA141 141]}} When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else.

When he was released from prison, he continued his activities in the student union, and began to promote Marxism.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA47 47]}} Karmal spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations, of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time; two of the four were established by Karmal.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA47 47\u201348]}} When the [[1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution]], which legalised the establishment of new political entities, was introduced several prominent Marxists agreed to establish a communist political party. The [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA, the Communist Party) was established in January 1965 in [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]]'s home.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA48 48]}} Factionalism within the PDPA quickly became a problem; the party split into the [[Khalq]] led by Taraki alongside [[Hafizullah Amin]], and the [[Parcham]] led by Karmal.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA49 49]}}\n{{History of Afghanistan}}\nDuring the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1965|1965 parliamentary election]] Karmal was one of four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were [[Anahita Ratebzad]], [[Nur Ahmed Nur]] and [[Fezanul Haq Fezan]]. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA32 32]}} Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing [[Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal]] as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA33 33\u201334] }}\n\nIn 1967, the PDPA unofficially split into two formal parties, one Khalqist and one Parchamist. The dissolution of the PDPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khalqist newspaper, ''[[Khalq (newspaper)|Khalq]]''. Karmal criticised the ''Khalq'' for being too [[communism|communist]], and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA34 34]}} According to the official version of events, the majority of the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]] rejected Karmal's criticism. The vote was a close one, and it is reported that Taraki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically unaligned with and one switching to the Parchamite side. Karmal and half the PDPA Central Committee left the PDPA to establish a Parchamite-led PDPA.{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA35 35]}} Officially the split was caused by ideological differences, but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Taraki versus Karmal. Taraki wanted to model the party after [[Leninism|Leninist norms]] while Karmal wanted to establish a democratic front. Other differences were socioeconomic. The majority of Khalqists came from rural areas; hence they were poorer, and were of Pashtun origin. The Parchamites were urban, richer, and spoke [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari]] more often than not. The Khalqists accused the Parchamites of having a connection with the monarchy, and because of it, referred to the Parchamite PDPA as the \"Royal Communist Party\".{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&pg=PA113 113] }} Both Karmal and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 1969|1969 parliamentary election]].{{sfn|Gladstone|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=aH_KCWVB6W0C&pg=PA114 114] }}\n\n===The Daoud era===\n{{further|Saur Revolution}}\n[[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], in collaboration with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the [[monarchy]] and instituted the Afghan [[Republic of Afghanistan|Republic in 1973]].{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA105 105]}} After Daoud's seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and [[Mir Akbar Khyber]] were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; [[Hassan Sharq]] became Deputy Prime Minister, Major [[Faiz Mohammad (politician)|Faiz Mohammad]] became [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] and [[Nematullah Pazhwak]] became [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]]. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA107 107]}} At first, the National Front government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the [[National Revolutionary Party (Afghanistan)|National Revolutionary Party]] (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA107 107]}}\n\nShortly after the ban on opposition to the NRP, Daoud began a massive purge of Parchamites in government. Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, [[Abdul Qadir (Afghan communist)|Abdul Qadir]] was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA107 107]}} To mitigate Daoud's suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the [[Saur Revolution]] (literally the April Revolution) was planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to a chain of events which ended with the communists seizing power.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA110 110\u2013111] }} Karmal, when taking power in 1979, accused Amin of ordering the assassination of Khyber.{{sfn|Tomsen|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zz9_Ve29eL0C&pg=PA110 110\u2013111] }}\n\n===Taraki\u2013Amin rule===\nTaraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]] and [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]], retaining his post as PDPA general secretary.

A PDPA Politburo meeting voted in favour of giving Central Committee membership to the officers.{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA71 71]}}\n\nOn 27 June, three months after the [[Saur Revolution]], Amin outmaneuvered the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting,{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA72 72\u201373]}} giving the Khalqists exclusive right over formulating and deciding policy.{{sfn|Westad|2005|[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA73 73]}} A purge against the Parchamites was initiated by Amin and supported by Taraki on 1 July 1979. Karmal, fearing for his safety, went into hiding in one of his Soviet friends' homes. Karmal tried to contact [[Alexander Puzanov]], the [[Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan]], to talk about the situation. Puzanov refused, and revealed Karmal's location to Amin. It should be noted that the Soviets probably saved Karmal's life by sending him to the [[Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia]].{{sfn|Rasanayagam|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QhFZHRpQdu4C&pg=PT296 296]}} In exile, Karmal established a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for 4 September 1979. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir and the Army Chief of Staff General [[Shahpur Ahmedzai]]. The coup was planned for the Festival of Eid, in anticipation of relaxed military vigilance. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. Another purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled. Few returned to Afghanistan; Karmal and [[Mohammad Najibullah]] stayed in their respective countries.{{sfn|Westad|2005|[https://books.google.com/books?id=5L8CnWkACQkC&pg=PA73 73]}} The Soviets decided that Amin should be removed to make way for a Karmal-Taraki coalition government. However Amin managed to order the arrest and later the murder of Taraki.\n\nAmin was informed of the Soviet decision to [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervene in Afghanistan]] and was initially supportive,{{sfn|Garthoff|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGG-x_tuNUcC&pg=PA1017 1017]}} but was [[Operation Storm-333|assassinated]]. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=99}} On 27 December 1979, Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people was broadcast via [[Radio Kabul]] from [[Tashkent]] in the [[Uzbek SSR]] (the radio [[wavelength]] was changed to that of Kabul), saying: \"Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices \u2013 the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen \u2013 fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=103}} Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in [[Bagram]], protected by the [[KGB]].{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=103}}\n\nThat evening [[Yuri Andropov]], the [[Chairman of the KGB]], congratulated Karmal on his rise to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the [[Revolutionary Council (Afghanistan)|Revolutionary Council]], some time before Karmal received an official appointment.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=103}} Karmal returned to Kabul on 28 December. He travelled alongside a Soviet military column. For the next few days Karmal lived in a villa on the outskirts of Kabul under the protection of the KGB. On 1 January 1980 [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and [[Alexei Kosygin]], the Soviet [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], congratulated Karmal on his \"election\" as leader.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Domestic policies===\n\n====The \"Fundamental Principles\" and amnesty====\nWhen he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general [[amnesty]]. He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse [[socialism]]. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal.  Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978\u2014a promise later proven to be a lie.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M.

His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA72 72]}}\n\nWork on the '''Fundamental Principles''' had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as [[freedom of speech]], the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that \"no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law\" and that the accused had the right to a [[fair trial]]. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of [[Politburo of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Politburo]] members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take \"families, both parents and children, under its supervision.\"{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA73 73]}} While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions.{{sfn|H. Kakar|M. Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA73 73]}}\n\nThe Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against [[national security]] and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government.  The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more.{{sfn|Yassari|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CMGfLzYWeW4C&pg=PA13 13]}}\n\n====Dividing power: Khalq\u2013Parcham====\nWith Karmal's ascension to power, Parchamites began to \"settle old scores\".{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=104}} [[Revolutionary Troika]]s were created to arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, \"As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khalq faction there will be no unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong&nbsp;... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=104}} Amin's daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until [[Mohammad Najibullah]], then leader of the PDPA, released her.{{sfn|Braithwaite|2011|p=104}} When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only [[technocrat]]s, [[Opportunism|opportunists]] and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]], but Parchamites were given control over [[KHAD]] and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Communications]] and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defence]].{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA44 44]}} In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the [[Central Committee of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Central Committee]]. Only one Khalqi, [[Saleh Mohammad Zeary]], was a member of the [[Secretariat of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Secretariat]] during Karmal's rule.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA45 45]}}\n\nOver 14 and 15 March 1982 the PDPA held a party ''conference'' at the Kabul Polytechnic Institute instead of a party ''congress'', since a party congress would have given the Khalq faction a majority and could have led to a Khalqist takeover of the PDPA. The rules of holding a party conference were different, and the Parchamites had a three-fifths majority. This infuriated several Khalqists; the threat of expulsion did not lessen their anger.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA48 48]}} The conference was not successful, but it was portrayed as such by the official media. The conference broke up after one and a half days of a 3-day long program, because of the inter-party struggle for power between the Khalqists and the Parchamites. A \"program of action\" was introduced, and party rules were given minor changes. As an explanation of the low party membership, the official media also made it seem hard to become a member of the party.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA49 49]}}\n\n====PDPA base====\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" width=60% style=\"float:right; margin:0 15px;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"9\" align=\"center\" | Karmal cabinet (1979\u20131981){{sfn|Adamec|2011|pp=Iii, Iiii & lv}}\n|-\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Office\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Incumbent\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Took office\n!colspan=1 bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Left office\n|-\n|Deputy Chairman of the [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|Council of Ministers]]\n|[[Assadullah Sarwari]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Planning (Afghanistan)|Minister of Planning]]\n|[[Sultan Ali Keshtmand]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Minister of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of National Defence]]\n|[[Muhammad Rafie]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Minister of Interior]]\n|[[Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]\n|[[Shah Muhammad Dost]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Education]]\n|[[Anahita Ratebzad]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Minister of Finance]]\n|[[Abdul Wakil]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Transport (Afghanistan)|Minister of Transport]]\n|[[Sherjan Mazduryar]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Border and Tribes (Afghanistan)|Minister of Border and Tribes]]\n|[[Faiz Muhammad]]\n|28 December 1979\n|14 September 1980\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Trade (Afghanistan)|Minister of Trade]]\n|[[Muhammad Khan Jalalar]]\n|28 December 1979\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Minister of Communications]]\n|[[Muhammad Aslam Watanjar]]\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Mines, Industries|Minister of Mines, Industries]]\n|[[Muhammad Isma'il Danesh]]\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Water, Power (Afghanistan)|Minister of Water, Power]]\n|[[Raz Muhammad Paktin]]\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Higher Education (Afghanistan)|Minister of Higher Education]]\n|Guldad\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Health (Afghanistan)|Minister of Health]]\n|[[Nazar Muhammad]]\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|-\n|[[Ministry of Agriculture (Afghanistan)|Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform]]\n|[[Fazl Rahim Mohmand]]\n|10 January 1980\n|11 June 1981\n|}\nWhen Karmal took power, he began expanding the support base of the PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to [[class enemy|class enemies]] of the revolution during Taraki and Amin's rule, to support the PDPA.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA45 45\u201346]}} Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to the Afghan people, Karmal called for the establishment of the [[National Front (Afghanistan)|National Fatherland Front]] (NFF); the NFF's founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA46 46]}}\n\nBy 1981, the government gave up on political solutions to the conflict. At the fifth PDPA Central Committee plenum in June, Karmal resigned from his Council of Ministers chairmanship and was replaced by [[Sultan Ali Keshtmand]], while [[Nur Ahmad Nur]] was given a bigger role in the Revolutionary Council. This was seen as \"base broadening\".{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA48 48]}} The previous weight given to non-PDPA members in top positions ceased to be an important matter in the media by June 1981. This was significant, considering that up to five members of the Revolutionary Council were non-PDPA members. By the end of 1981, the previous contenders, who had been heavily presented in the media, were all gone; two were given ambassadorships, two ceased to be active in politics, and one continued as an advisor to the government. The other three changed sides, and began to work for the opposition.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA48 48]}}\n\nThe national policy of reconciliation continued: in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Taraki and Amin was drastically modified, the limits of landholdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants, the literacy programme was continued, and concessions to women were made. In 1985 the [[Loya Jirga]] was reconvened. The 1985 Loya Jirga was followed by a tribal jirga in September. In 1986 [[Abdul Rahim Hatef]], a non-PDPA member, was elected to the NFF chairmanship. During the 1985\u201386 elections it was said that 60 percent of the elected officials were non-PDPA members. By the end of Karmal's rule, several non-PDPA members had high-level government positions.{{sfn|Staff writers|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e5Az1lGCJwQC&pg=PA64 64]}}\n\n====Civil war and military====\n{{further|Soviet\u2013Afghan War}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"width=60% style=\"float:right; margin:0 15px;\"\n|+'''Troop levels'''\n!Soldiers!!As of\n|-\n|25,000\n|1980{{sfn|Arnold|1983|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC&pg=PA111 111]}}\n|-\n|25\u201330,000\n|1981{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&pg=PA180 180]}}\n|-\n|25\u201330,000\n|1982{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&pg=PA180 180]}}\n|-\n|40,000\n|1983{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC&pg=PA181 181]}}\n|-\n|40,000\n|1984{{sfn|Bonosky|2001|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kZ7E6S02Gq0C&pg=PA261 261]}}\n|-\n|35\u201340,000\n|1985{{sfn|Levite|Jenteleson|Berman|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tA8jTFUFuzQC&pg=PA80 80]}}\n|}\nIn March 1979, the military budget was 6.4 million US$, which was 8.3 percent of the government budget, but only 2.2 of [[gross national product]].

The change from a political to a military solution did not come suddenly. It began in January 1981, as Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and decorated one general and thirteen colonels. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June 1981, [[Assadullah Sarwari]] lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, replaced by [[Mohammad Aslam Watanjar]], a former tank commander and [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Minister of Communications]], [[Major General]] [[Mohammad Rafi (politician)|Mohammad Rafi]] was made[[Ministry of Defence (Afghanistan)|Minister of Defence]] and [[Mohammad Najibullah]] appointed [[KHAD]] Chairman.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA47 47]}}\n\nThese measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition.{{sfn|Arnold|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmMJnaMVN6oC&pg=PA47 47]}} To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council.

In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion [[Afghan afghani]]s, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. [[GNP per capita]] decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the [[Agriculture in Afghanistan|agricultural sector]]. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The [[balance of payments]], which had grown in the pre-communist administration of [[Muhammad Daoud Khan]], decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was [[export]] and [[import]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gl.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/country.html |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]] | accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nKarmal observed in the spring of 1983 that without Soviet intervention, \"It is unknown what the destiny of the Afghan Revolution would be&nbsp;...

Kakar|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QyTmFj5tUGsC&pg=PA75 75]}} It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but [[Andrei Gromyko]] discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with [[Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with [[Mohammad Najibullah]], who had joined the PDPA at its creation.{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA95 95]}} Najibullah was thought highly of by [[Yuri Andropov]], [[Boris Ponomarev]] and [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support [[Assadullah Sarwari]]'s ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the [[Saur Revolution]].{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA96 96]}}\n\nNajibullah was appointed to the [[Secretariat of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA Secretariat]] in November 1985.  During Karmal's March 1986 visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviets tried to persuade Karmal that he was too ill to govern, and that he should resign.{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA96 96\u201397]}} This backfired, as a Soviet doctor attending to Karmal told him he was in good health. Karmal asked to return home to Kabul, and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations. Before leaving, Karmal promised he would step down as PDPA General Secretary. The Soviets did not trust him and sent [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], the head of intelligence in the [[KGB]], into Afghanistan. At a meeting in Kabul, Karmal confessed his undying love for the Soviet Union, comparing his ardor to his Muslim faith. Kryuchkov, concluding that he could not persuade Karmal to resign, left the meeting. After Kryuchkov left the room, the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited Karmal's office, telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts. Understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated, Karmal resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th PDPA Central Committee plenum. He was succeeded in his post by Najibullah.{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA97 97]}}\n\nKarmal still had support within the party, and used his base to curb Najibullah's powers. He began spreading rumors that he would be reappointed General Secretary. Najibullah's power base was in the [[KHAD]], the Afghan equivalent to the KGB, and not the party.{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA97 97]}} Considering the fact that the Soviet Union had supported Karmal for over six years, the Soviet leadership wanted to ease him out of power gradually. [[Yuli Mikhailovich Vorontsov|Yuli Vorontsov]], the [[Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan]], told Najibullah to begin undermining Karmal's power slowly. Najibullah complained to the Soviet leadership that Karmal used most of his spare time looking for errors and \"speaking against the [[National Reconciliation]] [programme]\".{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA98 98]}} At a meeting of the Soviet Politburo on 13 November 1986 it was decided that Najibullah should remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Gromyko, Vorontsov, [[Eduard Shevardnadze]], [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] and [[Viktor Chebrikov]]. A PDPA meeting in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and exiled him to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a [[dacha]].{{sfn|Kalinovsky|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rf1Yg2SGLQgC&pg=PA98 98]}} Karmal was succeeded as Revolutionary Council chairman by [[Haji Mohammad Chamkani]], who was not a member of the PDPA.{{sfn|Amtstutz|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=a0Mp1AHpp0gC&pg=PA152 152]}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nMany years after the end of his Presidency, he denounced the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978 in which he took part, taking aim at the Khalq governments of Taraki and Amin. He told a Russian reporter:\n\n<blockquote>It was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan. Parcham's leaders were against armed actions because the country was not ready for a revolution... I knew that people would not support us if we decided to keep power without such support.<ref>''Ghosts of Afghanistan: Hard Truths and Foreign Myths'' by Jonathan Steele</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor unknown reasons, Karmal was invited back to Kabul by Najibullah, and \"for equally obscure reasons Karmal accepted\",{{sfn|Steele|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hDVs0IhLcwC&pg=PA146 146]}} returning on June 20, 1991. If Najibullah's plan was to strengthen his position within the [[Watan Party of Afghanistan|Watan Party]] (the renamed PDPA) by appeasing the pro-Karmal Parchamites, he failed - Karmal's apartment became a center for opposition to Najibullah's government. When Najibullah was toppled in 1992, Karmal became the most powerful politician in Kabul through leadership of the Parcham. However, his negotiations with the rebels collapsed quickly, and on 16 April 1992 the rebels, led by [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], took Kabul.{{sfn|Clements|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bv4hzxpo424C&pg=PA26 26 (xxvi)]}} After the fall of Najibullah's government, Karmal was based in [[Hairatan]]. There, it is alleged, Karmal used most of his time either trying to establish a new party, or advising people to join the [[National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan|National Islamic Movement]] (''Junbish-i-Milli''). [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], the leader of Junbish-i-Milli, was a supporter of Karmal during his rule. It is unknown how much control Karmal had over Dostum, but there is little evidence that Karmal was in any commanding position. Karmal's influence over Dostum appeared indirect \u2013 some of his former associates supported Dostum. Those who spoke with Karmal during this period noted his lack of interest in politics.{{sfn|Giustozzi|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRScVHx4hvsC&pg=PA182 182]}} In June 1992 it was reported that he had died in a plane crash along with Dostum, although these reports later proved to be false.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-22/news/mn-687_1_plane-crash World IN BRIEF: AFGHANISTAN: General Denies Report of Fatal Crash]</ref>\n\nIn early December 1996, Karmal died in Moscow's [[Central Clinical Hospital]] from [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]].

The Buddhist path combines both philosophical reasoning and meditation.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6\">Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 6</ref> The Buddhist traditions present a multitude of [[Buddhist paths to liberation]], and Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in [[East Asia]] have covered topics as varied as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[ethics]], [[ontology]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of time]] in their analysis of these paths.\n\nEarly Buddhism was based on [[empirical evidence]] gained by the sense organs (''[[ayatana]]'')<ref>David Kalupahana, ''Causality: The Central Philosophy of Buddhism.'' The University Press of Hawaii, 1975, p. 70.</ref> and the Buddha seems to have retained a skeptical distance from [[The unanswered questions|certain metaphysical questions]], refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. A recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the reification of concepts, and the subsequent return to the Buddhist [[Middle Way]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}}<ref>David Kalupahana, ''Mulamadhyamakakarika of Nagarjuna.'' Motilal Banarsidass, 2006, p. 1.</ref>\n\nParticular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different [[schools of Buddhism]]. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to [[Early Buddhist schools|various schools in early Buddhism]] of [[Abhidharma]], and to the [[Mahayana]] traditions and schools of the [[prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Buddha-nature]] and [[Yogacara]].\n\n==Historical phases of early buddhist philosophy in India==\n\nEdward Conze splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases. The first phase concerns questions of the original doctrines derived from oral traditions that originated during the life of the Buddha, and are common to all later sects of Buddhism. The second phase concerns Hinayana \"scholastic\" Buddhism, as evident in the Abhidarma texts beginning in the third century BCE that feature scholastic reworking and schematic classification of material in the sutras. The third phase of development of Indian Buddhist philosophy concerns Mahayana \"metaphysical\" Buddhism, beginning in the late first century CE, which emphasizes monastic life and the path of a bodhisattva. Various elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and world view of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.<ref>Conze, Edward. Buddhist thought in India: Three phases of Buddhist philosophy. Vol. 4. Routledge, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical orientation==\nPhilosophy in India was aimed mainly at [[moksha|spiritual liberation]] and had [[soteriology|soteriological]] goals. In his study of [[M\u0101dhyamaka]] Buddhist philosophy in India, Peter Deller Santina writes:<ref>Santina, Peter Della. ''Madhyamaka Schools in India: A Study of the Madhyamaka Philosophy and of the Division of the System into the Prasangika and Svatantrika Schools.'' 2008. p. 31</ref>\n\n{{quote|Attention must first of all be drawn to the fact that philosophical systems in India were seldom, if ever, purely speculative or descriptive. Virtually all the great philosophical systems of India: [[S\u0101\u1e45khya]], [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaitaved\u0101nta]], M\u0101dhyamaka and so forth, were preeminently concerned with providing a means to liberation or salvation. It was a tacit assumption with these systems that if their philosophy were correctly understood and assimilated, an [[Nirvana|unconditioned state]] free of suffering and limitation could be achieved. [...] If this fact is overlooked, as often happens as a result of the propensity engendered by formal [[western philosophy|Occidental philosophy]] to consider the philosophical enterprise as a purely descriptive one, the real significance of Indian and Buddhist philosophy will be missed.}}\n\nFor the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of the Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis (''pramana'') of the world.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark 2007, page 6\"/> The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha's teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom and the gradual training also requires that a disciple \u201cinvestigate\u201d (''upaparikkhati'') and \u201cscrutinize\u201d (''tuleti'') the teachings.<ref>Smith, Douglas; Whitaker, Justin; Reading the Buddha as a philosopher, Philosophy east and west, volume 66, April 2016, page 515-538, University of Hawaii Press, http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/phil551854.pdf</ref> The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the [[V\u012bma\u1e43saka Sutta]].\n\n==The Buddha and early Buddhism==\n{{Main article|Presectarian Buddhism}}\n[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 13-14.jpg|thumbnail|right|Gautama Buddha surrounded by followers, from an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]\n\n===The Buddha===\nScholarly opinion varies as to whether the Buddha himself was engaged in philosophical inquiry.<ref>Smith, Douglass, and Justin Whitaker. \"Reading the Buddha as a Philosopher.\" Philosophy East and West 66, no. 2 (2016): 515-538.</ref> The [[Buddha]] (circa 5th century BC) was a north Indian [[sramana]] from [[Magadha]]. He cultivated various yogic techniques and ascetic practices and taught throughout north India, where his teachings took hold. These teachings are preserved in the Pali [[Nikayas]] and in the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|Agamas]] as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections. Dating these texts is difficult, and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha's teachings are about attaining the highest good of nirvana, they also contain an analysis of the source of human suffering, the nature of [[personal identity]], and the process of acquiring knowledge about the world.\n\n===The Middle Way===\nThe Buddha defined his teaching as \"the middle way\". In the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]], this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of [[asceticism]] and bodily denial (as practiced by the [[Jains]] and other [[sramana]]s) and sensual [[hedonism]] or indulgence. Many sramanas of the Buddha's time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as fasting, to liberate the mind from the body. The Buddha however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed.<ref>Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), p. 29</ref> Thus, Buddhism's main concern is not with luxury or poverty, but instead with the human response to circumstances.<ref>Swearer, Donald K. Ethics, wealth, and salvation: A study in Buddhist social ethics. Edited by Russell F. Sizemore. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1990. (from the introduction)</ref>\n\n===Basic teachings===\n{{Main|Pre-sectarian Buddhism}}\n\nCertain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:<ref>Mitchell, ''Buddhism'', Oxford University Press, 2002, page 34 and table of contents</ref>\n* The [[Middle Way]]\n* [[Four Noble Truths|The four noble truths]]\n* [[Noble Eightfold Path|The Noble Eightfold Path]]\n* [[Three marks of existence]] (impermanence, unease, not-self)\n* [[Skandha|Five aggregates]]\n* [[Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da|Dependent arising]]\n* [[Karma in Buddhism|Karma]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]\n* [[Nirvana]]\n\nCritical studies by Schmithausen, Vetter, Bronkhorst, Gombrich and others have adjusted this list of basic teachings, and revealed a more nuanced genesis of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term \"the middle way\".{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}} Vetter argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxx}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, ''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'' constituted the original \"liberating practice\",{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=58}} while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxiv-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=131}}\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Lambert Schmithausen concluded that the four truths were a later development in early Buddhism.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993}} Carol Anderson, following Lambert Schmithausen and K.R. Norman, notes that the four truths are missing in critical passages in the canon,{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=viii}} and states:\n{{quote|... the four noble truths were probably not part of the earliest strata of what came to be recognized as Buddhism, but that they emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.{{sfn|Anderson|1999|p=21}}}}\n\nAccording to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajna, or \"liberating insight\", in the suttas{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} in those texts where \"liberating insight\" was preceded by the four jhanas.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}}\n\nAccording to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to ''reject'' more than on what doctrines to ''accept''.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See for example Thanissaro Bhikkhu's commentary on the Mulapariyaya Sutta, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.001.than.html].}} Only knowledge that is useful in achieving [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.\n\n===The noble truths and causation===\nThe four noble truths or \"truths of the noble one\" are a central feature of the teachings and are put forth in the [[Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]. The first truth of [[Dukkha]], often translated as ''suffering'', is the inherent unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all phenomena.<ref>Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 21</ref> It also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly 'craving' ([[tanha]]) and ignorance ([[Avidy\u0101 (Buddhism)|avidya]]). The third truth is then the fact that if you let go of craving and remove ignorance through knowledge, dukkha ceases ([[nirodha]]). The fourth is the [[Eightfold Path|eightfold path]] which are eight practices that end suffering, they are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right [[mindfulness]] and right [[samadhi]] (mental unification, meditation). The goal taught by the Buddha, [[nirvana]], literally means 'extinguishing' and signified \"the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power [[samsara]]\".<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2011, page 48\">Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 48.</ref> Nirvana also means that after an enlightened being's death, there is no further rebirth. In early Buddhism, the concept of [[Pratitya-samutpada|dependent origination]] was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena.<ref>Shulman, Eviatar. \"Early meanings of dependent-origination.\" Journal of Indian Philosophy 36, no. 2 (2008): 297-317.</ref> The Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances.<ref>Gunnar Skirbekk, Nils Gilje, ''A history of Western thought: from ancient Greece to the twentieth century.'' 7th edition published by Routledge, 2001, p. 26.</ref> His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time, are considered to be static or independent. Craving, for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations. Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha's causal theory is simply descriptive: \u2018This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.\u2019 This understanding of causation as 'impersonal lawlike causal ordering' is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2011, page 48\"/>\n\nThe removal of suffering then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality ([[praj\u00f1a]]). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require [[meditation]], paired with understanding.<ref>Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, page 25</ref> According to the Buddha, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly see the nature of reality, which is said to have the marks of suffering, impermanence and not-self. Understanding and meditation are said to work together to 'clearly see' ([[vipassana]]) the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.\n\n===Anatta===\n{{PancaKhandha}}\n{{main article|Anatta}}\nThe Buddha argued that [[anatta|there is no permanent self]], no 'essence of a person' or 'what makes me, me'. This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, it means that there is no individual \"part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time\".<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33\">Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 33</ref> This is in opposition to the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] concept of an unchanging [[Atman (Hinduism)|ultimate self]] and any view of an eternal [[soul]]. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering, and the main obstacle to [[Moksha|liberation]].\n\nThe most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates that make up a person and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:<ref>Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 39</ref>\n\n#All psycho-physical processes ([[skandhas]]) are impermanent.\n#If there were a self it would be permanent.\n::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.] \n::\u2234 There is no self.\n\nThis argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark 2007, page 33\"/>\n\nThis argument is famously expounded in the [[Anattalakkhana Sutta]]. According to this argument, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the [[skandhas|temporary aggregates]], the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view a 'person' is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, an 'individual' is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences just like a [[chariot]] is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is [[empiricist]], for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.<ref>Panjvani, Cyrus; Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach (2013), page 131.</ref>\n\nAnother argument for 'non-self', the 'argument from lack of control'<ref>Cyrus Panjvani, Buddhism: A Philosophical Approach, p. 123.</ref> and it is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the 'executive function' of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the Indian 'Anti Reflexivity Principle' which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so, the Buddha uses this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:<ref>Siderits, Mark, \"Buddha\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/buddha/>.</ref>\n\n#If the self existed it would be the part of the person that performs the executive function, the \"controller.\"\n#The self could never desire that it be changed (anti-reflexivity principle).\n#Each of the five kinds of psycho-physical element is such that one can desire that it be changed.\n::IP [There is no more to the person than the five skandhas.]\n::\u2234 There is no self.\n\nThis argument then denies that there is one permanent \"controller\" in the person. Instead it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:\n\n\"What the Buddhist has in mind is that on one occasion one part of the person might perform the executive function, on another occasion another part might do so. This would make it possible for every part to be subject to control without there being any part that always fills the role of controller (and so is the self). On some occasions a given part might fall on the controller side, while on other occasions it might fall on the side of the controlled. This would explain how it's possible for us to seek to change any of the skandhas while there is nothing more to us than just those skandhas.\"<ref>Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, p. 48.</ref>\n\nAs noted by [[K.R. Norman]] and [[Richard Gombrich]], the Buddha extended his [[anatta]] critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] that the Self (Atman) was indeed the whole world, or [[Brahman]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Gombrich; Recovering the Buddha's Message \u00a9 The Buddhist Forum, Vol I, Seminar Papers 1987-1988</ref><ref>Norman, KR; A note on Att\u0101 in the Alagadd\u016bpama Sutta \u2013 1981</ref> This is shown by the Alagadd\u016bpama-sutta, where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the Self cannot be the whole world. {{refn|group=lower-alpha|MN 22, Alagaddupama Sutta, \"Bhikkhus, what do you think? If people carried off the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in this Jeta Grove, or burned them, or did what they liked with them, would you think: \u2018People are carrying us off or burning us or doing what they like with us\u2019?\u201d\u2014\u201cNo, venerable sir. Why not? Because that is neither our self nor what belongs to our self.\" [https://suttacentral.net/en/mn22/69-70].}} In this sutta (as well as in the Soatt\u0101 Sutta) the Buddha outlines six wrong views about Self:\n\n<blockquote>\"There are six wrong views: An unwise, untrained person may think of the body, \u2018This is mine, this is me, this is my self\u2019; he may think that of feelings; of perceptions; of volitions; or of what has been seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought or considered by the mind. The sixth is to identify the world and self, to believe: \u2018At death I shall become permanent, eternal, unchanging, and so remain forever the same; and that is mine, that is me, that is my self.\u2019 A wise and well-trained person sees that all these positions are wrong, and so he is not worried about something that does not exist.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/></blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, the Buddha argues that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the Self. The idea that \"this cosmos is the self\" is one of the [[View (Buddhism)|views]] rejected by the Buddha <ref>Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], MN 22 PTS: M i 130 Alagaddupama Sutta: The Water-Snake Simile, 2004, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html</ref> along with the related [[Monism|Monistic]] theory that held that \"everything is a Oneness\" (SN 12.48 Lokayatika Sutta).<ref>Thanissaro Bhikkhu [trans], SN 12.48 PTS: S ii 77 CDB i 584 Lokayatika Sutta: The Cosmologist, 1999;  http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.048.than.html</ref> The Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of not-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance about the true nature of personality led to further suffering.\n\n===Epistemology===\n{{Main|Epistemology}}\n\nAll schools of [[Indian philosophy]] recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or ''[[pramana|pram\u0101\u1e47a]]'' and many see the [[Vedas]] as providing access to truth. The Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of having a proper understanding of reality ('right view').<ref>BOdhi; The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, page 117; AN 1.307 \u201cBhikkhus, I do not see even a single thing on account of\nwhich unarisen wholesome qualities arise and arisen wholesome qualities increase\nand expand so much as right view.\u201d</ref> However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience.<ref>Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, p. 223.</ref> Therefore, the Buddha's epistemic project is different than that of modern philosophy, it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.\n\nThe Buddha's epistemology has been compared to [[empiricism]], in the sense that it was based on experience of the world through the senses.<ref>Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, page 224.</ref><ref>Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</ref> The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields ([[ayatanas]]) was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some suttas go further, stating that \"the All\", or everything that exists (''sabbam''), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, Sabba Sutta) <ref>D. J. Kalupahana, A Buddhist tract on empiricism, https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kk3n/80-300/kalupahana1969.pdf</ref> and that anyone who attempts to describe another \"All\" will be unable to do so because \"it lies beyond range\".<ref>SN 35.23 PTS: S iv 15 CDB ii 1140\nSabba Sutta: The All, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu \u00a9 2001, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.023.than.html</ref> This sutta seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or [[noumena]], are beyond our epistemological reach (''avisaya'').<ref>Hamilton, Sue. 2000. Early Buddhism: a New Approach: the I of the Beholder. Richmond, Surrey:\nCurzon</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in the [[Kalama sutta]] the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one's beliefs is verification in one\u2019s own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from personal authority, sacred tradition (''anussava'') or any kind of [[rationalism]] which constructs metaphysical theories (''takka'').<ref>Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 177; 206.</ref> In the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of [[Brahman]]. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the [[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN.I.265):\n\n::\"Monks, do you only speak that which is known by yourselves seen by yourselves, found by yourselves?\" \n::\"Yes, we do, sir.\" \n::\"Good, monks, That is how you have been instructed by me in this timeless doctrine which can be realized and verified, that leads to the goal and can be understood by those who are intelligent.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the \"Discourse to Prince Abhaya\" (MN.I.392\u20134) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences.<ref>Emmanuel, Steven M (editor); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, 2013, page 228.</ref> This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or 'what works' has been called by scholars such as [[Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids|Mrs Rhys Davids]] and [[Charles Jean de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin|Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] a form of [[Pragmatism]].<ref>Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 356.</ref><ref>Poussin; Bouddhisme, Third Edition, Paris, 1925, p. 129</ref> However, [[K. N. Jayatilleke]] argues the Buddha's epistemology can also be taken to be a form of [[correspondence theory]] (as per the 'Apannaka Sutta') with elements of [[Coherentism]] <ref>Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, page 352-353.</ref> and that for the Buddha, it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to cessation of suffering and evil.\n\nThe Buddha discouraged his followers from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the goal of awakening. Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the [[Pali Canon|scriptures]], during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] [[The unanswered questions|questions]] which he regarded as the basis for \"unwise reflection\". These 'unanswered questions' (avy\u0101kata) regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]], the complete inexistence of a person after [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] and death, and others. The Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable ([[Acinteyya]]) issues led to \"a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views\" (Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta).\n\nOne explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic [[Epoch\u00e9]] is that such questions distract from activity that is practical to realizing [[bodhi|enlightenment]]<ref>[[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 72 [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.072.than.html (Thanissaro, 1997)]. For further discussion of the context in which these statements was made, see [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html Thanissaro (2004)].</ref> and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the Dharma is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the 'Parable of the raft' and the [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow]].<ref>Jayatilleke, K. N.; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 357.</ref> The Dharma is a like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana (\"for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto\", MN 22) once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that, the particulars of how one was [[Parable of the Poisoned Arrow|injured by a poisoned arrow]] (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense the Buddha was often called 'the great physician' because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.<ref>Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, page 36.</ref>\n\nHaving said this, it is still clear that resisting (even, refuting) a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha's confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn't be disparaged by buddhists.\n\nAfter the Buddha's death, some Buddhists such as [[Dharmakirti]] went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The [[Theravada|Therav\u0101da]] commentary, ascribed to [[Dhammapala]], on the ''[[Nettipakarana|Nettipakara\u1e47a]]'', says (P\u0101li ''pam\u0101\u1e47a'' is equivalent to Sanskrit ''pram\u0101\u1e47a''): \"''na hi p\u0101\u1e37ito a\u00f1\u00f1a\u1e43 pam\u0101\u1e47atara\u1e43 atthi'' (quoted in [[P\u0101li Text Society]] edition of the Nettipakara\u1e47a, 1902, page XI) which Nanamoli translates as: \"for there is no other criterion beyond a text\" (''The Guide'', P\u0101li Text Society, 1962, page xi).}})\n\n===Transcendence===\nAnother possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in [[metaphysics]] is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' inadequate to explain it.<ref name=\"Nagao\">Gadjin M. Nagao, ''Madhyamika and Yogachara.'' Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate [[misology]] or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened.<ref name=\"Nagao\"/> Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on imagining direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in yogic meditation.\n\nThe Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of \"truth\") as \"beyond reasoning\" or \"transcending logic\", in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going \"beyond reasoning\" means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside the system as a whole.<ref>Sue Hamilton, ''Early Buddhism''. Routledge, 2000, page 135.</ref>\n\n===Meta-ethics===\n{{main article|Buddhist ethics}}\nThe Buddha's ethics are based on the [[soteriological]] need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of [[karma]]. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to [[virtue ethics]] (this approach began with Damien Keown).<ref>Damien Keown, The Nature of Buddhist Ethics, 1992.</ref> Keown writes that Buddhist [[Nirvana]] is analogous to the Aristotelian [[Eudaimonia]], and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.\n\nThe Buddha outlined [[five precepts]] (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.\n\nFirst, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result (and vice versa). Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However the important word here is ''intentionally'', for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the [[Jains]] who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls \u2018an ethicised consciousness\u2019.<ref>Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n\nThis idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha; intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]], the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful (''akusala'') in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.\n\nThe third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of \"my\" suffering and someone else's. Instead an enlightened person would just work to end suffering ''tout court'', without thinking of the conventional concept of persons.<ref>Siderits, Mark. Buddhism as philosophy, 2007, page 82.</ref> According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.\n\n==Abhidharma==\n[[File:Buddhaghosa_with_three_copies_of_Visuddhimagga.jpg|thumbnail|[[Buddhaghosa]] (c. 5th century), the most important Abhidharma scholar of [[Therav\u0101da]] Buddhism, presenting three copies of the [[Visuddhimagga]].<ref>Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 206.</ref>]]\n{{main article|Abhidharma}}\nThe main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed ''[[Abhidharma]]'' which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called \"''[[Abhidharma#The dharma theory|dharmas]]''\". Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharmic schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[process philosophy]].<ref name=\"Nyanaponika page 35\">Nyanaponika, Abhidhamma studies, page 35</ref><ref>Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist metaphysics</ref> Abhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of ''dharmas'', or phenomenal events, but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream, everything else is merely conceptual (''pa\u00f1\u00f1atti'') and nominal.\n\nThis view has been termed \"[[Mereology|mereological]] reductionism\" by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes.<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 105</ref> Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.), \"disappear under analysis\" and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the [[Nyaya]] school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]].<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 117-118</ref> Some Abhidharmikas such as the [[Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da]] were also strict [[nominalists]], and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.\n\n===Competing Abhidharma schools===\nAn important Abhidhamma work from the [[Therav\u0101da]] school is the [[Kath\u0101vatthu]] (\"Points of controversy\"), by the scholar-monk [[Moggaliputta-Tissa]] (ca.327\u2013247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that 'all exists' (sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da), the theory of momentariness (kh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da) and the personalist view ([[pudgalavada]])<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David page 128\">Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 128.</ref> These were the major philosophical theories which divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India. After being brought to [[Sri Lanka]] in the first century BCE, the Theravada Pali language Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of [[Buddhaghosa]] (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the [[Theravada]] school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of [[Atthakatha]], commentaries (as well as [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]) on the Pali Abhidhamma, but also included short summaries and compendiums.\n\nThe [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katy\u0101y\u0101niputra (the compiler of the [[Mahavibhasa]], a central text of the school) eventually refined this system into a robust [[Philosophical realism|realism]], which also included a type of [[essentialism]]. This realism was based on a quality of dharmas, which was called [[svabhava]] or 'intrinsic existence'.<ref>Kalupahana, David; A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities, page 128</ref> Svabhava is a sort of [[essence]], though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] with regards to time, hence the name of their school means \"the view that everything exists\".<ref name=\"Kalupahana, David page 128\"/>\n\nOther Buddhist schools such as the Praj\u00f1aptivadins ('nominalists'), the Purvasailas and the Vainasikas refused to accept the concept of [[svabhava]].<ref>Sh\u00ec h\u00f9if\u0113ng, \u201cDependent Origination = Emptiness\u201d\u2014N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Innovation? An Examination of the Early and Mainstream Sectarian Textual Sources</ref> The main topic of the [[Tattvasiddhi]] \u015a\u0101stra by Harivarman (3-4th century AD), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness ([[shunyata]]) of dharmas.<ref>Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. pp. 91-92</ref>\n\nThe Therav\u0101dins and other schools such as the [[Sautrantika|Sautr\u0101ntikas]] attacked the realism of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar [[Vasubandhu]], an ex-Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din, who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for [[philosophical presentism]] in his comprehensive treatise, the [[Abhidharmakosa]]. This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Therav\u0101da also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also [[Philosophical presentism|presentists]].<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2011, page 124\">Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony; Wynne, Alexander; Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, 2011, p. 124.</ref> The Therav\u0101din presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din view, but is more of a phenomenology<ref name=\"Nyanaponika page 35\"/> and hence the concept of svabhava for the Therav\u0101dins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. According to [[Y Karunadasa]]:\n\n<blockquote>In the Pali tradition it is only for the sake of definition and description that each dhamma is postulated as if it were a separate entity; but in reality it is by no means a solitary phenomenon having an existence of its own...If this Abhidhammic view of existence, as seen from its doctrine of dhammas, cannot be interpreted as a radical pluralism, neither can it be interpreted as an out-and-out monism. For what are called dhammas -- the component factors of the universe, both within us and outside us -- are not fractions of an absolute unity but a multiplicity of co-ordinate factors. They are not reducible to, nor do they emerge from, a single reality, the fundamental postulate of monistic metaphysics. If they are to be interpreted as phenomena, this should be done with the proviso that they are phenomena with no corresponding [[noumena]], no hidden underlying ground. For they are not manifestations of some mysterious metaphysical substratum, but processes taking place due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.<ref>Prof. Dr. Y. Karunadasa, THE DHAMMA THEORY, p. 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn important theory held by some Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins, Therav\u0101dins and Sautr\u0101ntikas was the theory of \"momentariness\" (Skt., k\u1e63\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, Pali, kh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment (''ksana'') after they arise. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins saw these 'moments' in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the [[Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]].<ref>Ronkin, Noa, \"Abhidharma\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/>.</ref> The Therav\u0101dins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Kha\u1e47ikakath\u0101 of the [[Kathavatthu]] which attempts to refute the doctrine that \"all phenomena (dhamma) are\nas momentary as a single mental entity.\"<ref>Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, page 18.</ref> However momentariness was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Therav\u0101dins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar [[Buddhagosa]].<ref>Von Rospatt, Alexander; The Buddhist Doctrine of Momentariness: A Survey of the Origins and Early Phase of This Doctrine up to Vasubandhu, p. 36.</ref>\n\nAll Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of [[perception]]. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred [[representationalism]] and held that we only perceive objects indirectly.<ref>Ronkin, Noa, \"Abhidharma\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/abhidharma/></ref> The major argument used for this view by the Sautr\u0101ntikas was the \"time lag argument.\" According to Mark Siderits: \"The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can't be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists.\"<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, 132</ref> This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.\n\nOne major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the [[Pudgalavadin]] or 'personalist' schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of 'personhood' in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2011, page 124\"/> This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (praj\u00f1apti) and only conventionally real.\n\n==Indian Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy==\nFrom about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery-university complexes such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramasila]], which became centres of learning in North India. Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma while at the same time critiquing them and introducing new concepts and ideas. Since the Mah\u0101y\u0101na held to the [[Pragmatism|pragmatic concept of truth]]<ref>Williams, ''Mahayana Buddhism'', Routledge, 1989, p. 2</ref> which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally \"true\" in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, the new theories and practices were seen as 'skillful means' ([[Upaya]]). The Mahayana also promoted the [[Bodhisattva]] ideal, which included an attitude of compassion for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in [[samsara]] (the cycle of birth and death) to benefit all other beings who are suffering.\n\nMajor Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the [[Prajnaparamita]], [[Madhyamaka]], [[Tathagatagarbha]], the Epistemological school of Dignaga, [[Yogacara|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], [[Tiantai]] and the Chan/[[Zen]] schools.\n\n===Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 and Madhyamaka===\n[[File:Nagardjuna.jpg|thumb|Nagarjuna, protected by the [[N\u0101ga|Nagas]] snake spirits who are said to be the guardians of the Prajnaparamita sutras.]]\nThe earliest [[Prajnaparamita|Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101-sutras]] (1st century BC) emphasize the emptiness ([[Shunyata]]) of phenomena or dhammas. The 'perfection of insight' (Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101) is said to be true knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is illusory and empty of essence. The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' states that: \n{{quote|All conditioned phenomena<br>\n Are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow,<br>\n Like dew or a flash of lightning;<br>\n Thus we shall perceive them.\u201d<ref name=\"chungtai\">{{cite web|title=The Diamond of Perfect Wisdom Sutra |url=http://ctzen.org/sunnyvale/enUS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=141&Itemid=57|publisher=Chung Tai Translation Committee|accessdate=April 16, 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nThe ''[[Heart Sutra]]'' famously affirms the emptiness or voidness ([[shunyata]]) of phenomena:\n{{quote|\"Oh, Sariputra, Form Does not Differ From the Void,<br>\nAnd the Void Does Not Differ From Form.<br>\nForm is Void and Void is Form;<br>\nThe Same is True For Feelings,<br>\nPerceptions, Volitions and Consciousness\".<ref>[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm The Heart Sutra Prajna Paramita Hrydaya Sutra]</ref>}}\n\nThe Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna|N\u0101g\u0101rjuna]] (c. AD 150 \u2013 c. 250) and the [[Madhyamaka]] (Middle way) school. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was one of the most influential Indian Buddhist thinkers; he gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of [[phenomena]] and attacked the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da and Pudgalavada schools' essentialism in his magnum opus, ''[[Mulamadhyamakakarika|The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way]]'' (''M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101'').<ref>Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pp. 221\u2013222.</ref> In the ''M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101'', Nagarjuna relies on [[reductio ad absurdum]] arguments to refute various theories which assume an inherent [[essence]] or \"own being\" ([[svabhava]]). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 183</ref>\n\n[[Nagarjuna]] asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, [[dependent origination]], selflessness (''[[anatta]]''), and emptiness (''[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]]''). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of any substantial being (''anatta'') underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as emptiness (''\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101''), or emptiness of a nature or essence (''[[svabh\u0101va]] sunyam'').\n\nLater philosophers of the Madhyamaka school built upon Nagarjuna's analysis and defended Madhyamaka against their opponents. These included [[\u0100ryadeva]] (3rd century CE), N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's pupil; [[Candrak\u012brti]] (600\u2013c. 650), who wrote an important commentary on the M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101; and [[Shantideva]] (8th century). [[Buddhap\u0101lita]] (470\u2013550) has been understood as the originator of the 'pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika' approach which is based on critiquing essentialism only through ''reductio ad absurdum'' arguments. He was criticized by [[Bh\u0101vaviveka]] (c. 500 \u2013 c. 578), who argued for the use of syllogisms \"to set one's own doctrinal stance\". These two approaches were later termed the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika and the Sv\u0101tantrika approaches to Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.\n\nInfluenced by the work of [[Dignaga]], [[Bh\u0101vaviveka]]'s Madhyamika philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. [[Candrak\u012brti]] on the other hand, critiqued Bh\u0101vaviveka's adoption of the epistemological (''[[pramana]]'') tradition on the grounds that it contained a subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna's famous statement in the ''Vigrahavyavartani'' which says \"I have no thesis\" for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements.<ref>Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 213</ref> [[Candrak\u012brti]] held that a true Madhyamika could only use \"consequence\" (''[[Prasa\u1e45gika|prasanga]]'') in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponents position without asserting an \"autonomous inference\" (''[[Svatantrika|svatantra]]''), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.\n\nIn China, the Madhyamaka school (known as [[East Asian M\u0101dhyamaka|S\u0101nl\u00f9n]]) was founded by [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] (344\u2013413 CE) who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] 's pupil [[Sengzhao]], [[Jizang]] (549\u2013623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka and [[Hyegwan]], a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.\n\n===Yog\u0101c\u0101ra===\n{{main article|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra}}\n[[File:Seshin Vasubandhu Kofukuji.jpg|thumbnail|[[Vasubandhu]]  wrote in defense of Vij\u00f1apti-matra (appearance only) as well as writing a massive work on [[Abhidharma]], the [[Abhidharmakosa]].]]\nThe [[Yog\u0101c\u0101ra|Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school]] (''Yoga practice'') was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers [[Asanga]] and [[Vasubandhu]]<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 147\">Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 147</ref> and with various sutras such as the [[Sandhinirmocana Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. The central feature of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thought is the concept of ''Vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101tra'', often translated as \"impressions only\" or \"appearance only\" and this has been interpreted as a form of [[Idealism]] or as a form of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]]. Other names for the Yogacara school are 'Vij\u00f1anavada' (the doctrine of consciousness) and 'Cittamatra' (mind-only).<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 147\"/>\n\nYogacara thinkers like  [[Vasubandhu]] argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu's ''Vijnaptimatratasiddhi'', or 'The Proof that There Are Only Impressions' (20 verses) begins thus:\n\n\"I. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, \nJust like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.\" <ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 149\">Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 149</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Vasubandhu]] then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something \"out there\" when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the [[dream argument]] to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 149\"/> The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be intersubjective is proved by the event of a [[wet dream]] and by the mass or shared [[hallucinations]] created by the karma of certain types of beings.<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 156</ref>\n\nAfter having argued that impressions only is a theory which can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to [[wikt:Parsimony|parsimony]] - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 158\">Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp 158</ref> Inter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various mental streams and their [[karma]], and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the 'internal' sense of self as observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator Sthiramati explains this thus:\n\n\"There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is no thing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer.\"<ref>Siderits, Mark; Buddhism as philosophy, pp. 176</ref>\n\nVasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of [[Buddhist atomism]] and the Abhidharma theory of [[svabhava]]. He argued that atoms as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities) would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.<ref name=\"Siderits, Mark pp 158\"/>\n\nLater Yogacara thinkers include [[Dharmapala of Nalanda]], [[Sthiramati]], [[Chandragomin]] (who debated Candrakirti), and [[\u015a\u012blabhadra]]. Yogacarins such as [[Paramartha]] and [[Gu\u1e47abhadra]] brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as [[East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra|W\u00e9ish\u00ed-z\u014dng or F\u01cexi\u00e0ng-z\u014dng]]. As an important contribution to East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is [[Xuanzang]]'s ''Cheng Weishi Lun'', or \"Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.\n\n===Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-M\u0101dhyamika synthesis===\n[[J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha]] (8th century) and his student [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] (725\u2013788) brought together Yogacara, Madhyamaka and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the ''Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Svatantrika-M\u0101dhyamika''. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet which was conducted at Samye. [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]]'s disciples included [[Haribhadra (Buddhist philosopher)|Haribhadra]] and [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]]. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought.\n\n===Tathagatagarbha===\n{{main article|Tathagatagarbha}}\n\nThe ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tath\u0101gathagarbha sutras]]'', in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that the potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) philosophical trend within Buddhism to a decidedly more [[cataphatic]] (positive) modus.\n\nPrior to the period of these scriptures, Mah\u0101y\u0101na [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the ''tath\u0101gatagarbha'' genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism.\n\nIn these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.<ref>Sallie B.

This tradition is called \u201cthose who follow reasoning\u201d (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su \u2018brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da', or \u201cthe Epistemological School.\u201d<ref>Tillemans, Tom, \"Dharmak\u012brti\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N.

They attacked Hindu theories of God, universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul (''atman'').\n\n==Tantra==\nThe tradition associated with a group of texts known as the [[Buddhist Tantras]], known as [[Vajrayana]], developed by the eighth century in North India. By this time Tantra was a key feature of Indian Buddhism, and Indian Tantric scholars developed philosophical defenses, [[hermeneutics]] and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the [[Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra]] and the [[Guhyagarbha Tantra]].\n\nWhile the view of the Vajrayana was based on [[Madhyamaka]], [[Yogacara]] and [[Buddha-nature]] theories,<ref>Wayman, Alex; The Buddhist Tantras: Light on Indo-Tibetan Esotericism, 2013, page 3.</ref><ref>Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125.</ref> it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods ([[upaya]]) of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret [[mantras]], alcohol, [[Karmamudr\u0101|sexual yoga]], complex visualizations of [[mandalas]] filled with [[wrathful deities]] and other practices and injunctions which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist thought. The Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra for example, states \"you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women\".<ref>Damien Keown, Charles S. Prebish (editors) Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Guhyasamaja tantra and Guhyagarbha tantra</ref> Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and sexuality.<ref>Bibhuti Baruah; Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism, pp. 154-162</ref>\n\nThe defense of these practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting, the [[Hevajra tantra]] states:\n\n<blockquote>Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.<ref>Snellgrove, David. (1987) Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and their Tibetan successors. pp 125-126.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the [[Vimalaprabha]] of Pundarika (a commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra) is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice. For example, in the Vimalaprabha, \"killing living beings\" refers to stopping the [[prana]] at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti's ''Pradipoddyotana'', a commentary to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, killing living beings is glossed as \"making them void\" by means of a \"special [[samadhi]]\" which according to Bus-ton is associated with [[completion stage]] tantric practice.<ref>Lopez, Donald (editor); Buddhist Hermeneutics, page 92</ref>\n\nDouglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation ([[nirvana]]) and [[Buddhahood]] is not seen as something outside or an event in the future, but as imminently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like [[deity yoga]], and hence Vajrayana is also called the \"resultant vehicle\".<ref>Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na in \"A companion to Buddhist philosophy\", page 100.</ref> Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajrayana as a form of [[pantheism]], by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.<ref>Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na in \"A companion to Buddhist philosophy\", page 106.</ref>\n\nMajor Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as [[Buddhaguhya]], Padmavajra (author of the ''Guhyasiddhi''), Nagarjuna (7th century disciple of [[Saraha]]), [[Indrabhuti]] (author of the ''J\u00f1\u0101nasiddhi''), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, [[Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti]] and [[Abhayakaragupta]] wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition.<ref>Goodman (ed.), Davidson (ed.); Tibetan Buddhism: Reason and Revelation, page 109.</ref><ref>Bhattacharyya, Benoytosh; An Introduction to Buddhist Esoterism, pp. 66</ref> Others such as [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[\u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha]] brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as [[Yi Xing]] and [[K\u016bkai]]. In [[Tibet]], philosophers such as [[Sakya Pandita]] (1182-28 \u2013 1251), [[Longchenpa]] (1308\u20131364) and [[Tsongkhapa]] (1357\u20131419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Tibetan.\n\n==Tibetan Buddhist philosophy==\n{{main article|Tibetan Buddhism}}\nTibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian traditions of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and the Dignaga-Dharmak\u012brti school of epistemology or \"reliable cognition\" (Sanskrit: ''Pramana'', Tib. ''tshad ma''). The initial efforts of [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] and [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]] brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet. Other influences include Buddhist Tantras and the Buddha nature texts.\n\nThe initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries, this initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of [[Dharmakirti]] and these include Ngok Lo-dza-wa (1059-1109) and Cha-ba (1182-1251). Their works are now lost.<ref>Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, p. 22.</ref> The 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of [[Chandrakirti]], the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as [[Patsab Nyima Drakpa]], Kanakavarman<ref>Lopez, Donald; A study of Svatantrika, p. 262</ref> and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the [[prasangika]] and [[svatantrika]] views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools.<ref>Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 215</ref> The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]], [[Kamala\u015b\u012bla]] and their defenders, reason is useful is establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness, then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual [[gnosis]] that does not rely on reason. For Chandrakirti however, this is wrong, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason's role here is to negate any essence or essentialist views, and then eventually negate itself along with any [[Conceptual proliferation]].<ref name=\"Garfield, Jay p. 217\">Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 217</ref>\n\nThere are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the [[Sakya]] school holds a mostly [[anti-realist]] philosophical position, while the [[Gelug]] school tends to defend a form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. The [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).<ref name=\"Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2\">Dreyfus, Georges B. J. Recognizing Reality: Dharmakirti's Philosophy and Its Tibetan Interpretations (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies), 1997, page 2.</ref>\n\n===Shengtong and Buddha nature===\nThe 14th century saw increasing interest in the [[Buddha nature]] texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284-1339), especially his treatise \"Profound Inner Meaning\".<ref name=\"Garfield, Jay p. 256\">Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 256</ref> This treatise describes ultimate nature or [[suchness]] as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.<ref name=\"Garfield, Jay p. 256\"/>\n\n[[Dolpopa]] (''Dol-bo-ba'', 1292\u20131361), founder of the [[Jonang]] school, developed a view called [[shentong]] (Wylie: gzhan {{nat|stong}}) (other empty), which is closely tied to [[Yogacara]] and Buddha-nature theories. This view holds that the qualities of Buddhahood or [[Buddha nature]] are already present in the mind, and that it is empty of all conventional reality which occludes its own nature as Buddhahood or [[Dharmakaya]]. According to Dolpopa all beings are said to have Buddha nature which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. Dolpopa's shentong view taught that ultimate reality was truly a \"Great Self\" or \"Supreme Self\" referring to works such as the ''[[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]]'', the ''[[A\u1e45gulim\u0101l\u012bya S\u016btra]]'' and the ''[[\u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b Si\u1e43han\u0101da S\u016btra]].''<ref>Hopkins, Jeffrey, ''Mountain Doctrine'', 2006 passim</ref> This view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as [[Nyingma]] and [[Kagyu]] thinkers and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]].<ref>Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 257</ref> The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar [[T\u0101ran\u0101tha]] (1575\u20131634).\n\nIn the late 17th century the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the [[5th Dalai Lama]], who converted the majority of their monasteries in [[Tibet]] to the [[Gelug]] order, although several survived in secret.<ref name=\"Stearns\">{{cite book|last1=Stearns|first1=Cyrus|title=The Buddha from Dolpo : a study of the life and thought of the Tibetan master Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen|date=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=978-8120818330}}, p. 73</ref>\n\n===Gelug===\n[[File:Tsongkapa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Tsongkapa, 15th-century painting, [[Rubin Museum of Art]] ]]\n[[Je Tsongkhapa]] (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357\u20131419) founded the [[Gelug]] school of Tibetan Buddhism which came to dominate the country through the office of the [[Dalai Lama]] and is the major defender of the [[Prasa\u1e45gika]] Madhyamaka view, his work is influenced by the philosophy of [[Candrakirti]] and [[Dharmakirti]]. Tsongkhapa's magnum opus is ''The Ocean of Reasoning'', a Commentary on Nagarjuna\u2019s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]]. Gelug philosophy is based upon study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa's works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).\n\nTsongkhapa defended Prasangika [[Madhyamaka]] as the highest view and critiqued the [[Svatantrika]]. Tsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the [[Shunyata|emptiness]] of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization.<ref>Shantarakshita and Ju Mipham (2005) The Adornment of the Middle Way Padmakara Translation, pp. 21-24</ref> Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view.<ref name=\"Garfield, Jay p. 217\"/> Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of [[svabhava]] or own essence) which could lead to Absolutism and over-negation which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa's solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the [[two truths]] framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism <ref>Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, p. 220</ref> while holding that from the view of ultimate truth (''paramarthika satya''), all things (including [[Buddha nature]] and [[Nirvana]]) are empty of inherent existence ([[svabhava]]) and true enlightenment is this realization of emptiness.\n\nSakya scholars such as Rongt\u00f6n and [[Gorampa]] disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa's realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa's students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars' anti-realism.\n\n===Sakya===\n[[Sakya Pandita]] (1182\u20131251) was a 13th-century head of the [[Sakya]] school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting [[Dharmakirti]]'s ''[[Pramanavarttika]]'' (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' (''Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter'') set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge.<ref name=\"Dreyfus, Georges B. J 1997, page 2\"/> Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden enlightenment which was held by some teachers of the \"Chinese Great Perfection\" in Tibet.\n\nLater Sakyas such as [[Gorampa]] (1429\u20131489) and [[Sakya Chokden]] (1428\u20131507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. [[Sakya Chokden]] also critiqued Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his ''Definite ascertainment of the middle way'', Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language.<ref>Leaman, Oliver [ed.]; Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy; Sakya Chokden</ref> Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality.<ref>Hookham, SK. The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga, SUNY pres, p. 158</ref> Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization.<ref>Brunnholzl, Karl; Luminous Heart: The Third Karmapa on Consciousness, Wisdom, and Buddha Nature, p. 107.</ref> Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.\n\n===Nyingma and Rim\u00e9===\n[[File:MiphamNew.jpg|thumb|Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso.]]\nThe Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of [[Dzogchen]] (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. [[Longchenpa]] (1308\u20131364) was a major philosopher of the [[Nyingma]] school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of [[Dzogchen]] and on Buddhist [[Tantra]]. These include the ''[[Seven Treasuries|Seven Treasures]]'', the ''[[Trilogy of Natural Ease]]'', and his ''[[Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness]]''. Longchenpa's works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions.<ref>D. Germano, The Tantric Philosophical Prose and Poetry of Longchenpa, Religion and the Literary in Tibet, AAR, November 7, 2012, https://tiblit.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/germano_aartiblit2012_combined.pdf</ref> For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous clarity, [[rigpa]], or [[Buddha nature]] and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and [[tantra]].<ref>Duckworth, Douglas, Jamgon Mipam his life and teachings, pp 60.</ref> Longchenpa's philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the \"Ground\" (''gzhi''), the immanent Buddha nature, \"the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present\" which is \"free from all elaborated extremes\".<ref>Garfield, Jay; Edelglass, William; The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, pp. 256\u2013257</ref>\n\nThe 19th century saw the rise of the [[Rim\u00e9 movement]] (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school's criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and [[Bon]] philosophical views and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. [[Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo]] (1820-1892) and [[Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl]] (1813-1899) were the founders of Rim\u00e9. The Rim\u00e9 movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan.<ref name=GKLT-I>Callahan, Elizabeth (2007). ''The Treasury of Knowledge: Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy''. Introduction, p. 10</ref> The aim of the movement was \"a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.\"<ref name=GKLT-I/> Philosophically, [[Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl]] defended [[Shentong]] as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rim\u00e9 scholar [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846\u20131912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a [[Nyingma]] perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung 'jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of ''rangtong'' (self emptiness).<ref>Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 102.</ref> The later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894\u20131959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their \"object of negation\"; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.<ref>Emmanuel, Steven M. (Ed.); A Companion to Buddhist Philosophy, p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe [[14th Dalai Lama]] was also influenced by this eclectic approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:\n\n<blockquote>There is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation \u2013 14th Dalai Lama<ref>The 14th Dalai Lama, Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection, p. 166.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==East Asian Buddhism==\n[[File:Sramana Zhiyi.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Painting of \u015arama\u1e47a [[Zhiyi]] of the Tiantai school.]]\n\n===Tiantai===\n\n{{main article|Tiantai}}\n\nThe schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by [[Zhiyi]] (538\u2013597),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">JeeLoo Liu, Tian-tai Metaphysics vs. Hua-yan Metaphysics A Comparative Study</ref> was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. The doctrine of Tiantai was based on the [[ekayana]] or \"one vehicle\" doctrine taught in the [[Lotus sutra]] and sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings and texts into a comprehensively inclusive hierarchical system, which placed the Lotus sutra at the top of this hierarchy.\n\nTiantai's metaphysics is an immanent [[holism]], which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all \u201cinherently entailed\u201d within each other.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">Ziporyn, Brook, \"Tiantai Buddhism\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/buddhism-tiantai/>.</ref> Each moment of consciousness is simply the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.\n\nThis metaphysics is entailed in the Tiantai teaching of the \"three truths\" which is an extension of the M\u0101dhyamaka [[two truths]] doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness ([[shunyata]]) and the third truth of 'the exclusive Center' (\u4f46\u4e2d ''danzhong'') or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] and expressed by the claim that nothing is \u201cNeither-Same-Nor-Different\u201d than anything else, but rather each 'thing' is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of 'The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances'(\u8af8\u6cd5\u5be6\u76f8 zhufashixiang) and each thought \"contains three thousand worlds\". This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as \"evil is ineradicable from the highest good, [[Buddhahood]].\"<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/> Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are the ultimately the same, as Zhiyi writes \"A single, unalloyed reality is all there is \u2013 no entities whatever exist outside of it.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThough Zhiyi did write \"One thought contains three thousand worlds\", this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, \"The objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning\" (The Esoteric Meaning, 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.\n\nOther key figures of Tiantai thought are [[Zhanran]] (711\u2013782) and [[Siming Zhili]] (960\u20131028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have [[Buddha nature]], since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as [[Tendai]] and was first brought to the island by [[Saicho]].\n\n===Huayan===\n\n[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A 3D rendering of [[Indra's net]].]]\n{{main article|Huayan school}}\n\nThe [[Huayan school|Huayan]] developed the doctrine of \"interpenetration\" or \"coalescence\" (Wylie: ''zung-'jug''; Sanskrit: ''yuganaddha''),<ref>Neville, Robert C. (1987).[http://buddhism.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/neville.htm New metaphysics for eternal experience], Journal of Chinese Philosophy 14, 357-370</ref><ref>http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/zung_'jug</ref> based on the ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra|Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra]]'' (Flower Garland sutra), a Mah\u0101y\u0101na scripture. Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: ''[[dharmas]]'') are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomena contains every other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as [[Indra's net]]. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.\n\n[[Fazang]] (Fa-tsang, 643\u2013712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote 'Essay on the Golden Lion' and 'Treatise on the Five Teachings', which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a [[House of mirrors]]. Fazang introduced the distinction of \"the Realm of Principle\" and \"the Realm of Things\". This theory was further developed by [[Chengguan (monk)|Cheng-guan]] (738\u2013839) into the major Huayan thesis of \"the fourfold [[Dharmadhatu]]\" (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion, the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion.<ref name=\"Taigen Dan Leighton 2006\">Taigen Dan Leighton, Huayan Buddhism and the Phenomenal Universe of the Flower Ornament Sutra, \"Buddhadharma\" magazine (2006)</ref> \n \nWhile both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to [[idealism]]. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician\u2019s conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that \"The triple world is illusory \u2013 it is only made by one mind\" and Fazang echoes this by writing \"outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world \"according to their mental patterns\", and \"these worlds are infinite in kind\" and constantly arising and passing away.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> However, in Huayan, mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or \"Principle\" is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn [[Korea]], this school was known as [[Hwaeom]] and is represented in the work of [[Wonhyo]] (617\u2013686), who also wrote about the idea of [[Essence-Function|essence-function]], a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In [[Japan]], Huayan is known as [[Kegon]] and one of its major proponents was [[My\u014de]], who also introduced Tantric practices.\n\n===Chan and Japanese Buddhism===\n\nThe philosophy of Chinese [[Chan Buddhism]] and Japanese [[Zen]] is based on various sources, these include Madhyamaka, Yogacara, the [[La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra]], Huayan and the Buddha nature texts. An important issue in Chan is that of [[subitism]] or \"sudden enlightenment\", the idea that enlightenment happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by [[Shenhui]] and is a central issue discussed in the  [[Platform Sutra]], a key Chan scripture composed in China.\n\nHuayan philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the [[Five Ranks]] of [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (806-869), the founder of the [[Caodong]] Chan lineage.<ref name=\"Taigen Dan Leighton 2006\"/> [[Guifeng Zongmi]], who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra. \n\n[[Buddhism in Japan|Japanese Buddhism]] during the 6th and 7th centuries saw an increase in the proliferation of new schools and forms of thought, a period known as the six schools of Nara (''[[Nanto Rokush\u016b]]''). The [[Kamakura period|Kamakura Period]] (1185\u20131333) also saw another flurry of intellectual activity. During this period, the influential figure of [[Nichiren]] (1222\u20131282) made the practice and universal message of the [[Lotus Sutra]] more readily available to the population. He is of particular importance in the history of thought and religion as his teachings constitute a separate sect of Buddhism, one of the only major sects to have originated in Japan <ref name=\"Yampolsky1990\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/21035153|title=Selected writings of Nichiren|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=Yampolsky, Philip B.

In Korea, [[Chinul]] was an important exponent of Seon Buddhism at around the same time.\n\n===Esoteric Buddhism===\n\n[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|228px|The ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]]. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]\n[[Tantric Buddhism]] arrived in China in the 7th century, during the [[Tang Dynasty]]. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as M\u00ecz\u014dng (\u5bc6\u5b97), or \"Esoteric School\"  and ''Zhenyan'' (true word, Sanskrit: [[Mantrayana]]). [[K\u016bkai]]  (AD774\u2013835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric [[Shingon]] (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under [[Huiguo]], K\u016bkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.\n\nK\u016bkai's philosophy is based on the [[Mahavairocana Tantra]] and the [[Vajrasekhara Sutra]] (both from the seventh century). His ''Benkenmitsu nikky\u00f4ron'' (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream [[Mahayana Buddhism]] (kengy\u00f4) and esoteric [[Tantric Buddhism]] (mikky\u00f4).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Krummel, John, \"K\u00fbkai\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/kukai/>.</ref> K\u016bkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bringing the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of K\u016bkai's thought is the [[Trikaya]] doctrine, which holds there are three \"bodies of the Buddha\".\n\nAccording to K\u016bkai, esoteric Buddhism has the [[Dharmakaya]] (Jpn: ''hosshin'', embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with [[Vairocana]] Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as [[mudras]] and [[mantras]]. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirmankaya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For K\u016bkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is ''hosshin sepp\u00f4'' (literally: \u201cthe dharmak\u00e2ya's expounding of the Dharma\u201d) which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In a broad sense, the universe itself a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be \"read\".\n\nDainichi means \"Great Sun\" and K\u016bkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to enlightenment ([[hongaku]]) and [[Buddha nature]], and that because of this, there is the possibility of \"becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence\" (''sokushinj\u00f4butsu'').<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> This is achieved because of the [[non-dual]] relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.\n\nK\u016bkai's exposition of what has been called Shingon's \"metaphysics\", is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin - body, appearance and function.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty ([[Shunyata]]) The physical universe for Shingon, contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such the [[Womb Realm]] mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence reach enlightenment here and now.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Modern philosophy ==\n{{main article|Buddhist modernism}}\n[[File:Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala (1864-1933).jpg|upright|thumb|170px|Anagarika Dharmapala]]\n[[File:Gendun Chophel.gif|thumb|170px|A portrait of Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6phel in India, 1936.]]\n[[File:Kitaro Nishidain in Feb. 1943.jpg|thumb|170px|Kitar\u014d Nishida, professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the [[Kyoto School]].]]\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], Buddhist modernists such as [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] (1864-1933) and the American convert [[Henry Steel Olcott]] sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution.<ref>McMahan, David L. 2008.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 75.</ref> Like Taixu, [[Yin Shun]] (1906\u20132005) advocated a form of [[Humanistic Buddhism]] grounded in concern for humanitarian issues and his students and followers have been influential in promoting [[Humanistic Buddhism]] in [[Taiwan]]. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi ([[Yogachara]]), by [[Yang Rensan]] (1837-1911), [[Ouyang Jinwu]] (1871-1943) and [[Liang Shuming]] (1893\u20131988).<ref>Yih-Hsien Yu, Modern Chinese Philosophy, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</ref>\n\nOne of Tibetan Buddhism's most influential modernist thinkers is [[Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6phel]]  (1903\u20131951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr. \u201cwas arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.\u201d<ref>Holmgren, Felix [reviewer], \"The Madman\u2019s Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6pel by Donald S. Lopez Jr.\", https://www.lionsroar.com/a-modern-man-in-old-tibet/</ref> Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6phel traveled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as ''Adornment for Nagarjuna\u2019s Thought''. Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was [[Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa]], whose [[Shambhala Training]] was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of \"secular enlightenment\".<ref>Trungpa, Chogyam. (1984) \"Shambhala: Sacred Path of the Warrior\", pp 25-34</ref>\n\nIn [[Southeast Asia]], thinkers such as [[Buddhadasa]], [[Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh]], [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] have promoted a philosophy of socially [[Engaged Buddhism]] and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to economic ethics ([[Buddhist economics]]) have been explored in the works of [[E. F. Schumacher]],<ref>E. F. Schumacher, \"Buddhist economics\" (1973)</ref> [[Prayudh Payutto]], [[Neville Karunatilake]] and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in [[Myanmar]], where it was developed by monks such as [[Ledi Sayadaw]] and [[Mahasi Sayadaw]].\n\nJapanese Buddhist philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the [[Kyoto School]] which included [[Kitaro Nishida]], [[Keiji Nishitani]], [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Masao Abe]]. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is [[Critical Buddhism]], which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as [[Buddha nature]] and [[Hongaku|original enlightenment]].<ref name=Bingenheimer /> In [[Nichiren Buddhism]], the work of [[Daisaku Ikeda]] has also been popular.\n\nThe Japanese Zen Buddhist [[D.T. Suzuki]] (1870\u20131966) was instrumental in bringing [[Zen Buddhism]] to the West and his [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]] works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki's worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by [[Romanticism]] and [[Transcendentalism]], which promoted a spiritual freedom as \"a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention.\"<ref>McMahan, David L. 2008. The Making of Buddhist Modernism. Oxford: Oxford University Press. page 122</ref> This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is [[Gary Snyder]]. The American Theravada Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] has critiqued 'Buddhist Romanticism' in his writings.\n\nWestern Buddhist monastics and priests such as [[Nanavira Thera]], [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], [[Nyanaponika Thera]], [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], [[Taigen Dan Leighton]], [[Matthieu Ricard]] have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as [[Alan Wallace]], [[James H. Austin]], [[Mark Epstein]] and the [[14th Dalai Lama]] have worked and written on this issue.<ref>Austin, James H. Zen and the Brain</ref><ref>14th Dalai Lama, the Universe in a single atom</ref> Another area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of [[Joanna Macy]]. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to [[Secular Buddhism|secularize Buddhism]], as seen in the works of [[Stephen Batchelor (author)|Stephen Batchelor]].\n\nIn the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of [[Charles A. Moore]] who founded the journal [[Philosophy East and West]]. Contemporary Western Academics such as [[Mark Siderits]], [[Jan Westerhoff]], [[Jonardon Ganeri]], [[Miri Albahari]], [[Owen Flanagan]], [[Damien Keown]], [[Tom Tillemans]], [[David Loy]], [[Evan Thompson]] and [[Jay Garfield]] have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through [[Western philosophy]].\n\n== Comparison with other philosophies ==\n{{main article|Buddhism and Western Philosophy}}\n[[Baruch Spinoza]], though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered \"by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.\" The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is [[Nirvana]]. [[David Hume]], after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's [[Bundle theory]] is a very similar concept to the Buddhist ''[[skandhas]]'', though his skepticism about causation lead him to opposite conclusions in other areas. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of [[asceticism]] and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire.\n\n[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s \"[[language-game]]\" closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or [[papa\u00f1ca]] is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist ''[[Parable of the Poison Arrow]]''. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. [[Heidegger]]'s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some{{who|date=April 2012}} to be similar to Buddhism today.<ref>[http://www.westernbuddhistreview.com/vol1/god_is_dead.html God Is Dead: What Next<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAn alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the [[Middle Way]] in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all philosophies are considered non-essential views ([[View (Buddhism)|ditthis]]) and not to be clung to.<ref>[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity''(Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Buddhism and science]]\n* [[Buddhist ethics]]\n* [[Buddhist logic]]\n* [[Critical Buddhism]]\n* [[God in Buddhism]]\n* [[List of Buddhist terms and concepts]]\n* [[List of Buddhist topics]]\n* [[List of sutras]]\n* [[Madhyamaka]]\n* [[Mindstream]]\n* [[Reality in Buddhism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Anderson |first=Carol |year=1999 |title=Pain and Its Ending: The Four Noble Truths in the Theravada Buddhist Canon |publisher=Routledge}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bronkhorst |first=Johannes |authorlink=Johannes Bronkhorst |year=1993 |title=The Two Traditions Of Meditation In Ancient India |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.}}\n* {{Citation|last=Capriles |first=El\u00edas |title=The Four Schools of Buddhist Philosophy: Clear Discrimination of Views Pointing at the Definitive Meaning |url=http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/uploads/Biblioteca/philosophical_schools.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717191150/http://webdelprofesor.ula.ve/humanidades/elicap/en/uploads/Biblioteca/philosophical_schools.pdf |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}\n* {{Citation |last=Cousins |first=L.

The writing staff was assembled by the series' head writer, [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], who is known for his work on ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' and ''[[Hellsing]]''.\n\nThe story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top [[Negotiation|Negotiator]]. He provides this \"much needed service\" with the help of a [[robot]] named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his [[butler]] Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city's past.\n\nThe television series is designed as a tribute to Japanese and [[western world|Western]] shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is done in the style of ''[[film noir]]'' and combines the feel of a [[detective fiction|detective show]] with the [[mecha anime|mecha genre]] of anime. The [[setpiece]]s are reminiscent of [[tokusatsu]] productions of the 1950s and 1960s, particularly [[Toho]]'s [[kaiju]] movies, and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.\n\n''The Big O'' premiered  October 13, 1999 on [[WOWOW]] satellite television. It finished its run on January 19, 2000. The English-language version premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on April 2, 2001 and ended on April 18, 2001. Originally planned as a 26-episode series, low viewership in Japan reduced production to the first 13. Positive international reception resulted in a second season consisting of the remaining 13 episodes; co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and [[Bandai Visual]]. Season two premiered on Japan's [[Sun Television|SUN-TV]] on January 2, 2003, and the American [[premiere]] took place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company [[Bandai]] (owned by [[Bandai Namco Holdings]]) in 2012, [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] announced at [[Otakon]] 2013 that [[Sentai Filmworks]] rescued both seasons of ''The Big O''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sentai Filmworks Adds Sacred Seven, The Big O, Kurokami, More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/sentai-filmworks-adds-sacred-seven-big-o-kurokami-more|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=11 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Setting and plot ==\n{{Main|List of The Big O characters}}\n\n[[File:Paradigm City.JPG|thumb|left|240px|An [[aerial shot]] of Paradigm City.

[[Android (robot)|Androids]] coexist with the human inhabitants of Paradigm City; while they are rare, they are sufficiently numerous that denizens of the city do not consider them unusual.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WiLuAAAAMAAJ |title=Television cartoon shows: an illustrated encyclopedia |volume=1 |author=Hal Erickson |publisher=McFarland & Co. |isbn=978-0-7864-2255-5 |date=July 2005 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nSeveral episodes show inhabitants of Paradigm City practicing some form of [[Christianity]]: people congregate in meeting places with crucifixes prominently displayed. The practice appears to be based on custom, because no one clearly remembers any doctrine associated with the practice. A ruined cathedral remains unused, although some elderly people occasionally stand in front of it and sing incompletely remembered hymns. In episode 11, it appears that only [[List of The Big O characters#Alex Rosewater|Alex Rosewater]], [[CEO]] of the Paradigm Corporation that runs the city, remembers or observes [[Christmas]]. A holiday commemorating the founding of Paradigm City, \"Heaven's Day\", is observed on December 25. Though citizens decorate with generic Christmas decorations, they are ignorant of their original meaning. Dastun mentions that Rosewater had in his possession fragments of a \"[[Book of Revelation]]\", although neither Dastun nor Roger had heard of it before.\n\nAlthough the textbook definition of [[memory]] is a record stored in the brain of an organism, the citizens of Paradigm City use the term more loosely;<ref>Note the series uses the spelling {{nihongo|\"Memory\"|\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc|Memor\u012b}} instead of {{nihongo|\"memory\"|\u8a18\u61b6|kioku}}.</ref> {{nihongo|\"Memories\"|\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30fc|Memor\u012b}} can refer to forgotten knowledge, records or artifacts from before The Event, or partial forms of recollection including [[hallucination]]s and [[recurring dream]]s.\n\nThe first season is episodic. Each episode (referred to as an \"Act\") relates a separate instance the resurgence of lost \"memories\" and how the citizens cope with their collective amnesia. The final episodes introduce elements that come into play during season two, like the discovery of people living outside of Paradigm City, the true nature of the Event, and something obliquely described as \"the Power of God wielded by the hand of man\".\n\nWhile the majority of the first season's episodes are self-contained stories, the second season comprises a single serialized [[story arc]]. [[Alex Rosewater]] becomes a direct [[antagonist]] to Roger, and a mysterious group known as \"The Union\" is introduced, containing agents of a foreign power working within the City.\n\nThe series ends with the awakening of a new [[megadeus]], and the revelation that the world is a [[simulated reality]]. A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau, after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus, an incarnation of Angel, recognised as \"Big Venus\" by Dorothy. Roger implores Angel to \"let go of the past\" regardless of its existential reality, and focus only on the present and the future. In an isolated control room, the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors. On the control panel lies ''Metropolis'', a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode, with the cover featuring an illustration of angel wings and gives the author's name as \"Angel Rosewater\". Big Venus and Big O physically merge, causing the virtual reality to reset. A white flash subsides, and the first scenes of the first episode of the series play out. New versions of Dorothy and Angel watch Roger drive down the street as he delivers again his first speech of the series (\"My name is Roger Smith. I perform a much needed job here in the City of Amnesia\"), although he is a little hesitant this time. The ending title card, \"We have come to terms,\" appears, and the credits roll.\n\n== Production and release ==\n{{See also|List of The Big O episodes}}\n\nDevelopment of the [[retro]]-styled series began in 1996. [[Keiichi Sato]] came up with the concept of ''The Big O'': a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a [[Gotham City|Gotham]]-like environment. He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing ''[[Those Who Hunt Elves]]'', and started work on the layouts and character designs.

The series, including its second season is also featured in ''[[Super Robot Wars Z]]'', released in 2008. ''The Big O'' became a mainstay of the \"Z\" games, appearing in each entry of the subseries.\n\n===Toys and model kits===\n[[Bandai]] released a non-scale model kit of Big O in 2000. Though it was an easy snap-together kit, it required painting, as all of the parts (except the clear orange crown and canopy) were molded in dark gray. The kit included springs that enabled the slide-action Side Piles on the forearms to simulate Big O's Sudden Impact maneuver. Also included was an unpainted Roger Smith figure.\n\n[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] figures of Big O and Big Duo (Schwarzwald's Megadeus) were sold by Bandai America. Each came with non-poseable figures of Roger, Dorothy and Angel. Mini-figure sets were sold in Japan and America during the run of the second season. The characters included Big O (standard and attack modes), Roger, Dorothy & Norman, Griffon (Roger's car), Dorothy-1 (Big O's first opponent), Schwarzwald and Big Duo.\n\nIn 2009, Bandai released a plastic/diecast figure of the Big O under their [[Soul of Chogokin]] line. The figure has the same features as the model kit, but with added detail and accessories. Its design was closely supervised by original designer Keiichi Sato.<ref>[http://www.hlj.com/product/BAN956922 HobbyLink Japan - Soul of Chogokin The Big O]</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Max Factory released action figures of Roger and Dorothy through their [[Figma]] toyline. Like most Figmas, they are very detailed, articulated and come with accessories and interchangeable faces. In the same year, Max Factory also released a 12-inch, diecast figure of Big O under their Max Gokin line. The figure contained most of the accessories as the Soul of Chogokin figure but also included some others that could be bought separately from the SOC figure, such as the Mobydick (hip) Anchors and Roger Smith's car: the Griffon. Like the Soul of Chogokin figure, its design was also supervised by Keiichi Sato. As well, in that same year, Max Factory released soft vinyl figures of Big Duo and Big Fau, in-scale with the Max Gokin Big O. These figures are high in detail but limited in articulation, such as the arms and legs being the only things to move. To date, this is the only action figure of Big Fau.\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Big O'' premiered on 13 October 1999. The show was not a hit in its native Japan, rather it was reduced from an outlined 26 episodes to 13 episodes. Western audiences were more receptive and the series achieved the success its creators were looking for.<ref name=\"konaka\"/><ref name=\"verdict-II-1\"/> In an interview with [[AnimePlay]], Keiichi Sato said \"This is exactly as we had planned\", referring to the success overseas.<ref name = \"AnimePlay\">{{cite journal |last= Shimura |first= Shinichi |title= Anime rebel with a cause: ''The Big O'''s Keiichi Sato | journal= [[AnimePlay]] | volume = 5 | year = 2004  | pages = 22\u201326 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral words appear constantly in the English-language reviews; adjectives like \"hip\",<ref name = \"vision\"/> \"sleek,\"<ref name=\"verdict-II-2\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bigo2missingpiecesvol2.php | date = 2004-09-30 | accessdate = 2006-11-04 | title = ''The Big O II'': Missing Pieces (Volume 2) Review | last = Byun | first = Bryan | publisher = DVD Verdict | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061207182843/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bigo2missingpiecesvol2.php | archivedate = 2006-12-07 | df =  }}</ref> \"stylish\",\n<ref name=\"meta\">{{cite web |url = http://amr.nextstudio.net/html/big_o.html |accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = ''Big O'' Review |last = Shelton |first = Andrew |publisher = Anime Meta-Review |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821123458/http://amr.nextstudio.net/html/big_o.html |archivedate = 2006-08-21 |df =  }}</ref> \"classy\",<ref name = \"theEX\"/> and, above all, \"cool\"<ref name=\"verdict-II-1\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bigo2paradigmlost.php | date = 2004-03-05 | accessdate = 2006-11-04 | title = ''The Big O II'': Paradigm Lost (Volume 1) Review | last = Arseneau | first = Adam | publisher = DVD Verdict | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070408200254/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bigo2paradigmlost.php | archivedate = 2007-04-08 | df =  }}</ref><ref name=\"meta\"/><ref name=\"ANN-dvd1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/the-big-o/dvd-1 |accessdate = 2006-11-04 |title = ''Big O'' Review | last = Shepard | first = Chris | publisher = [[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> serve to describe the artwork, the concept, and the series itself.

The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the [[CP/M]] operating system in 1975.<ref name=\"Kildall_1975_BDOS\" /><ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\" /> Originally [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been [[reverse engineer]]ed by companies looking to create compatible systems. The [[Interface (computing)|interface]] of that original system serves as a ''[[De facto standard|de facto]]'' standard.\n\nThe BIOS in modern PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components, and loads a [[boot loader]] from a mass memory device which then initializes an [[operating system]]. In the era of [[MS-DOS]], the BIOS provided a [[hardware abstraction layer]] for the keyboard, display, and other [[input/output]] (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS after loading, instead accessing the hardware components directly.\n\nMost BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or [[motherboard]] model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system [[chipset]]. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip on the PC motherboard. In modern computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on [[flash memory]] so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard.  This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS [[rootkit]]s. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails can [[brick (electronics)|brick]] the motherboard permanently, unless the system includes some form of backup for this case.  \n\n[[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) is a successor to BIOS, aiming to address its technical shortcomings.<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{rquote|right|\n<pre>/* C P / M   B A S I C   I / O    S Y S T E M    (B I O S)\n                    COPYRIGHT (C) GARY A.

Together with the underlying hardware-specific but operating system-independent \"System BIOS\", which resides in [[Read-only memory|ROM]], it represents the analogue to the \"[[CP/M BIOS]]\".\n\nWith the introduction of PS/2 machines, IBM divided the System BIOS into real- and protected-mode portions. The real-mode portion was meant to provide backward compatibility with existing operating systems such as DOS, and therefore was named \"CBIOS\" (for \"Compatibility BIOS\"), whereas the \"ABIOS\" (for \"Advanced BIOS\") provided new interfaces specifically suited for multitasking operating systems such as [[OS/2]].\n\n== {{Anchor|BCU}}User interface ==\n{{rquote|right|\nStarting:-The first commercial licensing of [[CP/M]] took place in 1975 with contracts between [[Digital Systems (Seattle)|Digital Systems]]<!-- a company by [[John Torode (physicist)|John Torode]] --> and [[Omron of America]] for use in their intelligent terminal, and with [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratories]] where CP/M was used to monitor programs in the [[Octopus (network)|Octopus network]]. Little attention was paid to CP/M for about a year. In my spare time, I worked to improve overall facilities&nbsp;... By this time, CP/M had been adapted for four different controllers.&nbsp;... In 1976, Glenn Ewing approached me with a problem: [[IMSAI|Imsai]], Incorporated, for whom Glenn consulted, had shipped a large number of disk subsystems with a promise that an operating system would follow. I was somewhat reluctant to adapt CP/M to yet another controller, and thus the notion of a separated Basic I/O System (BIOS) evolved. In principle, the hardware dependent portions of CP/M were concentrated in the BIOS, thus allowing Glenn, or anyone else, to adapt CP/M to the Imsai equipment. Imsai was subsequently licensed to distribute [[CP/M 1.3|CP/M version 1.3]] which eventually evolved into an operating system called [[IMDOS]].\n| Gary Kildall<ref name=\"Kildall_1980_CPM\"/>\n}}\n\nThe BIOS of the original [[IBM PC XT]] had no interactive user interface. Error codes or messages were displayed on the screen, or coded series of sounds were generated to signal errors when the [[power-on self-test]] (POST) had not proceeded to the point of successfully initializing a video display adapter. Options on the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]] and XT were set by switches and jumpers on the main board and on [[peripheral card|expansion card]]s. Starting around the mid-1990s, it became typical for the BIOS ROM to include a ''\"BIOS configuration utility\"'' (BCU<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://ftp.hp.com/pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/HP_BCU.html\n |title       = HP BIOS Configuration Utility\n |year        = 2013\n |accessdate  = 2015-01-12\n |publisher   = [[Hewlett-Packard]]\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150112201124/http://ftp.hp.com/pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/HP_BCU.html\n |archivedate = 2015-01-12\n |df          = \n}}</ref>) or \"BIOS setup utility\", accessed at system power-up by a particular key sequence.  This program allowed the user to set system configuration options, of the type formerly set using [[DIP switch]]es, through an interactive menu system controlled through the keyboard.  In the interim period, IBM-compatible PCs{{mdashb}}including the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]]{{mdashb}}held configuration settings in battery-backed RAM and used a bootable configuration program on disk, not in the ROM, to set the configuration options contained in this memory.  The disk was supplied with the computer, and if it was lost the system settings could not be changed.  The same applied in general to computers with an [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] bus, for which the configuration program was called an EISA Configuration Utility (ECU).\n\nA modern [[Wintel]]-compatible computer provides a setup routine essentially unchanged in nature from the ROM-resident BIOS setup utilities of the late 1990s; the user can configure hardware options using the keyboard and video display.  Also, when errors occur at boot time, a modern BIOS usually displays user-friendly error messages, often presented as pop-up boxes in a [[Text-based user interface|TUI]] style, and offers to enter the BIOS setup utility or to ignore the error and proceed if possible.  Instead of battery-backed RAM, the modern Wintel machine may store the BIOS configuration settings in flash ROM, perhaps the same flash ROM that holds the BIOS itself.\n\n== Operation ==\n{{rquote|right|\nWhen [[IMSAI|we]] failed to produce an operating system in a timely manner, Glenn started talking with [[Gary Kildall|Gary]] about [[CP/M|CPM]]&nbsp;... It took several months of twisting Gary's arm to get Gary to port it to the 8080. The final success came when Glenn talked Gary into just separating the I/O from the rest of it, with Glenn promising to re-write the I/O module for the [[IMSAI 8080]] (which he did).

When a modern [[x86 microprocessor]] is reset, it starts in pseudo [[16-bit]] [[real mode]], initializing most registers to zero. The code segment register is initialized with selector F000h, base FFFF0000h, and limit FFFFh, so that execution starts at 4&nbsp;GB minus 16 bytes (FFFFFFF0h).<ref>See [http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126002939/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html |date=2012-01-26 }}, volume 3, section 9.1.2</ref> The platform logic maps this address into the system ROM, mirroring address 000FFFF0h.\n\nIf the system has just been powered up or the reset button was pressed (\"cold boot\"), the full [[power-on self-test]] (POST) is run. If Ctrl+Alt+Delete was pressed (\"warm boot\"), a special flag value is stored in [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] (\"[[CMOS]]\") before the processor is reset, and after the reset the BIOS startup code detects this flag and does not run the POST. This saves the time otherwise used to detect and test all memory.\n\nThe POST checks, identifies, and initializes system devices such as the [[central processing unit|CPU]], [[random-access memory|RAM]], [[programmable interrupt controller|interrupt]] and [[DMA controller]]s and other parts of the [[chipset]], [[video display card]], [[computer keyboard|keyboard]], [[hard disk drive]], [[optical disc drive]] and other basic [[computer hardware|hardware]].\n\nEarly IBM PCs had a little-known routine in the POST that would attempt to download a maintenance program into RAM through the keyboard port before performing any other elements of the boot process, such as before scanning for option ROMs or executing a boot loader. (No [[serial port|serial]] or [[parallel port]]s were standard on early IBM PCs, but a keyboard port of either the XT or AT / PS/2 type has been standard on practically every PC and clone.) If the download was apparently successful, the BIOS would verify a checksum on it and then run it.<ref name=\"technical-ref-5-27\"/><ref>{{cite web | title = IBM 5162 PC XT286 TechRef 68X2537 Technical Reference manual | date = August 1986 | page = 35 (System BIOS A-5) | url = http://www.reenigne.org/crtc/PC-XT.pdf | accessdate = 2014-12-11 | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211141709/http://www.reenigne.org/crtc/PC-XT.pdf | archivedate = 2014-12-11 | df =  }}</ref> This feature was intended for factory test or diagnostic purposes; while it was of limited utility outside of factory or repair facilities, it could be used in a proprietary way to boot the PC as a satellite system to a host machine (as it was used in the manufacturing environment{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}).\n\n=== Boot process ===\nAfter the option ROM scan is completed and all detected ROM modules with valid checksums have been called, or immediately after POST in a BIOS version that does not scan for option ROMs, the BIOS calls INT 19h to start boot processing. Post-boot, programs loaded can also call INT 19h to reboot the system, but they must be careful to disable interrupts and other asynchronous hardware processes that may interfere with the BIOS rebooting process, or else the system may hang or crash while it is rebooting.\n\nWhen INT 19h is called, the BIOS attempts to locate [[boot loader]] software held on a storage device designated as a \"boot device\", such as a [[hard disk]], a [[floppy disk]], [[CD]], or [[DVD]]. It loads and executes the first boot software it finds, giving it control of the PC.<ref name=\"hsw1\"/> This is the process that is known as ''[[booting]]'' (sometimes informally called \"booting up\"), which is short for \"bootstrapping\".\n\nThe BIOS selects candidate boot devices using information collected by POST and configuration information from [[EEPROM]], CMOS RAM or, in the earliest PCs, [[DIP switch]]es. Following the boot priority sequence in effect, BIOS checks each device in order to see if it is bootable. For a disk drive or a device that logically emulates a disk drive, such as a [[USB flash drive]] or perhaps a tape drive, to perform this check the BIOS attempts to load the first sector ([[boot sector]]) from the disk into RAM at memory address <code>0x0000:0x7C00</code>. If the sector cannot be read (due to a missing or unformatted disk, or due to a hardware failure), the BIOS considers the device unbootable and proceeds to check the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Magic_AA55\"/><!-- Not all BIOSes do this at all, and some do it only for floppies. Also, some BIOSes disallow higher speed access modes, if reading this or certain other signatures failed. -->\n\nThe BIOS proceeds to test each device sequentially until a bootable device is found, at which time the BIOS transfers control to the loaded sector with a jump instruction to its first byte at address <code>0x0000:0x7C00</code> (exactly 1&nbsp;KiB below the 32&nbsp;KiB mark); see [[MBR invocation]] and [[VBR invocation]]. (This location is one reason that an IBM PC requires at least 32&nbsp;KiB of RAM in order to be equipped with a disk system; with 31 KiB or less, it would be impossible to boot from any disk, removable or fixed, using the BIOS boot protocol.) Most, but not all, BIOSes load the drive number (as used by INT 13h) of the boot drive into CPU register DL before jumping to the first byte of the loaded boot sector.\n\nNote well that the BIOS does not interpret or process the contents of the boot sector other than to possibly check for the boot sector signature in the last two bytes; all interpretation of data structures like MBR partition tables and so-called BIOS Parameter Blocks is done by the boot program in the boot sector itself or by other programs loaded through the boot process and is beyond the scope of BIOS. Nothing about BIOS predicates these data structures or impedes their replacement or improvement.\n\nA non-disk device such as a [[network adapter]] attempts booting by a procedure that is defined by its [[option ROM]] or the equivalent integrated into the motherboard BIOS ROM. As such, option ROMs may also influence or supplant the boot process defined by the motherboard BIOS ROM.\n\n==== Boot priority ====\nThe user can control the boot process, to cause one medium to be booted instead of another when two or more bootable media are present, by taking advantage of the boot priority implemented by the BIOS. For example, most computers have a hard disk that is bootable, but usually there is a removable-media drive that has higher boot priority, so the user can cause a removable disk to be booted, simply by inserting it, without removing the hard disk drive or altering its contents to make it unbootable.\n\nIn most modern BIOSes, the boot priority order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured by the user through the BIOS configuration utility. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, even if there were two drives of either type installed. All more advanced boot priority sequences evolved as incremental improvements on this basic system.\n\nHistorically the BIOS would try to boot from a floppy drive first and a hard disk second. The default for CD or DVD booting is an extension of this. With the [[El Torito (CD-ROM standard)|El Torito optical media boot standard]], the optical drive actually emulates a 3.5\" high-density floppy disk to the BIOS for boot purposes. Optical disks are a special case, because their lowest level of data organization is typically a fairly high-level file system (e.g. [[ISO 9660]] for CD-ROM).\n\nReading the \"first sector\" of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is not a simply defined operation like it is on a floppy disk or a hard disk. Furthermore, the complexity of the medium makes it difficult to write a useful boot program in one sector, even though optical media sectors are typically 2048 bytes each, four times the standard 512-byte size of floppy and legacy hard disk sectors. Therefore, optical media booting uses the El Torito standard, which specifies a way for an optical disk to contain an image of a high-density (1.44&nbsp;MB) floppy disk and for the drive to provide access to this disk image in a simple manner that emulates floppy disk drive operations. Therefore, CD-ROM drives boot as emulated floppy disk drives; the bootable virtual floppy disk can contain software that provides access to the optical medium in its native format.\n\n==== Boot failure ====\nThe behavior if the BIOS does not find a bootable device has varied as [[personal computer]]s developed. The original [[IBM PC]] and XT had [[Microsoft]] [[Cassette BASIC]] in ROM, and if no bootable device was found, [[IBM BASIC|ROM BASIC]] was started by calling INT 18h. Therefore, barring a hardware failure, an original IBM PC or XT would never fail to boot, either into [[IBM BASIC|BASIC]] or from disk (or through an option ROM). One model of the original IBM PC was available with no disk drive; a [[cassette recorder]] could be attached via the cassette port on the rear, for loading and saving BASIC programs to tape. Since few programs used BASIC in ROM, clone PC makers left it out; then a computer that failed to boot from a disk would display \"No ROM BASIC\" and halt (in response to INT 18h).\n\nLater computers would display a message like \"No bootable disk found\"; some would prompt for a disk to be inserted and a key to be pressed, and when a key was pressed they would restart the boot process. A modern BIOS may display nothing or may automatically enter the BIOS configuration utility when the boot process fails. Unlike earlier BIOSes, modern versions are often written with the assumption that if the computer cannot be booted from a hard disk, the user will not have software that they want to boot from removable media instead. (Lately, typically it will only be a specialist computer technician who does that, only to get the computer back into a condition where it can be booted from the hard disk.)\n\n=== Boot environment ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe environment for the boot program is very simple: the CPU is in real mode and the general-purpose and segment registers are undefined, except CS, SS, SP, and DL. CS is always zero and IP is initially <code>0x7C00</code>. Because boot programs are always loaded at this fixed address, there is no need or motivation for a boot program to be relocatable. DL contains the drive number, as used with INT 13h, of the boot device, unless the BIOS is one that does not set the drive number in DL{{snd}} and then DL is undefined. SS:SP points to a valid stack that is presumably large enough to support hardware interrupts, but otherwise SS and SP are undefined. (A stack must be already set up in order for interrupts to be serviced, and interrupts must be enabled in order for the system timer-tick interrupt, which BIOS always uses at least to maintain the time-of-day count and which it initializes during POST, to be active and for the keyboard to work. The keyboard works even if the BIOS keyboard service is not called; keystrokes are received and placed in the 15-character type-ahead buffer maintained by BIOS.) The boot program must set up its own stack (or at least MS-DOS 6 acts like it must), because the size of the stack set up by BIOS is unknown and its location is likewise variable; although the boot program can investigate the default stack by examining SS:SP, it is easier and shorter to just unconditionally set up a new stack.\n\nAt boot time, all BIOS services are available, and the memory below address <code>0x00400</code> contains the [[interrupt vector table]]. BIOS POST has initialized the system timers {{angle bracket|}}8253 or 8254 IC), interrupt controller(s), DMA controller(s), and other motherboard/chipset hardware as necessary to bring all BIOS services to ready status. DRAM refresh for all system DRAM in conventional memory and extended memory, but not necessarily expanded memory, has been set up and is running. The [[interrupt vector]]s corresponding to the BIOS interrupts have been set to point at the appropriate entry points in the BIOS, hardware interrupt vectors for devices initialized by the BIOS have been set to point to the BIOS-provided ISRs, and some other interrupts, including ones that BIOS generates for programs to hook, have been set to a default dummy ISR that immediately returns. The BIOS maintains a reserved block of system RAM at addresses <code>0x00400\u20130x004FF</code> with various parameters initialized during the POST. All memory at and above address <code>0x00500</code> can be used by the boot program; it may even overwrite itself.\n\n== Extensions (option ROMs) ==\nPeripheral cards such as some hard disk drive controllers and some video display adapters have their own BIOS extension [[option ROM]]s, which provide additional functionality to BIOS. Code in these extensions runs before the BIOS boots the system from [[mass storage]]. These ROMs typically test and initialize hardware, add new BIOS services, and augment or replace existing BIOS services with their own versions of those services. For example, a [[SCSI controller]] usually has a BIOS extension ROM that adds support for hard drives connected through that controller. Some video cards have extension ROMs that replace the video services of the motherboard BIOS with their own video services. BIOS extension ROMs gain total control of the machine, so they can in fact do anything, and they may never return control to the BIOS that invoked them. An extension ROM could in principle contain an entire operating system or an application program, or it could implement an entirely different boot process such as booting from a network. Operation of an IBM-compatible computer system can be completely changed by removing or inserting an adapter card (or a ROM chip) that contains a BIOS extension ROM.\n\nThe motherboard BIOS typically contains code to access hardware components necessary for bootstrapping the system, such as the keyboard, display, and storage. In addition, plug-in adapter cards such as [[SCSI]], [[RAID]], [[network interface card]]s, and video boards often include their own BIOS (e.g. [[Video BIOS]]), complementing or replacing the system BIOS code for the given component. Even devices built into the motherboard can behave in this way; their option ROMs can be stored as separate code on the main BIOS [[flash chip]], and upgraded either in tandem with, or separately from, the main BIOS.\n\nAn add-in card requires an option ROM if the card is not supported by the main BIOS and the card needs to be initialized or made accessible through BIOS services before the operating system can be loaded (usually this means it is required in the bootstrapping process). Even when it is not required, an option ROM can allow an adapter card to be used without loading driver software from a storage device after booting begins{{snd}} with an option ROM, no time is taken to load the driver, the driver does not take up space in RAM nor on hard disk, and the driver software on the ROM always stays with the device so the two cannot be accidentally separated. Also, if the ROM is on the card, both the peripheral hardware and the driver software provided by the ROM are installed together with no extra effort to install the software. An additional advantage of ROM on some early PC systems (notably including the IBM PCjr) was that ROM was faster than main system RAM. (On modern systems, the case is very much the reverse of this, and BIOS ROM code is usually copied (\"shadowed\") into RAM so it will run faster.)\n\nThere are many methods and utilities for examining the contents of various motherboard BIOS and expansion ROMs, such as Microsoft [[DEBUG (DOS Command)|DEBUG]] or the Unix [[dd (Unix)|dd]].\n\n=== Boot procedure ===\nIf an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots (such as from a network device or a SCSI adapter for which the BIOS has no driver code) in a cooperative way, it can use the ''BIOS Boot Specification'' (BBS) [[application programming interface|API]] to register its ability to do so. Once the expansion ROMs have registered using the BBS APIs, the user can select among the available boot options from within the BIOS's user interface. This is why most BBS compliant PC BIOS implementations will not allow the user to enter the BIOS's user interface until the expansion ROMs have finished executing and registering themselves with the BBS API.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The specification can be downloaded from the ACPICA website. The official title is BIOS Boot Specification (Version 1.01, 11 January 1996).<ref name=\"boot-spec-96\"/>\n\nAlso, if an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots unilaterally, it can simply hook INT 19h or other interrupts normally called from interrupt 19h, such as INT 13h, the BIOS disk service, to intercept the BIOS boot process. Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the boot sequence by inserting its own boot actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Initialization ===\nAfter the motherboard BIOS completes its POST, most BIOS versions search for option ROM modules, also called BIOS extension ROMs, and execute them. The motherboard BIOS scans for extension ROMs in a portion of the \"[[upper memory area]]\" (the part of the x86 real-mode address space at and above address 0xA0000) and runs each ROM found, in order. To discover memory-mapped [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] option ROMs, a BIOS implementation scans the real-mode address space from <code>0x0C0000</code> to <code>0x0F0000</code> on 2&nbsp;[[KiB]] boundaries, looking for a two-byte ROM ''signature'': 0x55 followed by 0xAA. In a valid expansion ROM, this signature is followed by a single byte indicating the number of 512-byte blocks the expansion ROM occupies in real memory, and the next byte is the option ROM's [[entry point]] (also known as its \"entry offset\"). A [[checksum]] of the specified number of 512-byte blocks is calculated, and if the ROM has a valid checksum, the BIOS transfers control to the entry address, which in a normal BIOS extension ROM should be the beginning of the extension's initialization routine.\n\nAt this point, the extension ROM code takes over, typically testing and initializing the hardware it controls and registering [[interrupt vector]]s for use by post-boot applications. It may use BIOS services (including those provided by previously initialized option ROMs) to provide a user configuration interface, to display diagnostic information, or to do anything else that it requires. While the actions mentioned are typical behaviors of BIOS extension ROMs, each option ROM receives total control of the computer and may do anything at all, as noted with more detail in the Extensions section below; it is possible that an option ROM will not return to BIOS, pre-empting the BIOS's boot sequence altogether.\n\nAn option ROM should normally return to the BIOS after completing its initialization process. Once (and if) an option ROM returns, the BIOS continues searching for more option ROMs, calling each as it is found, until the entire option ROM area in the memory space has been scanned.\n\n=== Physical placement ===\nOption ROMs normally reside on adapter cards. However, the original PC, and perhaps also the PC XT, have a spare ROM socket on the motherboard (the \"system board\" in IBM's terms) into which an option ROM can be inserted, and the four ROMs that contain the BASIC interpreter can also be removed and replaced with custom ROMs which can be option ROMs. The [[IBM PCjr]] is unique among PCs in having two ROM cartridge slots on the front. Cartridges in these slots map into the same region of the upper memory area used for option ROMs, and the cartridges can contain option ROM modules that the BIOS would recognize. The cartridges can also contain other types of ROM modules, such as BASIC programs, that are handled differently. One PCjr cartridge can contain several ROM modules of different types, possibly stored together in one ROM chip.\n\n== Operating system services ==\nThe BIOS ROM is customized to the particular manufacturer's hardware, allowing low-level services (such as reading a keystroke or writing a sector of data to diskette) to be provided in a standardized way to programs, including operating systems. For example, an IBM PC might have either a monochrome or a color display adapter (using different display memory addresses and hardware), but a single, standard, BIOS system call may be invoked to display a character at a specified position on the screen in [[text mode]] or [[All points addressable|graphics mode]].\n\nThe BIOS provides a small [[library (computing)|library]] of basic input/output functions to operate peripherals (such as the keyboard, rudimentary text and graphics display functions and so forth). When using MS-DOS, BIOS services could be accessed by an application program (or by MS-DOS) by executing an [[INT 13h]] interrupt instruction to access disk functions, or by executing one of a number of other documented [[BIOS interrupt call]]s to access video display, keyboard, cassette, and other device functions.\n\n[[Operating system]]s and executive software that are designed to supersede this basic firmware functionality provide replacement software interfaces to application software. Applications can also provide these services to themselves. This began even in the 1980s under MS-DOS, when programmers observed that using the BIOS video services for graphics display was very slow. To increase the speed of screen output, many programs bypassed the BIOS and programmed the video display hardware directly. Other graphics programmers, particularly but not exclusively in the [[demoscene]], observed that there were technical capabilities of the PC display adapters that were not supported by the IBM BIOS and could not be taken advantage of without circumventing it. Since the AT-compatible BIOS ran in Intel [[real mode]], operating systems that ran in protected mode on 286 and later processors required hardware device drivers compatible with protected mode operation to replace BIOS services.\n\nIn modern personal computers running modern operating systems the BIOS is used only during booting and initial loading of system software. Before the operating system's first graphical screen is displayed, input and output are typically handled through BIOS. A boot menu such as the textual menu of Windows, which allows users to choose an operating system to boot, to boot into the safe mode, or to use the last known good configuration, is displayed through BIOS and receives keyboard input through BIOS.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nMost modern PCs can still boot and run legacy operating systems such as MS-DOS or DR-DOS that rely heavily on BIOS for their console and disk I/O, providing that the system has a BIOS or BIOS-compatible firmware, which is not necessarily the case with UEFI-based PCs.\n\n=== Processor microcode updates ===\n[[Intel]] processors have reprogrammable [[microcode]] since the [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6]] microarchitecture.<ref name=\"Mueller-1\"/><ref name=\"microcode-09\"/> The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up.  Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required;<ref name=\"Mueller-2\"/> for example, the [[Pentium FDIV bug]] became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a [[product recall]] because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.\n\n=== {{Anchor|SLIC}}Identification ===\nSome BIOSes contain a software licensing description table (SLIC), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), for example [[Dell]]. The SLIC is inserted into the ACPI table and contains no active code.<ref name=\"guytechie-2010225\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.guytechie.com/articles/2010/2/25/how-slp-and-slic-works.html\n |title       = How SLP and SLIC Works\n |date        = 2010-02-25\n |accessdate  = 2015-02-03\n |website     = guytechie.com\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150203135933/http://www.guytechie.com/articles/2010/2/25/how-slp-and-slic-works.html\n |archivedate = 2015-02-03\n |df          = \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.congatec.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Application_Notes/AN21_Add_OEM_ACPI_SLIC_Table.pdf\n |title       = Create and add an OEM ACPI SLIC table module to a congatec BIOS\n |date        = 2011-06-16\n |accessdate  = 2015-02-03\n |website     = congatec.com\n |format      = PDF\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140802014113/http://www.congatec.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Documents/Application_Notes/AN21_Add_OEM_ACPI_SLIC_Table.pdf\n |archivedate = 2014-08-02\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nComputer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and system [[recovery disc]] containing Windows software. Systems with an SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see [[System Locked Preinstallation]], SLP). If a user performs a fresh install of Windows, they will need to have possession of both the OEM key (either SLP or COA) and the digital certificate for their SLIC in order to bypass activation.<ref name=\"guytechie-2010225\" /> This can be achieved if the user performs a restore using a pre-customised image provided by the OEM. Power users can copy the necessary certificate files from the OEM image, decode the SLP product key, then perform SLP activation manually. Cracks for non-genuine Windows distributions usually edit the SLIC or emulate it in order to bypass Windows activation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n=== Overclocking ===\nSome BIOS implementations allow [[overclocking]], an action in which the [[central processing unit|CPU]] is adjusted to a higher [[clock rate]] than its manufacturer rating for guaranteed capability. Overclocking may, however, seriously compromise system reliability in insufficiently cooled computers and generally shorten component lifespan. Overclocking, when incorrectly performed, may also cause components to overheat so quickly that they mechanically destroy themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-introduction-to-overclocking-your-intel-pr-5580998|title=A Beginner's Introduction to Overclocking Your Intel Processor|author=Whitson Gordon|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Lifehacker|accessdate=6 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207213218/http://lifehacker.com/a-beginners-introduction-to-overclocking-your-intel-pr-5580998|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern use ===\nSome [[operating system]]s, for example [[MS-DOS]], rely on the BIOS to carry out most input/output tasks within the PC.<ref name=\"computing-basics-94\"/>\n\nBecause the BIOS still runs in 16-bit [[real mode]], calling BIOS services directly is inefficient for protected-mode operating systems. BIOS services are not used by modern multitasking operating systems after they initially load, so the importance of the primary part of BIOS is greatly reduced from what it was initially.\n\nLater BIOS implementations took on more complex functions, by including interfaces such as [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface]] (ACPI); these functions include [[power management]], [[hot swapping]], and thermal management.  At the same time, since 2010, BIOS technology is in a transitional process toward [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI]].<ref name=\"Bradley\" />\n\n== Configuration ==\n\n=== Setup utility ===\nHistorically, the BIOS in the IBM PC and XT had no built-in user interface. The BIOS versions in earlier PCs (XT-class) were not software configurable; instead, users set the options via [[DIP switch]]es on the motherboard. Later computers, including all IBM-compatibles with 80286 CPUs, had a battery-backed [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] (CMOS RAM chip) that held BIOS settings.<ref name=\"CMOS Battery\"/> These settings, such as video-adapter type, memory size, and hard-disk parameters, could only be configured by running a configuration program from a disk, not built into the ROM. A special \"reference diskette\" was inserted in an [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM AT]] to configure settings such as memory size.\n\nEarly BIOS versions did not have passwords or boot-device selection options. The BIOS was hard-coded to boot from the first floppy drive, or, if that failed, the first hard disk. Access control in early AT-class machines was by a physical keylock switch (which was not hard to defeat if the computer case could be opened). Anyone who could switch on the computer could boot it.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nLater, 386-class computers started integrating the BIOS setup utility in the ROM itself, alongside the BIOS code; these computers usually boot into the BIOS setup utility if a certain key or key combination is pressed, otherwise the BIOS POST and boot process are executed.\n\n[[File:Award BIOS setup utility.png|thumb|Award BIOS setup utility on a standard PC]]\n\nA modern BIOS setup utility has a menu-based [[user interface]] (UI) accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts. Usually the key is advertised for short time during the early startup, for example \"Press F1 to enter CMOS setup\". The actual key depends on specific hardware. Features present in the BIOS setup utility typically include:\n\n* Configuring the hardware components, including setting their various operating modes and frequencies (for example, selecting how the storage controllers are visible to the operating system, or overclocking the CPU)\n* Setting the [[system clock]]\n* Enabling or disabling system components\n* Selecting which devices are potential boot devices, and in which order booting from them will be attempted\n* Setting various passwords, such as a password for securing access to the BIOS user interface functions itself and preventing malicious users from booting the system from unauthorized portable storage devices, a password for booting the system, or a hard disk drive password that limits access to it and stays assigned even if the hard disk drive is moved to another computer\n\n=== {{anchor|Flashing the BIOS}}Reprogramming ===\n[[File:BIOS replacement kit.jpg|right|thumb|BIOS replacement kit for a Dell 310 from the late 1980s.  Included are two chips, a plastic holder for the chips, and a chip puller.]]\nIn modern PCs the BIOS is stored in [[EEPROM|rewritable memory]], allowing the contents to be replaced and modified. This rewriting of the contents is sometimes termed ''flashing'', based on the common use of a kind of EEPROM known technically as \"flash EEPROM\" and colloquially as \"flash memory\". It can be done by a special program, usually provided by the system's manufacturer, or at [[power-on self-test|POST]], with a BIOS image in a hard drive or USB flash drive. A file containing such contents is sometimes termed \"a BIOS image\". A BIOS might be reflashed in order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved performance or to support newer hardware, or a reflashing operation might be needed to fix a damaged BIOS\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Elitegroup 761GX-M754 - AMIBIOS (American Megatrends) in a Winbond W39V040APZ-5491.jpg|thumb|[[American Megatrends]] BIOS 686. This BIOS chip is housed in a [[plastic leaded chip carrier|PLCC]] package in a socket.]]\nThe original IBM PC BIOS (and cassette BASIC) was stored on mask-programmed [[read-only memory]] (ROM) chips in sockets on the motherboard. ROMs could be replaced, but not altered, by users. To allow for updates, many compatible computers used re-programmable memory devices such as [[EPROM]] and later [[flash memory]] devices. According to Robert Braver, the president of the BIOS manufacturer Micro Firmware, '''Flash BIOS''' chips became common around 1995 because the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) chips are cheaper and easier to program than standard [[ultraviolet]] erasable PROM ([[EPROM]]) chips. Flash chips are programmed (and re-programmed) in-circuit, while EPROM chips need to be removed from the motherboard for re-programming.<ref name=\"smart-computing-97\"/> BIOS versions are upgraded to take advantage of newer versions of hardware and to correct bugs in previous revisions of BIOSes.<ref name=\"smart-computing-96\"/>\n\nBeginning with the IBM AT, PCs supported a hardware clock settable through BIOS. It had a century bit which allowed for manually changing the century when the year 2000 happened. Most BIOS revisions created in 1995 and nearly all BIOS revisions in 1997 supported [[Year 2000 problem|the year 2000]] by setting the century bit automatically when the clock rolled past midnight, December 31, 1999.<ref name=\"smart-somputing-99\"/>\n\nThe first flash chips were attached to the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA bus]]. Starting in 1997, the BIOS flash moved to the [[Low Pin Count|LPC]] bus, a functional replacement for ISA, following a new standard implementation known as \"firmware hub\" (FWH). In 2006, the first systems supporting a [[Serial Peripheral Interface]] (SPI) appeared, and the BIOS flash memory moved again.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe size of the BIOS, and the capacity of the ROM, EEPROM, or other media it may be stored on, has increased over time as new features have been added to the code; BIOS versions now exist with sizes up to 16 megabytes. For contrast, the original IBM PC BIOS was contained in an 8 KiB mask ROM. Some modern motherboards are including even bigger NAND [[flash memory]] ICs on board which are capable of storing whole compact operating systems, such as some [[Linux distribution]]s. For example, some ASUS motherboards included [[Splashtop OS]] embedded into their NAND flash memory ICs.<ref name=\"geek-splashtop\"/>  However, the idea of including an operating system along with BIOS in the ROM of a PC is not new; in the 1980s, Microsoft offered a ROM option for MS-DOS, and it was included in the ROMs of some PC clones such as the [[Tandy 1000#Tandy 1000 HX .26 TX|Tandy 1000 HX]].\n\nAnother type of firmware chip was found on the IBM PC AT and early compatibles. In the AT, the [[keyboard controller (computing)|keyboard interface]] was controlled by a [[microcontroller]] with its own programmable memory. On the IBM AT, that was a 40-pin socketed device, while some manufacturers used an EPROM version of this chip which resembled an EPROM. This controller was also assigned the [[A20 gate]] function to manage memory above the one-megabyte range; occasionally an upgrade of this \"keyboard BIOS\" was necessary to take advantage of software that could use upper memory.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} <!-- An earlier version of this article stated that the IBM PC also used a microcontroller to control the keyboard interface.  This is incorrect; the PC and XT used a simple shift register and an [[8-bit]] parallel port of the 8255A PPI chip for the computer end of the keyboard interface. -->\n\nThe BIOS may contain components such as the [[Memory Reference Code]] (MRC), which is responsible for handling memory timings and related hardware settings.<ref name=\"Life and Times\"/>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"Hilber\"/>\n\n== {{Anchor|COMPARISON}}Vendors and products ==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of different BIOS implementations\n|-\n!

The effect of the publication of the BIOS listings is that anyone can see exactly what a definitive BIOS does and how it does it.\n\nIn May 1984 [[Phoenix Technologies|Phoenix Software Associates]] released its first ROM-BIOS which enabled OEMs to build essentially 100%-compatible clones without having to reverse-engineer the IBM PC BIOS themselves, as Compaq had done for the [[Compaq Portable|Portable]], helping fuel the growth in the PC compatibles industry and sales of non-IBM versions of DOS.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zzAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 Phoenix Eagerly Waiting to Clone Next-Generation IBM BIOS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122080016/http://books.google.com/books?id=zzAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA8 |date=2014-01-22 }}, ''InfoWorld'', March 9, 1987</ref> And the first [[American Megatrends]] (AMI) BIOS was released on 1986.\n\nNew standards grafted onto the BIOS are usually without complete public documentation or any BIOS listings. As a result, it is not as easy to learn the intimate details about the many non-IBM additions to BIOS as about the core BIOS services.\n\nMost PC motherboard suppliers license a BIOS \"core\" and toolkit from a commercial third-party, known as an \"independent BIOS vendor\" or IBV. The motherboard manufacturer then customizes this BIOS to suit its own hardware. For this reason, updated BIOSes are normally obtained directly from the motherboard manufacturer. Major BIOS vendors include [[American Megatrends]] (AMI), [[Insyde Software]], [[Phoenix Technologies]] and Byosoft. Former vendors include [[Award Software]] and Microid Research that were acquired by [[Phoenix Technologies]] in 1998; Phoenix later phased out the Award Brand name. [[General Software]], which was also acquired by Phoenix in 2007, sold BIOS for Intel processor based embedded systems.\n\nThe open source community increased their effort to develop a replacement for proprietary BIOSes and their future incarnations with an open sourced counterpart through the [[libreboot]], [[coreboot]] and [[OpenBIOS]]/[[Open Firmware]] projects. [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] provided product specifications for some chipsets, and [[Google]] is sponsoring the project. [[Motherboard]] manufacturer [[Tyan]] offers [[coreboot]] next to the standard BIOS with their [[Opteron]] line of motherboards. [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] and [[Gigabyte Technology]] have followed suit with the MSI K9ND MS-9282 and MSI K9SD MS-9185 resp. the M57SLI-S4 models.\n\n== {{Anchor|MEBROMI}}Security ==\n[[File:AMIBIOSIntel CPU uCode Error.jpg|thumb|An [[American Megatrends]] BIOS showing a \"[[Intel]] CPU uCode Loading Error\" after a failed attempt to upload microcode patches into the CPU]]<!-- probably just because the CPU revision isn't recognized by this BIOS revision.-->\n[[File:Bios chip-2011-04-11.jpg|thumb|A detached BIOS chip]]\n\n[[EEPROM]] chips are advantageous because they can be easily updated by the user; it is customary for hardware manufacturers to issue BIOS updates to upgrade their products, improve compatibility and remove [[software bug|bugs]]. However, this advantage had the risk that an improperly executed or aborted BIOS update could render the computer or device unusable. To avoid these situations, more recent BIOSes use a \"boot block\"; a portion of the BIOS which runs first and must be updated separately. This code verifies if the rest of the BIOS is intact (using [[hash function|hash]] [[checksum]]s or other methods) before transferring control to it. If the boot block detects any corruption in the main BIOS, it will typically warn the user that a recovery process must be initiated by booting from [[removable media]] (floppy, CD or USB flash drive) so the user can try flashing the BIOS again. Some [[motherboard]]s have a ''backup'' BIOS (sometimes referred to as DualBIOS boards) to recover from BIOS corruptions.\n\nThere are at least four known BIOS attack viruses, two of which were for demonstration purposes. The first one found in the wild was ''Mebromi'', targeting Chinese users.\n\nThe first BIOS virus was [[CIH (computer virus)|CIH]], whose name matches the initials of its creator, Chen Ing Hau. CIH was also called the \"Chernobyl Virus\", because its payload date was 1999-04-26, the 13th anniversary of the [[Chernobyl accident]]. CIH appeared in mid-1998 and became active in April 1999. It was able to erase flash ROM BIOS content. Often, infected computers could no longer boot, and people had to remove the flash ROM IC from the motherboard and reprogram it. CIH targeted the then-widespread Intel i430TX motherboard chipset and took advantage of the fact that the [[Windows 9x]] operating systems, also widespread at the time, allowed direct hardware access to all programs.\n\nModern systems are not vulnerable to CIH because of a variety of chipsets being used which are incompatible with the Intel i430TX chipset, and also other flash ROM IC types. There is also extra protection from accidental BIOS rewrites in the form of boot blocks which are protected from accidental overwrite or dual and quad BIOS equipped systems which may, in the event of a crash, use a backup BIOS. Also, all modern operating systems such as [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[Windows NT]]-based Windows OS like [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]] and newer, do not allow [[Protection ring|user-mode]] programs to have direct hardware access.\n\nAs a result, as of 2008, CIH has become essentially harmless, at worst causing annoyance by infecting executable files and triggering antivirus software. Other BIOS viruses remain possible, however;<ref name=\"Yam\">[http://www.tomshardware.com/news/bios-virus-rootkit-security-backdoor,7400.html New BIOS Virus Withstands HDD Wipes], March 27, 2009. Marcus Yam. Tom's Hardware US</ref> since most Windows home users without Windows Vista/7's UAC run all applications with administrative privileges, a modern CIH-like virus could in principle still gain access to hardware without first using an exploit. The operating system [[OpenBSD]] prevents all users from having this access and the grsecurity patch for the Linux kernel also prevents this direct hardware access by default, the difference being an attacker requiring a much more difficult kernel level exploit or reboot of the machine.\n\nThe second BIOS virus was a technique presented by John Heasman, principal security consultant for UK-based Next-Generation Security Software. In 2006, at the Black Hat Security Conference, he showed how to elevate privileges and read physical memory, using malicious procedures that replaced normal [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] functions stored in flash memory.\n\nThe third BIOS virus was a technique called \"Persistent BIOS infection.\" It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver, and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore. Researchers [[Anibal Sacco]]<ref name=\"AutoTU-1\"/> and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start-up, even before the operating system is booted. The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine, or for the user to be root. Despite these requirements, Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco's discovery: \"We can patch a driver to drop a fully working [[rootkit]]. We even have a little code that can remove or disable antivirus.\"<ref name=\"Fisher\"/>\n\nMebromi is a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] which targets computers with [[AwardBIOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[antivirus software]] from two Chinese companies: Rising Antivirus and Jiangmin KV Antivirus.<ref name=\"Giuliani\"/><ref name=\"BMW\"/><ref name=\"Yuan\"/> Mebromi installs a rootkit which infects the [[master boot record]].\n\nIn a December 2013 interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Deborah Plunkett, Information Assurance Director for the US [[National Security Agency]] claimed that NSA analysts had uncovered and thwarted a possible BIOS attack by a foreign nation state. The attack on the world's computers could have allegedly \"literally taken down the US economy.\" The segment further cites anonymous cyber security experts briefed on the operation as alleging the plot was conceived in China.<ref name=\"cbs-news-60-minutes\"/> A later article in [[The Guardian]] cast doubt on the likelihood of such a threat, quoting Berkeley computer-science researcher Nicholas Weaver, [[Matt Blaze]], a computer and information sciences professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and cybersecurity expert Robert David Graham in an analysis of the NSA's claims.<ref name=\"Ackerman\"/>\n\n== Alternatives and successors ==\n{{Hatnote|For comparable software on other computer systems, see [[booting]].}}\n\n{{As of|2011}}, the BIOS is being replaced by the more complex [[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) in many new machines. EFI is a specification which replaces the runtime interface of the legacy BIOS. Initially written for the [[Intel Itanium architecture]], EFI is now available for [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] platforms; the specification development is driven by The [[Unified EFI Forum]], an industry [[Special Interest Group]]. EFI booting has been supported in only [[Microsoft Windows]] versions supporting [[GUID Partition Table|GPT]],<ref name=\"windows-gpt\"/> the [[Linux kernel]] 2.6.1 and later, and [[macOS]] on [[Apple\u2013Intel architecture|Intel-based Macs]].<ref name=\"intel-uefi\"/> {{as of|2014}}, new PC hardware predominantly ships with UEFI firmware. The architecture of the rootkit safeguard can also prevent the system from running the user's own software changes, which makes UEFI controversial as a BIOS replacement in the [[open hardware]] community. \n\nOther alternatives to the functionality of the \"Legacy BIOS\" in the x86 world include [[coreboot]] and [[libreboot]].\n\nSome servers and workstations use a platform-independent [[Open Firmware]] (IEEE-1275) based on the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] programming language; it is included with Sun's [[SPARC]] computers, IBM's [[RS/6000]] line, and other [[PowerPC]] systems such as the [[Common Hardware Reference Platform|CHRP]] motherboards, along with the x86-based [[OLPC XO-1]].\n\nAs of at least 2015, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has removed legacy BIOS support from [[MacBook Pro]] computers. As such the bless utility no longer supports the --legacy switch, and prints \"Legacy mode not supported on this system\". These Macs also cannot boot from [[CD-ROM]] or [[USB]] flash drives.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computing}}\n\n* [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI)\n* [[e820]]\n* [[Extended System Configuration Data]] (ESCD)\n* [[Double boot]]\n* [[Legacy Plug and Play]] (PnP){{snd}} specifications supporting automated configuration of hardware devices, primarily those on the ISA bus\n* [[Ralf Brown's Interrupt List]] (RBIL){{snd}} interrupts, calls, interfaces, data structures, memory and port addresses, and processor opcodes for the x86 architecture\n* [[System Management BIOS]] (SMBIOS)\n* [[VESA BIOS Extensions]] (VBE){{snd}} an interface for using compliant video boards at high resolutions and bit depths, beyond the standard BIOS support\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Magic_AA55\">The signature at offset <code>+0x1FE</code> in boot sectors is <code>0x55 0xAA</code>, that is <code>0x55</code> at offset <code>+0x1FE</code> and <code>0xAA</code> at offset <code>+0x1FF</code>.

Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest [[quantum state]], at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent [[Macroscopic quantum phenomena|macroscopically]]. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of [[Atmosphere of Earth|normal air]], to ultra-low temperatures.\n\nThis state was first predicted, generally, in 1924\u20131925 by [[Satyendra Nath Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|right|thumb|238px|Velocity-distribution data (3 views) for a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms, confirming the discovery of a new phase of matter, the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. {{nowrap|Left: just}} before the appearance of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. {{nowrap|Center: just}} after the appearance of the condensate. {{nowrap|Right: after}} further evaporation, leaving a sample of nearly pure condensate.]]\n\n[[Satyendra Nath Bose]] first sent a paper to Einstein on the [[quantum statistics]] of light quanta (now called [[photon]]s), in which he derived [[Planck's law|Planck's quantum radiation law]] without any reference to classical physics.

If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.\n\nIf we can tell which particle is which, there are <math>2^N</math> different configurations, since each particle can be in <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math> or <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math> independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math> and the other half in <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math>. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.\n\nIf the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only ''N''+1 different configurations. If there are ''K'' particles in state <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math>, there are {{nowrap|''N \u2212 K''}} particles in state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math>. Whether any particular particle is in state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math> or in state <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math> cannot be determined, so each value of ''K'' determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.\n\nSuppose now that the energy of state <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math> is slightly greater than the energy of state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math> by an amount ''E''. At temperature ''T'', a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state <math>\\scriptstyle|1\\rangle</math> by <math>e^{-E/kT}</math>. In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math>. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most-likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math>.\n\nIn the distinguishable case, for large ''N'', the fraction in state <math>\\scriptstyle|0\\rangle</math> can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;exp(\u2212''E''/''T'') to land tails.\n\nIn the indistinguishable case, each value of ''K'' is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:\n\n:<math>\\,\nP(K)= C e^{-KE/T} = C p^K.\n</math>\n\nFor large ''N'', the normalization constant ''C'' is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 ''p'')}}. The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that <math>\\scriptstyle N\\rightarrow \\infty</math>, is equal to <math>\\scriptstyle \\sum_{n>0} C n p^n=p/(1-p) </math>. It does not grow when ''N'' is large; it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.\n\nConsider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled <math>\\scriptstyle|k\\rangle</math>. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit, the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point, more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.\n\nTo calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate, over all momentum states, the expression for maximum number of excited particles, {{nowrap|''p''/(1 \u2212 ''p'')}}:\n\n:<math>\\,\n N = V \\int {d^3k \\over (2\\pi)^3} {p(k)\\over 1-p(k)} = V \\int {d^3k \\over (2\\pi)^3} {1 \\over e^{k^2\\over 2mT}-1} </math>\n:<math>\\,\np(k)= e^{-k^2\\over 2mT}.\n</math>\n\nWhen the integral is evaluated with factors of ''k''<sub>''B''</sub> and \u210f restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible [[chemical potential]].  In [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] distribution, ''\u03bc'' is actually still nonzero for BECs; however, ''\u03bc'' is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, \u03bc can be approximated for most energy or momentum states as&nbsp;''\u03bc''&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;0.\n\n=== Bogoliubov theory for weakly interacting gas ===\n[[Nikolay Bogolyubov|Nikolay Bogoliubov]] considered perturbations on the limit of dilute gas,<ref name=Bogoliubov:1947/> finding a finite pressure at zero temperature and positive chemical potential. This leads to corrections for the ground state. The Bogoliubov state has pressure (''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0): <math>P = g/2 n^2</math>.\n\nThe original interacting system can be converted to a system of non-interacting particles with a dispersion law.\n\n=== Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation ===\n{{Main|Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation}}\n\nIn some simplest cases, the state of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, also known as Gross\u2013Pitaevskii or Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation. The validity of this approach is actually limited to the case of ultracold temperatures, which fits well for the most alkali atoms experiments.\n\nThis approach originates from the assumption that the state of the BEC can be described by the unique wavefunction of the condensate <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>. For a [[Schr\u00f6dinger field|system of this nature]], <math>|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2</math> is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is <math>N=\\int d\\vec{r}|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2</math>\n\nProvided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using [[mean field theory]], the energy (E) associated with the state <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math> is:\n\n:<math>E=\\int\nd\\vec{r}\\left[\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2+V(\\vec{r})|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2+\\frac{1}{2}U_0|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^4\\right]</math>\n\nMinimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross\u2013Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]):\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial \\psi(\\vec{r})}{\\partial t} = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m}+V(\\vec{r})+U_0|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2\\right)\\psi(\\vec{r})</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n<dl><dd>\n{|cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| <math>\\,m</math>\n| &nbsp;is the mass of the bosons,\n|-\n| <math>\\,V(\\vec{r})</math>\n| &nbsp;is the external potential,\n|-\n| <math>\\,U_0</math>\n| &nbsp;is representative of the inter-particle interactions.\n|}\n</dd></dl>\n\nIn the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law  of interacting Bose\u2013Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for <math>\\ T= 0</math>):\n\n:<math> {\\omega _p} = \\sqrt {\\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}}\\left( {\\frac{{{p^2}}}{{2m}} + 2{U_0}{n_0}} \\right)} </math>\n\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC's. However, GPE does not take into account the temperature dependence of dynamical variables, and is therefore valid only for <math>\\ T= 0</math>.\nIt is not applicable, for example, for the condensates of excitons, magnons and photons, where the critical temperature is comparable to room temperature.\n\n==Numerical Solution==\n\nThe Gross-Pitaevskii  equation is a partial differential equation in space and time variables.

By construction, the [[Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation|GPE]] uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to [[self-energy]].<ref>Beliaev, S. T. Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 34, 417\u2013432 (1958) [Soviet Phys. JETP 7, 289 (1958)]; ibid. 34, 433\u2013446 [Soviet Phys.

If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate [[wavefunction]] acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms turns out to be infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial.

This problem was in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.\n\n=== Superfluidity of BEC and Landau criterion ===\nThe phenomena of superfluidity of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose\u2013Einstein condensation. Under corresponding conditions, below the temperature of phase transition, these phenomena were observed in [[helium-4]] and different classes of superconductors. In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the superfluidity of Fermi gas.  In the simplest form, the origin of superfluidity can be seen from the weakly interacting bosons model.\n\n== Experimental observation ==\n\n=== Superfluid He-4 ===\n\nIn 1938, [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa|Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[John F. Allen|John Allen]] and [[Don Misener]] discovered that [[helium-4]] became a new kind of fluid, now known as a [[superfluid]], at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the [[lambda point]]). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero [[viscosity]] (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]]. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose\u2013Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). [[Superfluid helium-4]] is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose\u2013Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose\u2013Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that [[helium-3]], a [[fermion]], also enters a [[superfluid]] phase (at a much lower temperature) which can be explained by the formation of bosonic [[Cooper pairs]] of two atoms (see also [[fermionic condensate]]).\n\n=== Gaseous ===\n\nThe first \"pure\" Bose\u2013Einstein condensate was created by [[Eric Cornell]], [[Carl Wieman]], and co-workers at [[JILA]] on 5 June 1995. They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand [[rubidium|rubidium-87]] atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of [[laser cooling]] (a technique that won its inventors [[Steven Chu]], [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]], and [[William D. Phillips]] the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]) and [[magnetic evaporative cooling]].  About four months later, an independent effort led by [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] condensed [[sodium|sodium-23]]. Ketterle's condensate had a hundred times more atoms, allowing important results such as the observation of [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their achievements.<ref name=\"nobel\">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/cornellwieman-lecture.pdf |title=Eric A.

Hulet's team subsequently showed the condensate could be stabilized by confinement quantum pressure for up to about 1000 atoms.  Various isotopes have since been condensed.\n\n==== Velocity-distribution data graph ====\n\nIn the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate out of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the [[uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This [[anisotropy]] of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook ''Thermal Physics'' by Ralph Baierlein.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fqUU71spbZYC&printsec=frontcover|title=Thermal Physics|author=Baierlein, Ralph |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-521-65838-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Quasiparticles ===\n\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensation of quasiparticles}}Bose\u2013Einstein condensation also applies to [[quasiparticle]]s in solids.

Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic [[Thallium|Tl]][[Copper|Cu]][[Chlorine|Cl]]<sub>3</sub>,<ref name=Nikuni:1999/> at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the magnons small mass (near an electron) and greater achievable density.

These can be created, for example, by 'stirring' the condensate with lasers, or rotating the confining trap. The vortex created will be a [[quantum vortex]]. These phenomena are allowed for by the non-linear <math>|\\psi(\\vec{r})|^2</math> term in the GPE.{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2017|reason=I do not believe the non-linear term is necessary; vortices are a simple consequence of the continuity equation the condensate wavefunction satisfies, and this equation is the same without the interaction term because the interaction term is real.}} As the vortices must have quantized [[angular momentum]] the wavefunction may have the form <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})=\\phi(\\rho,z)e^{i\\ell\\theta}</math> where <math>\\rho, z</math> and <math>\\theta</math> are as in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]], and <math>\\ell</math> is the angular number.  This is particularly likely for an axially symmetric (for instance, harmonic) confining potential, which is commonly used.  The notion is easily generalized.  To determine <math>\\phi(\\rho,z)</math>, the energy of <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})</math> must be minimized, according to the constraint <math>\\psi(\\vec{r})=\\phi(\\rho,z)e^{i\\ell\\theta}</math>.

Research has, however, indicated they are metastable states, so may have relatively long lifetimes.\n\nClosely related to the creation of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark [[soliton]]s in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.<ref name=Becker:2008/>\n\n=== Attractive interactions ===\nExperiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist up to a critical atom number.  Quench cooling the gas, they observed the condensate to grow, then subsequently collapse as the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the confining potential, in a burst reminiscent of a supernova, with an explosion preceded by an implosion.\n\nFurther work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the [[JILA]] team, of Cornell, Wieman and coworkers. Their instrumentation now had better control so they used naturally ''attracting'' atoms of rubidium-85 (having negative atom\u2013atom [[scattering length]]). Through [[Feshbach resonance]] involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, they lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which rubidium bonds, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] among wave-like condensate atoms.\n\nWhen the JILA team raised the magnetic field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud.<ref name=nobel/> [[Carl Wieman]] explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose\u2013Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms;<ref name=vanPutten:2010/> energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.\n\nThe process of creation of molecular Bose condensate during the sweep of the magnetic field throughout the Feshbach resonance, as well as the reverse process, are described by the exactly solvable model that can explain many experimental observations.<ref name='sun-16pra2'>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033808|title=Landau-Zener extension of the Tavis-Cummings model: Structure of the solution|author1=C.

It arises from a subtle interplay of electronic and nuclear spins: at ultra-low temperatures and corresponding excitation energies, the half-integer total spin of the electronic shell and half-integer total spin of the nucleus are coupled by a very weak [[hyperfine coupling|hyperfine interaction]].  The total spin of the atom, arising from this coupling, is an integer lower value.  The chemistry of systems at room temperature is determined by the electronic properties, which is essentially fermionic, since room temperature thermal excitations have typical energies much higher than the hyperfine values.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Atom laser]]\n*[[Atomic coherence]]\n*[[Bose\u2013Einstein correlations]]\n*[[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation: a network theory approach]]\n*[[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation of quasiparticles]]\n*[[Cold Atom Laboratory]]\n*[[Electromagnetically induced transparency]]\n*[[Fermionic condensate]]\n*[[Gas in a box]]\n*[[Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation]]\n*[[Macroscopic quantum phenomena]]\n*[[Macroscopic quantum self-trapping]]\n*[[Slow light]]\n*[[Superconductivity]]\n*[[Superfluid film]]\n*[[Superfluid helium-4]]\n*[[Supersolid]]\n*[[Tachyon condensation]]\n*[[Timeline of low-temperature technology]]\n*[[Transuranium element#Super-heavy elements|Super-heavy atom]]\n*[[Ultracold atom]]\n*[[Wiener sausage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=London:1938>\n{{cite journal\n |author=F.

B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component Thompson felt he could do without in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. The BCPL to B transition also included changes made to suit Thompson's preferences (mostly along the lines of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters in a typical program).<ref name=chist /> Much of the typical [[ALGOL]]-like syntax of BCPL was rather heavily changed in this process. The assignment operator <code>:=</code> reverted to the <code>=</code> of [[Heinz Rutishauser|Rutishauser]]'s Superplan (the source of [[ALGOL 58]]'s <code>:=</code>), and the equality operator <code>=</code> was replaced by <code>==</code>.\n\nThompson invented arithmetic assignment operators for B, using <code>x =+ y</code> to add y to x (in C the operator is written <code>+=</code>). B also introduced the increment and decrement operators (<code>++</code> and <code>--</code>). Their prefix or postfix position determines whether the value is taken before or after alteration of the operand. These innovations were not in the earliest versions of B. Some guess {{Who|date=February 2018}} that they were created for the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes of the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]]. This is historically impossible as there was no PDP-11 at the time that B was developed.<ref name=chist />\n\nB is typeless, or more precisely has one data type: the computer word. Most operators (e.g. <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>) treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be de[[reference (computer science)|referenced]]. In many other ways it looked a lot like an early version of C. There are a few library functions, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the [[stdio.h|standard I/O library]] in C.<ref name=bur />\n\nEarly implementations were for the DEC [[PDP-7]] and [[PDP-11]] minicomputers using early [[Unix]], and [[Honeywell]] {{nowrap|[[GE-600 series|GE 645]]}}<ref name=\"Evolution\">{{cite journal |first=Dennis M. |last=Ritchie |title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611114353/https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html |archivedate=11 June 2015 |journal=AT&T Bell Laboratories Technical Journal |volume=63 |number=6 Part 2 |year=1984 |pages=1577\u20131593}}</ref> 36-bit mainframes running the operating system [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GCOS]].

The law is commonly applied to [[chemical analysis]] measurements and used in understanding attenuation in [[physical optics]], for [[photons]], [[neutrons]] or rarefied gases. In [[mathematical physics]], this law arises as a solution of the [[Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook|BGK equation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe law was discovered by [[Pierre Bouguer]] before 1729.<ref>Pierre Bouguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JNkTAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA1 ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumi\u00e8re''] (Paris, France: Claude Jombert, 1729) pp. 16\u201322.</ref> It is often attributed to [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who cited Bouguer's ''Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumi\u00e8re'' (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729)\u2014and even quoted from it\u2014in his ''[[Photometria]]'' in 1760.<ref>J.\u00a0H.

Much later, [[August Beer]] discovered another attenuation relation in 1852.

If the radiation is especially intense, [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] processes can also cause variances. The main reason, however, is the following. At high concentrations, the [[Molecule|molecules]] are closer to each other and begin to interact with each other. This interaction will change several properties of the molecule, and thus will change the attenuation.\n\n=== Expression with attenuation coefficient ===\nThe Beer\u2013Lambert law can be expressed in terms of [[attenuation coefficient]], but in this case is better called Lambert's law since amount concentration, from Beer's law, is hidden inside the attenuation coefficient. The (Napierian) attenuation coefficient <math>\\mu</math> and the decadic attenuation coefficient <math>\\mu_{10}=\\mu/\\ln 10</math>of a material sample are related to its number densities and amount concentrations as\n:<math>\\mu(z) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\mu_i(z) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\sigma_i n_i(z),</math>\n:<math>\\mu_{10}(z) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\mu_{10,i}(z) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\varepsilon_i c_i(z)</math>\nrespectively, by definition of attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient. Then the Beer\u2013Lambert law becomes\n:<math>T = e^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu(z)\\mathrm{d}z} = 10^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu_{10}(z)\\mathrm{d}z},</math>\nand\n:<math>\\tau = \\int_0^\\ell \\mu(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z,</math>\n:<math>A = \\int_0^\\ell \\mu_{10}(z)\\,\\mathrm{d}z.</math>\n\nIn case of ''uniform'' attenuation, these relations become\n:<math>T = e^{-\\mu\\ell} = 10^{-\\mu_{10}\\ell},</math>\nor equivalently\n:<math>\\tau = \\mu\\ell,</math>\n:<math>A = \\mu_{10}\\ell.</math>\n\n== Derivation ==\nAssume that a beam of light enters a material sample. Define ''z'' as an axis parallel to the direction of the beam. Divide the material sample into thin slices, perpendicular to the beam of light, with thickness d''z'' sufficiently small that one particle in a slice cannot obscure another particle in the same slice when viewed along the ''z'' direction. The radiant flux of the light that emerges from a slice is reduced, compared to that of the light that entered, by {{nobreak|1=d\u03a6<sub>e</sub>(''z'') = \u2212''\u03bc''(''z'')\u03a6<sub>e</sub>(''z'') d''z''}}, where ''\u03bc'' is the (Napierian) [[attenuation coefficient]], which yields the following first-order [[Linear differential equation|linear ODE]]:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{d}z}(z) = -\\mu(z)\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}(z).</math>\nThe attenuation is caused by the photons that did not make it to the other side of the slice because of [[scattering]] or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]]. The solution to this differential equation is obtained by multiplying the [[integrating factor]]\n:<math>e^{\\int_0^z \\mu(z')\\mathrm{d}z'}</math>\nthroughout to obtain\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}}{\\mathrm{d}z}(z)\\,e^{\\int_0^z \\mu(z')\\mathrm{d}z'} + \\mu(z)\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}(z)\\,e^{\\int_0^z \\mu(z')\\mathrm{d}z'} = 0,</math>\nwhich simplifies due to the [[product rule]] (applied backwards) to\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}z}\\bigl(\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}(z)\\,e^{\\int_0^z \\mu(z')\\mathrm{d}z'}\\bigr) = 0.</math>\nIntegrating both sides and solving for \u03a6<sub>e</sub> for a material of real thickness ''\u2113'', with the incident radiant flux upon the slice {{nobreak|1=\u03a6<sub>e</sub><sup>i</sup> = \u03a6<sub>e</sub>(0)}} and the transmitted radiant flux {{nobreak|1=\u03a6<sub>e</sub><sup>t</sup> = \u03a6<sub>e</sub>(''\u2113'' )}} gives\n:<math>\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}^\\mathrm{t} = \\Phi_\\mathrm{e}^\\mathrm{i}\\,e^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu(z)\\mathrm{d}z},</math>\nand finally\n:<math>T = \\frac{\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}^\\mathrm{t}}{\\Phi_\\mathrm{e}^\\mathrm{i}} = e^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu(z)\\mathrm{d}z}.</math>\nSince the decadic attenuation coefficient ''\u03bc''<sub>10</sub> is related to the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient by {{nobreak|1=''\u03bc''<sub>10</sub> = ''\u03bc''/ln 10}}, one also have\n:<math>T = e^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\ln{10}\\,\\mu_{10}(z)\\mathrm{d}z} = \\bigl(e^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu_{10}(z)\\mathrm{d}z}\\bigr)^{\\ln{10}} = 10^{-\\int_0^\\ell \\mu_{10}(z)\\mathrm{d}z}.</math>\n\nTo describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[Number density|number densities]] ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> of the ''N'' attenuating species of the material sample, one introduces the [[Cross section (physics)|attenuation cross section]] {{nobreak|1=''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''\u03bc''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')/''n''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')}}. ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub> has the dimension of an area; it expresses the likelihood of interaction between the particles of the beam and the particles of the specie ''i'' in the material sample:\n:<math>T = e^{-\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\sigma_i \\int_0^\\ell n_i(z)\\mathrm{d}z}.</math>\n\nOne can also use the [[molar attenuation coefficient]]s {{nobreak|1=''\u03b5''<sub>''i''</sub> = (N<sub>A</sub>/ln 10)''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, where N<sub>A</sub> is the [[Avogadro constant]], to describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the [[amount concentration]]s {{nobreak|1=''c''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'') = ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>(''z'')/N<sub>A</sub>}} of the attenuating species of the material sample:\n:<math> \\begin{align}\nT = e^{-\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\frac{\\ln{10}}{\\mathrm{N_A}}\\varepsilon_i \\int_0^\\ell n_i(z)\\mathrm{d}z} = \\\\\n \\Bigl(e^{-\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\varepsilon_i \\int_0^\\ell \\frac{n_i(z)}{\\mathrm{N_A}}\\mathrm{d}z}\\Bigr)^{\\ln{10}} = 10^{-\\sum_{i = 1}^N \\varepsilon_i \\int_0^\\ell c_i(z)\\mathrm{d}z}.\\end{align} </math>\n\n== Validity ==\nUnder certain conditions Beer\u2013Lambert law fails to maintain a linear relationship between attenuation and concentration of [[analyte]].<ref>Mehta A.[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/05/ultraviolet-visible-uv-vis-spectroscopy-%E2%80%93-limitations-and-deviations-of-beer-lambert-law/ Limitations and Deviations of Beer\u2013Lambert Law]</ref> These deviations are classified into three categories:\n# Real\u2014fundamental deviations due to the limitations of the law itself.\n# Chemical\u2014deviations observed due to specific chemical species of the sample which is being analyzed.\n# Instrument\u2014deviations which occur due to how the attenuation measurements are made.\n\nThere are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for Beer\u2013Lambert law to be valid. These are:\n# The attenuators must act independently of each other.\n# The attenuating medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume.\n# The attenuating medium must not scatter the radiation\u2014no [[turbidity]]\u2014unless this is accounted for as in [[Differential optical absorption spectroscopy|DOAS]].\n# The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the absorbing medium.\n# The incident radiation should preferably be [[monochromatic]], or have at least a width that is narrower than that of the attenuating transition. Otherwise a spectrometer as detector for the power is needed instead of a photodiode which has not a selective wavelength dependence.\n# The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a non-invasive probe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical saturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise to stimulated emission.\n\nIf any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from Beer\u2013Lambert law.\n\nThe Beer\u2013Lambert law is not compatible with [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mayerh\u00f6fer|first=Thomas G.|last2=Mutschke|first2=Harald|last3=Popp|first3=J\u00fcrgen|date=2016-04-01|title=Employing Theories Far beyond Their Limits\u2014The Case of the (Boguer-) Beer\u2013Lambert Law|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cphc.201600114/abstract|journal=ChemPhysChem|language=en|pages=1948\u20131955|doi=10.1002/cphc.201600114|issn=1439-7641|volume=17}}</ref> Being strict, the law does not describe the transmittance through a medium, but the propagation within that medium. It can be made compatible with Maxwell's equations if the transmittance of a sample with solute is ratioed against the transmittance of the pure solvent which explains why it works so well in [[Spectrophotometry, ultraviolet|spectrophotometry]]. As this is not possible for pure media, the uncritical employment of the Beer\u2013Lambert law can easily generate errors of the order of 100% or more.<ref name=\":0\" /> In such cases it is necessary to apply the [[Transfer-matrix method (optics)|Transfer-matrix method]].\n\n== Chemical analysis by spectrophotometry ==\nBeer\u2013Lambert law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by [[spectrophotometry]], without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of [[bilirubin]] in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar attenuation coefficient ''\u03b5'' is known. Measurements of decadic attenuation coefficient ''\u03bc''<sub>10</sub> are made at one wavelength ''\u03bb'' that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences. The amount concentration ''c'' is then given by\n:<math>c = \\frac{\\mu_{10}(\\lambda)}{\\varepsilon(\\lambda)}.</math>\n\nFor a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two species at amount concentrations ''c''<sub>1</sub> and ''c''<sub>2</sub>. The decadic attenuation coefficient at any wavelength ''\u03bb'' is, given by\n:<math>\\mu_{10}(\\lambda) = \\varepsilon_1(\\lambda) c_1 + \\varepsilon_2(\\lambda) c_2.</math>\n\nTherefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the amount concentrations ''c''<sub>1</sub> and ''c''<sub>2</sub> as long as the molar attenuation coefficient of the two components, ''\u03b5''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u03b5''<sub>2</sub> are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]]. In practice it is better to use [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of ''N'' wavelengths for a mixture containing ''N'' components.\n\nThe law is used widely in [[infra-red spectroscopy]] and [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] for analysis of [[polymer degradation]] and [[oxidation]] (also in biological tissue) as well as to measure the [[concentration]] of various compounds in different [[food]] samples. The [[carbonyl group]] attenuation at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the [[polymer]] calculated.\n\n== Beer\u2013Lambert law in the atmosphere ==\nThis law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The optical depth for a slant path is {{nobreak|1=''\u03c4''\u2032 = ''m\u03c4''}}, where ''\u03c4'' refers to a vertical path, ''m'' is called the [[airmass|relative airmass]], and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as {{nobreak|1=''m'' = sec ''\u03b8''}} where ''\u03b8'' is the [[zenith angle]] corresponding to the given path. The Beer\u2013Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written\n:<math>T = e^{-m(\\tau_\\mathrm{a} + \\tau_\\mathrm{g} + \\tau_\\mathrm{RS} + \\tau_\\mathrm{NO_2} + \\tau_\\mathrm{w} + \\tau_\\mathrm{O_3} + \\tau_\\mathrm{r} + \\ldots)},</math>\nwhere each ''\u03c4''<sub>''x''</sub> is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:\n* a refers to [[aerosols]] (that absorb and scatter);\n* g are uniformly mixed gases (mainly [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>)  and molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) which only absorb);\n* NO<sub>2</sub> is [[nitrogen dioxide]], mainly due to urban pollution (absorption only);\n* RS are effects due to [[Raman scattering]] in the atmosphere;\n* w is [[water vapour]] [[water absorption|absorption]];\n* O<sub>3</sub> is [[ozone]] (absorption only);\n* r is [[Rayleigh scattering]] from molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) (responsible for the blue color of the sky);\n* the selection of the attenuators which have to be considered depends on the wavelength range and can include various other compounds. This can include [[tetraoxygen]], [[HONO]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glyoxal]], a series of halogen radicals and others.\n\n''m'' is the ''optical mass'' or ''[[airmass]] factor'', a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of ''\u03b8'') to 1/cos ''\u03b8'', where ''\u03b8'' is the observed object's [[celestial coordinate system|zenith angle]] (the angle measured from the direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site). This equation can be used to retrieve ''\u03c4''<sub>a</sub>, the aerosol [[optical depth|optical thickness]], which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Applied spectroscopy]]\n* [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy]]\n* [[Absorption spectroscopy]]\n* [[Cavity ring-down spectroscopy]]\n* [[Infra-red spectroscopy]]\n* [[Job plot]]\n* [[Laser absorption spectrometry]]\n* [[Logarithm]]\n* [[Polymer degradation]]\n* [[Scientific laws named after people]]\n* [[Quantification of nucleic acids]]\n* [[Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.changbioscience.com/calculator/BeerLambert.html Beer\u2013Lambert Law Calculator]\n<!-- * [http://www.canberra.edu.au/irps/blbalaw.html Origin of the law(s)] (Bad link)-->\n<!-- See also L.

The group's [[#Members|original lineup]] consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]]; their cousin [[Mike Love]]; and their friend [[Al Jardine]]. Distinguished by their [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and early [[surf music|surf songs]], they are one of the [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys|most influential acts of the rock era]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3640|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic \"The Beach Boys \u2013 Overview\"].

In 1963, they gained national prominence with a string of top-ten hits reflecting a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance, later dubbed the \"[[California Sound]]\". After 1964, they abandoned [[beach]]going themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|nascent counterculture era]]. Following the [[Collapse of Smile|dissolution]] of the group's ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' project in 1967, Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of [[mental health]] and [[substance abuse]] issues. The group's commercial momentum subsequently faltered, and despite efforts to maintain an [[experimental music|experimental]] sound, they were dismissed by [[Music journalism#20th century rock criticism|early rock critics]] as the archetypal \"pop music cop-outs\".\n\nCarl took over as the band's musical leader until the late 1970s. Personal struggles, creative disagreements, and the continued success of the band's [[greatest hits album]]s precipitated their transition into an [[oldies]] act. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, [[Love v. Wilson|songwriting credits]] and use of the band's name transpired.

Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic.\"{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=42}} Most of the song's structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=148}}  Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Brian limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or \"modules\").

All of these elements combined to create a split fanbase corresponding to two distinct musical markets. One group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band's early hits as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s. The other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity, but not as much as the band's ambitious work that was created during the formative [[psychedelic era]].{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p={{page needed|date=May 2018}}}}\n\nInitially, rock music journalists valued the Beach Boys' early records over their experimental work.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|p=218}}{{refn|group=nb|For example, critics from ''Rolling Stone'' were wary of the group's changing music, with [[Ralph J. Gleason]] writing in January 1968: \"The Beach Boys, when they were a reflection of an actuality of American society (i.e., Southern California hot rod, surfing and beer-bust fraternity culture), made music that had vitality and interest.

She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the [[Lake District]], developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.\n\nThough Potter was typical of women of her generation in having limited opportunities for higher education, her study and watercolours of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of [[mycology]]. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]''. Following this, Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.\n\nIn all, Potter wrote thirty books; the best known being her [[Beatrix Potter#Publications|twenty-three children's tales]]. With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought [[Hill Top, Cumbria|Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], a village in the [[Lake District]] which at that time was in [[Lancashire]]. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from [[Hawkshead]]. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of [[Herdwick sheep]] and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne, until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.\n\nPotter died of [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at the age of 77, leaving almost all her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the [[Lake District National Park]]. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in song, film, ballet, and animation, and her life depicted in a feature film and television film.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Young Beatrix.jpg|thumb|left|Potter at fifteen years with her [[English Springer Spaniel|springer spaniel]], Spot]]\n\nPotter's paternal grandfather, [[Edmund Potter]], from [[Glossop]] in Derbyshire, owned what was then the largest [[calico]] printing works in England, and later served as a Member of Parliament.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 10\u201314</ref>\n\nBeatrix's father, Rupert William Potter (1832\u20131914), was educated at Manchester College by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] philosopher [[James Martineau|Dr. James Martineau]].<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tim|title=Mandrake-The Duchess of Cambridge is related to Beatrix Potter, who once gave the Middleton family her own original hand-painted illustrations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10980599/Kate-Middleton-is-related-to-Beatrix-Potter.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph | location=UK | page=8 | date=22 July 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|last=Taylor\n|first=Judy\n|title=Beatrix Potter \u2013  Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman\n|url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/1007152/Taylor_-_Beatrix_Potter_Artist,_Storyteller_and_Countrywoman.html\n|publisher=Frederick Warne, 1996\n|accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref> He then trained as a barrister in London.

Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly.  In their school room, Beatrix and Bertram kept a variety of small pets, mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects which they drew and studied.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 31, pp. 37\u201344, p. 458nn15</ref> Beatrix was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays.<ref>Judy Taylor, Joyce Irene Whalley, Anne Stevenson Hobbs and Elizabeth Battrick, (1987) ''Beatrix Potter, 1866\u20131943: The Artist and Her World'', pp.9\u201317, 35\u201348; Lear, pp. 25\u201348.</ref> In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Beatrix spent summer holidays at [[Dalguise]], an estate on the [[River Tay]] in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 26\u20138, 51</ref> Beatrix and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country and both children became adept students of [[natural history]]. In 1887, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the [[Lake District]], at [[Wray Castle]] near [[Windermere|Lake Windermere]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 51\u20132</ref> Here Beatrix met [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]], vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Beatrix and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.<ref>Potter, ''The Journal, 1885\u20131897''</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 52\u20133</ref>\n\nAt about the age of 14, Beatrix began to keep a diary. It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter [[Substitution cipher|substitution]]. Her ''Journal'' was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment: in tiny handwriting she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.49\u201351 ''cf.'' also p. 463nn1</ref> The ''Journal'', decoded and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter's maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights on the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings.<ref>Potter, \"The Journal, 1885\u20131897\"</ref> Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own whilst dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother,<ref>Lear 2007, p. 94 also ''cf.'' p. 474nn55</ref> and managing their various households.\n\n===Scientific illustrations and work in mycology===\n[[File:Beatrix Potter- Mycology.

In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on [[mycology]]. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in [[Perthshire]] in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the [[agaric]]s) and in 1895 developed a theory of their [[germination]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 81\u2013103</ref> Through the connections of her uncle [[Henry Enfield Roscoe|Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe]], a chemist and [[vice-chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of London]], she consulted with botanists at [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew Gardens]], convincing [[George Edward Massee|George Massee]] of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of [[F1 hybrid|hybridisation]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 117</ref> She did not believe in the theory of [[symbiosis]] proposed by [[Simon Schwendener]], the German mycologist, as previously thought; rather she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.<ref>M.A. Taylor and R.H.

It was introduced by Massee because, as a female, Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered, along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beatrix Potter and the Linnean Society|url=http://www.linnean.org/index.php?id=104|publisher=Linnean Society|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Lear 2007, pp. 104\u201325</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |last=Watling |first=Roy |title=Helen Beatrix Potter: Her interest in fungi |work=The Linnean: Newsletter and Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London |volume=16 |issue=1 |date=January 2000 |pages=24\u201331 |authorlink=Roy Watling |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513210936/https://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/The-Linnaen/Lin%20Vol%2016_%20no%201_%20Jan%202000.pdf |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the [[Armitt Library|Armitt Museum and Library]] in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the [[Perth Museum and Art Gallery]] in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist [[Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay|W.P.K. Findlay]] included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi'', thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book.<ref>Walter Philip Kennedy Findlay, (1967) ''Wayside & Woodland Fungi''</ref> In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 125, p.482nn58</ref>\n\n===Artistic and literary career===\n[[File:Peter Rabbit first edition 1902a.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition, 1902]]\nPotter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the [[Old Testament]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', she grew up with ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'', the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''[[The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby|The Water Babies]]'',<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 30\u20131</ref> the folk tales and [[Scottish mythology|mythology of Scotland]], the [[German Romanticism|German Romantics]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref>Lear 2007, p. 95. She liked to memorise his plays by heart.</ref> and the romances of [[Sir Walter Scott]].<ref>Lear 2007, p. 35. Beatrix said she learnt to read \"on\" Scott</ref> As a young child, before the age of eight, [[Edward Lear]]'s ''Book of Nonsense'', including the much loved ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', and [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' had made their impression, although she later said of ''Alice'' that she was more interested in [[John Tenniel|Tenniel]]'s illustrations than what they were about.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 34</ref> The ''[[Brer Rabbit]]'' stories of [[Joel Chandler Harris]] had been family favourites, and she later studied his ''[[Uncle Remus]]'' stories and illustrated them.<ref>Lear 2007, p.131. She began eight ''Uncle Remus'' drawings in the same year 1893 she began writing the ''Peter Rabbit'' picture letters to Noel Moore, completing the last in 1896.</ref> She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate [[Walter Crane]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Randolph Caldecott]], the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 33</ref> When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, \"[[Cinderella]]\", \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\", \"[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]\", \"[[Puss in Boots|Puss-in-boots]]\", and \"[[Red Riding Hood]]\".<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 127\u20138</ref> But most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.<ref>Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and her World,'' pp. 49\u201370;  Potter, ''Journal, 1884\u20131897''; Humphrey Carpenter (1985), ''Secret Gardens: The Golden Age of Children\u2019s Literature.''</ref>\n\nIn her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the [[Royal Academy]] in London.<ref>Lear 2007, p. 47-8. [[J. M. W. Turner]] was the first artist to impress her.</ref> Her ''Journal'' reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist [[Sir John Everett Millais]], who recognised Beatrix's talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.<ref>Taylor, ''Artist, Storyteller,'' pp. 70\u201395; Taylor, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potters Letters''.</ref>\n\nAs a way to earn money in the 1890s, Beatrix and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design, as well as cards for special occasions. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of her drawings of her rabbit [[Benjamin Bunny]] to illustrate verses by [[Frederic Weatherly]] titled ''A Happy Pair''. In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's ''Our Dear Relations'', another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for ''Changing Pictures'', a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.<ref>Taylor, et al. 1987, pp. 107\u2013148; Katherine Chandler, \"Thoroughly Post-Victorian, Pre-Modern Beatrix.\" ''Children's Literature Quarterly''. 32(4): 287\u2013307.</ref>\n\nWhenever Potter went on holiday to the [[Lake District]] or [[Scotland]], she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in [[Dunkeld]], Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel and so she told him a story about \"four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter\". It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.<ref>Judy Taylor 1992, ''Letters to Children from Beatrix Potter''.</ref>\n[[File:Beatrix Potter dummy manuscripts.jpg|thumb|left|Potter's dummy manuscripts of three of her books - designed to see how the printed book would look]]\nIn 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it \u2013 it has been suggested, in imitation of [[Helen Bannerman]]'s 1899 bestseller ''[[The Story of Little Black Sambo]]''.<ref>Stevenson, Laura C. \"A Vogue for Small Books\": The Tale of Peter Rabbit and its Contemporary Competitors\" [http://www.lauracstevenson.org/avogueoflittlebooks.htm]</ref> Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Family friend [[canon (priest)|Canon]] [[Hardwicke Rawnsley]] had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. [[Frederick Warne & Co]] had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the \"bunny book\" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist [[L. Leslie Brooke]].<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 144\u20137</ref> The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then new [[Edmund Evans#Later work and retirement|Hentschel three-colour process]] to reproduce her watercolours.<ref name=\"Hobbs15\">Hobbs 1989, p. 15</ref>\n[[File:Tower Bank Arms.jpg|thumb|right|Potter used many real locations for her book illustrations. The Tower Bank Arms, Near Sawrey appears in ''The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck''.]]\nOn 2 October 1902, ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' was published,<ref>Taylor 1996, p. 76</ref> and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' and ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'', which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with [[Norman Warne]] as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was ''[[Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes]]'' in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the [[First World War]], when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.<ref>Judy Taylor 2002, ''That Naughty Rabbit: Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit'';  Lear 2007, pp. 207\u2013247; Anne Stevenson Hobbs, ed. 1989, ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Art: Paintings and Drawings''.</ref>\n\nThe immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.\n\nPotter was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903, she made and patented a [[Peter Rabbit]] doll. It was followed by other \"spin-off\" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by [[Frederick Warne & Co]] and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.<ref>See Judy Taylor 2002, \"That Naughty Rabbit\"</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Potter and [[Norman Warne]] became unofficially engaged. Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was \"in trade\" and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month until Warne died of [[pernicious anaemia]] at age 37.<ref>Lear 2007, pp.198- 201</ref> That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy [[Hill Top Farm]] in [[Near Sawrey]] in the English [[Lake District]] near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne's death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm, and live in \"that charming village\".<ref>Lear 2007, p. 207</ref>\n\n===Country life===\n[[File:Hill Top Farm.jpg|thumb|right|Hill Top, Near Sawrey&nbsp;\u2013 Potter's former home, now owned by the National Trust and preserved as it was when she lived and wrote her stories there.]]\nThe tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of [[fell farming]] and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis & Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby [[Hawkshead]]. With William Heelis acting for her she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the {{convert|20|acre|ha}} Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as ''[[The Tale of Ginger and Pickles]]'', about the local shop in Near Sawrey and ''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'', a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.<ref>Taylor, ed., (2002) ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Hunter Davies, ''Beatrix Potter's Lakeland''; W.R. Mitchell, ''Potter: Her Life in the Lake District''.</ref>\n\nOwning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912 Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at [[St Mary Abbots]] in [[Kensington]]. The couple moved immediately to [[Near and Far Sawrey|Near Sawrey]], residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farm house on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'' are representative of Hill Top Farm and of her farming life, and reflect her happiness with her country life.<ref>John Heelis, (1999) ''The Tale of Mrs William Heelis&nbsp;\u2013 Beatrix Potter''; Lear, Ch. 13.</ref>\n\nRupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of [[World War I]], Potter, now a wealthy woman, persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in [[Bowness-on-Windermere|Bowness]], on the other side of Lake Windermere,<ref>{{cite book|last= McDowell|first= Marta|title=Beatrix Potter's Gardening Life: The Plants and Places That Inspired the classic children's tales|publisher=Timber Press|date=2013|pages=116|isbn=1604693630}}</ref> Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne & Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages, and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.<ref>Taylor et al. ''The Artist and Her World'', pp. 185\u2013194; Taylor, ''Artist Storyteller'', pp. 105\u2013144.</ref>\n\n===Sheep farming===\nSoon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of [[Herdwick|Herdwick sheep]], the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called [[Troutbeck Park|Troutbeck Park Farm]], formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.<ref>William Rollinson, (1981) ''How They Lived in the Lake District''; Susan Denyer, 1993 ''Herdwick Sheep Farming''; Geoff Brown, (2009) ''Herdwicks: Herdwick Sheep and the English Lake District''; Judy Taylor, ed., (1998) ''Beatrix Potter\u2019s Farming Friendship. Lake District Letters to Joseph Moscrop, 1926\u20131943''.</ref>\n\nBy the late 1920s Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders\u2019 Association, the first time a woman had ever been elected, but died before taking office.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 381\u2013404</ref>\n\n==Lake District conservation==\nPotter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley]], the first secretary and founding member of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]]. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. She was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the [[Herdwick sheep]], but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the [[Tarn Hows]]. Potter was the ''de facto'' estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to buy most of the property back from her. Her stewardship of these farms earned her wide regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of [[afforestation]], preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with [[Galloway cattle]].\n[[File:Derwent Water, Lake District, Cumbria - June 2009.jpg|thumb|Lake District]]\n\n==Later life==\nPotter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'', a fanciful tale set in her beloved [[Troutbeck Tongue|Troutbeck fells]]. It was published only in the US during Potter's lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. ''Sister Anne'', Potter's version of the story of [[Bluebeard]], was written especially for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, ''Wag by Wall'', was published posthumously by ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the [[Girl Guides]], whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.<ref>Jane Morse, ed., (1982) ''Beatrix Potter's Americans: Selected Letters''; Susan Denyer, (2000) ''At Home with Beatrix Potter: The Creator of Peter Rabbit''.</ref>\n\nPotter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of [[World War II]]. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William's large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband's brothers and sisters.<ref>Heelis, ''Mrs. William Heelis''; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''.</ref>\n\nPotter died of complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[heart disease]] on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at [[Carleton Crematorium and Cemetery|Carleton Crematorium]]. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over {{convert|4000|acre|km2}} of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the [[Lake District National Park]] and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in [[Swindon]] was named \"Heelis\" in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the eighteen months he survived her. When he died in August 1945 he left the remainder to the National Trust.<ref>Lear 2007, pp. 405\u2013440; Taylor, ed., ''Beatrix Potter's Letters''; Taylor, et al., ''The Artist and Her World''.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Goody and Mrs. Hackee.jpg|thumb|left|Goody and Mrs. Hackee, illustration to ''The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes'', 1911]]\nPotter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne & Co, now a division of the [[Penguin Group]].  On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in [[Hawkshead]], also owned by the National Trust as the [[Beatrix Potter Gallery]].<ref>Bruce L.

of [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and [[free trade]] [[Peelite]]s and [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] favourable to the ideals of the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s in the 1850s. By the end of the 19th century, it had formed four governments under [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]. Despite being divided over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], the party returned to government in 1905 and then won [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|a landslide victory]] in the following year's general election.\n\nUnder [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]s [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (1905\u20131908) and [[H. H. Asquith]] (1908\u20131916), the Liberal Party passed the [[Liberal welfare reforms|welfare reforms]] that created a basic British [[welfare state]]. Although Asquith was [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|the party's leader]], its dominant figure was [[David Lloyd George]]. Asquith was overwhelmed by the [[World War I|wartime]] role of [[Asquith coalition ministry|coalition]] Prime Minister and Lloyd George replaced him as Prime Minister in late 1916, but Asquith remained as Liberal Party leader. The pair fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process.<ref>Michael Fry, \"Political Change in Britain, August 1914 to December 1916: Lloyd George Replaces Asquith: The Issues Underlying the Drama.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#3 (1988): 609-627.</ref> Historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] in ''The Oxford Companion to British History'' argues:\n:Lloyd George made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system (especially medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions, largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land). Furthermore, in foreign affairs, he played a leading role in winning the First World War, redrawing the map of Europe at the peace conference, and partitioning Ireland.<ref>[[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]], \"Lloyd George, David, 1st Earl Lloyd-George\" in {{cite book|editor1=John Cannon |editorlink1 = John Cannon (historian)| editor2 = Robert Crowcroft|title=The Oxford Companion to British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PM9xCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA565|year=2015|page=565}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lloyd George ministry|government of Lloyd George]] was dominated by the Conservative Party, which finally deposed him in 1922. By the end of the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rival. The party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections. Apart from notable [[by-election]] victories, its fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in 1981. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], its share of the vote fell below 23% and the Liberal and Social Democratic parties merged in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. A splinter group reconstituted the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] in 1989. It was formed by party members opposed to the merger who saw the Liberal Democrats diluting Liberal ideals.\n\nProminent intellectuals associated with the Liberal Party include the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and social planner [[William Beveridge]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:palmerston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Viscount Palmerston]]]]\nThe Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who had their origins in an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] faction in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the early 19th century [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]]. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of [[democracy]] for its own sake. The great figures of reformist [[Whiggism|Whiggery]] were [[Charles James Fox]] (died 1806) and his disciple and successor [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] in 1832.\n\nThe Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the [[middle class]]es to the franchise and to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] led eventually to the development of a systematic middle class liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement, the party was led first by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], a fairly traditional Whig, and then by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a renegade Irish [[Tory]] and essentially a [[conservatism|conservative]], although capable of radical gestures.\n\nAs early as 1839, Russell had adopted the name of \"Liberals\", but in reality his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the [[House of Lords]] and Radicals in the Commons. The leading Radicals were [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the [[Church of England]] (many Liberals were [[Nonconformism|Nonconformists]]), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business) and above all [[free trade]]. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.\n\nIn 1841, the Liberals lost office to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] under [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], but their period in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a free trade issue; and a faction known as the [[Peelite]]s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after) defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston and the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a reforming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.\n\nHowever, the Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the \"Two Terrible Old Men\", Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the [[National Liberal Federation]] in 1877. The philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] was also a Liberal MP from 1865 to 1868.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/mill_john_stuart.shtml|title=John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Gladstonian era ===\n[[File:Acgladstone2.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Ewart Gladstone]]]]\nFor the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] served as prime minister four times (1868\u201374, 1880\u201385, 1886, and 1892\u201394). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the [[working class]] and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy.<ref>J. P. Parry, ''Democracy and Religion: Gladstone and the Liberal Party, 1867\u20131875'' (1989) p. 174.</ref> His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.<ref>H. C. G. Matthew, \"Gladstone, William Ewart (1809\u20131898)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004).</ref><ref>J. L. Hammond and M. R. D. Foot, ''Gladstone and Liberalism'' (1952).</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of imperialism. For example, he ordered the occupation of [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] by British forces in 1882.<ref>R. C. Mowat, \"From Liberalism to Imperialism: The Case of Egypt 1875-1887\", ''Historical Journal'' 16#1 (1973), pp. 109\u2013124 focus on Lord Cromer as a Liberal imperialist. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637918 online].</ref> His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the [[rule of law]] was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a [[Bismarckian]] system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, ''British foreign and imperial policy, 1865\u20131919'' (2000) p. 21.</ref>\n\nAs Prime Minister from 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs and Radicals. He was now a spokesman for \"peace, economy and reform\". One major achievement was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Act of 1870]], which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|pages=56\u201357|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nRegarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he [[Irish Land Acts|ended centuries of landlord oppression]], and the [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablishment]] of the (Anglican) [[Church of Ireland]] through the [[Irish Church Act 1869]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom general election, 1874|1874 general election]] Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the [[Midlothian campaign]]. The Liberals won a large majority in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 election]]. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.\n\n==== Ireland and Home Rule ====\nAmong the consequences of the [[Third Reform Act]] (1884) was the giving of the vote to many Catholics in Ireland. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]] the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded [[Irish Home Rule]] as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong [[Liberal Unionist]] faction led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it. The Irish Home Rule bill gave all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a rescue operation for the landed elite.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, \"The Liberal Party and Gladstone's Land Purchase Bill of 1886. Historical Journal 1989 32(3): 627\u2013641 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2639536 in JSTOR].</ref>\n\nThe result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|1886 election]] at the hands of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.\n\n==== The Newcastle Programme ====\n{{main|The Newcastle Programme}}\nHistorically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. Following the Queen, High Society in London largely ostracized home rulers and Liberal clubs were badly split. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party called Liberal Unionism on the Irish issue. It collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party.<ref>[[R. C. K. Ensor]], ''England 1870-1914'' (1936) pp. 206\u2013207.</ref><ref>Peter Fraser, \"The Liberal Unionist Alliance: Chamberlain, Hartington, and the Conservatives, 1886-1904.\" ''English Historical Review'' 77#302 (1962): 53\u201378.</ref> The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted [[The Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24\u201326}}</ref>\n\n==== Relations with trade unions ====\nA major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates, in the absence of any committed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received sponsorship and endorsement from [[trade union]]s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|page=74|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==== Reform policies ====\nA broad range of interventionist reforms were introduced by the 1892\u20131895 Liberal government. Amongst other measures, standards of accommodation and of teaching in schools were improved, factory inspection was made more stringent, and ministers used their powers to increase the wages and reduce the working hours of large numbers of male workers employed by the state.<ref>[[Kenneth O. Morgan]], ''The Age of Lloyd George: Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890-1929''.</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHistorian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:\n:Notable as the Gladstonian reforms had been, they had almost all remained within the nineteenth-century Liberal tradition of gradually removing the religious, economic, and political barriers that prevented men of varied creeds and classes from exercising their individual talents in order to improve themselves and their society. As the third quarter of the century drew to a close, the essential bastions of Victorianism still held firm: respectability; a government of aristocrats and gentlemen now influenced not only by middle-class merchants and manufacturers but also by industrious working people; a prosperity that seemed to rest largely on the tenets of laissez-faire economics; and a Britannia that ruled the waves and many a dominion beyond.<ref>Walter L. Arnstein, ''Britain Yesterday and Today: 1832 the Present'' (6th ed. 1992) p. 125.</ref>\n\n=== After Gladstone ===\nGladstone finally retired in 1894. Gladstone's support for Home Rule deeply divided the party, and it lost its upper and upper-middle-class base, while keeping support among Protestant nonconformists and the Celtic fringe. Historian [[R. C. K. Ensor]] reports that after 1886, the main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class members. High prestige London clubs that had a Liberal base were deeply split. Ensor notes that, \"London society, following the known views of the Queen, practically ostracized home rulers.\" <ref>R. C. K. Ensor, ''England 1870\u20131914'' (1936) p 207.</ref>\n\nThe new Liberal leader was the ineffectual [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]].

Many Conservatives (including Winston Churchill) had recently protested against high tariff moves by the Conservatives by switching to the anti-tariff Liberal camp, but it was unclear how many old Conservative traits they brought along, especially on military and naval issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=F.

The working class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging Labour Party.  One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics. All Liberals were outraged when Conservatives used their majority in the House of Lords to block reform legislation.<ref>R. C. K.

The policies of the New Liberalism are now known as [[social liberalism]].<ref>[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).</ref>\n\n[[File:ChurchillGeorge0001.jpg|thumb|Liberal politicians [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]] enacted the 1909 [[People's Budget]] which specifically aimed at the redistribution of wealth]]\nThe New Liberals included intellectuals like [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse|L. T. Hobhouse]], and [[John A. Hobson]]. They saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favourable social and economic circumstances.<ref name=\"adams\">{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}</ref> In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.<ref>''The Routledge encyclopaedia of philosophy,'' (2016) p. 599 [https://www.rep.routledge.com/ online].</ref>\n\nAfter the historic 1906 victory, the Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on range of issues, including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]]. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The [[People's Budget]] of 1909, championed by [[David Lloyd George]] and fellow Liberal [[Winston Churchill]], introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies.<ref>Geoffrey Lee - [http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf \"The People's Budget: An Edwardian Tragedy\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182535/http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf|date=5 March 2012}}</ref> It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, high incomes, and land -- taxation that disproportionately affected the rich. The new money was to be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his [[National Insurance Act]], making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920|Unemployment Insurance Act]].<ref>Bentley Gilbert, \"David Lloyd George: Land, The Budget, and Social Reform,\" ''American Historical Review'' 81#5 (1976), pp. 1058\u20131066 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1852870 in JSTOR].</ref>\n\nHistorian Peter Weiler argues:\n:Although still partially informed by older Liberal concerns for character, self-reliance, and the capitalist market, this legislation nevertheless, marked a significant shift in Liberal approaches to the state and social reform, approaches that later governments would slowly expand and that would grow into the welfare state after the Second World War. What was new in these reforms was the underlying assumption that the state could be a positive force, that the measure of individual freedom... was not how much the state left people alone, but whether it gave them the capacity to fill themselves as individuals.<ref>Peter Weiler, \"New Liberalism\" in Fred M. Leventhal, ed., ''Twentieth-century Britain: an encyclopedia'' (Garland, 1995) pp 564-65.</ref><ref>Peter Weiler, ''The New Liberalism: Liberal Social Theory in Great Britain, 1889-1914'' (2016)</ref>\n\nContrasting Old Liberalism with New Liberalism, David Lloyd George noted in a 1908 speech the following:\n:[Old Liberals] used the natural discontent of the people with the poverty and precariousness of the means of subsistence as a motive power to win for them a better, more influential, and more honourable status in the citizenship of their native land. The new Liberalism, while pursuing this great political ideal with unflinching energy, devotes a part of its endeavour also to the removing of the immediate causes of discontent. It is true that man cannot live by bread alone. It is equally true that a man cannot live without bread.<ref>See [http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/history/the-new-liberalism/ text]</ref>\n\n=== Liberal zenith ===\n{{main|Liberal welfare reforms}}\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1906.svg|thumb|The results of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 election]]]]\n[[File:Ten Years of Toryism.jpg|thumb|left|Liberal poster c. 1905\u20131910, clockwise from the left: [[Joseph Chamberlain]] abandons his commitment to old age pensions; Chancellor [[Austen Chamberlain]] threatens duties on consumer items which had been removed by Gladstone (in the picture on the wall); Chinese indentured labour in South Africa; [[John Bull]] contemplates his vote; and Joseph Chamberlain and [[Arthur Balfour]] (who favoured retaliatory tariffs) wearing top hats]]\nThe Liberals languished in opposition for a decade while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power. The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, [[John Morley]]. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal figures H. H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's \"methods of barbarism\" in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, [[Arthur Balfour]], pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as the [[Education Act 1902]] and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs.\n\nCampbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|the greatest election victory]] in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right.<ref>Goldman, Lawrence. \"Oxford DNB theme: The general election of 1906\" [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95348.html online].</ref><ref>A.K.

Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died soon after. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism. Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer, and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by [[Winston Churchill]], a recent defector from the Conservatives.\n\n[[File:Asquith Q 42036.jpg|thumb|[[H.

This included the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and welfare.\n\n[[File:Punch cartoon 28 April 1909.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Cartoonist [[John Bernard Partridge]] depicts Lloyd George as a giant with a cudgel labelled \"Budget\" in reference to his [[People's Budget]] while Asquith cowers beneath the table, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 28 April 1909]]\nA political battle erupted over the [[People's Budget]] and resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalists]].\n\nAs a result, Asquith was forced to introduce a new [[Third Home Rule Act|third Home Rule bill]] in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's [[Ulster Volunteers]] led by Sir [[Edward Carson]], launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] and the threat of mass resignation of their commissions by army officers in Ireland in 1914 (''see [[Curragh Incident]]''). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Bonar Law]], was of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Historian [[George Dangerfield]] has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, before the war broke out, so weakened the Liberal coalition that it marked the ''[[Strange Death of Liberal England]]''.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910-1914'' (1935)</ref> However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.\n\n=== Decline ===\n{{further|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|David Lloyd George}}\nThe Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for measures that the Party had long  rejected.  The result was the permanent destruction of ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government.  Historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] explains the dilemma:\n: [T]he Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion. [...] Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship,  the [[Defence of the Realm Act]], severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives [...] had no such misgivings.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Decline of Power: 1915-1964'' (1985), p. 3.</ref>\n\nBlake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of ''realpolitik'' and the balance of power.<ref>Blake, ''The Decline of Power'' (1985), p. 3.</ref> However, Lloyd George and Churchill were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out. \n\nAsquith was blamed for the poor British performance in first year. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Conservatives, there were heavy partisan attacks. However, even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the ''Manchester Guardian'' complained:\n:The fact that the Government has not dared to challenge the nation to rise above itself, is one among many signs. [...] The war is, in fact, not being taken seriously. [...] How can any slacker be blamed when the Government itself is slack.<ref>''Manchester Guardian'' 1 May 1915, editorial, in {{cite book|author=Trevor Wilson|title=The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914-1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PyvNxXVMg4C&pg=PT37|year=1966|page=51}}</ref>\n\nAsquith's Liberal government was brought down in {{Nowrap|May 1915}}, due in particular to a [[Shell Crisis of 1915|crisis in inadequate artillery shell production]] and the protest resignation of [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] over the disastrous  [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on 25 May, with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist (Conservative) party]], along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half, and was the last time Liberals controlled the government.<ref>Barry McGill, \"Asquith's Predicament, 1914\u20131918.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 39.3 (1967): 283\u2013303. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1876582 in JSTOR]</ref> The analysis of historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, But on all sides there was growing distrust for the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues:<ref>{{cite book|author=A.J.P. Taylor|title=English History, 1914-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb0RDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|year=1965|page=17}}</ref>\n:The Unionists, by and large, regarded Germany as a dangerous rival, and rejoiced at the chance to destroy her. They meant to fight a hard-headed war by ruthless methods; they condemned Liberal 'softness' before the war and now. The Liberals insisted on remaining high-minded. Many of them had come to support the war only when the Germans invaded Belgium. [...] Entering the war for idealistic motives, the Liberals wished to fight it by noble means and found it harder to abandon their principles than to endure defeat in the field. \n\nThe 1915 coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became Prime Minister at the head of a new coalition largely made up of Conservatives.<ref>Kenneth O.

He insisted on strong government controls over business as opposed to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitudes of traditional Liberals. He insisted on conscription of young men into the Army, a position that deeply troubled his old colleagues. That brought him and a few like-minded Liberals into the new coalition on the ground long occupied by Conservatives. There was no more planning for world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfit with aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the party, says historian Trevor Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal performance.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914-1935'' (1966) pp. 23\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|David Lloyd George]]\nIn the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 general election]], Lloyd George, hailed as \"the Man Who Won the War\", led his coalition into a [[khaki election]]. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law]] wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates\u2014this \"[[The Coalition Coupon|coupon]]\", as it became known, was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. The coalition won a massive victory as the Asquithian Liberals and  Labour were decimated. Those remaining Liberal MPs who were opposed to the Coalition Government went into opposition under the parliamentary leadership of [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] who also became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Asquith, who had appointed MacLean, remained as overall Leader of the Liberal Party even though he lost his seat in 1918. Asquith returned to parliament in 1920 and resumed leadership. Between 1919-1923, the anti-Lloyd George  Liberals were called Asquithian Liberals, [[Wee Free]] Liberals<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beaverbrook|first1=Lord|title=The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George|date=1963|publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce|location=New York|pages=290-291|edition=first|url=https://archive.org/stream/declineandfallof006894mbp#page/n319/mode/2up/search/wee|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> or [[Independent Liberal Party (UK, 1918)|Independent Liberals]].<ref>Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970''.</ref>\n\nLloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party who numerically dominated the coalition. In 1922, the Conservative backbenchers [[Carlton Club meeting|rebelled]] against the continuation of the coalition, citing in particular Lloyd George's plan for war with Turkey in the [[Chanak Crisis]], and his corrupt sale of honours. He resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by [[Bonar Law]].\n\nAt the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 elections]] the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922, Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]] but made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour\u2014a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. However, instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense, but it was a fatal error.\n\n[[File:UK popular vote.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Share of the vote received by Conservatives (blue), Whigs/Liberals/Liberal Democrats (orange), Labour (red) and others (grey) in general elections since 1832<ref>Table 2.01 \"Summary Results of General Elections 1832\u20132005 (UK)\", ''British electoral facts, 1832\u20132006'', by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, 7th edition, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-2712-8}}, p. 59.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/|title=Election 2010 Results|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> shows that following success as the successor to the Whig party, the party's share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberals]]\nLabour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was forced into a [[united Kingdom general election, 1924|snap election in 1924]] and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour. Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], were the sons of Liberal MPs.\n\nAsquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]], he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', largely written for him by the Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast, most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the [[Celtic fringe]], where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]], but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars, 1918\u20131940'' (1955).</ref>\n\nThe last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906. The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Irish Home Rule]] movement. After the carnage of 1914\u20131918, the democratic reforms of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its [[First Labour Government (UK)|first minority government in 1924]].<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965).</ref>\n\n=== Splits over the National Government ===\n[[File:Gws samuel 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]]]\nIn 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart in response to the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the Liberals agreed to join his [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|only a few MPs and candidates followed]]. Another group under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk \u2013 the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]] (officially the \"National Liberals\" after 1947) led by Simon, also known as \"Simonites\", and the \"Samuelites\" or \"official Liberals\", led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.\n\nThe official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to [[protectionism]]. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the [[Ottawa Conference|Ottawa Agreement]] on [[Imperial Preference]]. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]], just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|independent Liberals]]. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as [[Clement Davies]], who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during [[World War II]] and who would lead it after the war.\n\n=== Near extinction ===\nSamuel had lost his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 election]] and the leadership of the party fell to [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]]. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the [[appeasement]] foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the [[Midlothian Campaign]] and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.\n\nIn 1940, they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as [[Secretary of State for Air]], the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the [[War Cabinet]]; some leading party members founded [[Radical Action]], a group which called for liberal candidates to break the [[war-time electoral pact]].<ref>Chris Cook, ''A Short History of the Liberal Party: 1900 - 2001'', pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1945_over.stm|title=1945: Labour landslide buries Churchill|work=The election battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> but this was just the beginning of the decline. In [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]], the general election saw the Liberals return just nine MPs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1950_over.stm|title=1950: Labour limps home|work=The election battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> Another [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|general election was called in 1951]] and the Liberals were left with just six MPs and all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1951_over.stm|title=1951: Churchill's return|work=The election battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party, which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader [[Megan Lloyd George]] as its own candidate. The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.\n\n=== Liberal revival ===\n[[File:Jo Grimond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Jo Grimond]]]]\nThrough the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]], local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. [[Jo Grimond]], for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the [[Orpington by-election, 1962|Orpington by-election]] of March 1962 which was won by [[Eric Reginald Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Eric Lubbock]]. There, the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.\n\nThe Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the [[European Economic Community]]. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.\n\nThe new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote, but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although [[Emlyn Hooson]] held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon [[Clement Davies]] death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966, the [[Welsh Liberal Party]] formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.<ref>Russell Deacon (2011) History of the Welsh Liberal party, Welsh Academic Press</ref>\n\nIn local elections, [[Liverpool]] remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the [[United Kingdom local elections, 1973|elections]] to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jeffery|first=David|date=2017-08-01|title=The strange death of Tory Liverpool: Conservative electoral decline in Liverpool, 1945\u20131996|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41293-016-0032-6|journal=British Politics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=386\u2013407|doi=10.1057/s41293-016-0032-6|issn=1746-918X}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the [[Home Office]] if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing [[proportional representation]] and a change of Prime Minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead a minority Labour government was formed under [[Harold Wilson]] but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]], the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.\n\nThorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations that he attempted to have his homosexual lover murdered by a hitman. The party's new leader, [[David Steel]], negotiated the [[Lib-Lab pact]] with Wilson's successor as Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]]. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of [[proportional representation]] was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson [[John Pardoe]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], who were mutually antagonistic.\n\n=== Alliance and Liberal Democrats ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|upright=0.7|The symbol of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats]] -->\n{{main article|SDP-Liberal Alliance|Liberal Democrats (UK)}}\nThe Conservative Party under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.\n\nIn 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]] and [[Shirley Williams]], founded the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). The new party and the Liberals quickly formed the SDP-Liberal Alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. Indeed, Steel was so confident of an Alliance victory that he told the 1981 Liberal conference, \"Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Conference season's greatest hits|date=10 September 2003|accessdate=7 April 2010|first=Ollie|last=Stone-Lee}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Alliance was overtaken in the polls by the Tories in the aftermath of the [[Falkland Islands War]] and at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] the Conservatives were re-elected by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition. While the SDP-Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%), it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour's 209.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn and Christine F.

In the election's aftermath Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader [[David Owen]] objected and continued to lead a \"rump\" SDP.\n\nIn March 1988, the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to create the Social and Liberal Democrats, renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=SDP: Breaking the mould|date=25 January 2001}}</ref> Over two-thirds of the members and all the serving MPs of the Liberal Party joined this party, led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Barberis|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&pg=PA302|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|pages=301\u20133|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nA group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats, including [[Michael Meadowcroft]] (the former Liberal MP for Leeds West) and Paul Wiggin (who served on [[Local government in Peterborough|Peterborough City Council]] as a Liberal), continued with a new party organisation under the old name of \"the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]]\". Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007.\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|A crowd waits outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 general elections]]]]\nDuring the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called [[classical liberalism]], supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies such as [[free trade]] and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed [[Gladstonian liberalism]] after the [[Victorian era]] Liberal Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of [[the Crown]] and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformism|nonconformists]]) and an extension of the electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about [[liberalism]] in 1872: <blockquote>If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this\u2014that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world. [...] It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.<ref>''The Times'' (31 December 1872), p. 5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe political terms of \"modern\", \"progressive\" or \"new\" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.<ref>W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume II: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 143.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Liberals stance began to shift towards \"New Liberalism\", what would today be called [[social liberalism]], namely a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of [[welfare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/higher/history/liberal/impact1_rev.shtml|title=Education Scotland \u2013 Higher Bitesize Revision \u2013 History \u2013 Liberal \u2013 Impact: Revision 1|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of [[H.

Relatively few MPs were dissenters. However the Dissenters were a major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands.<ref>Henry Pelling, ''Social Geography of British Elections, 1885-1910'' (London, 1967) 89-90, 206.</ref> They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Down to the 1830s, Dissenters demanded removal of [[political and civil disabilities]] that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. Numerous reforms of voting rights, especially that of 1832, increased the political power of Dissenters. They demanded an end to compulsory church rates, in which local taxes went only to Anglican churches. They finally achieved the end of religious tests for university degrees in 1905. Gladstone brought the majority of dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Roman Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement. The [[nonconformist conscience]], as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy.<ref>D. W. Bebbington, ''The Nonconformist Conscience: Chapel and Politics, 1870-1914'' (George Allen & Unwin, 1982).</ref> In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.<ref>David L. Wykes, \"Introduction: Parliament and Dissent from the Restoration to the Twentieth Century\", ''Parliamentary History'' (2005) 24#1 pp 1\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the 1820s, the different Nonconformists, including [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]], Baptists, Congregationalists and Unitarians, had formed the Committee of Dissenting Deputies and agitated for repeal of the highly restrictive [[Test and Corporation Acts]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Angus Hawkins|title=Victorian Political Culture: 'Habits of Heart and Mind'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PcJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|year=2015|publisher=Oxford UP|page=84}}</ref> These Acts excluded Nonconformists from holding civil or military office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, compelling them to set up their own [[Dissenting Academies]] privately.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever? The political geography of Liberal voting in Great Britain\", ''Political Geography'' (2002) 21#4 pp 421\u2013447.</ref> The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] tended to be in favour of these Acts and so the Nonconformist cause was linked closely to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who advocated civil and religious liberty. After the Test and Corporation Acts were [[Sacramental Test Act 1828|repealed in 1828]], all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals. Nonconformists were angered by the [[Education Act 1902]], which integrated Church of England denominational schools into the state system and provided for their support from taxes. [[John Clifford (minister)|John Clifford]] formed the National Passive Resistance Committee and by 1906 over 170 Nonconformists had gone to prison for refusing to pay school taxes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2011|p=66}}</ref> They included 60 [[Primitive Methodists]], 48 Baptists, 40 Congregationalists and 15 Wesleyan Methodists.\n\nThe political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularisation of British society in the 20th century. The rise of the Labour Party reduced the Liberal Party strongholds into the nonconformist and remote \"Celtic Fringe\", where the party survived by an emphasis on localism and historic religious identity, thereby neutralising much of the class pressure on behalf of the Labour movement.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever?

Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base [[interest rate]], which is decided by the [[Monetary Policy Committee]], and through its communications strategy, such as publishing [[yield curve]]s.<ref>Bank of England \u2013 Yield Curves by [[Internet Archive]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20110421034658/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yieldcurve/]</ref>\n\n:Maintaining financial stability involves protecting against threats to the whole financial system. Threats are detected by the Bank's surveillance and market intelligence functions. The threats are then dealt with through financial and other operations, both at home and abroad. In exceptional circumstances, the Bank may act as the [[lender of last resort]] by extending credit when no other institution will.\nThe Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:\n* [[HM Treasury]], the Government department responsible for financial and economic policy; and\n* Other central banks and international organisations, with the aim of improving the international financial system.\nThe 1997 [[memorandum of understanding]] describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between the HM Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203101708/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financialstability/mou.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 2010 the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank.

It also manages the country's [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] and [[gold reserves]]. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.\n\nThe Bank has a monopoly on the issue of [[banknote]]s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to [[De La Rue]] in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2003/041.htm|publisher=Bank of England|title=Sale of Bank Note Printing|accessdate=10 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[Monetary Policy Committee]] (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new [[Debt Management Office]], which also took over government cash management in 2000. [[Computershare]] took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds ([[gilt-edged security|gilt-edged securities]] or ''gilts'') from the Bank at the end of 2004.\n\nThe Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.\n\nIn 2011 the interim [[Financial Policy Committee]] (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.\n\nTo help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report,<ref>[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211185350/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/fsr/ |date=11 February 2012 }}</ref> and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public.

Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).<ref name=\"APF\"/>\n\n==Banknote issues==\n{{Main article|Bank of England note issues}}\nThe Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were \"White Notes\", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in \u00a31 and \u00a32 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between \u00a35 and \u00a31000.\n\nUntil the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u00a32 note issued by Evans, Jones, Davies & Co|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118104053/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/others/%c2%a32_note_issued_by_evans,_jones.aspx|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Bank Charter Act 1844]] began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was [[Fox, Fowler and Company]] in 1921.<ref name=banknote-history>{{cite web|title=A brief history of banknotes|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/about/scottish_northernireland.htm|website=Bank of England website|accessdate=31 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=fox-note>{{cite web|title=Fox, Fowler & Co. \u00a35 note|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%C2%A35_not.aspx|publisher=British Museum|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002040119/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/f/fox,_fowler__co_%c2%a35_not.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|banknotes]], regulated by the Bank.<ref name=scot-ni/>\n\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], the [[Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914]] was passed, which granted temporary powers to [[HM Treasury]] for issuing banknotes to the values of \u00a31 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of [[George V|King George V]] (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:\n\n{{quotation|''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND \u2013 Currency notes are Legal Tender for the payment of any amount \u2013 Issued by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury under the Authority of Act of Parliament (4 & 5 Geo.

The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above \u00a35 to be removed from circulation.\n\nIn 2006, over \u00a353&nbsp;million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was [[Securitas depot robbery|stolen from a depot]] in [[Tonbridge, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4756454.stm|title=Record \u00a353m stolen in depot raid|accessdate=14 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nModern banknotes are printed by contract with [[De La Rue]] Currency in [[Loughton, Essex]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/pages/about/production.aspx|title=Banknote Production|last=|first=|date=|website=bankofengland.co.uk|publisher=Bank of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004155/http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/production.aspx|archive-date=10 March 2012|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Gold vault==\nThe Bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries.

Before 1797, banknotes issued by the Bank of England were required to be convertible into specie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fff.org/explore-freedom/article/economic-ideas-david-ricardo-wealth-making-paper-money-inflation-free-society/|title=Economic Ideas: David Ricardo on Wealth, Inflation, and Freedom - The Future of Freedom Foundation|website=www.fff.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref> In the end, Ricardo won with his recommendation to return to convertibility to prevent further conflicts and to ensure price stability. The suspension remained in effect until 1821.

It began with the heating of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst such as hydrochloric acid, [[zinc chloride]], or the base ammonia. This created a liquid condensation product, referred to as ''Bakelite A'', which was soluble in alcohol, acetone, or additional phenol. Heated further, the product became partially soluble and could still be softened by heat. Sustained heating resulted in an \"insoluble hard gum\". However, the high temperatures required to create this tended to cause violent foaming of the mixture, which resulted in the cooled material being porous and breakable. Baekeland's innovative step was to put his \"last condensation product\" into an egg-shaped \"Bakelizer\". By heating it under pressure, at about {{convert|150|C|F|-1}}, Baekeland was able to suppress the foaming that would otherwise occur. The resulting substance was extremely hard and both infusible and insoluble.<ref name=CookSlessor/>{{rp|67}} <ref name=\"Meikle\"/>{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Weigh Room Liquid Materials 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p12.tif | Weigh room\nFile:Still room 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p12.tif | Still room\nFile:Bakelite Cooling Room 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p13.tif | Cooling room\nFile:Resin and Varnish inspection laboratory 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p17.tif | Resin and varnish inspection laboratory\nFile:Test samples 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p17.tif | Testing resin samples\nFile:Resin and Varnish Development Laboratory 1935 Bakelite Review Silver Anniversary p17.tif | Development laboratory\n</gallery>\n\n===Compression molding===\n[[File:RotorBakelite-2.jpg|thumb|Bakelite [[distributor]] rotor]]\nMolded Bakelite forms in a condensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde, with wood flour or asbestos fiber as a filler, under high pressure and heat in a time frame of a few minutes of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]].

This was long before the [[New World]] genus ''[[Phaseolus]]'' was known in Europe. After Columbian-era contact between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of ''Phaseolus'', such as the [[common bean]] and the [[runner bean]], and the related genus ''[[Vigna]]''. The term has long been applied generally to many other seeds of similar form,<ref name=\"MW_Collegiate\"/><ref name=\"AHD\">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> such as Old World [[soybean]]s, [[pea]]s, [[chickpea]]s (garbanzo beans), other [[Vicia|vetches]], and [[Lupinus|lupins]], and even to those with slighter resemblances, such as [[coffee bean]]s, [[vanilla|vanilla beans]], [[Ricinus|castor beans]], and [[cocoa bean]]s. Thus the term \"bean\" in general [[usage]] can mean a host of different species.<ref name=FAOdef>{{cite web|title=Definition And Classification Of Commodities (See Chapter 4)|publisher=FAO, United Nations|year=1994|url=http://www.fao.org/es/faodef/faodefe.htm}}</ref>\n\nSeeds called \"beans\" are often included among the crops called \"pulses\" ([[legume]]s),<ref name=\"MW_Collegiate\"/> although a narrower [[linguistic prescription|prescribed]] sense of \"pulses\" reserves the word for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain. The term ''bean'' usually excludes legumes with tiny seeds and which are used exclusively for [[forage]], [[hay]], and [[silage]] purposes (such as [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]]). According to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] the term \"BEANS, DRY\" (item code 176)<ref name=FAOdef/> should include only species of ''Phaseolus''; however, enforcing that [[linguistic prescription|prescription]] has proven difficult for several reasons. One is that in the past, several species, including ''Vigna angularis'' (adzuki bean), ''mungo'' ([[black gram]]), ''radiata'' ([[green gram]]), and ''aconitifolia'' ([[moth bean]]), were classified as ''Phaseolus'' and later reclassified. Another is that it is not surprising that the prescription on limiting the use of the word, because it tries to replace the word's older senses with a newer one, has never been consistently followed in general [[usage]].<ref>[[Merriam-Webster]] [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bean BEAN] </ref><ref>[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] [https://www.britannica.com/plant/bean Bean] </ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Field beans near Pendomer - geograph.org.uk - 1463701.jpg|thumb|right|Field beans (broad beans, ''[[Vicia faba]]''), ready for harvest]]\nUnlike the closely related pea, beans are a summer crop that need warm temperatures to grow.

The corn would not be planted in rows as is done by European agriculture, but in a checkerboard/hex fashion across a field, in separate patches of one to six stalks each.\n\n:Beans would be planted around the base of the developing stalks, and would vine their way up as the stalks grew. All American beans at that time were vine plants, \"bush beans\" having been bred only more recently. The cornstalks would work as a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] for the beans, and the beans would provide much-needed [[nitrogen]] for the corn.\n\n:Squash would be planted in the spaces between the patches of corn in the field. They would be provided slight shelter from the sun by the corn, would shade the soil and reduce evaporation, and would deter many animals from attacking the corn and beans because their coarse, hairy vines and broad, stiff leaves are difficult or uncomfortable for animals such as deer and raccoons to walk through, crows to land on, etc.\n\nDry beans come from both Old World varieties of broad beans (fava beans) and New World varieties (kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy/haricot).\n\nBeans are a [[heliotropic]] plant, meaning that the leaves tilt throughout the day to face the sun. At night, they go into a folded \"sleep\" position.\n\n==Types==\nCurrently, the world genebanks hold about 40,000 bean varieties, although only a fraction are mass-produced for regular consumption.<ref>Laura McGinnis and Jan Suszkiw, ARS.

The [[nipple]] of the breast is surrounded by the [[areola]] (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30&nbsp;mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4\u201318 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues ([[collagen]], [[elastin]]), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the [[peripheral nervous system]] innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth [[intercostal nerves]]. The T-4 nerve ([[Thoracic spinal nerve 4]]), which innervates the [[dermatomic area]], supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.<ref name=grabowski>{{cite book |first1 = Gerard J. |last1 = Tortora |first2 = Sandra Reynolds |last2 = Grabowski |title = Introduction to the Human Body: the Essentials of Anatomy and Physiology |date = 2001 |publisher = J.

The [[axillary lymph node]]s include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central [[axillary lymph nodes]] and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to [[oncology]] because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can [[Metastasis|metastasize]] (break away) from a [[tumour]] and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.\n\n=== Shape, texture, and support ===\n\nThe morphologic variations in the size, shape, volume, tissue density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant. The size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normal-life hormonal changes (thelarche, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause) and medical conditions (e.g. [[virginal breast hypertrophy]]).<ref name=wood>{{cite journal |vauthors = Wood K, Cameron M, Fitzgerald K |title = Breast Size, Bra Fit and Thoracic Pain in Young Women: A Correlational Study |journal = Chiropractic & Osteopathy |volume = 16 |issue =  |page = 1 |year = 2008 |pmid = 18339205 |pmc = 2275741 |doi = 10.1186/1746-1340-16-1 }}</ref> The shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments, the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest, and by the skin envelope.

The breasts become larger, the nipple-areola complex becomes larger and darker, the [[Montgomery's glands]] enlarge, and veins sometimes become more visible. Breast tenderness during pregnancy is common, especially during the first trimester. By mid-pregnancy, the breast is physiologically capable of lactation and some women can express [[colostrum]], a form of breast milk.{{sfn | Lawrence | 2016 | p=58}}\n\nPregnancy causes elevated levels of the hormone [[prolactin]], which has a key role in the production of milk. However, milk production is blocked by the hormones [[progesterone]] and [[estrogen]] until after delivery, when progesterone and estrogen levels plummet.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\"/>\n\n===Menopause===\n\nAt menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from [[Adverse effect|adverse side effect]]<nowiki/>s of [[combined oral contraceptive pill]]s. The size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to [[body weight|weight]] fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often recorded in the [[stretch marks]] of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n== Breastfeeding ==\n{{Main|Breastfeeding}}\n\nThe primary function of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the nourishing of an infant with [[breast milk]]. Milk is produced in milk-secreting cells in the alveoli. When the breasts are stimulated by the suckling of her baby, the mother's brain secretes [[oxytocin]]. High levels of oxytocin trigger the contraction of muscle cells surrounding the alveoli, causing milk to flow along the ducts that connect the alveoli to the nipple.<ref name=\"NCBI Bookshelf 2008\">{{cite web | title=The physiological basis of breastfeeding | website=NCBI Bookshelf | date=November 5, 2008 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK148970/ | access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFull-term newborns have an instinct and a need to suck on a nipple, and breastfed babies nurse for both nutrition and for comfort.{{sfn|Lawrence|2016|p=201}}  Breast milk provides all necessary nutrients for the first six months of life, and then remains an important source of nutrition, alongside solid foods, until at least one or two years of age.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n{{Main|Breast disease}}\n\nThe breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are [[puerperal mastitis]], [[fibrocystic breast changes]] and [[mastalgia]].\n\n[[Lactation]] unrelated to pregnancy is known as  [[galactorrhea]]. It can be caused by certain drugs (such as [[antipsychotic]] medications), extreme physical stress, or [[endocrine]] disorders. Lactation in newborns is caused by hormones from the mother that crossed into the baby's bloodstream during pregnancy.\n\n===Breast cancer===\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women<ref>{{cite web |author = [[World Health Organization]] |date = February 2006 |title = Fact sheet No. 297: Cancer |url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en/index.html |accessdate = 26 April 2007 }}</ref> and it is one of the leading causes of death among women.

A typical example is the so-called [[Venus of Willendorf]], one of many [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]] with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000&nbsp;BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nMany female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess [[Astarte]] were represented as pillars studded with breasts. [[Isis]], an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling [[pharaohs]], thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god [[Hapy]] who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the [[Nile]].\n\nFemale breasts were also prominent in the [[Minoan civilization]] in the form of the famous [[Snake Goddess]] statuettes. In [[Ancient Greece]] there were several cults worshipping the \"Kourotrophos\", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Hera]] and [[Artemis]]. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Yalom (1998) pp. 9\u201316; see Eva Keuls (1993), ''Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens'' for a detailed study of male-dominant rule in ancient Greece.</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Dampier's oil on canvas painting 'Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands', 1825.jpg|thumb|right|1825 oil painting entitled \"Tetuppa, a Native Female of the Sandwich Islands\", by [[Robert Dampier]]]]\n\nDuring the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like [[Athena]], the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern [[Pin-up|pin ups]] by historian [[Marilyn Yalom]].<ref>Yalom (1998), p. 18.</ref> Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred \"usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture\".<ref>Hollander (1993), p. 6.</ref> A popular legend at the time was of the [[Amazons]], a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.\n\n=== Body image ===\nMany women regard their breasts as important to their [[sexual attractiveness]], as a sign of [[femininity]] that is important to their [[Self-concept|sense of self]].\n\n=== Clothing ===\n{{See also|Brassiere|Cleavage (breasts)|Toplessness|Modesty|Naturism|Exhibitionism}}\n\n[[File:Namibie Himba 0716a.jpg|thumb|right|As is customary in her culture, a bare-breasted [[Himba people|Himba]] woman of northern Namibia wears a traditional headdress and skirt]]\n\nBecause breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can -within limits- be molded by clothing, such as [[foundation garment]]s.

They chose a site north of the [[Sassanid]] capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (and also just north of where ancient [[Babylon]] had once stood), and on 30 July 762<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Corzine\n|first=Phyllis\n|title=The Islamic Empire\n|year=2005\n|publisher=Thomson Gale\n|pages=68\u201369\n}}</ref> the [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] commissioned the construction of the city. It was built under the supervision of the [[Barmakids]].<ref>{{Cite book\n|title=Times History of the World\n|publisher=Times Books\n|location=London\n|year=2000\n|isbn= }}</ref> Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasids.

Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.\n\nBaghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of [[Salman Pak]], just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed [[Seleucia]], the first capital of the [[Seleucid Empire]], which had earlier replaced the city of [[Babylon]].\n\nAccording to the traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], Baghdad was one of the largest cities, not including the damage it has received. The residents are mostly Hanbal. Bagdad is also home to the grave of Abu Hanifa where there is a cell and a mosque above it. The Sultan of Bagdad, Abu Said Bahadur Khan, was a Tartar king who embraced Islam.<ref>Battuta, pg. 75</ref>\n\nIn its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the [[Qur'an]], when it refers to [[Paradise]].<ref>Wiet, pg. 13</ref> It took four years to build (764\u2013768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last=Corzine|first=Phyllis|title=The Islamic Empire|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|page=69}}</ref> July was chosen as the starting time because two [[Astrology|astrologers]], [[Naubakht|Naubakht Ahvazi]] and [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], believed that the city should be built under the sign of the [[Mesopotamian lion|lion]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].<ref>Wiet, pg. 12</ref> Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.\n\nThe bricks used to make the city were {{convert|18|in|mm}} on all four sides. [[Abu Hanifa]]h was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for both human consumption and the manufacture of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.\n\nThe basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} in diameter, leading it to be known as the \"Round City\". The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first.<ref name=\"ox\">{{cite web|url=http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030325090348/http://islamicceramics.ashmol.ox.ac.uk/Abbasid/baghdad.htm |archivedate=25 March 2003 |dead-url=yes |title=Abbasid Ceramics: Plan of Baghdad |publisher=web.archive.org |accessdate=5 October 2014 }}</ref> Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades.<ref>\"Yakut: Baghdad under the Abbasids, c. 1000CE\"</ref> In the center of the city lay the [[mosque]], as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian [[urban planning|urban design]]. The Sasanian city of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Gur]] in [[Fars Province|Fars]], built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.\n\n{{wide image|The historical city of Babylon.jpg|1000px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view over the ancient city of [[Babylon]], located {{convert|85|km|abbr=on}} south of Baghdad.}}\n\n===Surrounding walls===\n{{see also|Gates of Baghdad}}\nThe four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named [[Kufa]], [[Basra]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and [[Syria]]; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44&nbsp;m thick at the base and about 12&nbsp;m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30&nbsp;m high, which included [[merlon]]s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by [[embrasure]]s. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50&nbsp;m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid [[glacis]], which is made out of bricks and [[quicklime]]. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.\n\n====Golden Gate Palace====\nThe Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the middle of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 39&nbsp;m high. Surrounding the palace was an [[esplanade]], a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences.

The Abbasids considered themselves the inheritors of Arab-Islamic culture. Harun al-Rashid needed to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity and  built the [[House of Wisdom]], where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic.

Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character.<ref name=mackensen>Mackensen, Ruth Stellhorn .

Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues.  Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities.  There is no single [[city council]] that singularly governs Baghdad at a municipal level.  The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.\n\nThese official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.\n\nThe CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.\n\nOnce all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.\n\nThe same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.\n\nThe first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.\n\nThis system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.\n\nThe nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:<ref>{{cite news |title=New troops to move into Iraq |url=http://images.usatoday.com/news/graphics/troop_surge/flash.swf |work=USA Today}}</ref>\n\n*[[Adhamiyah]]\n*[[Karkh]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=27637 |title=DefenseLink News Article: Soldier Helps to Form Democracy in Baghdad |publisher=Defenselink.mil |accessdate=27 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090831135357/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=27637| archivedate=31 August 2009| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n*[[Karrada]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/june2005/a060105la2.html |title=Zafaraniya Residents Get Water Project Update - DefendAmerica News Article |publisher=Defendamerica.mil |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228064722/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/june2005/a060105la2.html |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-03-26-councils-work_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Basics of democracy in Iraq include frustration | first1=Thomas | last1=Frank | date=26 March 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>\n*[[Kadhimiya]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/mar2004/a031804d.html |title=DefendAmerica News - Article |publisher=Defendamerica.mil |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227233739/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/mar2004/a031804d.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Mansour district|Mansour]]\n*[[Sadr City]] (Thawra)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1205/p01s04-woiq.html |title=Democracy from scratch |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=5 December 2003 |accessdate=27 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100403220914/http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1205/p01s04-woiq.html| archivedate= 3 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n*[[Al Rashid, Baghdad|Al Rashid]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sept2006/a091906dg2.html |title=Leaders Highlight Successes of Baghdad Operation - DefendAmerica News Article |publisher=Defendamerica.mil |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228012249/http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sept2006/a091906dg2.html |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Rusafa]]\n*[[New Baghdad]] (Tisaa Nissan) (9 April)<ref>[http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=5&nid=235 NBC 6 News - 1st Cav Headlines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212142736/http://www.kcentv.com/news/c-article.php?cid=5&nid=235 |date=12 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above.

As seen in the table below, definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures vary by up to 0.5%.

Famous Bugattis include the [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35 Grand Prix]] cars, the [[Bugatti Royale|Type 41 \"Royale\"]], the [[Bugatti Type 57|Type 57 \"Atlantic\"]] and the [[Bugatti Type 55|Type 55]] sports car.\n\nThe death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the [[marque]], and the death of his son [[Jean Bugatti]] in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive [[sports car]]s. Today, the name is owned by the [[Volkswagen Group]].\n\n==Under Ettore Bugatti==\nFounder Ettore Bugatti was born in [[Milan]], Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the [[German Empire]] from 1871 to 1919. The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856\u20131940), was an important [[Art Nouveau]] furniture and jewelry designer).\n\n===World War I and its aftermath===\n[[File:Bugatti Typ 13 Brescia Sport-Racing 1922.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 13 Brescia Sport-Racing, 1922]]\nDuring the [[First World War|war]] Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim.<ref name=Automobilia1920>{{cite journal|authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Bellu |title=Automobilia|journal=Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1920 (salon [Oct] 1919)|volume=Nr. 31|pages=63|year=2004|publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris}}</ref> Less than four months after the [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)|Versailles Treaty]] formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the [[Paris Motor Show|15th Paris motor show]] in October 1919.<ref name=Automobilia1920/> He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same [[ohc|overhead camshaft]] 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder.<ref name=Automobilia1920/> Smallest of the three was a \"[[Bugatti Type 13|Type 13]]\" with a racing body (constructed by Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} wheelbase.<ref name=Automobilia1920/> The others were a \"[[Bugatti Type 13#Type 22|Type 22]]\" and a \"[[Bugatti Type 13#Type 23|Type 23]]\" with wheelbases of {{convert|2250|and|2400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref name=Automobilia1920/>\n\n===Racing successes===\n[[File:Bugatti Type 35.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 35B]]\n{{Main|Bugatti Grand Prix results}}\nThe company also enjoyed great success in early [[Grand Prix motor racing]]: in 1929 a privately entered [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35B|Bugatti]] won the first ever [[Monaco Grand Prix]]. Racing success culminated with driver [[Jean-Pierre Wimille]] winning the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] twice (in 1937 with [[Robert Benoist]] and 1939 with [[Pierre Veyron]]).\n\nBugatti cars were extremely successful in racing. The little [[Bugatti Type 10]] swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 [[Bugatti Type 35]] is one of the most successful racing cars. The Type 35 was developed by Bugatti with master engineer and racing driver [[Jean Chassagne]] who also drove it in the car\u2019s first ever Grand Prix in 1924 Lyon.<ref>L\u2019Automobiliste, 1971 P. 7</ref> Bugattis swept to victory in the [[Targa Florio]] for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. [[Louis Chiron]] held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the modern marque revival Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. named the 1999 [[Bugatti 18/3 Chiron]] concept car in his honour. But it was the final racing success at Le Mans that is most remembered\u2014Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one car and meagre resources.\n\n===Aeroplane racing===\n[[File:Bugatti 100 Racing Plane @ Oshkosh (2234509290) (2).jpg|thumb|Bugatti 100P Racing Plane]]\nIn the 1930s, Ettore Bugatti got involved in the creation of a racer [[airplane]], hoping to beat the Germans in the [[Deutsch de la Meurthe prize]].

Jean died while testing a [[Bugatti Type 57#Type 57S Tank|Type 57 tank-bodied race car]] near the Molsheim factory.\n\n==After World War II==\n[[File:Bugatti Coach Type 73A (1947) pic1.JPG|thumb|Bugatti Type 73A]]\n[[World War II]] left the Molsheim factory in ruins and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois, a northwestern suburb of Paris. After the war, Bugatti designed and planned to build a series of new cars, including the Type 73 road car and Type 73C single seat racing car, but in all Bugatti built only five Type 73 cars.\n\nDevelopment of a 375&nbsp;cc supercharged car was stopped when Ettore Bugatti died on 21 August 1947. Following Ettore Bugatti's death, the business declined further and made its last appearance as a business in its own right at a [[Paris Motor Show]] in October 1952.<ref name=Automobilia1953>{{cite journal |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Bellu |title=Automobilia |journal=Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1953 (salon Paris oct 1952) |volume=Nr. 14 |pages=Pages 6 & 10|year=2000|publisher=Histoire & collections|location=Paris}}</ref>\n\nAfter a long decline, the original incarnation of Bugatti ceased operations in 1952.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Fondation Bugatti-Molsheim-Moteur Type 49 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Bugatti Type 49 Engine]]\nBugattis are noticeably focused on design. [[Engine block]]s were [[hand scraper|hand scraped]] to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured ''[[guilloch\u00e9]]'' (engine turned) finishes on them, and safety wires had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the [[axle]]s as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed through a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor [[Bentley]]'s cars as \"the world's fastest lorries\" for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, \"weight was the enemy\".\n\n===Important models built===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:99%;\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"| Prototypes\n!  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"| Racing cars\n!  style=\"width:33%; vertical-align:top;\"| Road cars\n|-\n| valign=top |\n* 1900\u20131901 [[Bugatti Type 2#Type 2|Type 2]]\n* 1903 [[Bugatti Type 5#Type 5|Type 5]]\n* 1908 [[Bugatti Type 10|Type 10]] \"''Petit Pur Sang''\"\n* 1925 [[Bugatti Type 36|Type 36]]\n* 1929\u20131930 [[Bugatti Type 45|Type 45/47]]\n* [[Bugatti Type 56|Type 56]] ([[electric car]])\n* 1939 [[Bugatti Type 64|Type 64]] (coupe)\n* 1943/1947 [[Bugatti Type 73|Type 73C]]\n| valign=top |\n* 1910\u20131914 [[Bugatti Type 13#Type 13|Type 13]]/[[Bugatti Type 13#15|Type 15]]/[[Bugatti Type 17|17]]/[[Bugatti Type 22|22]]\n* 1912 [[Bugatti Type 16#Type 16|Type 16]] \"''B\u00e9b\u00e9''\"\n* 1922\u20131926 [[Bugatti Type 30#Type 29|Type 29]] \"''Cigare''\"\n* 1923 [[Bugatti Type 32|Type 32]] \"Tank\"\n* 1924\u20131930 [[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35|Type 35]]/[[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35A|35A]]/[[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35B|35B]]/[[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35T|35T]]/[[Bugatti Type 35#Type 35C|35C]]/[[Bugatti Type 37|37]]/[[Bugatti Type 39|39]] \"Grand Prix\"\n* 1927\u20131930 [[Bugatti Type 52|Type 52]] ([[electric vehicle|electric racer]] for children)\n* 1936\u20131939 [[Bugatti Type 57#Type 57G|Type 57G \"Tank\"]]\n* 1937\u20131939 [[Bugatti Type 46#Type 50|Type 50B]]\n* 1931\u20131936 [[Bugatti Type 53|Type 53]]\n* 1931\u20131936 [[Bugatti Type 51#Type 51/51A|Type 51/51A]]/[[Bugatti Type 51#Type 54 GP|54GP]]/[[Bugatti Type 59|59]]\n* 1955\u20131956 [[Bugatti Type 251|Type 251]]\n| valign=top |\n* 1910 [[Bugatti Type 13|Type 13]]<ref>[[Georgano, G.N.]] ''Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886\u20131930''.

The Mullin Museum in [[Oxnard, California]] bought it at auction for $351,343 at Bonham's [[R\u00e9tromobile]] sale in Paris in 2010.\n\n==Attempts at revival==\nThe company attempted a comeback under Roland Bugatti in the mid-1950s with the [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[Bugatti Type 251|Type 251]] race car. Designed with help from [[Gioacchino Colombo]], the car failed to perform to expectations and the company's attempts at automobile production were halted.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Virgil Exner]] designed a Bugatti as part of his \"[[Exner Revival Cars|Revival Cars]]\" project. A show version of this car was actually built by [[Ghia]] using the last [[Bugatti Type 101]] chassis, and was shown at the 1965 [[Turin Motor Show]]. Finance was not forthcoming, and Exner then turned his attention to a revival of [[Stutz Motor Company|Stutz]].\n\nBugatti continued manufacturing airplane parts and was sold to [[Hispano-Suiza]], also a former auto maker turned aircraft supplier, in 1963. [[Snecma]] took over Hispano-Suiza in 1968. After acquiring [[Messier-Bugatti-Dowty|Messier]], Snecma merged Messier and Bugatti into Messier-Bugatti in 1977.\n\n==Modern revivals==\n\n==={{anchor|Bugatti Automobili|Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.}}Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.

Artioli commissioned architect Giampaolo Benedini to design the factory which was built in [[Campogalliano]], Modena, Italy. Construction of the plant began in 1988, alongside the development of the first model, and it was inaugurated two years later\u2014in 1990.{{sfnp|AISA|2011|p=28}}\n\nBy 1989 the plans for the new Bugatti revival were presented by Paolo Stanzani and [[Marcello Gandini]], designers of the [[Lamborghini Miura]] and [[Lamborghini Countach]]. The first production vehicle was the [[Bugatti EB110|Bugatti EB110 GT]]. It used a [[carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer]] chassis, a 3.5-litre, 5-valve per cylinder, quad-[[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 60\u00b0 [[V12 engine]], a six-speed [[gearbox]], and [[four-wheel drive]].\n\nFamed racing car designer [[Mauro Forghieri]] served as Bugatti's technical director from 1992 through 1994.\n\nOn 27 August 1993, through his holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. of [[Luxembourg]], Romano Artioli purchased [[Lotus Cars]] from [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]. Plans were made to list Bugatti shares on international stock exchanges.\n\nBugatti presented a prototype large saloon called the [[Bugatti EB 112|EB112]] in 1993.\n\nPerhaps the most famous Bugatti EB110 owner was seven-time [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Formula One World Champion]] racing driver [[Michael Schumacher]] who purchased an EB110 in 1994. Schumacher sold his EB110, which had been repaired after a severe 1994 crash, to Modena Motorsport, a Ferrari service and race preparation garage in Germany.\n\nBy the time the EB110 came to market, the North American and European economies were in recession. Poor economic conditions forced the company to fail and operations ceased in September 1995. A model specific to the US market called the \"Bugatti America\" was in the preparatory stages when the company ceased operations.\n\nBugatti's liquidators sold Lotus Cars to [[Proton (carmaker)|Proton]] of Malaysia. German firm [[Dauer Racing]] purchased the EB110 licence and remaining parts stock in 1997 in order to produce five more EB110 SS vehicles. These five SS versions of the EB110 were greatly refined by Dauer. The Campogalliano factory was sold to a furniture-making company, which became defunct prior to moving in, leaving the building unoccupied.<ref>{{cite web|author=Copyright.

As infected rodents infected new rodents, the disease spread across the region, entering also from southern Russia. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]].

Swollen lymph glands (''buboes'') often occur in the neck, armpit and groin (''inguinal'') regions of plague victims.]]\nContemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.<ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/> [[Boccaccio]]'s description:\n\n{{quotation|In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg&nbsp;...

Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes,<ref>D.

The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the [[Philip VI of France|king of France]] that blamed the heavens, in the form of a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] of three planets in 1345 that caused a \"great pestilence in the air\".{{sfn|Horrox|1994|p=159}} This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the [[miasma theory]]. The word ''plague'' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.\n\nThe importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Sehdev PS | title = The Origin of Quarantine | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1071\u201372 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12398064 | doi = 10.1086/344062 | url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full }}</ref>\n\nThe dominant explanation for the Black Death is the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''.<ref name=Chritakos2005>{{cite book|first=George |last=Christakos |first2=Ricardo A. |last2=Olea |first3=Marc L. |last3=Serre |first4=Hwa-Lung |last4=Yu |first5=Lin-Lin |last5=Wang |title=Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death |year=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-25794-3 |pages=110\u201314}}</ref> The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]], and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nThe historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]] wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from 541 to 700&nbsp;CE.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nAn estimate of the [[mortality rate]] for the modern [[bubonic plague]], following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, although it may be higher in underdeveloped regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html|author=Centers for Disease Control (CDC)|title= FAQ: Plague|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=24 April 2017}}</ref> Symptoms of the disease include fever of {{convert|38|\u2013|41|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, headaches, painful aching joints, [[nausea]] and vomiting, and a general feeling of [[malaise]].

Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=8}}\n\nA number of alternative theories \u2013 implicating other diseases in the Black Death pandemic \u2013 have also been proposed by some modern scientists (see below \u2013 \"Alternative Explanations\").\n\n===DNA evidence===\n[[File:Bubonic plague victims-mass grave in Martigues, France 1720-1721.jpg|thumb|Skeletons in a mass grave from 1720\u20131721 in [[Martigues]], France, yielded molecular evidence of the ''orientalis'' strain of ''Yersinia pestis'', the organism responsible for bubonic plague.

They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) techniques for ''Y. pestis'' from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences.

These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of [[plague pit]] remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the [[Low Countries]] from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.<ref name=\"Haensch2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Haensch S, Bianucci R, Signoli M, Rajerison M, Schultz M, Kacki S, Vermunt M, Weston DA, Hurst D, Achtman M, Carniel E, Bramanti B | title = Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = e1001134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20949072 | pmc = 2951374 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134 | editor1-last = Besansky | editor1-first = Nora J }}</ref>\n\nThe results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended.

Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.\n\nIn addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere or [[Replication crisis|were not replicable at all]], despite extensive samples from other mass graves.<ref name=Chritakos2005/> Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague\u2014which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.<ref name=Chritakos2005/>\n\nMcCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the \"laborious\" processes needed to discover rat remains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Michael|date=1 July 2003|title=Rats, Communications, and Plague: Toward an Ecological History|journal=Journal of Interdisciplinary History|volume=34|issue=1|page=6|pages=|doi=10.1162/002219503322645439|issn=0022-1953|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3208221|format=Submitted manuscript}}</ref> Wall\u00f8e complains that all of these authors \"take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat \u2192 rat flea \u2192 human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread\", whilst pointing to several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-[[commensalism|commensal]]) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Monica|date=2014|title=Taking \"Pandemic\" Seriously: Making the Black Death Global|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=2&article=1000&context=medieval_globe&type=additional|journal=The Medieval Globe|pages=31ff|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]\n\nA variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward.

Century by J Amman.png|right|thumb|[[Brewing]] was an early application of biotechnology]]\n\n{{Main article|History of biotechnology}}\n\nAlthough not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived [[agriculture]] clearly fit the broad definition of \"'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products\".  Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.\n\n[[Agriculture]] has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the [[Neolithic Revolution]].  Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population.  As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively [[fertilize]], [[nitrogen fixation|restore nitrogen]], and [[pesticide|control pests]]. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and [[plant breeding|breeding]] them with other plants \u2014 one of the first forms of biotechnology.\n\nThese processes also were included in early [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of [[beer]].<ref>See {{cite book | last = Arnold | first = John P.  | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2005 | title = Origin and History of Beer and Brewing: From Prehistoric Times to the Beginning of Brewing Science and Technology | location = Cleveland, Ohio | publisher = BeerBooks | page = 34 | isbn = 978-0-9662084-1-2 | oclc = 71834130 }}.</ref> These processes were introduced in early [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], [[China]] and [[India]], and still use the same basic biological methods.  In [[brewing]], malted grains (containing [[enzymes]]) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific [[yeasts]] to produce beer. In this process, [[carbohydrates]] in the grains broke down into alcohols, such as ethanol. Later, other cultures produced the process of [[lactic acid fermentation]], which produced other preserved foods, such as [[soy sauce]]. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce [[leavened bread]]. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until [[Louis Pasteur]]'s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.\n\nBefore the time of [[Charles Darwin]]'s work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404200058.html|title = Biotechnology|last = Cole-Turner|first = Ronald | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2003|journal = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion|access-date = December 7, 2014|doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nFor thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.<ref name=Thieman>{{cite book | vauthors = Thieman WJ, Palladino MA |title=Introduction to Biotechnology |publisher=Pearson/Benjamin Cummings |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-321-49145-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of [[microbiology]] and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, [[Chaim Weizmann]] first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing [[corn starch]] using ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]],'' to produce [[acetone]], which the [[United Kingdom]] desperately needed to manufacture [[explosive]]s during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Springham_biotechnology\">{{cite book | vauthors = Springham D, Springham G, Moses V, Cape RE |title=Biotechnology: The Science and the Business |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9GY5DCr6LD4C |date=August 24, 1999 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5702-407-8 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nBiotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the mold ''[[Penicillium]]''. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley \u2013 to form what we today know as [[penicillin]]. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.<ref name=Thieman/>\n\nThe field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success.  Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.  The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that a [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[microorganism]] could be [[patent]]ed in the case of ''[[Diamond v.

Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases.

Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of [[abattoir]] animals (cattle or pigs).

It was fought on 19 September 1356 in Nouaill\u00e9, near the city of [[Poitiers]] in [[Aquitaine]], western France. [[Edward, the Black Prince]], led an army of [[Kingdom of England|English]], [[Principality of Wales|Welsh]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] and [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] troops, many of them veterans of the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]]. They were attacked by a larger French force led by King [[John II of France]], which included allied [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scottish]] forces. The French were heavily defeated; an English counter-attack captured King John II along with [[Philip the Bold|his youngest son]] and much of the French nobility.{{sfn|Blockmans|Prevenier|1999|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nThe effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]] to rule the country. Charles faced [[Jacquerie|populist revolts across the kingdom]] in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war ended four years later in 1360, [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny|on favourable terms for England]].\n\nPoitiers was the second major English victory of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Poitiers was fought ten years after the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (the first major victory), and about half a century before the third, the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415). The town and battle were often referred to as ''Poictiers'' in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated in [[HMS Poictiers|several warships of the Royal Navy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Kendall B.

Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to [[Philip VI of France|Philip]] in his role as [[Duke of Aquitaine]], resulting in Philip confiscating these lands in 1337, precipitating war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself [[King of France]]. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the war at the [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340,<ref>Henri de Wailly. Introduction by Emmanuel Bourassin, Crecy 1346: Anatomy of a Battle (Blandford Press, Poole, Dorset 1987) p. 10</ref>devastated the French in south west France with the [[Gascon campaign of 1345|Gascon campaigns of 1345]] and [[Gascon campaign of 1346|1346]], inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at [[Battle of Crecy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346, and [[Siege of Calais (1346\u201347)|captured Calais in 1347]].\n\nIn the late 1340s and early 1350s, the [[Black Death]] decimated the population of Western Europe, bringing all significant efforts in campaigning to a halt, one such victim being [[Philip VI of France]] himself. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, [[Edward, the Black Prince]], now an experienced soldier following the Cr\u00e9cy campaign, landed at [[Bordeaux]] in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to [[Carcassonne]]. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Duke of Lancaster]] led an army through [[Normandy]], while Edward led his army on a great [[chevauch\u00e9e]] from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.<ref>William W. Lace, ''The Hundred Years' War'' {{ISBN|978-1-56006-233-2}}, 1/1994</ref>\n\nEdward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the [[Loire River]] at [[Tours]]. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed [[John II of France|King John II]] to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging [[Breteuil, Eure|Breteuil]] in [[Normandy]], organised the bulk of his army at [[Chartres]] to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux.<ref>Jonathan Sumption, ''The Hundred Years' War: Vol. 2: Trial by Fire'' (London: Faber, 2001), pp. 223, 227\u2013228</ref> The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny.  Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south.

He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, his army leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English. The English gained vantage points on the natural high ground in order for their longbowmen to have an advantage on the heavily armored French troops.{{citation needed|date = September 2018}}\n\n==== English army ====\nThe English army was led by [[Edward, the Black Prince]] and composed primarily of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascon]] and [[Duchy of Brittany|Breton]] soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 [[longbow]]men, 3,000 [[men-at-arms]] and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.\n\nLike the earlier engagement at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], the power of the English army lay in the [[longbow]], a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]] in 1298, [[Battle of Halidon Hill|Halidon Hill]] in 1333 and [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] ten years prior, in 1346.

The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal.

The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced forth, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal de Buch]] to pursue. [[John Chandos|Sir John Chandos]] urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.<ref> This section reflects the traditional narrative of the battle, which relies to a substantial extent on the chronicle of Jean Froissart.

Stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into the French line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. Fearful of encirclement, the cohesion of the French army disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the mel\u00e9e. Around this time, King John and his son, [[Philip the Bold]], found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, \"To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him\". Denis replied; \"Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him\". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; \"I yield me to you\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Froissart |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Froissart |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Eliot ||title=Chronicle and Romance: Froissart, Malory, Holinshed |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cs_xSDQgDUsC&pg=PA52 |accessdate=2018-09-17| year=1910 |page=52 |chapter=The Battle of Poitiers |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army had broken up and left the field, ending the battle.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nFollowing the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. [[Jean de Venette]], a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the [[Charles V of France|Dauphin Charles]], who faced [[Jacquerie|popular rebellion across the kingdom]] in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling and pillaging the peasants' goods. [[Free company|Mercenary companies]] hired by both sides added to the destruction, who plundered the peasants and churches.<ref>Jean Birdsall, Richard A. Newhall, ''The Chronicles of Jean de Venette '' (Columbia University Press 1953) p. 6</ref>\n\nCharles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the [[ransom]] of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, [[Edward III of England|King Edward]] assembled his army at [[Calais]] in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against [[Rheims]]. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, [[Paris]], Edward moved his army to [[Chartres]]. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former [[Angevin Empire]].<ref>Hersch Lauterpacht, \"Volume 20 of International Law Reports, Cambridge University Press, 1957, {{ISBN|0-521-46365-3}}, p. 118</ref>\n\n== Nobles and men-at-arms present ==\n=== English ===\n[[Jean Froissart|Froissart]] states these men fought with the Black Prince:\n* [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick]]\n* [[William de Ufford, 2nd Earl of Suffolk]]\n* [[William de Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]]\n* [[John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford]]\n* [[Reginald de Cobham, 1st Baron Cobham]]\n* [[Edward le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer]]\n* [[James Audley|Lord James Audley]]\n* Lord Peter Audley\n* Lord Berkeley\n* Lord Basset\n* Lord Warin\n* Lord Delaware\n* Lord Manne\n* Lord Willoughby\n* Lord Bartholomew de Burghersh\n* Lord of Felton\n* Lord Richard of Pembroke\n* Lord Stephen of Cosington\n* Lord Bradetane\n* Lord of Pommiers\n* Lord of [[Langoiran|Languiran]]\n* [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Captal of Buch]]\n* Lord John the 69th of Caumont\n* Lord de [[Lesparre-M\u00e9doc|Lesparre]]\n* Lord of [[Rauzan]]\n* Lord of Condon\n* Lord of [[Montferrand (district of Clermont-Ferrand)|Montferrand]]\n* Lord of [[Landiras]]\n* Lord Soudic of Latrau\n* Lord Eustace d'Aubrecicourt\n* Lord John of Ghistelles\n* Lord Daniel Pasele\n* Lord Denis of Amposta<ref>John Bourchier; G.

It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s.\n\nThe [[cabal]] was created in an effort to facilitate reliable propagation of new Usenet posts: While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the backbone cabal were available 24 hours a day. The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the [[Great Renaming]] of [[Usenet]] newsgroups during 1987.\n\n== History ==\nAs Usenet has few technologically or legally enforced hierarchies, just about the only ones that formed were [[social hierarchy|social]]. People acquired power through persuasion (both publicly and privately), public debate, force of will (often via aggressive [[flaming (Internet)|flames]]), garnering authority and respect by spending much time and effort contributing to the community (by being a maintainer of a [[FAQ]], for example; see also [[James Parry|Kibo]], etc.).\n\nCredit for organizing the backbone about 1983 is commonly attributed to [[Gene Spafford|Gene \"Spaf\" Spafford]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021012011241/http://www.vrx.net/usenet/history/rename.html The Great Renaming FAQ]</ref> although it is also claimed by [[Mary Ann Horton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maryannhorton.com/MaryAnnHorton-extended.html |title=Mary Ann Horton's Resum\u00e9 |accessdate=2016-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709160729/http://www.maryannhorton.com/MaryAnnHorton-extended.html |archivedate=2006-07-09 |df= }}</ref> Other prominent members of the cabal were [[Brian Reid (computer scientist)|Brian Reid]], Richard Sexton, [[Chuq von Rospach]], Neil Crellin and [[Rick Adams (Internet pioneer)|Rick Adams]].\n\n== In Internet culture ==\nDuring most of its existence, the cabal (sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; those involved would often respond '''\"There is no Cabal\"''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''\"TINC\"'''), whenever the existence or activities of the group were speculated on in public. It is sometimes used humorously to dispel cabal-like organizational conspiracy theories, or as an ironic statement, indicating one who knows the existence of \"the cabal\" will invariably deny there is one.\n\nThis belief became a model for various conspiracy theories about various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over Usenet or the Internet. [[Website spoofing|Spoofs]] include the \"Eric Conspiracy\" of moustachioed hackers named \"Eric\"; ex-members of the [[P.H.I.R.M.]]; and the [[Lumber Cartel]] putatively funding anti-[[spamming|spam]] efforts to support the paper industry.\n\nThe result of this policy was an aura of mystery, even a decade after the cabal mailing list disbanded in late 1988 following an internal fight.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=backbone+cabal |title=backbone cabal |publisher=TechWeb|accessdate=2007-09-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000916/http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=backbone+cabal |archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n*[[Image:PD-icon.svg|15px|link=|alt=]]&nbsp;''This article incorporates text from [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/B/backbone-cabal.html the corresponding entry in the Jargon File], which is in the [[public domain]] according to [http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/online-preface.html its Introduction].''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n# Henry Edward Hardy, 1993.
