When the answer is an exact copy of the subject to the new key, with identical intervals to the first statement, it is classified as a ''real answer''; if the intervals are altered to maintain the key it is a ''tonal answer''.<ref name = \"oxfcomp\" />\n\n[[Image:Respuesta tonal en la fuga.jpg|center|thumb|450x450px|Example of a tonal answer in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S.

Answers in the subdominant are also employed for the same reason.<ref name=\"Verrall-1966-p12\">{{harvnb|Verrall|1966|p=12}}</ref>\n\nWhile the answer is being stated, the voice in which the subject was previously heard continues with new material. If this new material is reused in later statements of the subject, it is called a ''[[countersubject]]''; if this accompanying material is only heard once, it is simply referred to as ''[[free counterpoint]]''. [[File:Interval Inversion.jpg|thumb|375x375px|The interval of a [[Fifth (interval)|fifth]] inverts to a [[Fourth (interval)|fourth]] (dissonant) and therefore cannot be employed in [[Invertible Counterpoint|invertible counterpoint]], without preparation and resolution.]] The countersubject is written in [[Invertible Counterpoint|invertible counterpoint]] at the octave or fifteenth.<ref>{{harvnb|Gedalge|1964|p=59}}</ref> The distinction is made between the use of free counterpoint and regular countersubjects accompanying the fugue subject/answer, because in order for a countersubject to be heard accompanying the subject in more than one instance, it must be capable of sounding correctly above or below the subject, and must be conceived, therefore, in invertible (double) counterpoint.<ref name = \"oxfcomp\" /><ref>\"Invertible Counterpoint\" ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2002) {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t114.e3465|title=Oxford Reference Online, subscription access|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref>\n\nIn [[tonality|tonal]] music, invertible contrapuntal lines must be written according to certain rules because several intervallic combinations, while acceptable in one particular orientation, are no longer permissible when inverted. For example, when the note \"G\" sounds in one voice above the note \"C\" in lower voice, the interval of a fifth is formed, which is considered consonant and entirely acceptable. When this interval is inverted (\"C\" in the upper voice above \"G\" in the lower), it forms a fourth, considered a dissonance in tonal contrapuntal practice, and requires special treatment, or preparation and resolution, if it is to be used.<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Invertible Counterpoint|author=Drabkin, William|access-date=16 March 2007}}</ref> The countersubject, if sounding at the same time as the answer, is transposed to the pitch of the answer.<ref>{{harvnb|Gedalge|1964|p=61}}</ref> Each voice then responds with its own subject or answer, and further countersubjects or free counterpoint may be heard.\n\nWhen a tonal answer is used, it is customary for the exposition to alternate subjects (S) with answers (A), however, in some fugues this order is occasionally varied: e.g., see the SAAS arrangement of Fugue No. 1 in C Major, BWV 846, from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach's]] ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier|Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1]]''. A brief [[codetta]] is often heard connecting the various statements of the subject and answer. This allows the music to run smoothly. The codetta, just as the other parts of the exposition, can be used throughout the rest of the fugue.<ref>{{harvnb|Gedalge|1964|pp=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nThe first answer must occur as soon after the initial statement of the subject as possible; therefore the first codetta is often extremely short, or not needed. In the above example, this is the case: the subject finishes on the [[quarter note]] (or crotchet) B{{music|flat}} of the third beat of the second bar which harmonizes the opening G of the answer. The later codettas may be considerably longer, and often serve to (a) develop the material heard so far in the subject/answer and countersubject and possibly introduce ideas heard in the second countersubject or free counterpoint that follows (b) delay, and therefore heighten the impact of the reentry of the subject in another voice as well as modulating back to the tonic.<ref>Paul Walker, \"Fugue, \u00a71: A Classic Fugue Analysed\" {{cite web|url=http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.51678.1|title=Grove Music Online|accessdate=2007-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe exposition usually concludes when all voices have given a statement of the subject or answer. In some fugues, the exposition will end with a redundant entry, or an extra presentation of the theme.<ref name=\"oxfcomp\" /> Furthermore, in some fugues the entry of one of the voices may be reserved until later, for example in the pedals of an organ fugue (see J.S. Bach's Fugue in C major for Organ, BWV 547).\n\n===Episode===\n{{Further information|Section (music)}}\n\nFurther entries of the subject follow this initial exposition, either immediately (as for example in Fugue No. 1 in C major, BWV 846 of the ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'') or separated by episodes.<ref name=\"oxfcomp\" /> Episodic material is always [[Modulation (music)|modulatory]] and is usually based upon some element heard in the exposition.<ref name=\"classic\" /><ref name=\"oxfcomp\" /> Each episode has the primary function of transitioning for the next entry of the subject in a new key,<ref name=\"oxfcomp\" /> and may also provide release from the strictness of form employed in the exposition, and middle-entries.<ref name=\"Verrall 1966 33\">{{harvnb|Verrall|1966|p=33}}</ref> [[Andr\u00e9 Gedalge]] states that the episode of the fugue is generally based on a series of imitations of the subject that have been fragmented.<ref>{{harvnb|Gedalge|1964|p=}}</ref>\n\n===Development<!--linked from 'Musical development'-->===\n{{further information|Musical development}}\nFurther entries of the subject, or middle entries, occur throughout the fugue. They must state the subject or answer at least once in its entirety, and may also be heard in combination with the countersubject(s) from the exposition, new countersubjects, free counterpoint, or any of these in combination. It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle-entries as in the exposition; rather, it is usually heard with at least one of the countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments.\n\nMiddle-entries tend to occur at pitches other than the initial. As shown in the typical structure above, these are often [[Closely related key|closely-related keys]] such as the [[Dominant key|relative dominant]] and [[Subdominant key|subdominant]], although the key structure of fugues varies greatly. In the fugues of J.S. Bach, the first middle-entry occurs most often in the [[relative major]] or [[Relative minor|minor]] of the work's overall key, and is followed by an entry in the dominant of the relative major or minor when the fugue's subject requires a tonal answer. In the fugues of earlier composers (notably, [[Dieterich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]] and [[Pachelbel]]), middle entries in keys other than the tonic and dominant tend to be the exception, and non-modulation the norm. One of the famous examples of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehude's Praeludium (Fugue and Chaconne) in C, BuxWV 137.\n\nWhen there is no entrance of the subject and answer material, the composer can develop the subject by altering the subject. This is called an ''episode'',<ref>{{GroveOnline|title=Counter-exposition|author=Paul Walker|access-date=19 March 2007}}</ref> often by ''[[Melodic inversion|inversion]]'', although the term is sometimes used synonymously with middle-entry and may also describe the exposition of completely new subjects, as in a double fugue for example (see below). In any of the entries within a fugue, the subject may be altered, by inversion, [[Permutation (music)|retrograde]] (a less common form where the entire subject is heard back-to-front) and [[diminution]] (the reduction of the subject's rhythmic values by a certain factor), [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (the increase of the subject's rhythmic values by a certain factor) or any combination of them.<ref name=\"oxfcomp\" />\n\n===Example and analysis===\nThe excerpt below, bars 7\u201312 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach's]] Fugue No. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, from the [[Well-Tempered Clavier|''Well-Tempered Clavier'', Book 1]] illustrates the application of most of the characteristics described above. The fugue is for keyboard and in three voices, with regular countersubjects.<ref name = \"classic\" /><ref>{{cite book | first = Johann Sebastian | last = Bach | chapter = Fuge Nr. 2 | title = Das Wohltemperierte Klavier I | editor-first = Ernst-G\u00fcnter | editor-last = Heinemann | location = Munich | publisher = G.

Each voice takes this pattern and states all the subjects/themes in the same order (and repeats the material when all the themes have been stated, sometimes after a rest).\n\nThere is usually very little non-structural/thematic material. During the course of a permutation fugue, it is quite uncommon, actually, for every single possible voice-combination (or \"permutation\") of the themes to be heard. This limitation exists in consequence of sheer proportionality: the more voices in a fugue, the greater the amount of possible permutations. In consequence, composers exercise editorial judgment as to the most musical of permutations and processes leading thereto. One example of permutation fugue can be seen in the opening chorus of J.S. Bach's cantata, [[Himmelsk\u00f6nig, sei willkommen, BWV 182|''Himmelsk\u00f6nig, sei willkommen'', BWV182]].\n\nPermutation fugues differ from conventional fugue in that there are no connecting episodes, nor statement of the themes in related keys.<ref name=\"perm\" /> So for example, the fugue of Bach's [[Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582]] is not purely a permutation fugue, as it does have episodes between permutation expositions. Invertible counterpoint is essential to permutation fugues but is not found in simple fugues.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|1992|p=56}}</ref>\n\n===Fughetta===\nA '''fughetta''' is a short fugue that has the same characteristics as a fugue. Often the contrapuntal writing is not strict, and the setting less formal. See for example, variation 24 of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Diabelli Variations|''Diabelli Variations'' Op. 120]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===\nThe term ''fuga'' was used as far back as the [[Medieval music|Middle Ages]], but was initially used to refer to any kind of imitative counterpoint, including [[canon (music)|canons]], which are now thought of as distinct from fugues.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=7}}</ref> Prior to the 16th century, fugue was originally a genre.<ref name=\"Walker-2000-p7\">{{harvnb|Walker|2000|pp=9\u201310}}</ref> It was not until the 16th century that fugal technique as it is understood today began to be seen in pieces, both instrumental and vocal. Fugal writing is found in works such as [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], [[Ricercar|ricercares]] and [[Canzona|canzonas]].\n\n\"Fugue\" as a theoretical term first occurred in 1330 when [[Jacobus of Li\u00e8ge|Jacobus of Liege]] wrote about the ''fuga'' in his ''Speculum musicae''.<ref>{{harvnb|Mann|1960|p=9}}</ref> The fugue arose from the technique of \"imitation\", where the same musical material was repeated starting on a different note.\n\n[[Gioseffo Zarlino]], a composer, author, and theorist in the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], was one of the first to distinguish between the two types of imitative counterpoint: fugues and canons (which he called imitations).<ref name=\"Walker-2000-p7\" /> Originally, this was to aid [[improvisation]], but by the 1550s, it was considered a technique of composition. The [[Renaissance]] composer [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] (1525?\u20131594) wrote masses using [[musical mode|modal]] counterpoint and imitation, and fugal writing became the basis for writing [[motet]]s as well.<ref>{{cite book | first = Leeman L. | last = Perkins | title = Music in the Age of the Renaissance | location = New York | publisher = [[W. W. Norton & Company]] | year = 1999 | pp = 880\u201381 }}</ref> Palestrina's imitative motets differed from fugues in that each phrase of the text had a different subject which was introduced and worked out separately, whereas a fugue continued working with the same subject or subjects throughout the entire length of the piece.\n\n===Baroque era===\nIt was in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]] that the writing of fugues became central to composition, in part as a demonstration of compositional expertise. Fugues were incorporated into a variety of musical forms. [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]], [[Girolamo Frescobaldi]], [[Johann Jakob Froberger]] and [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] all wrote fugues,<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=165}}</ref> and [[George Frideric Handel]] included them in many of his [[oratorio]]s. Keyboard [[suite (music)|suites]] from this time often conclude with a fugal [[gigue]]. [[Domenico Scarlatti]] has only a few fugues among his corpus of over 500 harpsichord sonatas. The [[French overture]] featured a quick fugal section after a slow introduction. The second movement of a [[sonata da chiesa]], as written by [[Arcangelo Corelli]] and others, was usually fugal.\n\nThe Baroque period also saw a rise in the importance of [[music theory]]. Some fugues during the Baroque period were pieces designed to teach contrapuntal technique to students.<ref>{{cite book | first = David | last = Schulenberg | title = Music of the Baroque | location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2001 | page = 243 }}</ref> The most influential text was [[Johann Joseph Fux|Johann Joseph Fux's]] ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum|Gradus Ad Parnassum]]'' (\"Steps to [[Parnassus]]\"), which appeared in 1725.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=316}}</ref> This work laid out the terms of [[Species counterpoint|\"species\" of counterpoint]], and offered a series of exercises to learn fugue writing.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=317}}</ref> Fux's work was largely based on the practice of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s modal fugues.<ref>{{harvnb|Mann|1960|p=53}}</ref> [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] studied from this book, and it remained influential into the nineteenth century. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], for example, taught counterpoint from his own summary of Fux and thought of it as the basis for formal structure.\n\nBach's most famous fugues are those for the harpsichord in ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', which many composers and theorists look at as the greatest model of fugue.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|2000|p=2}}</ref> ''The Well-Tempered Clavier'' comprises two volumes written in different times of Bach's life, each comprising 24 prelude and fugue pairs, one for each major and minor key. Bach is also known for his organ fugues, which are usually preceded by a [[prelude (music)|prelude]] or [[toccata]]. [[The Art of Fugue|''The Art of Fugue'', BWV 1080]], is a collection of fugues (and four [[canon (music)|canons]]) on a single theme that is gradually transformed as the cycle progresses. Bach also wrote smaller single fugues and put fugal sections or movements into many of his more general works. J.S. Bach's influence extended forward through his son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E. Bach]] and through the theorist [[Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg]] (1718\u20131795) whose ''Abhandlung von der Fuge'' (\"Treatise on the fugue\", 1753) was largely based on J.S. Bach's work.\n\n===Classical era===\nDuring the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]], the fugue was no longer a central or even fully natural mode of musical composition.<ref name=\"Graves-1962-p64\">{{harvnb|Graves|1962|p=64}}</ref> Nevertheless, both [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] had periods of their careers in which they in some sense \"rediscovered\" fugal writing and used it frequently in their work.\n\n==== Haydn ====\nJoseph Haydn was the leader of fugal composition and technique in the Classical era.<ref name=\"Ratner-1980-p263\"/> Haydn's most famous fugues can be found in his [[String Quartets, Op. 20 (Haydn)|\"Sun\" Quartets]] (op. 20, 1772), of which three have fugal finales. This was a practice that Haydn repeated only once later in his quartet-writing career, with the finale of his [[String Quartets, Op. 50 (Haydn)|String Quartet, Op. 50 No. 4]] (1787). Some of the earliest examples of Haydn's use of counterpoint, however, are in three symphonies ([[Symphony No. 3 (Haydn)|No. 3]], [[Symphony No. 13 (Haydn)|No. 13]], and [[Symphony No. 40 (Joseph Haydn)|No. 40]]) that date from 1762\u201363. The earliest fugues, in both the symphonies and in the [[Baryton trios (Haydn)|Baryton trios]], exhibit the influence of Joseph Fux's treatise on counterpoint, ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' (1725), which Haydn studied carefully. \n\nHaydn's second fugal period occurred after he heard, and was greatly inspired by, the [[oratorio]]s of Handel during his visits to London (1791\u20131793, 1794\u20131795). Haydn then studied Handel's techniques and incorporated Handelian fugal writing into the choruses of his mature oratorios ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' and ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]],'' as well as several of his later symphonies, including [[Symphony No. 88 (Haydn)|No. 88]], [[Symphony No. 95 (Haydn)|No. 95]], and [[Symphony No. 101 (Haydn)|No. 101]].\n\n==== Mozart ====\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart studied counterpoint when young with [[Padre Martini]] in Bologna. However, the major impetus to fugal writing for Mozart was the influence of Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]] in Vienna around 1782. Van Swieten, during diplomatic service in [[Berlin]], had taken the opportunity to collect as many manuscripts by Bach and Handel as he could, and he invited Mozart to study his collection and also encouraged him to transcribe various works for other combinations of instruments. Mozart was evidently fascinated by these works, and wrote a set of transcriptions for string trio of fugues from Bach's ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', introducing them with preludes of his own. \n\nIn a letter to his sister, dated in Vienna on April 20, 1782, Mozart recognizes that he had not written anything in this form, but moved by the interest of [[Constanze Mozart|Constance]] he composed one piece, which is sent with the letter. He begs her sister does not let anybody to see the fugue and manifests the hope to write five more and then present them to Baron van Swieten. Regarding the piece, he said \"I have taken particular care to write ''andante maestoso'' upon it, so that it should not be played fast \u2013 for if a fugue is not played slowly the ear cannot clearly distinguish the new subject as it is introduced and the effect is missed\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Letters of Mozart|last=|first=|publisher=Dorset Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=New york|pages=195|via=}}</ref> Mozart then set to writing fugues on his own, mimicking the Baroque style. These included the fugues for String Quartet, K. 405 (1782) and a Fugue in C Minor K. 426 for two pianos (1783). Later, Mozart incorporated fugal writing into his opera ''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'' and the finale of his [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 41]].\n\n[[File:Jupiter finale.png|thumb|center|500px| Fugal passage from the finale of Mozart's Symphony No. 41 (''Jupiter''). [[File:Mozart Symphony 41, finale, fugal passage.wav|thumb]]]]\n\nThe parts of the [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] he completed also contain several fugues (most notably the Kyrie, and the three fugues in the Domine Jesu;<ref>{{harvnb|Ratner|1980|p=266}}</ref> he also left behind a sketch for an [[Amen]] fugue which, some believe{{Who|date=January 2018}}, would have come at the end of the Sequentia).\n\n==== Beethoven ====\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was familiar with fugal writing from childhood, as an important part of his training was playing from ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]''. During his early career in [[Vienna]], Beethoven attracted notice for his performance of these fugues. There are fugal sections in Beethoven's early piano sonatas, and fugal writing is to be found in the second and fourth movements of the ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica Symphony]]'' (1805). Beethoven incorporated fugues in his sonatas, and reshaped the episode's purpose and compositional technique for later generations of composers.<ref>{{harvnb|Graves|1962|p=65}}</ref> \n\nNevertheless, fugues did not take on a truly central role in Beethoven's work until his late period. The finale of Beethoven's [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' Sonata]] contains a fugue, which was practically unperformed until the late 19th century, due to its tremendous technical difficulty and length. The last movement of his [[Cello Sonatas Nos. 4 and 5 (Beethoven)#Sonata No. 5.2C Op. 102.2C No. 2|Cello Sonata, Op. 102 No. 2]] is a fugue, and there are fugal passages in the last movements of his Piano Sonatas in [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|A major, Op. 101]] and [[Piano Sonata No. 31 (Beethoven)|A{{music|flat}} major Op. 110]]. According to [[Charles Rosen]] (1971, p.&nbsp;503) \"With the finale of 110, Beethoven re-conceived the significance of the most traditional elements of fugue writing.\"<ref>Rosen, C. (1971) The Classical Style.  London, Faber.</ref>\n\nFugal passages are also found in the ''[[Missa Solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa Solemnis]]'' and all movements of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], except the third . A massive, dissonant fugue forms the finale of his [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|String Quartet, Op. 130]] (1825); the latter was later published separately as Op. 133, the ''[[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]]'' (\"Great Fugue\"). However, it is the fugue that opens Beethoven's [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|String Quartet in C{{music|sharp}} minor, Op. 131]] that several commentators regard as one of the composer's greatest achievements. [[Joseph Kerman]] (1966, p.&nbsp;330) calls it \"this most moving of all fugues\".<ref>Kerman, J. (1966), ''The Beethoven Quartets''. Oxford University Press</ref> [[J. W. N. Sullivan|J.W.N. Sullivan]] (1927, p.&nbsp;235) hears it as \"the most superhuman piece of music that Beethoven has ever written.\"<ref>Sullivan, J.W.N. (1927) ''Beethoven''.  London, Jonathan Cape</ref> [[Philip Radcliffe]] (1965, p.&nbsp;149) says \"[a] bare description of its formal outline can give but little idea of the extraordinary profundity of this fugue .\"<ref>Radcliffe, P.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlFYC1U5viw Listen]]]\n\n===Romantic era===\nBy the beginning of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]], fugue writing had become specifically attached to the norms and styles of the Baroque. [[Felix Mendelssohn]] wrote many fugues inspired by his study of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]. [[Franz Liszt|Franz Liszt's]] [[Piano Sonata (Liszt)|Piano Sonata in B minor]] (1853) contains a powerful fugue, demanding incisive virtuosity from its player:[[File:Liszt B minor sonata fugue subject.png|thumb|center|500px|Liszt Piano Sonata Fugue subject. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwXtuavTed0 Link to passage]]][[Verdi|Giuseppe Verdi]] included a whimsical example at the end of his opera'' [[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' and his setting of the [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem Mass]] contained two (originally three) choral fugues.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} [[Bruckner|Anton Bruckner]] and [[Mahler|Gustav Mahler]] also included them in their respective symphonies. The exposition of the finale of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 5 (Bruckner)|Fifth Symphony]] begins with a fugal exposition. The exposition ends with a chorale, the melody of which is then used as a second fugal exposition at the beginning of the development. The recapitulation features both fugal subjects concurrently.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The finale of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 5 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 5]] features a \"fugue-like\"<ref>Floros, C.

Amadeus Press.</ref> passage early in the movement, though this is not actually an example of a fugue.\n\n===20th century===\nTwentieth-century composers brought fugue back to its position of prominence, realizing its uses in full instrumental works, its importance in development and introductory sections, and the developmental capabilities of fugal composition.<ref name=\"Graves-1962-p64\"/>\n\nThe second movement of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s piano suite ''[[Le Tombeau de Couperin]]'' (1917) is a fugue that [[Roy Howat]] (200, p.&nbsp;88) describes as having \"a subtle glint of jazz\".<ref>Howat, R. (2000) \"Ravel and the Piano\" in Mawer, D. (ed.) ''The Cambridge Companion to Ravel''. Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]]'s ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) opens with a slow fugue that [[Pierre Boulez]] (1986, pp.&nbsp;346\u201347) regards as \"certainly the finest and most characteristic example of Bart\u00f3k's subtle style... probably the most ''timeless'' of all Bart\u00f3k's works \u2013 a fugue that unfolds like a fan to a point of maximum intensity and then closes, returning to the mysterious atmosphere of the opening.\"<ref>Boulez, P. (1986) ''Orientations''. London, Faber.</ref>\n\n[[Igor Stravinsky]] also incorporated fugues into his works, including the ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' and the ''[[Concerto in E-flat (Dumbarton Oaks)|Dumbarton Oaks]]'' concerto. Stravinsky recognized the compositional techniques of Bach, and in the second movement of his ''Symphony of Psalms'' (1930), he lays out a fugue that is much like that of the Baroque era.<ref>{{harvnb|Graves|1962|p=67}}</ref> It employs a double fugue with two distinct subjects, the first beginning in C and the second in E{{Music|flat}}. Techniques such as ''stretto'', sequencing, and the use of subject incipits are frequently heard in the movement.\n\n[[Olivier Messiaen]], writing about his ''[[Vingt regards sur l'enfant-J\u00e9sus]]'' (1944) wrote of the sixth piece of that collection, \"''Par Lui tout a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait''\" (\"By Him were all things made\"): {{Quote|It expresses the Creation of All Things: space, time, stars, planets&nbsp;\u2013 and the Countenance (or rather, the Thought) of God behind the flames and the seething&nbsp;\u2013 impossible even to speak of it, I have not attempted to describe it ... Instead, I have sheltered behind the form of the Fugue. Bach's ''[[Art of Fugue]]'' and the fugue from Beethoven's Opus 106 (the ''[[Hammerklavier sonata]]'') have nothing to do with the academic fugue. Like those great models, this one is an anti-scholastic fugue.<ref>Notes to ''Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant J\u00e9sus''. Translator not indicated. Erato Disques S.A. 4509-91705-2, 1993.

Several examples exist within [[jazz]], such as ''Bach goes to Town'', composed by the Welsh composer [[Alec Templeton]] and recorded by [[Benny Goodman]] in 1938, and ''[[Concorde (album)|Concorde]]''  composed by [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]] and recorded by the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] in 1955.\n\nIn \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" from the Broadway musical [[Guys and Dolls]], written by [[Frank Loesser]], the characters Nicely-Nicely, Benny, and Rusty sing simultaneously about hot tips they each have in an upcoming [[Horse racing|horse race]]. \n\nA few examples also exist within [[progressive rock]], such as the central movement of \"[[Trilogy (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)#Track listing |The Endless Enigma]]\" by [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]] and \"[[Free Hand#Track listing |On Reflection]]\" by [[Gentle Giant]].\n\n== Discussion ==\n\n===Musical form or texture===\nA widespread view of the fugue is that it is not a musical form but rather a technique of composition.<ref>{{cite book | first = Donald Francis | last = Tovey | title = Essays in Music Analysis Volume I: Symphonies | location = London | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1962 | page = 17 }}</ref>\n\nThe Austrian musicologist [[Erwin Ratz]] argues that the formal organization of a fugue involves not only the arrangement of its theme and episodes, but also its harmonic structure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ratz|1951|loc=Chapter 3}}</ref> In particular, the exposition and coda tend to emphasize the [[tonic key]], whereas the episodes usually explore more distant tonalities. Ratz stressed, however, that this is the core, underlying form (\"Urform\") of the fugue, from which individual fugues may deviate.\n\nThus it is to be noted that while certain [[closely related key|related keys]] are more commonly explored in fugal development, the overall structure of a fugue does not limit its harmonic structure. For example, a fugue may not even explore the dominant, one of the most closely related keys to the tonic. Bach's Fugue in B{{music|flat}} major from book one of the ''Well Tempered Clavier'' explores the [[relative minor]], the [[supertonic]] and the [[subdominant]]. This is unlike later forms such as the sonata, which clearly prescribes which keys are explored (typically the tonic and dominant in an ABA form). Then, many modern fugues dispense with traditional tonal harmonic scaffolding altogether, and either use serial (pitch-oriented) rules, or (as the Kyrie/Christe in [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s ''Requiem'', [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]] works), use panchromatic, or even denser, harmonic spectra.\n\n===Perceptions and aesthetics===\nFugue is the most complex of contrapuntal forms. In Ratz's words, \"fugal technique significantly burdens the shaping of musical ideas, and it was given only to the greatest geniuses, such as Bach and Beethoven, to breathe life into such an unwieldy form and make it the bearer of the highest thoughts.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ratz|1951|p=259}}</ref> In presenting Bach's fugues as among the greatest of contrapuntal works, [[Peter Kivy]] points out that \"counterpoint itself, since time out of mind, has been associated in the thinking of musicians with the profound and the serious\"<ref name=\"Kivy\">{{harvnb|Kivy|1990|p=206}}</ref> and argues that \"there seems to be some rational justification for their doing so.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kivy|1990|p=210}}</ref>\n\nThis is related to the idea that restrictions create freedom for the composer, by directing their efforts. He also points out that fugal writing has its roots in improvisation, and was, during the Renaissance, practiced as an improvisatory art. Writing in 1555, [[Nicola Vicentino]], for example, suggests that:\n{{Quote|the composer, having completed the initial imitative entrances, take the passage which has served as accompaniment to the theme and make it the basis for new imitative treatment, so that \"he will always have material with which to compose without having to stop and reflect\". This formulation of the basic rule for fugal improvisation anticipates later sixteenth-century discussions which deal with the improvisational technique at the keyboard more extensively.<ref>{{harvnb|Mann|1965|p=16}}</ref>}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | first = Andr\u00e9 | last = Gedalge | author-link=Andr\u00e9 Gedalge| title = Trait\u00e9 de la fugue |trans-title=Treatise on Fugue | others = trans.

The state can last days, months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of [[dissociative amnesia]], according to the fifth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-5).\n\nAfter recovery from a fugue state, previous memories usually return intact, and further treatment is unnecessary. Additionally, an episode of fugue is not characterized as attributable to a [[psychiatric disorder]] if it can be related to the ingestion of [[psychotropic]] substances, to physical trauma, to a general medical condition, or to [[dissociative identity disorder]],{{clarify|reason=Confusing.

It is most commonly associated with childhood victims of sexual abuse who learn over time to dissociate memory of the abuse ([[dissociative amnesia]]).\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSymptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion, and once the fugue ends, possible [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], grief, shame and discomfort. People have also experienced a post-fugue anger.<ref>The Merck Manual</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA doctor may suspect dissociative fugue when people seem confused about their identity or are puzzled about their past or when confrontations challenge their new identity or absence of one. The doctor carefully reviews symptoms and does a physical examination to exclude physical disorders that may contribute to or cause memory loss.\n\nSometimes dissociative fugue cannot be diagnosed until people abruptly return to their pre-fugue identity and are distressed to find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances. The diagnosis is usually made retroactively when a doctor reviews the history and collects information that documents the circumstances before people left home, the travel itself, and the establishment of an alternative life.\n\nFunctional amnesia can also be situation specific, varying from all forms and variations of traumas or generally violent experiences, with the person experiencing severe memory loss for a particular trauma. Committing homicide; experiencing or committing a violent crime such as rape or torture; experiencing combat violence; attempting suicide; and being in automobile accidents and natural disasters have all induced cases of situation-specific amnesia (Arrigo & Pezdek, 1997; Kopelman, 2002a). As Kopelman (2002a) notes, however, care must be exercised in interpreting cases of psychogenic amnesia when there are compelling motives to feign memory deficits for legal or financial reasons. However, although some fraction of psychogenic amnesia cases can be explained in this fashion, it is generally acknowledged that true cases are not uncommon. Both global and situationally specific amnesia are often distinguished from the organic amnesic syndrome, in that the capacity to store new memories and experiences remains intact. Given the very delicate and often times dramatic nature of memory loss in these such cases, there usually is a concerted effort to help the person recover their identity and history. This will allow the subject to sometimes be recovered spontaneously when particular cures are encountered.\n\n===Definition===\nThe cause of the fugue state is related to [[Psychogenic amnesia|dissociative amnesia]], (''[[DSM-IV Codes]] 300.12<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psychiatryonline.com/content.aspx?aID=9708 |title=Dissociative Amnesia, DSM-IV Codes 300.12 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ) |publisher=Psychiatryonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>'') which has several other subtypes:<ref>[http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/dissociative_amnesia.htm Dissociative Amnesia, DSM-IV Code 300.12 ( PsychNet-UK.com )] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128192837/http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/dissociative_amnesia.htm |date=November 28, 2010 }}</ref> selective amnesia, generalised amnesia, continuous amnesia, and systematised amnesia, in addition to the subtype ''dissociative fugue''.<ref name=\"DSM-IV_300.13\"/>\n\nUnlike [[retrograde amnesia]] (which is popularly referred to simply as \"amnesia\", the state where someone forgets events before brain damage), dissociative amnesia is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, ''[[DSM-IV Codes]] 291.1 & 292.83'') or a neurological or other general medical condition (e.g., amnestic disorder due to a head trauma, ''[[DSM-IV Codes]] 294.0'').<ref name=\"PsychNet-UK.com\">[http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/_misc/complete_tables.htm Complete List of DSM-IV Codes ( PsychNet-UK.com )] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106174809/http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/_misc/complete_tables.htm |date=January 6, 2011 }}</ref> It is a complex neuropsychological process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dissociation.co.uk/background.asp |title=Background to Dissociation ( The Pottergate Centre for Dissociation & Trauma ) |publisher=Dissociation.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114165147/http://www.dissociation.co.uk/background.asp |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs the person experiencing a dissociative fugue may have recently suffered the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier life trauma, the emergence of an armoring or defensive personality seems to be for some, a logical apprehension of the situation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nTherefore, the terminology ''fugue state'' may carry a slight linguistic distinction from ''[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociative]] fugue'', the former implying a greater degree of ''motion''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} For the purposes of this article then, a ''fugue state'' occurs while one is ''acting out'' a ''dissociative fugue''.\n\nThe [[DSM-IV]] defines<ref name=\"DSM-IV_300.13\"/> as:\n*sudden, unexpected travel away from home or one's customary place of work, with inability to recall one's past\n*confusion about personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity\n*significant distress or impairment\n\nThe ''[[Merck Manual]]''<ref name=\"Merck\">[[Merck Manual]] 1999 section 15 (Psychiatric Disorders), chapter 188 (Dissociative Disorders)</ref> defines ''dissociative fugue'' as:\n\n: One or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one's past and either the loss of one's identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home.\n\nIn support of this definition, the ''Merck Manual''<ref name=\"Merck\"/> further defines dissociative amnesia as:\n\n: An inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe [[DSM-IV-TR]] states that the fugue may have a duration from days to months, and recovery is usually rapid.

AMN discovered a small fire in the basement of his house and left to call for help. On his escape he did not inhale any smoke, and he smashed the cellar door open then immediately ran out of the house. That evening, he appeared dazed and frightened, and the next morning when he awoke, he no longer knew what his profession was nor even where he lived. Approximately three weeks went by and he finally checked himself into a hospital, where AMN was examined by medical professionals. It became clear that his memories extended only until the age of 17. He barely recognized his partner, whom he had known for three years, and he did not recognize his friends or coworkers. AMN immediately underwent therapy. Three weeks later, he reported one of his earliest memories as a child. At the age of four, he saw a car crash, which set another car on fire. He was then witness to the driver\u2019s screams and his agonizing death in the flames, with his head pressed against the window. Since that time, fire had been AMN\u2019s worst fear. Despite the horror, AMN showed normal psychological and physical development and throughout his life showed next to no evidence of psychological illness. A full examination revealed no obvious evidence of any sort of brain damage, although there were signs of greatly reduced metabolism present in memory-related areas. Eight months later, at the time of the report, AMN\u2019s deficits in personal memory remained. It can be observed in the case of AMN that a particular event makes contact with a trauma and triggers a massive reaction. The stressful event can cause a profound loss of personal memory for public events and general knowledge is often intact. Unlike in AMN\u2019s case, amnesia can be global, affecting the entirety of a person\u2019s history. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/27253/InTech-Neuroimaging_and_dissociative_disorders.pdf|title=Neuroimaging and dissassociative disorders|authors=Staniloiu, et.al|publisher=IntechOpen|accessdate=2018-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Psychology}}\n*[[Depersonalization|Depersonalization disorder]] ([[DSM-IV Codes#Dissociative disorders|DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders]] 300.6)\n*[[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation ''(psychology)'']]\n*[[Dissociative disorders]] ([[DSM-IV Codes#Dissociative disorders|DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders]])\n*[[Dissociative identity disorder]] (''formerly'' multiple personality disorder) ([[DSM-IV Codes#Dissociative disorders|DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders]] 300.14)\n*[[Psychogenic amnesia]]; dissociative amnesia (''formerly'' psychogenic amnesia) ([[DSM-IV Codes#Dissociative disorders|DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders]] 300.12)\n*[[Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB     = \n|  ICD10          = {{ICD10|F|44|1|f|40}} \n|  ICD9           = {{ICD9|300.13}} \n|  ICDO           = \n|  OMIM           = \n|  MedlinePlus    = \n|  eMedicineSubj  = \n|  eMedicineTopic = \n|  MeshID         =\n}}\n*\"[http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec07/ch106/ch106c.html Dissociative Fugue]\" from the [[Merck & Co.]] website.\n\n{{Mental and behavioral disorders|selected = neurotic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fugue State}}\n[[Category:Dissociative disorders]]\n[[Category:Memory disorders]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric diagnosis]]\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: Cognition, perception, emotional state and behaviour]]", "sha1": "mm62j0lcrcjqm958sucotlv4ssp3n5t"}}, {"title": "Frames per second", "ns": "0", "id": "10900", "redirect": {"title": "Frame rate"}, "revision": {"id": "764365491", "parentid": "763443636", "timestamp": "2017-02-08T14:35:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kvng", "id": "910180"}, "comment": "rm unnec section link to article lead", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Frame rate]]\n\n[[Category:Units of frequency]]", "sha1": "6vy2teuzbwq9vexw1pj82urk6ntc7w7"}}, {"title": "First-Person Shooter", "ns": "0", "id": "10901", "redirect": {"title": "First-person shooter"}, "revision": {"id": "783862752", "parentid": "290580073", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:51:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[First-person shooter]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "n4fehdbuaxxy7j75z89bz1zbzhvjajr"}}, {"title": "Force", "ns": "0", "id": "10902", "revision": {"id": "866377346", "parentid": "860562593", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T23:58:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ciphers", "id": "7643502"}, "comment": "/* Fundamental forces */ quick ce scan", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description| Any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object }}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{pp-protected|small=yes}}\n\n{{Infobox physical quantity\n| name = Force\n| width =\n| background =\n| image = [[File:Force examples.svg|200px]]\n| caption = Forces can be described as a push or pull on an object.

Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both [[Euclidean vector#Length|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]], making it a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] quantity.  It is measured in the [[SI unit]] of [[newton (unit)|newtons]] and represented by the symbol '''F'''.\n\nThe original form of [[Newton's second law]] states that the net force acting upon an object is equal to the [[time derivative|rate]] at which its [[momentum]] changes with time. If the mass of the object is constant, this law implies that the [[acceleration]] of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on the object, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the [[mass]] of the object.\n\nConcepts related to force include: [[thrust]], which increases the velocity of an object; [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which decreases the velocity of an object; and [[torque]], which produces [[angular acceleration|changes in rotational speed]] of an object. In an extended body, each part usually applies forces on the adjacent parts; the distribution of such forces through the body is the internal [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]]. Such internal mechanical stresses cause no acceleration of that body as the forces balance one another. [[Pressure]], the distribution of many small forces applied over an area of a body, is a simple type of stress that if unbalanced can cause the body to accelerate. Stress usually causes [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solid materials, or flow in [[fluid]]s.\n\n==Development of the concept==\nPhilosophers in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] used the concept of force in the study of [[statics|stationary]] and [[dynamics (physics)|moving]] objects and [[simple machine]]s, but thinkers such as [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]] retained fundamental errors in understanding force.

Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lang|first=Helen S.|title=The order of nature in Aristotle's physics : place and the elements|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman, with help from Julia Budenz.</ref> In this work Newton set out three laws of motion that to this day are the way forces are described in physics.<ref name=\"Principia\"/>\n\n===First law===\n{{main article|Newton's first law}}\nNewton's First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external [[net force]] (resultant force).<ref name=\"Principia\"/> This law is an extension of Galileo's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force (see [[#Dynamic equilibrium|a more detailed description of this below]]). Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate [[inertia]] that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \"natural state\" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \"natural state of rest\". That is, Newton's empirical First Law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity. By making ''rest'' physically indistinguishable from ''non-zero constant velocity'', Newton's First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of [[Galilean relativity|relative velocities]]. Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is \"in motion\" and which object is \"at rest\". The laws of physics are the same in every [[inertial frame of reference]], that is, in all frames related by a [[Galilean transformation]].\n\nFor instance, while traveling in a moving vehicle at a [[wikt:Constant|constant]] [[velocity]], the laws of physics do not change as a result of its motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving [[parabola|parabolic path]] in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be [[Galilean equivalence|physically indistinguishable]]. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.\n\n[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|right|thumb|Though [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s most famous equation is<br>\n<math>\\scriptstyle{\\vec{F}=m\\vec{a}}</math>, he actually wrote down a different form for his second law of motion that did not use [[differential calculus]].]]\n\n===Second law===\n{{main article|Newton's second law}}\nA modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:<ref group=Note>Newton's ''Principia Mathematica'' actually used a finite difference version of this equation based upon ''impulse''.

Forces are resolved and added together to determine their magnitudes and the net force.]]\nSince forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.<ref name=uniphysics_ch2/> As with other physical concepts (e.g. [[temperature]]), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise [[operational definition]]s that are consistent with direct [[sensory perception|observations]] and [[measurement|compared to a standard measurement scale]]. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the [[conceptual definition]] of force offered by [[#Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]].\n\nForces act in a particular [[direction (geometry)|direction]] and have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|sizes]] dependent upon how strong the push or pull is. Because of these characteristics, forces are classified as \"[[Euclidean vector|vector quantities]]\". This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the [[resultant|result]]. If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be. The two people could be pulling against each other as in [[tug of war]] or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. In this simple [[one-dimensional]] example, without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other. Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.\n\nHistorically, forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of [[static equilibrium]] where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive [[Vector (geometric)|vector quantities]]: they have [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and direction.<ref name=uniphysics_ch2/> When two forces act on a [[point particle]], the resulting force, the ''resultant'' (also called the ''[[net force]]''), can be determined by following the [[parallelogram rule]] of [[vector addition]]: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner /> The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.\n\n[[Free-body diagram]]s can be used as a convenient way to keep track of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that [[Vector (geometric)|graphical vector addition]] can be done to determine the net force.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Introduction to Free Body Diagrams\n|work=Physics Tutorial Menu\n|publisher=[[University of Guelph]]\n|url=http://eta.physics.uoguelph.ca/tutorials/fbd/intro.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-02\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116042455/http://eta.physics.uoguelph.ca/tutorials/fbd/intro.html\n|archivedate=2008-01-16\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n\nAs well as being added, forces can also be resolved into independent components at [[right angle]]s to each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of [[basis vector]]s is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions.<ref>{{cite web\n|first=Tom\n|last=Henderson\n|title=The Physics Classroom\n|work=The Physics Classroom and Mathsoft Engineering & Education, Inc.\n|year=2004\n|url=http://www.glenbrook.k12.il.us/GBSSCI/PHYS/Class/vectors/u3l1b.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-02\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101141103/http://www.glenbrook.k12.il.us/gbssci/Phys/Class/vectors/u3l1b.html\n|archivedate=2008-01-01\n|df=\n}}</ref> This is because, for [[orthogonal]] components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===Equilibrium===\n[[Mechanical equilibrium|Equilibrium]] occurs when the resultant force acting on a point particle is zero (that is, the vector sum of all forces is zero). When dealing with an extended body, it is also necessary that the net torque be zero.\n\nThere are two kinds of equilibrium: [[static equilibrium]] and [[#Dynamic equilibrium|dynamic equilibrium]].\n\n===={{anchor|Static equilibrium}}Static====\n{{main article|Statics|Static equilibrium}}\nStatic equilibrium was understood well before the invention of classical mechanics. Objects that are at rest have zero net force acting on them.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Static Equilibrium\n|work=Physics Static Equilibrium (forces and torques)\n|publisher=[[University of the Virgin Islands]]\n|url=http://www.uvi.edu/Physics/SCI3xxWeb/Structure/StaticEq.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019054156/http://www.uvi.edu/Physics/SCI3xxWeb/Structure/StaticEq.html |archivedate=October 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe simplest case of static equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object on a level surface is pulled (attracted) downward toward the center of the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a [[normal force]]). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.<ref name=uniphysics_ch2/>\n\nPushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by [[static friction]], generated between the object and the table surface. For a situation with no movement, the static friction force ''exactly'' balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration. The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.<ref name=uniphysics_ch2/>\n\nA static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces, using simple devices such as [[weighing scale]]s and [[spring balance]]s. For example, an object suspended on a vertical [[spring scale]] experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the \"spring reaction force\", which equals the object's weight. Using such tools, some quantitative force laws were discovered: that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant [[density]] (widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights); [[Archimedes' principle]] for buoyancy; Archimedes' analysis of the [[lever]]; [[Boyle's law]] for gas pressure; and [[Hooke's law]] for springs. These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Three Laws of Motion]].<ref name=uniphysics_ch2/><ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===={{anchor|Dynamical equilibrium|Dynamic equilibrium}}Dynamic====\n{{main article|Dynamics (physics)}}\n[[File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]] was the first to point out the inherent contradictions contained in Aristotle's description of forces.]]\nDynamic equilibrium was first described by [[Galileo]] who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and [[logic]]. Galileo realized that [[Galilean relativity|simple velocity addition]] demands that the concept of an \"absolute [[rest frame]]\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant [[velocity]] was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.<ref name=\"Galileo\"/>\n\nMoreover, any object traveling at a constant velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This is the definition of dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity.\n\nA simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with [[kinetic friction]]. In such a situation, a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===Forces in quantum mechanics===\n{{main article|Quantum mechanics|Pauli principle}}\nThe notion \"force\" keeps its meaning in [[quantum mechanics]], though one is now dealing with operators  instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian equations]]. This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes \"quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions. This is, of course, difficult to imagine in the context of \"forces\". However, the [[potential]]s V(x,y,z) or [[field (physics)|field]]s, from which the forces generally can be derived, are treated similarly to classical position variables, i.e., <math>V(x,y,z)\\to {\\hat V}(\\hat x,\\hat y,\\hat z)</math>.\n\nThis becomes different only in the framework of [[quantum field theory]], where these fields are also quantized.\n\nHowever, already in quantum mechanics there is one \"caveat\", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete  intrinsic [[angular momentum|angular momentum-like]] variable called the \"[[Spin (physics)|spin]]\", and there is the [[Pauli principle]] relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s.  If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a ''symmetric'' spin function (e.g.  parallel spins) the spatial variables must be ''antisymmetric'' (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel ''spins'' the ''position variables'' must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.\n\nThus the notion \"force\" loses already part of its meaning.\n\n===Feynman diagrams===\n{{main article|Feynman diagrams}}\n[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|right|Feynman diagram for the decay of a neutron into a proton. The [[W boson]] is between two vertices indicating a repulsion.]]\nIn modern [[particle physics]], forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying [[gauge boson]]s. With the development of [[quantum field theory]] and [[general relativity]], it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from [[conservation of momentum]] ([[4-momentum]] in relativity and momentum of [[virtual particle]]s in [[quantum electrodynamics]]). The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of [[space]] and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force. Thus the currently known [[fundamental forces]] are considered more accurately to be \"[[fundamental interactions]]\".<ref name=\"final theory\">{{cite book|last=Weinberg |first=S. |year=1994 |title=Dreams of a Final Theory |publisher=Vintage Books USA |isbn=0-679-74408-8}}</ref>{{rp|199\u2013128}} When particle A emits (creates) or absorbs (annihilates) virtual particle B, a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A' exchanging by B. This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see [[world line]]) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines. Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and, in the case of virtual particle exchange, are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.<ref name=Shifman>{{cite book |first=Mikhail |last=Shifman |title=ITEP lectures on particle physics and field theory |publisher=World Scientific |year=1999 |isbn=981-02-2639-X}}</ref>\n\nThe utility of Feynman diagrams is that other types of physical phenomena that are part of the general picture of [[fundamental interaction]]s but are conceptually separate from forces can also be described using the same rules. For example, a Feynman diagram can describe in succinct detail how a [[neutron]] [[beta decay|decays]] into an [[electron]], [[proton]], and [[neutrino]], an interaction mediated by the same gauge boson that is responsible for the [[weak nuclear force]].<ref name=\"Shifman\"/>\n\n==Fundamental forces==\n{{main article|Fundamental interaction}} \n\nAll of the known forces o the universe are classified into four [[fundamental interaction]]s. The [[strong force|strong]] and the [[weak force|weak]] forces are [[nuclear force]]s that act only at very short distances, and are responsible for the interactions between [[subatomic particle]]s, including [[nucleon]]s and compound [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. The [[electromagnetic force]] acts between [[electric charge]]s, and the [[gravitational force]] acts between [[mass]]es. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, [[friction]] is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between [[atoms]] of two surfaces, and the [[Pauli exclusion principle]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Pauli Exclusion Principle |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/pauli.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref> which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in [[spring (device)|springs]], modeled by [[Hooke's law]], are the result of electromagnetic forces and the [[Exclusion Principle]] acting together to return an object to its [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] position. [[Centrifugal force (fictitious)|Centrifugal forces]] are [[acceleration]] forces that arise simply from the acceleration of [[rotation|rotating]] [[frames of reference]].<ref name=FeynmanVol1/>{{rp|12-11}}<ref name=Kleppner/>{{rp|359}}\n\nThe fundamental theories for forces developed from the [[Unified field theory|unification]] of different ideas. For example, Sir. [[Isaac Newton]] unified, with his universal theory of [[gravitation]], the force responsible for objects falling near the surface of the [[Earth]] with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the [[Moon]]) and around the Sun (the planets). [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of [[quantum mechanics]] led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter ([[fermion]]s) interacting by exchanging [[virtual particle]]s called [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fermions & Bosons |work=The Particle Adventure |url=http://particleadventure.org/frameless/fermibos.html |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218074732/http://particleadventure.org/frameless/fermibos.html |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }}</ref> This [[standard model]] of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in [[electroweak]] theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved [[Higgs mechanism]], but observations such as [[neutrino oscillation]]s suggest that the standard model is incomplete. A [[Grand Unified Theory]] that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as [[supersymmetry]] proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding [[unsolved problems in physics]]. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a [[theory of everything]]. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is [[string theory]].<ref name=\"final theory\"/>{{rp|212\u2013219}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|+ '''The four fundamental forces of nature'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpepphysics.org/cpep_sm_large.html |title=Standard model of particles and interactions|publisher=Contemporary Physics Education Project |date=2000 |accessdate=2 January 2017  |df= }}</ref>\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\"| Property/Interaction\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;background-color:#8585C2\"|Gravitation\n!style=\"background-color:#F012F0\"|Weak\n!style=\"background-color:#FF4D4D\"|Electromagnetic\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;background-color:#99B280\"|Strong\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;background-color:#FF9999\"| <small>(Electroweak)</small>\n!style=\"background-color:#CCD8C0\"|<small>Fundamental</small>\n!style=\"background-color:#F0F3EC\"|<small>Residual</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFFF6\"|Acts on:\n|align=\"center\"|Mass - Energy\n|align=\"center\"|Flavor\n|align=\"center\"|Electric charge\n|align=\"center\"|Color charge\n|align=\"center\"|Atomic nuclei\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFFF6\"|Particles experiencing:\n|align=\"center\"|All\n|align=\"center\"|Quarks, leptons\n|align=\"center\"|Electrically charged\n|align=\"center\"|Quarks, Gluons\n|align=\"center\"|Hadrons\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFFF6\"|Particles mediating:\n|align=\"center\"|Graviton <br /><small>(not yet observed)</small>\n|align=\"center\"|W<sup>+</sup>  W<sup>\u2212</sup>  Z<sup>0</sup>\n|align=\"center\"|\u03b3\n|align=\"center\"|Gluons\n|align=\"center\"|Mesons\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFFF6\"|Strength in the scale of quarks:\n|align=\"center\"|{{val||e=-41}}\n|align=\"center\"|{{val||e=-4}}\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|<small>Not applicable <br />to quarks</small>\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#FFFFF6\"|Strength in the scale of <br />protons/neutrons:\n|align=\"center\"|{{val||e=-36}}\n|align=\"center\"|{{val||e=-7}}\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|<small>Not applicable <br />to hadrons</small>\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|}\n\n===Gravitational===\n{{main article|Gravity}}\n[[File:Falling ball.jpg|upright|thumb|Images of a freely falling basketball taken with a [[stroboscope]] at 20 flashes per second.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the [[acceleration]] of every object in [[free-fall]] was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this [[Gravitational acceleration|acceleration due to gravity]] towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{g}</math> and has a magnitude of about 9.81 [[meter]]s per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=A. H. |journal=Nature |title=A New Absolute Determination of the Acceleration due to Gravity at the National Physical Laboratory |date=1965|doi=10.1038/208279a0 |page=279 |volume=208 |bibcode=1965Natur.208..279C |issue=5007}}</ref> This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of <math>m</math> will experience a force:\n:<math>\\vec{F} = m\\vec{g}</math>\n\nFor an object in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, the force of gravity is opposed by the reaction forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a [[normal force]] (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\nNewton's contribution to gravitational theory was to unify the motions of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed were in a natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a [[Newton's law of gravity|law of gravity]] that could account for the celestial motions that had been described earlier using [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]].<ref name=uniphysics_ch4 />\n\nNewton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances. In particular, Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an [[inverse square law]]. Further, Newton realized that the acceleration of a body due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the other attracting body.<ref name=uniphysics_ch4 /> Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass (<math>\\scriptstyle m_\\oplus</math>) and the radius (<math>\\scriptstyle R_\\oplus</math>) of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration:\n:<math>\\vec{g}=-\\frac{Gm_\\oplus}{{R_\\oplus}^2} \\hat{r}</math>\n\nwhere the vector direction is given by <math>\\hat{r}</math>, is the [[unit vector]] directed outward from the center of the Earth.<ref name=\"Principia\"/>\n\nIn this equation, a dimensional constant <math>G</math> is used to describe the relative strength of gravity. This constant has come to be known as [[Newton's Universal Gravitation Constant]],<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Sir Isaac Newton: The Universal Law of Gravitation\n|work=Astronomy 161 The Solar System\n|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> though its value was unknown in Newton's lifetime. Not until 1798 was [[Henry Cavendish]] able to make the first measurement of <math>G</math> using a [[torsion balance]]; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing <math>G</math> could allow one to solve for the Earth's mass given the above equation. Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same [[Kepler's laws|laws of motion]], his law of gravity had to be universal. Succinctly stated, [[Newton's Law of Gravitation]] states that the force on a spherical object of mass <math>m_1</math> due to the gravitational pull of mass <math>m_2</math> is\n:<math>\\vec{F}=-\\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^2} \\hat{r}</math>\n\nwhere <math>r</math> is the distance between the two objects' centers of mass and <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat{r}</math> is the unit vector pointed in the direction away from the center of the first object toward the center of the second object.<ref name=\"Principia\"/>\n\nThis formula was powerful enough to stand as the basis for all subsequent descriptions of motion within the solar system until the 20th century.

In GR, gravitation is not viewed as a force, but rather, objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in [[geodesic|straight lines]] through [[curved space-time]] \u2013 defined as the shortest space-time path between two space-time events. From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ''[[external ballistics|ballistic]] [[trajectory]]'' of the object. For example, a [[basketball]] thrown from the ground moves in a [[parabola]], as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] of the order of few [[light-year]]s). The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as \"gravitational force\".<ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===Electromagnetic===\n{{main article|Electromagnetic force}}\nThe [[electrostatic force]] was first described in 1784 by Coulomb as a force that existed intrinsically between two [[electric charge|charges]].<ref name=Cutnell/>{{rp|519}} The properties of the electrostatic force were that it varied as an [[inverse square law]] directed in the [[polar coordinates|radial direction]], was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]), was independent of the mass of the charged objects, and followed the [[superposition principle]]. [[Coulomb's law]] unifies all these observations into one succinct statement.<ref name=\"Coulomb\">{{cite journal |first=Charles |last=Coulomb |journal=Histoire de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences |year=1784 |title=Recherches th\u00e9oriques et exp\u00e9rimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l'\u00e9lasticit\u00e9 des fils de metal |pages=229\u2013269}}</ref>\n\nSubsequent mathematicians and physicists found the construct of the ''[[electric field]]'' to be useful for determining the electrostatic force on an electric charge at any point in space. The electric field was based on using a hypothetical \"[[test charge]]\" anywhere in space and then using Coulomb's Law to determine the electrostatic force.<ref name=FeynmanVol2/>{{rp|4-6 to 4-8}} Thus the electric field anywhere in space is defined as\n:<math>\\vec{E} = {\\vec{F} \\over{q}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>q</math> is the magnitude of the hypothetical test charge.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Lorentz force]] of [[magnetism]] was discovered to exist between two [[electric current]]s. It has the same mathematical character as Coulomb's Law with the proviso that like currents attract and unlike currents repel. Similar to the electric field, the [[magnetic field]] can be used to determine the magnetic force on an electric current at any point in space. In this case, the magnitude of the magnetic field was determined to be\n:<math>B = {F \\over{I \\ell}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>I</math> is the magnitude of the hypothetical test current and <math>\\scriptstyle \\ell</math> is the length of hypothetical wire through which the test current flows. The magnetic field exerts a force on all [[magnet]]s including, for example, those used in [[compass]]es. The fact that the [[geomagnetism|Earth's magnetic field]] is aligned closely with the orientation of the Earth's [[rotation|axis]] causes compass magnets to become oriented because of the magnetic force pulling on the needle.\n\nThrough combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge, a rule of [[Cross product|vector multiplication]] called [[Lorentz force|Lorentz's Law]] describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field.<ref name=FeynmanVol2/> The connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified ''electromagnetic force'' that acts on a charge. This force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force (due to the electric field) and the magnetic force (due to the magnetic field). Fully stated, this is the law:\n:<math>\\vec{F} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B})</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{F}</math> is the electromagnetic force, <math>q</math> is the magnitude of the charge of the particle, <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{E}</math> is the electric field, <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{v}</math> is the [[velocity]] of the particle that is [[cross product|crossed]] with the magnetic field (<math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{B}</math>).\n\nThe origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when [[James Clerk Maxwell]] unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations, which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by [[Oliver Heaviside]] and [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Polarized light in liquid crystals and polymers\n|first1=Toralf\n|last1=Scharf\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=2007\n|isbn=0-471-74064-0\n|page=19\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CQNE13opFucC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CQNE13opFucC&pg=PA19 Chapter 2, p. 19]</ref> These \"[[Maxwell Equations]]\" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges, and the interactions of the fields themselves. This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be \"self-generating\" through a [[wave]] that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the [[speed of light]]. This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with [[optics]] and led directly to a complete description of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n|first=William |last=Duffin\n|title=Electricity and Magnetism, 3rd Ed.\n|publisher=McGraw-Hill\n|pages=364\u2013383\n|year=1980\n|isbn=0-07-084111-X}}</ref>\n\nHowever, attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations, the [[photoelectric effect]], and the nonexistence of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]], proved troublesome. Through the work of leading theoretical physicists, a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics. This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to [[quantum electrodynamics]] (or QED), which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave\u2013particles known as [[photon]]s. In QED, photons are the fundamental exchange particle, which described all interactions relating to electromagnetism including the electromagnetic force.<ref group=Note>For a complete library on quantum mechanics see [[Quantum mechanics#References|Quantum mechanics \u2013 References]]</ref>\n\n===Strong nuclear===\n{{main article|Strong interaction}}\nThere are two \"[[nuclear force]]s\", which today are usually described as interactions that take place in quantum theories of particle physics.

The (aptly named) strong interaction is the \"strongest\" of the four fundamental forces.\n\nThe strong force only acts ''directly'' upon elementary particles. However, a residual of the force is observed between [[hadron]]s (the best known example being the force that acts between [[nucleon]]s in atomic nuclei) as the [[nuclear force]]. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho [[meson]]s, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for [[free quark]]s has shown that the elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called [[color confinement]].\n\n===Weak nuclear===\n{{Main article|Weak interaction}}\nThe weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy [[W and Z bosons]]. Its most familiar effect is [[beta decay]] (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated [[radioactivity]]. The word \"weak\" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 10<sup>13</sup> times less than that of the [[strong force]]. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;[[kelvin]]s. Such temperatures have been probed in modern [[particle accelerator]]s and show the conditions of the [[universe]] in the early moments of the [[Big Bang]].\n\n==Non-fundamental forces==\nSome forces are consequences of the fundamental ones. In such situations, idealized models can be utilized to gain physical insight.\n\n===Normal force===\n[[File:Incline.svg|right|thumb|''F<sub>N</sub>'' represents the [[normal force]] exerted on the object.]]\n{{main article|Normal force}}\nThe normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to [[fermion]]ic nature of [[electron]]s) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the surface interface between two objects.<ref name=Cutnell/>{{rp|93}} The normal force, for example, is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===Friction===\n{{main article|Friction}}\nFriction is a surface force that opposes relative motion. The frictional force is directly related to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: [[static friction]] and [[kinetic friction]].\n\nThe static friction force (<math>F_{\\mathrm{sf}}</math>) will exactly oppose forces applied to an object parallel to a surface contact up to the limit specified by the [[coefficient of static friction]] (<math>\\mu_{\\mathrm{sf}}</math>) multiplied by the normal force (<math>F_N</math>). In other words, the magnitude of the static friction force satisfies the inequality:\n:<math>0 \\le F_{\\mathrm{sf}} \\le \\mu_{\\mathrm{sf}} F_\\mathrm{N}.</math>\n\nThe kinetic friction force (<math>F_{\\mathrm{kf}}</math>) is independent of both the forces applied and the movement of the object. Thus, the magnitude of the force equals:\n:<math>F_{\\mathrm{kf}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{kf}} F_\\mathrm{N},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_{\\mathrm{kf}}</math> is the [[coefficient of kinetic friction]]. For most surface interfaces, the coefficient of kinetic friction is less than the coefficient of static friction.\n\n===Tension===\n{{main article|Tension (physics)}}\nTension forces can be modeled using [[ideal string]]s that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be combined with ideal [[pulley]]s, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Tension Force\n|work=Non-Calculus Based Physics I\n|url=http://www.mtsu.edu/~phys2010/Lectures/Part_2__L6_-_L11/Lecture_9/Tension_Force/tension_force.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an [[mechanical advantage|increase in force]], there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the [[conservation of energy|conservation of mechanical energy]] since the [[#Kinematic integrals|work done on the load]] is the same no matter how complicated the machine.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner /><ref>{{cite web\n|last=Fitzpatrick\n|first=Richard\n|title=Strings, pulleys, and inclines\n|date=2006-02-02\n|url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/301/lectures/node48.html\n|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Elastic force===\n{{main article|Elasticity (physics)|Hooke's law}}\n[[File:Mass-spring-system.png|upright|thumb|''F<sub>k</sub>'' is the force that responds to the load on the spring]]\nAn elastic force acts to return a [[Spring (device)|spring]] to its natural length.

However, in real life, matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object. For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow, contract, expand, or otherwise change shape, the theories of [[continuum mechanics]] describe the way forces affect the material. For example, in extended [[fluid mechanics|fluids]], differences in [[pressure]] result in forces being directed along the pressure [[gradient]]s as follows:\n:<math>\\frac{\\vec{F}}{V} = - \\vec{\\nabla} P</math>\n\nwhere <math>V</math> is the volume of the object in the fluid and <math>P</math> is the [[scalar function]] that describes the pressure at all locations in space. Pressure gradients and differentials result in the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] for fluids suspended in gravitational fields, winds in [[atmospheric science]], and the [[lift (physics)|lift]] associated with [[aerodynamics]] and [[flight]].<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\nA specific instance of such a force that is associated with [[dynamic pressure]] is fluid resistance: a body force that resists the motion of an object through a fluid due to [[viscosity]]. For so-called \"[[Drag (physics)#Very low Reynolds numbers\u2014Stokes' drag|Stokes' drag]]\" the force is approximately proportional to the velocity, but opposite in direction:\n:<math>\\vec{F}_\\mathrm{d} = - b \\vec{v} \\,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:<math>b</math> is a constant that depends on the properties of the fluid and the dimensions of the object (usually the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional area]]), and\n:<math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{v}</math> is the velocity of the object.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\nMore formally, forces in [[continuum mechanics]] are fully described by a [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]\u2013[[tensor]] with terms that are roughly defined as\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math> is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the [[matrix diagonal]]s of the tensor) as well as [[Shear stress|shear]] terms associated with forces that act [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all [[strain (physics)|strains]] (deformations) including also [[tensile stress]]es and [[compression (physical)|compressions]].<ref name=uniphysics_ch2>''University Physics'', Sears, Young & Zemansky, pp.18\u201338</ref><ref name=Kleppner>{{harvnb|Kleppner|Kolenkow|2010}}</ref>{{rp|133\u2013134}}<ref name=FeynmanVol2>{{harvnb|Feynman volume 2}}</ref>{{rp|38-1\u201338-11}}\n\n===Fictitious forces===\n{{main article|Fictitious forces}}\nThere are forces that are [[frame dependent]], meaning that they appear due to the adoption of non-Newtonian (that is, [[non-inertial frame|non-inertial]]) [[Frame of reference|reference frames]].

As an extension, [[Kaluza\u2013Klein theory]] and [[string theory]] ascribe electromagnetism and the other [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] respectively to the curvature of differently scaled dimensions, which would ultimately imply that all forces are fictitious.\n\n==Rotations and torque==\n[[File:Torque animation.gif|frame|right|Relationship between force (F), torque (\u03c4), and [[angular momentum|momentum]] vectors (p and L) in a rotating system.]]\n{{main article|Torque}}\nForces that cause extended objects to rotate are associated with [[torque]]s. Mathematically, the torque of a force <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{F}</math> is defined relative to an arbitrary reference point as the [[cross-product]]:\n:<math>\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{r}</math> is the [[position vector]] of the force application point relative to the reference point.\n\nTorque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that [[angle]] is the rotational equivalent for [[position (vector)|position]], [[angular velocity]] for [[velocity]], and [[angular momentum]] for [[momentum]]. As a consequence of Newton's First Law of Motion, there exists [[rotational inertia]] that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque. Likewise, Newton's Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous [[angular acceleration]] of the rigid body:\n:<math>\\vec{\\tau} = I\\vec{\\alpha}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>I</math> is the [[moment of inertia]] of the body\n:<math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{\\alpha}</math> is the angular acceleration of the body.\n\nThis provides a definition for the moment of inertia, which is the rotational equivalent for mass. In more advanced treatments of mechanics, where the rotation over a time interval is described, the moment of inertia must be substituted by the [[Moment of inertia tensor|tensor]] that, when properly analyzed, fully determines the characteristics of rotations including [[precession]] and [[nutation]].\n\nEquivalently, the differential form of Newton's Second Law provides an alternative definition of torque:\n:<math>\\vec{\\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{L}}{\\mathrm{dt}},</math><ref>{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Newton's 2nd Law: Rotation |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/HBASE/n2r.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref> where <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{L}</math> is the angular momentum of the particle.\n\nNewton's Third Law of Motion requires that all objects exerting torques themselves experience equal and opposite torques,<ref>{{cite web |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Richard |title=Newton's third law of motion |date=2007-01-07 |url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/lectures/node26.html |accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> and therefore also directly implies the [[conservation of angular momentum]] for closed systems that experience rotations and [[revolution]]s through the action of internal torques.\n\n===Centripetal force===\n{{main article|Centripetal force}}\nFor an object accelerating in circular motion, the unbalanced force acting on the object equals:<ref>{{cite web |last=Nave |first=Carl Rod |title=Centripetal Force |work=HyperPhysics |publisher=University of Guelph |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/cf.html |accessdate=2013-10-28}}</ref>\n:<math>\\vec{F} = - \\frac{mv^2 \\hat{r}}{r}</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the mass of the object, <math>v</math> is the velocity of the object and <math>r</math> is the distance to the center of the circular path and <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat{r}</math> is the [[unit vector]] pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center. This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path. Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the [[speed]] of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path. This yields both the tangential force, which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up, and the radial (centripetal) force, which changes its direction.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n==Kinematic integrals==\n{{main article|Impulse (physics)|l1=Impulse|Mechanical work|Power (physics)}}\nForces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by [[integration (calculus)|integrating]] with respect to [[kinematics|kinematic variables]].

For instance, the gravitational force acting upon an object can be seen as the action of the [[gravitational field]] that is present at the object's location. Restating mathematically the definition of energy (via the definition of [[Mechanical work|work]]), a potential [[scalar field]] <math>\\scriptstyle{U(\\vec{r})}</math> is defined as that field whose [[gradient]] is equal and opposite to the force produced at every point:\n:<math>\\vec{F}=-\\vec{\\nabla} U.</math>\n\nForces can be classified as [[Conservative force|conservative]] or nonconservative. Conservative forces are equivalent to the gradient of a [[potential]] while nonconservative forces are not.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n===Conservative forces===\n{{main article|Conservative force}}\nA conservative force that acts on a [[closed system]] has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] or [[potential energy|potential]] forms. This means that for a closed system, the net [[mechanical energy]] is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space,<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Singh\n|first=Sunil Kumar\n|title=Conservative force\n|work=Connexions\n|date=2007-08-25\n|url=http://cnx.org/content/m14104/latest/\n|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref> and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the [[contour map]] of the elevation of an area.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\nConservative forces include [[gravity]], the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] force, and the [[Hooke's law|spring]] force.

This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the [[atom]]s, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other [[contact force]]s, [[Tension (physics)|tension]], [[Physical compression|compression]], and [[drag (physics)|drag]]. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\nThe connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with [[statistical mechanics]]. In macroscopic closed systems, nonconservative forces act to change the [[internal energy|internal energies]] of the system, and are often associated with the transfer of heat. According to the [[Second law of thermodynamics]], nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as [[entropy]] increases.<ref name=FeynmanVol1 /><ref name=Kleppner />\n\n==Units of measurement==\nThe [[SI]] unit of force is the [[Newton (unit)|newton]] (symbol N), which is the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared, or {{math|kg\u00b7m\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.<ref name= metric_units>{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Wandmacher |first2=Arnold |last2=Johnson |title=Metric Units in Engineering |page=15 |year=1995 |publisher=ASCE Publications |isbn=0-7844-0070-9}}</ref> The corresponding [[CGS]] unit is the [[dyne]], the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared, or {{math|g\u00b7cm\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>}}.

The kilogram-force is not a part of the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and engine output torque. Other arcane units of force include the [[sth\u00e8ne]], which is equivalent to 1000&nbsp;N, and the [[kip (unit)|kip]], which is equivalent to 1000&nbsp;lbf.\n\n{{units of force|center=yes|cat=no}}\n\nSee also [[Ton-force]].\n\n==Force measurement==\nSee [[force gauge]], [[spring scale]], [[load cell]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Physics}}\n* [[Orders of magnitude (force)]]\n* [[Parallel force]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=uniphysics_ch4>Young, Hugh; Freedman, Roger; Sears, Francis and Zemansky, Mark (1949) ''[[University Physics]]''.

Other divisions can be made.]]\nIn [[organic chemistry]], '''functional groups''' are specific [[substituent]]s or [[moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] within [[molecule]]s that are responsible for the characteristic [[chemical reaction]]s of those molecules. The same functional group will undergo the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of the molecule it is a part of.<ref>[[Compendium of Chemical Terminology]] (IUPAC \"Gold Book\") http://goldbook.iupac.org/F02555.html</ref><ref>{{JerryMarch}}</ref> This allows for systematic prediction of chemical reactions and behavior of chemical compounds and design of [[Chemical synthesis|chemical syntheses]]. Furthermore, the reactivity of a functional group can be modified by other functional groups nearby. In [[organic synthesis]], [[functional group interconversion]] is one of the basic types of transformations. \n\nFunctional groups are groups of one or more atoms of distinctive chemical properties no matter what they are attached to. The atoms of functional groups are linked to each other and to the rest of the molecule by [[covalent bond]]s. For repeating units of polymers, functional groups attach to their nonpolar core of carbon atoms and thus add chemical character to carbon chains. Functional groups can also be charged, e.g. in carboxylate salts (\u2013COO<sup>\u2212</sup>), which turns the molecule into a [[polyatomic ion]] or a [[Coordination complex|complex ion]]. Functional groups binding to a central atom in a coordination complex are called ''[[ligand]]s''. [[Coordination complex|Complexation]] and [[solvation]] are also caused by specific interactions of functional groups. In the common rule of thumb \"like dissolves like\", it is the shared or mutually well-interacting functional groups which give rise to [[solubility]]. For example, sugar dissolves in water because both share the hydroxyl functional group (\u2013OH) and hydroxyls interact strongly with each other. Plus, when functional groups are more electronegative than atoms they attach to, the functional groups will become polar, and the otherwise nonpolar molecules containing these functional groups become polar and so become soluble in some aqueous environment. \n\nCombining the names of functional groups with the names of the parent [[alkane]]s generates what is termed a [[systematic name|systematic nomenclature]] for naming [[organic compound]]s. In traditional nomenclature, the first [[carbon]] atom after the carbon that attaches to the functional group is called the [[alpha carbon]]; the second, beta carbon, the third, gamma carbon, etc. If there is another functional group at a carbon, it may be named with the Greek letter, e.g., the gamma-amine in [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] is on the third carbon of the carbon chain attached to the carboxylic acid group. IUPAC conventions call for numeric labeling of the position, e.g. 4-aminobutanoic acid. In traditional names various qualifiers are used to label isomers,  for example, isopropanol (IUPAC name: propan-2-ol) is an isomer of n-propanol (propan-1-ol).\n\n== Table of common functional groups ==\nThe following is a list of common functional groups.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Theodore | title = Chemistry : the central science | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = Upper Saddle River, NJ | year = 2002 | isbn = 0130669970 |page=1001 }}</ref> In the formulas, the symbols R and R' usually denote an attached hydrogen, or a [[hydrocarbon]] [[side chain]] of any length, but may sometimes refer to any group of atoms.\n\n=== Hydrocarbons ===\nFunctional groups, called [[wikt:hydrocarbyl|hydrocarbyl]], that contain only carbon and hydrogen, but vary in the number and order of double bonds.

Carbocations are often named ''-um''. Examples are [[tropylium]] and [[triphenylmethyl]] cations and the [[cyclopentadienyl]] anion.\n\n=== Groups containing halogen ===\nHaloalkanes are a class of molecule that is defined by a carbon\u2013[[halogen]] bond. This bond can be relatively weak (in the case of an iodoalkane) or quite stable (as in the case of a fluoroalkane). In general, with the exception of [[Fluorination|fluorinated]] compounds, haloalkanes readily undergo [[nucleophilic  substitution]] reactions or [[elimination reaction]]s. The substitution on the carbon, the acidity of an adjacent proton, the solvent conditions, etc. all can influence the outcome of the reactivity.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background: #ffffff; text-align: center;width:550px\"\n|-\n!

The mathematical concept is difficult to define formally, even for mathematicians, but key features can be understood with little mathematical background.\n\nThe feature of \"self-similarity\", for instance, is easily understood by analogy to zooming in with a lens or other device that zooms in on digital images to uncover finer, previously invisible, new structure. If this is done on fractals, however, no new detail appears; nothing changes and the same pattern repeats over and over, or for some fractals, nearly the same pattern reappears over and over.<ref name=\"Boeing2016Systems\" /> Self-similarity itself is not necessarily counter-intuitive (e.g., people have pondered self-similarity informally such as in the [[infinite regress]] in parallel mirrors or the [[homunculus]], the little man inside the head of the little man inside the head ...). The difference for fractals is that the pattern reproduced must be detailed.<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\" />{{rp|166; 18}}<ref name=\"Falconer\" /><ref name=\"Mandelbrot quote\" />\n\nThis idea of being detailed relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or [[fractal dimension]] greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a fractal scales compared to how geometric [[shapes]] are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 the length of the original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same [[reason]] as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a fractal dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The fractal curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its [[fractal dimension]].\n\nThis also leads to understanding a third feature, that fractals as mathematical equations are \"nowhere [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]\". In a concrete sense, this means fractals cannot be measured in traditional ways.<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\" /><ref name=\"vicsek\" /><ref name=\"Gordon\" /> To elaborate, in trying to find the length of a wavy non-fractal curve, one could find straight segments of some measuring tool small enough to lay end to end over the waves, where the pieces could get small enough to be considered to conform to the curve in the normal manner of [[rectifiable curve|measuring]] with a tape measure. But in measuring a wavy fractal curve such as the Koch snowflake, one would never find a small enough straight segment to conform to the curve, because the wavy pattern would always re-appear, albeit at a smaller size, essentially pulling a little more of the tape measure into the total length measured each time one attempted to fit it tighter and tighter to the curve.<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\" />\n\n{{anchor|history|koch}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Von Koch curve.gif|thumb|upright|A [[Koch snowflake]] is a fractal that begins with an equilateral triangle and then replaces the middle third of every line segment with a pair of line segments that form an equilateral bump]]\nThe history of fractals traces a path from chiefly theoretical studies to modern applications in computer graphics, with several notable people contributing canonical fractal forms along the way.<ref name=\"classics\">{{cite book | last=Edgar | first=Gerald | title=Classics on Fractals | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, CO | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-8133-4153-8 }}</ref><ref name=\"MacTutor\">{{cite web\n |title=A History of Fractal Geometry \n |work=MacTutor History of Mathematics \n |last=Trochet \n |first=Holly \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DCT2znx?url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/fractals.html \n |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/fractals.html \n |archivedate=February 4, 2012 \n |year=2009 \n |deadurl=yes \n |df= \n}}</ref> According to Pickover, the mathematics behind fractals began to take shape in the 17th century when the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] pondered [[recursion|recursive]] [[self-similarity]] (although he made the mistake of thinking that only the [[straight line]] was self-similar in this sense).<ref name=\"Pickover\">{{cite book |page=310 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JrslMKTgSZwC&pg=PA310&dq=fractal+koch+curve+book#v=onepage&q=fractal%20koch%20curve%20book&f=false |first=Clifford A. |last=Pickover \n|title=The Math Book: From Pythagoras to the 57th Dimension, 250 Milestones in the History of Mathematics |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-1-4027-5796-9 }}</ref> In his writings, Leibniz used the term \"fractional exponents\", but lamented that \"Geometry\" did not yet know of them.<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\" />{{rp|405}} Indeed, according to various historical accounts, after that point few mathematicians tackled the issues, and the work of those who did remained obscured largely because of resistance to such unfamiliar emerging concepts, which were sometimes referred to as mathematical \"monsters\".<ref name=\"Gordon\" /><ref name=\"classics\" /><ref name=\"MacTutor\" /> Thus, it was not until two centuries had passed that on July 18, 1872 [[Karl Weierstrass]] presented the first definition of a [[Weierstrass function|function]] with a [[Graph of a function|graph]] that would today be considered a fractal, having the non-[[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] property of being everywhere [[continuous function|continuous]] but [[nowhere differentiable]] at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences.<ref name=\"classics\" />{{rp|7}}<ref name=\"MacTutor\" /> In addition, the quotient difference becomes arbitrarily large as the summation index increases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/fractals.html|title=Fractal Geometry|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-04-11}}</ref> Not long after that, in 1883, [[Georg Cantor]], who attended lectures by Weierstrass,<ref name=\"MacTutor\" /> published examples of [[subset]]s of the real line known as [[Cantor set]]s, which had unusual properties and are now recognized as fractals.<ref name=\"classics\" />{{rp|11\u201324}} Also in the last part of that century, [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] introduced a category of fractal that has come to be called \"self-inverse\" fractals.<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\" />{{rp|166}}\n\n{{anchor|julia}}\n[[Image:Julia set (indigo).png|thumb|upright|A [[Julia set]], a fractal related to the Mandelbrot set]]\n[[File:Fractal tree.gif|thumb|A [[Sierpinski triangle]] can be generated by a fractal tree.]]\nOne of the next milestones came in 1904, when [[Helge von Koch]], extending ideas of Poincar\u00e9 and dissatisfied with Weierstrass's abstract and analytic definition, gave a more geometric definition including hand drawn images of a similar function, which is now called the [[Koch snowflake]].<ref name=\"classics\" />{{rp|25}}<ref name=\"MacTutor\" /> Another milestone came a decade later in 1915, when [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski]] constructed his famous [[Sierpinski triangle|triangle]] then, one year later, his [[Sierpinski carpet|carpet]].

Models may simulate theoretical fractals or [[#fractals in nature|natural phenomena with fractal features]]. The outputs of the modelling process may be highly artistic renderings, outputs for investigation, or benchmarks for [[fractal analysis]]. Some specific applications of fractals to technology are listed [[#fractals in technology|elsewhere]]. Images and other outputs of modelling are normally referred to as being \"fractals\" even if they do not have strictly fractal characteristics, such as when it is possible to zoom into a region of the fractal image that does not exhibit any fractal properties.

Fluids are a [[Phase (matter)|phases]] of [[matter]] and include [[liquid]]s, gases, [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], and to some extent, [[plasticity (physics)|plastic solids]]. Fluids are [[Matter|substances]] that have zero [[shear modulus]], or, in simpler terms, a fluid is a substance which cannot resist any [[shear force]] applied to it. \n\nAlthough the term \"fluid\" includes both the liquid and gas phases, in common usage, \"fluid\" is often used as a synonym for \"liquid\", with no implication that gas could also be present. For example, \"[[brake fluid]]\" is [[hydraulic oil]] and will not perform its required [[incompressible]] function if there is gas in it. This colloquial usage of the term is also common in medicine and in nutrition (\"take plenty of fluids\").\n\nLiquids form a [[free surface]] (that is, a surface not created by the container) while gases do not. The distinction between [[solid|solids]] and fluid is not entirely obvious. The distinction is made by evaluating the [[viscosity]] of the substance.  [[Silly Putty]] can be considered to behave like a solid or a fluid, depending on the time period over which it is observed.  It is best described as a [[viscoelastic]] fluid. There are many examples of substances proving difficult to classify. A particularly interesting one is [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]], as demonstrated in the [[pitch drop experiment]] currently running at the [[University of Queensland]].\n\n==Physics== \nFluids display properties such as:\n* not resisting permanent deformation, resisting only [[viscosity|relative rates of deformation]] in a dissipative, frictional manner, and\n* the ability to flow (also described as the ability to take on the shape of the container).\nThese properties are typically a function of their inability to support a [[shear stress]] in static [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. In contrast, solids respond to shear with [[Elasticity (physics)|a spring-like restoring force]], which means that small deformations, whether shear or normal, are reversible.\n\nSolids respond with restoring forces to both shear stresses, and to [[normal stress]]es\u2014both [[Compressive stress|compressive]] and [[Tensile stress|tensile]].  In contrast, ideal fluids only respond with restoring forces to normal stresses, called [[pressure]]: fluids can be subjected to both compressive stress, corresponding to positive pressure, and to tensile stress, corresponding to [[Pressure#Negative pressure|negative pressure]]. Both solids and liquids also have tensile strengths, which when exceeded in solids makes [[Plasticity (physics)|irreversible deformation]] and fracture, and in liquids causes the onset of [[cavitation]]. [[Gas]]es do not have tensile strength, and freely expand in response to changes in pressure.\n\nBoth solids and liquids have free surfaces, which cost some amount of [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] to form. In the case of solids, the amount of free energy to form a given unit of surface area is called [[surface energy]], whereas for liquids the same quantity is called [[surface tension]]. The ability of liquids to flow results in very different behaviour in response to surface tension than in solids, although in equilibrium both will try to [[Wulff construction|minimise their surface energy]]: liquids tend to form rounded [[droplets]], whereas pure solids tend to form [[crystals]]. [[Gas]]es do not have free surfaces, and freely [[Diffusion#Elementary theory of diffusion coefficient in gases|diffuse]].\n\n===Modelling===\n{{main|Fluid mechanics}}\nIn a solid, shear stress is a function of [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], but in a fluid, [[stress (physics)|shear stress]] is a function of [[strain rate]]. A consequence of this behavior is [[Pascal's law]] which describes the role of [[pressure]] in characterizing a fluid's state. \n\nDepending on the relationship between shear stress, and the rate of strain and its [[derivative]]s, fluids can be characterized as one of the following:\n*[[Newtonian fluid]]s: where stress is directly proportional to rate of strain\n*[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s: where stress is not proportional to rate of strain, its higher powers and derivatives.\n\nThe behavior of fluids can be described by the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\u2014a set of [[partial differential equations]] which are based on:\n* continuity ([[continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|conservation of mass]]),\n* conservation of [[linear momentum]],\n* conservation of [[angular momentum]],\n* [[conservation of energy]].\n\nThe study of fluids is [[fluid mechanics]], which is subdivided into [[fluid dynamics]] and [[fluid statics]] depending on whether the fluid is in motion.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Matter]]\n*[[Liquid]]\n*[[Gas]]\n*[[Supercritical fluid]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book |title=Transport Phenomena |last=Bird |first=Byron |authorlink= |author2=Stewart, Warren |author3=Lightfoot, Edward |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley, Second Edition |location=New York |isbn=0-471-41077-2 |page= |pages=912 |url= }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]", "sha1": "ng2txmyqb1az7195rmnt13gpcd7kfqt"}}, {"title": "FAQ", "ns": "0", "id": "10916", "revision": {"id": "864435338", "parentid": "864432930", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T05:32:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wham2001", "id": "915833"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/139.193.249.151|139.193.249.151]] ([[User talk:139.193.249.151|talk]]): Rv unexplained deletion.

The format is commonly used on email mailing lists and other online forums, where certain common questions tend to recur.\n\n\"FAQ\" is pronounced as either an [[initialism]] (F-A-Q) or an [[acronym]]. Since the acronym ''FAQ'' originated in textual media, its [[pronunciation]] varies; \"F-A-Q\",<ref name=pron>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/faqs/about-faqs/ |title=About FAQs: Pronunciation |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> is commonly heard. Depending on usage, the term may refer specifically to a single frequently asked question, or to an assembled list of many questions and their answers. Web page designers often label a single list of questions as an \"FAQ\", such as on [[Google Search|Google.com]],<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = FAQ\n| url = http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/government/faq/\n| publisher = [[Google]]\n| accessdate = May 30, 2013\n}}</ref> while using \"FAQs\" to denote multiple lists of questions such as on [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] sites.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = OFAC FAQs: Question Index\n| url = http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Sanctions/Pages/ques_index.aspx\n| publisher = [[United States Department of the Treasury]]\n| accessdate = May 30, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nWhile the name may be recent, the FAQ format itself is quite old. For example, [[Matthew Hopkins]] wrote ''The Discovery of Witches'' in 1647 as a list of questions and answers, introduced as \"Certain Queries answered\". Many old [[catechism]]s are in a question-and-answer (Q&A) format. ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', written by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the second half of the 13th century, is a series of common questions about Christianity to which he wrote a series of replies. [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] are even older.\n\n===On the Internet===\nThe \"FAQ\" is an [[Internet]] textual tradition originating from the technical limitations of early mailing lists from [[NASA]] in the early 1980s. The first FAQ developed over several pre-Web years, starting from 1982 when storage was expensive. On [[ARPANET]]'s SPACE mailing list, the presumption was that new users would download archived past messages through [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]. In practice this rarely happened, and the users tended to post questions to the mailing list instead of searching its archives. Repeating the \"right\" answers became tedious, and went against developing [[netiquette]]. A series of different measures were set up by loosely affiliated groups of computer system administrators, from regularly posted messages to [[netlib]]-like query [[email]] [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]]. The acronym ''FAQ'' was developed between 1982 and 1985 by Eugene Miya of NASA for the SPACE mailing list.<ref name=faqsaboutfaqs>Hersch, Russ. [http://www.faqs.org/faqs/faqs/about-faqs/ FAQs about FAQs]. 8 January 1998.</ref> The format was then picked up on other mailing lists and [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s. Posting frequency changed to monthly, and finally weekly and daily across a variety of mailing lists and newsgroups. The first person to post a weekly FAQ was [[Jef Poskanzer]] to the Usenet [news:net.graphics net.graphics]/[news:comp.graphics comp.graphics] [[newsgroup]]s. Eugene Miya experimented with the first daily FAQ.\n\nMeanwhile, on Usenet, [[Mary Ann Horton|Mark Horton]] had started a series of \"Periodic Posts\" (PP) which attempted to answer trivial questions with appropriate answers.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Periodic summary messages posted to Usenet newsgroups attempted to reduce the continual reposting of the same basic questions and associated wrong answers. On Usenet, posting questions which are covered in a group's FAQ came to be considered poor netiquette, as it showed that the poster has not done the expected background reading before asking others to provide answers. Some groups may have multiple FAQs on related topics, or even two or more competing FAQs explaining a topic from different points of view.\n\nAnother factor on early ARPANET mailing lists was people asking questions promising to 'summarize' received answers, then either neglecting to do this or else posting simple concatenations of received replies with little-to-no quality checking.\n\n==Modern developments==\nOriginally the term \"FAQ\" referred to the Frequently Asked Question itself, and the compilation of questions and answers was known as a \"FAQ list\" or some similar expression. The term became more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called a FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually ''frequently'' asked, if they are asked at all, or if there is even any way of asking questions.\n\nIn some cases, informative documents not in the traditional FAQ style have also been described as FAQs, particularly the [[videogame|video game]] FAQ, which is often a detailed description of gameplay, including tips, secrets, and beginning-to-end guidance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-09-what-the-faq-article|title=What the FAQ?|last=Teti|first=John|date=9 September 2010|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> Rarely are videogame FAQs in a question-and-answer format, although they may contain a short section of questions and answers.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nOver time, the accumulated FAQs across all Usenet newsgroups sparked the creation of the \"*.answers\" moderated newsgroups such as [news:comp.answers comp.answers], [news:misc.answers misc.answers] and [news:sci.answers sci.answers] for [[crossposting]] and collecting FAQ across respective comp.*, misc.*, sci.* newsgroups.\n\n==See also==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|FAQ|frequently asked questions}}\n*[http://www.faqs.org/topRated.html Original USENET examples]\n*[http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/FAQ.html FAQ definition], [[Jargon File|Jargon7767819960]]\n* [[Jargon File|File]]\n*[http://www.allanswers.org Usenet FAQ Archives]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130530021723/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/fga-not-faq.html Frequently Given Answers]\n*[http://alistapart.com/article/infrequently-asked-questions-of-faqs Infrequently Asked Questions of FAQs]\n*[http://sixrevisions.com/user-interface/designing-effective-faq-pages/ Designing Effective FAQ Pages]\n\n[[Category:Technical communication]]\n[[Category:FAQ| ]]\n[[Category:Initialisms]]", "sha1": "imjpau0s7yf8w8hjp9xb92ixca01cbd"}}, {"title": "Fibonacci number", "ns": "0", "id": "10918", "revision": {"id": "865793023", "parentid": "865752693", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T05:21:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "David Eppstein", "id": "2051880"}, "comment": "Undid revision 865752693 by [[Special:Contributions/Ernsts|Ernsts]] ([[User talk:Ernsts|talk]]) and also remove [[Lucas number]] per [[MOS:SEEALSO]], already prominently linked in main text of article", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:34*21-FibonacciBlocks.png|thumb|300px|right|A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Fibonacci numbers''' are the numbers in the following [[integer sequence]], called the '''Fibonacci sequence''', and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:{{Sfn | Beck | Geoghegan | 2010}}{{Sfn | B\u00f3na | 2011 | p=180}}\n\n:<math>1,\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;8,\\;13,\\;21,\\;34,\\;55,\\;89,\\;144,\\; \\ldots</math>\n\nOften, especially in modern usage, the sequence is extended by one more initial term:\n\n:<math>0,\\;1,\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;8,\\;13,\\;21,\\;34,\\;55,\\;89,\\;144,\\; \\ldots</math><ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A000045}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FibonacciSpiral.svg|right|thumb|The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the [[golden spiral]] created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDEEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA81| title=Exploring the World of Mathematics: From Ancient Record Keeping to the Latest Advances in Computers | author=John Hudson Tiner | publisher=New Leaf Publishing Group | year=200 | isbn=978-1-61458-155-0 }}</ref> this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21. ]]\n\nBy definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.\n\nThe sequence ''F<sub>n</sub>'' of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the [[recurrence relation]]:\n:<math>F_n=F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},</math>\n\nwith [[seed value]]s{{Sfn | Beck | Geoghegan | 2010}}{{Sfn | B\u00f3na | 2011 | p=180}}\n:<math>F_1=1,\\; F_2=1</math>\nor{{Sfn | Lucas | 1891 | p=3}}\n:<math>F_0=0,\\; F_1=1.</math>\n\nFibonacci numbers appear to have first arisen in perhaps 200 BC in work by [[Pingala]] on enumerating possible patterns of poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. The Fibonacci sequence is named after Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as [[Fibonacci]]. His 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics,{{Sfn | Pisano | 2002 | pp=404\u20135}} although the sequence had been described earlier in [[Indian mathematics]].<ref name=\"GlobalScience\" /><ref name=\"HistoriaMathematica\" /><ref name=\"Donald Knuth 2006 50\" /> The sequence described in ''Liber Abaci'' began with ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.

Fibonacci posed the puzzle: how many pairs will there be in one year?\n\n* At the end of the first month, they mate, but there is still only 1 pair.\n* At the end of the second month the female produces a new pair, so now there are 2 pairs of rabbits in the field.\n* At the end of the third month, the original female produces a second pair, making 3 pairs in all in the field.\n* At the end of the fourth month, the original female has produced yet another new pair, and the female born two months ago also produces her first pair, making 5 pairs.\n\nAt the end of the ''n''th month, the number of pairs of rabbits is equal to the number of new pairs (that is, the number of pairs in month ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2) plus the number of pairs alive last month (that is, ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1).

This can be taken as the definition of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>, with the convention that ''F''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, meaning no sum adds up to \u22121, and that ''F''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, meaning the empty sum \"adds up\" to 0. Here, the order of the summand matters.  For example, 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 and 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 are considered two different sums.\n\nFor example, the recurrence relation\n\n: <math>F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2},</math>\nor in words, the ''n''th Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers, may be shown by dividing the ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> sums of 1s and 2s that add to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into two non-overlapping groups. One group contains those sums whose first term is 1 and the other those sums whose first term is 2. In the first group the remaining terms add to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2, so it has ''F''<sub>''n''-1</sub> sums, and in the second group the remaining terms add to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;3, so there are ''F''<sub>''n''\u22122</sub> sums. So there are a total of ''F''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub> + ''F''<sub>''n''\u22122</sub> sums altogether, showing this is equal to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nSimilarly, it may be shown that the sum of the first Fibonacci numbers up to the ''n''th is equal to the (''n'' + 2)-nd Fibonacci number minus 1.{{Sfn | Lucas | 1891 | p = 4}}  In symbols:\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n F_i = F_{n+2} - 1</math>\n\nThis is done by dividing the sums adding to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 in a different way, this time by the location of the first 2.

This means that every positive integer can be written as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, where any one number is used once at most.\n\nMoreover, every positive integer can be written in a unique way as the sum of ''one or more'' distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers. This is known as [[Zeckendorf's theorem]], and a sum of Fibonacci numbers that satisfies these conditions is called a Zeckendorf representation. The Zeckendorf representation of a number can be used to derive its [[Fibonacci coding]].\n\nFibonacci numbers are used by some [[pseudorandom number generators]].<!-- Knuth vol. 2 -->\n\nThey are also used in [[planning poker]], which is a step in estimating in software development projects that use the [[Scrum (software development)]] methodology.\n\nFibonacci numbers are used in a polyphase version of the [[merge sort]] algorithm in which an unsorted list is divided into two lists whose lengths correspond to sequential Fibonacci numbers&nbsp;\u2013 by dividing the list so that the two parts have lengths in the approximate proportion \u03c6.

[[Primefree sequence]]s use the Fibonacci recursion with other starting points to generate sequences in which all numbers are [[composite number|composite]].\n* Letting a number be a linear function (other than the sum) of the 2 preceding numbers. The [[Pell number]]s have ''P<sub>n</sub>'' = 2''P''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub> + ''P''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub>.\n* Not adding the immediately preceding numbers. The [[Padovan sequence]] and [[Perrin number]]s have ''P''(''n'') = ''P''(''n'' \u2212 2) + ''P''(''n'' \u2212 3).\n* Generating the next number by adding 3 numbers (tribonacci numbers), 4 numbers (tetranacci numbers), or more.

It is located {{convert|55.5|km}} south-southeast of the [[Kilometre Zero|centre of Paris]]. Fontainebleau is a [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefecture]] of the [[Seine-et-Marne]] [[Departments of France|department]], and it is the seat of the [[Arrondissement of Fontainebleau|''arrondissement'' of Fontainebleau]]. The commune has the largest land area in the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] region; it is the only one to cover a larger area than Paris itself.\n\nFontainebleau, together with the neighbouring commune of [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] and three other smaller communes, form an urban area of 39,713 inhabitants (according to the 2001 census). This urban area is a satellite of Paris.\n\nFontainebleau is renowned for the large and scenic [[forest of Fontainebleau]], a favourite weekend getaway for Parisians, as well as for the historic [[Palace of Fontainebleau|Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]], which once belonged to the [[kings of France]]. It is also the home of [[INSEAD]], one of the world's most elite business schools.\n\nInhabitants of Fontainebleau are called ''Bellifontains''.\n\n==History==\n'''Fontainebleau''' has been recorded in different Latinised forms, such as, ''Fons Bleaudi'', ''Fons Bliaudi'', ''Fons Blaadi'' in the 12th and 13th centuries,  with ''Fontem blahaud'' being recorded  in 1137. It became ''Fons Bellaqueus'' in the 17th century, which gave rise to the name of the inhabitants as ''Bellifontains''. The name originates as a medieval composite of two words: ''Fontaine\u2013'' meaning spring, or fountainhead, followed by a person\u2019s Germanic name ''Blizwald''.<ref>[[Albert Dauzat]] and [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de lieu en France'', Librairie Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud, Paris, 1979.</ref>\n\nThis hamlet was endowed with a royal hunting lodge and a chapel by [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] in the middle of the twelfth century. A century later, [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], also called Saint Louis, who held Fontainebleau in high esteem and referred to it as \"his wilderness\", had a country house and a hospital constructed there.\n\n[[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] was born there in 1268 and died there in 1314. In all, thirty-four sovereigns, from [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI, the Fat]], (1081\u20131137) to [[Napoleon III]] (1808\u20131873), spent time at Fontainebleau.\n\nThe connection between the town of Fontainebleau and the French monarchy was reinforced with the transformation of the royal country house into a true royal palace, the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]. This was accomplished by the great builder-king, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1494\u20131547), who, in the largest of his many construction projects, reconstructed, expanded, and transformed the royal ch\u00e2teau at Fontainebleau into a residence that became his favourite, as well as the residence of his mistress, [[Anne de Pisseleu d'Heilly|Anne, duchess of \u00c9tampes]].\n\nFrom the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, every monarch, from [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to [[Louis XV]], made important renovations at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including demolitions, reconstructions, additions, and embellishments of various descriptions, all of which endowed it with a character that is a bit heterogeneous, but harmonious nonetheless.\n[[File:Le bassin des cascades (Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau) (2935087125).jpg|thumb|350px|left|Fontainebleau palace garden fountain and ''Grand canal'']]\nOn 18 October 1685, [[Louis XIV]] signed the ''[[Edict of Fontainebleau]]'' there. Also known as the ''Revocation of the Edict of Nantes'', this royal fiat reversed the permission granted to the [[Huguenots]] in 1598 to worship publicly in specified locations and hold certain other privileges. The result was that a large number of Protestants were forced to convert to the Catholic faith, killed, or forced into exile, mainly in the Low Countries, Prussia and in England.<ref>{{cite web|author=Meromedia, BUFFET Andre |url=http://www.museeprotestant.org/Pages/Notices.php?scatid=130&noticeid=650&lev=1&Lget=EN |title=Article - The Edict of Fontainebleau or the Revocation (1685) |publisher=Museeprotestant.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe 1762 [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], a secret agreement between France and Spain concerning the Louisiana territory in North America, was concluded here. Also, preliminary negotiations, held before the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[Seven Years' War]], were at Fontainebleau.\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Fontainebleau was temporarily renamed Fontaine-la-Montagne, meaning \"Fountain by the Mountain\". (The mountain referred to is the series of rocky formations located in the forest of Fontainebleau.)\n\nOn 29 October 1807, [[Manuel Godoy]], chancellor to the Spanish king, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] and [[Napoleon]] signed the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]], which authorized the passage of French troops through Spanish territories so that they might invade Portugal.\n\nOn 20 June 1812, Pope [[Pius VII]] arrived at the ch\u00e2teau of Fontainebleau, after a secret transfer from [[Savona]], accompanied by his personal physician, Balthazard Claraz. In poor health, the Pope was the prisoner of Napoleon, and he remained in his genteel prison at Fontainebleau for nineteen months. From June 1812 until 23 January 1814, the Pope never left his apartments.\n\nOn 20 April 1814, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], shortly before his first abdication, bid farewell to the [[Old Guard (France)|Old Guard]], the renowned ''grognards'' (gripers) who had served with him since his very first campaigns, in the \"White Horse Courtyard\" (la cour du Cheval Blanc) at the Palace of Fontainebleau. (The courtyard has since been renamed the \"Courtyard of Goodbyes\".) According to contemporary sources, the occasion was very moving. The [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1814)|1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau]] stripped Napoleon of his powers (but not his title as [[Emperor of the French]]) and sent him into exile on [[Elba]].\n\nUntil the 19th century, Fontainebleau was a village and a suburb of [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]]. Later, it developed as an independent residential city.\n\n[[File:Bicentenaire des Adieux de Napoleon a Fontainebleau.JPG|thumb|400px|left|Historical reenactment in Fontainebleau of the bicentenary of Napoleon's Farewell to the Old Guard, April 20th of 2014.

This event took place near a golf course.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410085129/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1924/1924.pdf 1924 Olympics official report.] pp. 501-3. {{fr icon}}</ref>\n\nIn July and August 1946, the town hosted the Franco-Vietnamese Conference, intended to find a solution to the long-contested struggle for Vietnam\u2019s independence from France, but the conference ended in failure.\n\nFontainebleau also hosted the general staff of the Allied Forces in Central Europe (Allied Forces Center or AFCENT) and the land forces command (LANDCENT); the air forces command (AIRCENT) was located nearby at [[Georges Guynemer|Camp Guynemer]]. These facilities were in place from the inception of [[NATO]] until France\u2019s partial withdrawal from NATO in 1967 when the United States returned those bases to French control. NATO moved AFCENT to [[Brunssum]] in the [[Netherlands]] and AIRCENT to [[Ramstein AFB|Ramstein]] in [[West Germany]]. (Note that the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, also known as SHAPE, was located at [[Rocquencourt]], west of Paris, quite a distance from Fontainebleau).\n\nIn 2008, The men's World Championship of Real Tennis (Jeu de Paume) was held in the tennis court of the Chateau. The real tennis World Championship is the oldest in sport and Fontainebleau has one of only two active courts in France.\n\n==Tourism==\nFontainebleau is a popular tourist destination; each year, 300,000 people visit the palace<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fontainebleau.fr/?chateau-de-fontainebleau|title=Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|language=French|accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> and more than 13 million people visit the forest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fontainebleau.fr/?foret-de-fontainebleau|title=For\u00eat de Fontainebleau|language=French|accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref>\n\n===Fontainebleau forest===\nThe [[forest of Fontainebleau]] surrounds the town and dozens of nearby villages. It is protected by France's ''Office National des For\u00eats'', and it is recognised as a French national park. It is managed in order that its wild plants and trees, such as the rare [[Sorbus latifolia|service tree of Fontainebleau]], and its populations of birds, mammals, and butterflies, can be conserved. It is a former royal hunting park often visited by [[walking|hikers]] and [[horse riding|horse riders]]. The forest is also well regarded for [[bouldering]] and is particularly popular among [[climbing|climbers]], as the biggest developed area of that kind in the world.\n\n===Royal Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau===\nThe Royal [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau]] is a large palace where the kings of France took their ease. It is also the site where the French royal court, from 1528 onwards, entertained the body of new ideas that became known as the Renaissance.\n[[File:Square in Fontainebleau Town Centre.JPG|thumb|right|270px|Town centre]]\n\n===INSEAD===\nThe European (and historic) campus of the [[INSEAD]] [[business school]] is located at the edge of Fontainebleau, by the Lycee Francois Couperin.

The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.\n\nMany fighters have secondary ground-attack capabilities, and some are designed as dual-purpose [[fighter-bomber]]s; often aircraft that do not fulfill the standard definition are called fighters.

In the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]] these aircraft were referred to as \"[[Scout (aircraft)|scouts]]\" into the early 1920s. The [[U.S. Army]] called their fighters \"pursuit\" aircraft from 1916 until the late 1940s. In most languages a fighter aircraft is known as a ''hunter'', or ''hunting aircraft'' (''avion de chasse, Jagdflugzeuge, avi\u00f3n de caza'' etc.). Exceptions include Russian, where a fighter is an \"\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\" (pronounced \"istrebitel\"), meaning \"exterminator\", and Hebrew where it is \"matose krav\" (literally \"battle plane\").\n\nAs a part of military nomenclature, a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use, along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft. The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries&nbsp;\u2013 in the English-speaking world, \"F\" is now used to indicate a fighter (e.g. [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire F.22]]), though when the pursuit designation was used in the US, they were \"P\" types (e.g. [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]). In Russia \"I\" was used ([[Polikarpov I-16]]), while the French continue to use \"C\" ([[Nieuport 17|Nieuport 17 C.1]]).\n\nAlthough the term \"fighter\" specifies aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft, such designs are often also useful as multirole [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[strike fighter]]s, and sometimes lighter, fighter-sized tactical [[ground-attack aircraft]]. This has always been the case, for instance the [[Sopwith Camel]] and other \"fighting scouts\" of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work. In World War II, the [[USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or [[dive bombers]], and types such as the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] that were no longer competitive as aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack. Several aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-117, have received fighter designations though they had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons. The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the [[U.S. Navy]], but it was cancelled. This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for \"attack\" or \"strike\" operations against ground targets by means of [[strafing]] or dropping small bombs and incendiaries. Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types.\n\nSome of the most expensive fighters such as the US [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and Russian [[Sukhoi Su-27]] were employed as all-weather [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] as well as [[air superiority fighter]] aircraft, while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers. An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target (or intercept) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcentralwis.net/wimuzikman/airterms.html|title=Military Aircraft Terminology|website=www.northcentralwis.net}}</ref>\n\n==Development overview==\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|Landing on {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} in a [[Sopwith Pup]] scout]]\n\nFighters were developed in World War I to deny enemy aircraft and [[airship|dirigibles]] the ability to gather information by [[reconnaissance]] over the battlefield. Early fighters were very small and lightly armed by later standards, and most were [[biplane]]s built with a wooden frame covered with fabric, and a maximum airspeed of about {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}. As control of the airspace over armies became increasingly important, all of the major powers developed fighters to support their military operations. Between the wars, wood was largely replaced in part or whole by metal tubing, and finally aluminium stressed skin structures (monocoque) began to predominate.\n\nOn 15 August 1914, [[Miodrag Tomi\u0107]] encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The Austro-Hungarian aviator initially waved at Tomi\u0107, who waved back. The enemy pilot then took a revolver and began shooting at Tomi\u0107's plane.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} Tomi\u0107 produced a pistol of his own and fired back.{{sfn|Blume|1968|p=291}} He swerved away from the Austro-Hungarian plane and the two aircraft eventually parted ways. {{sfnm|1a1=Glenny|1y=2012|1p=316|2a1=Buttar|2y=2014|2p=298}} It was considered the first exchange of fire between aircraft in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxGkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298|title=Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914|first=Prit|last=Buttar|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|accessdate=18 January 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>  Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} The Serbians equipped their planes with {{convert|8|mm|adj=on}} [[Schwarzlose MG M.07/12]] machine guns, six 100-round boxes of ammunition and several bombs.{{sfn|Jandri\u0107|2012|p=4}}\n\nBy [[World War II]], most fighters were all-metal [[monoplane]]s armed with batteries of [[machine gun]]s or [[Autocannon|cannons]] and some were capable of speeds approaching {{convert|400|mph|abbr=on}}. Most fighters up to this point had one engine, but a number of twin-engine fighters were built; however they were found to be outmatched against single-engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks, such as night fighters equipped with primitive radar sets.\n\n[[File:Hawker Sea Hurricanes.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Sea Hurricanes]] in formation]]\nBy the end of the war, [[turbojet]] engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the turbojet engine was far less than piston engine, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements.  This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape, and [[G-suit]]s to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers.\n\n[[File:MiG-17 underside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] underside]]\nIn the 1950s, [[radar]] was fitted to day fighters, since due to ever increasing air-to-air weapon ranges, pilots could no longer see far enough ahead to prepare for the opposition. Subsequently, radar capabilities grew enormously and are now the primary method of [[target acquisition]]. Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure, but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2, past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack.\n\n[[Air-to-air missile]]s largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained, however the [[Vietnam War]] showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between 20 and 30&nbsp;mm in [[caliber]]) in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles.\n\n[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[F-22A Raptor]] stealth fighter.]]\nIn the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engined support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible. Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress.\n\nWith the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient. To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China. The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines, eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces. Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application. Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components, and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weight\u2014most modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers.\n\n==Piston engine fighters==\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Vickers F.B.5. Gunbus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] ]]\n{{further|Aviation in World War I}}\n\nThe word \"fighter\" was first used to describe a two-seater aircraft with sufficient lift to carry a machine gun and its operator as well as the [[Aviator|pilot]]. Some of the first such \"fighters\" belonged to the \"gunbus\" series of experimental gun carriers of the British [[Vickers]] company that culminated in the [[Vickers F.B.5|Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] of 1914. The main drawback of this type of aircraft was its lack of speed. Planners quickly realized that an aircraft intended to destroy its kind in the air had to be fast enough to catch its quarry.\n\nAnother type of military aircraft was to form the basis for an effective \"fighter\" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on the small fast aircraft developed before the war for such [[Air racing|air races]] as the Gordon Bennett Cup and [[Schneider Trophy]]. The military '''[[Scout (aircraft)|scout]]''' airplane was not expected to carry serious armament, but rather to rely on its speed to reach the scout or reconnoiter location and return quickly to report&nbsp;\u2013 essentially an aerial horse. British scout aircraft, in this sense, included the [[Sopwith Tabloid]] and [[Bristol Scout]]. French equivalents included the [[Morane-Saulnier N]].\n\n[[File:Airco D.H.2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[Airco DH.2]] \"pusher\" scout]]\nSoon after the commencement of the war, pilots armed themselves with pistols, [[carbines]], [[grenade]]s, and an assortment of improvised weapons. Many of these proved ineffective as the pilot had to fly his airplane while attempting to aim a handheld weapon and make a difficult deflection shot. The first step in finding a real solution was to mount the weapon on the aircraft, but the propeller remained a problem since the best direction to shoot is straight ahead. Numerous solutions were tried. A second crew member behind the pilot could aim and fire a swivel-mounted machine gun at enemy airplanes; however, this limited the area of coverage chiefly to the rear hemisphere, and effective coordination of the pilot's maneuvering with the gunner's aiming was difficult. This option was chiefly employed as a defensive measure on two-seater reconnaissance aircraft from 1915 on. Both the [[SPAD S.A]] and the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9]] added a second crewman ahead of the engine in a pod but this was both hazardous to the second crewman and limited performance. The [[Sopwith L.R.T.Tr.]] similarly added a pod on the top wing with no better luck.\n\n[[File:BillyBishop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Billy Bishop]] sitting in his [[Nieuport 23]] with the machine gun (just visible at the top of the picture) mounted to fire over the propeller.]]\nAn alternative was to build a [[Pusher configuration|\"pusher\"]] scout such as the [[Airco DH.2]], with the propeller mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar [[Tractor configuration|\"tractor\"]] aircraft.\n\nA better solution for a single seat scout was to mount the machine gun (rifles and pistols having been dispensed with) to fire forwards but outside the propeller arc. Wing guns were tried but the unreliable weapons available required frequent clearing of [[Firearm malfunction|jammed rounds and misfires]] and remained impractical until after the war. Mounting the machine gun over the top wing worked well and was used long after the ideal solution was found. The [[Nieuport 11]] of 1916 and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] of 1918 both used this system with considerable success; however, this placement made aiming difficult and the location made it difficult for a pilot to both maneuver and have access to the [[Gun breech|gun's breech]]. The British [[Foster mounting]] was specifically designed for this kind of application, fitted with the [[Lewis Gun|Lewis Machine gun]], which due to its design was unsuitable for synchronizing.\n\n[[File:Fokker M5K-MG E5-15.jpg|thumb|The actual aircraft used by Wintgens in his pioneering aerial engagement, his [[Fokker M.5K/MG]] with [[IdFlieg]] military serial number \"E.5/15\", as it appeared at the time of the engagement.]]\nThe need to arm a [[tractor scout]] with a forward-firing gun whose bullets passed through the propeller arc was evident even before the outbreak of war and inventors in both France and Germany devised [[Synchronization gear|mechanisms]] that could time the firing of the individual rounds to avoid hitting the propeller blades. [[Franz Schneider (engineer)|Franz Schneider]], a Swiss engineer, had patented such a device in Germany in 1913, but his original work was not followed up. French aircraft designer [[Raymond Saulnier (aircraft manufacturer)|Raymond Saulnier]] patented a practical device in April 1914, but trials were unsuccessful because of the propensity of the machine gun employed to [[hang fire]] due to unreliable ammunition.\n\nIn December 1914, French aviator [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] asked Saulnier to install his synchronization gear on Garros' [[Morane-Saulnier Type L]]. Unfortunately the gas-operated [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss]] machine gun he was provided had an erratic rate of fire and it was impossible to synchronize it with a spinning propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were armored and fitted with metal wedges to protect the pilot from [[ricochet]]s. Garros' modified monoplane was first flown in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon thereafter. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans.\n\nMeanwhile, the synchronization gear (called the ''Stangensteuerung'' in German, for \"pushrod control system\") devised by the engineers of [[Anthony Fokker]]'s firm was the first system to see production contracts, and would make the [[Fokker Eindecker|Fokker ''Eindecker'']] monoplane a feared name over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], despite its being an adaptation of an obsolete pre-war French [[Morane-Saulnier]] racing airplane, with a mediocre performance and poor flight characteristics. The first victory for the ''Eindecker'' came on 1 July 1915, when ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]], flying with the ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]] 6'' unit on the Western Front, forced down a Morane-Saulnier Type L two-seat \"parasol\" monoplane just east of [[Luneville]]. Wintgens' aircraft, one of the five [[Fokker M.5|Fokker M.5K/MG]] production prototype examples of the ''Eindecker'', was armed with a synchronized, air-cooled aviation version of the [[Parabellum MG14]] machine gun.\n\n[[File:Sopwith Camel 1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Camel]] at the [[Royal Air Force Museum|RAF Museum]] ]]\nThe success of the ''Eindecker'' kicked off a competitive cycle of improvement among the combatants, both sides striving to build ever more capable single-seat fighters. The [[Albatros D.I]] and [[Sopwith Pup]] of 1916 set the classic pattern followed by fighters for about twenty years. Most were [[biplane]]s and only rarely monoplanes or [[triplane]]s. The strong box structure of the biplane provided a rigid wing that allowed the accurate lateral control essential for dogfighting. They had a single operator, who flew the aircraft and also controlled its armament. They were armed with one or two [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] or [[Vickers]] machine guns, which were easier to synchronize than other types, firing through the propeller arc. Gun breeches were directly in front of the pilot, with obvious implications in case of accidents, but jams could be cleared in flight, while aiming was simplified.\n\nThe use of metal aircraft structures was pioneered before World War I by Breguet but would find its biggest proponent in Anthony Fokker, who used chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure of all his fighter designs, while the innovative German engineer [[Hugo Junkers]] developed two all-metal, single-seat fighter monoplane designs with [[cantilever]] wings: the strictly experimental [[Junkers J 2]] private-venture aircraft, made with steel, and some forty examples of the [[Junkers D.I]], made with corrugated [[duralumin]], all based on his experience in creating the pioneering [[Junkers J 1|Junkers J&nbsp;1]] all-metal airframe technology demonstration aircraft of late 1915. While Fokker would pursue steel tube fuselages with wooden wings until the late 1930s, and Junkers would focus on corrugated sheet metal, Dornier was the first to build a fighter (The [[Dornier-Zeppelin D.I]]) made with pre-stressed sheet aluminium and having cantelevered wings, a form that would replace all others in the 1930s.\n\nAs collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as [[Oswald Boelcke]], [[Max Immelmann]], and [[Edward Mannock]] developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness.\n\n[[File:Fordi.jpg|thumb|German Fokker Triplanes of ''[[Jasta]]'' 26 in World War I]]\nAllied and&nbsp;\u2013 before 1918&nbsp;\u2013 German pilots of World War I were not equipped with [[parachute]]s, so in-flight fires or structural failure were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year. The well known and feared [[Manfred von Richthofen]] \"Red Baron\" was wearing one when he was killed, but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.<ref>Lee, Arthur Gould.

In France, Italy and Russia, where large budgets continued to allow major development, both monoplanes and all metal structures were common. By the end of the 1920s, however, those countries overspent themselves and were overtaken in the 1930s by those powers that hadn't been spending heavily, namely the British, the Americans and the Germans.\n\n[[File:HawkerFury43sqn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hawker Fury]] of 43 Squadron, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], a typical late inter-war biplane]]\nGiven limited defense budgets, air forces tended to be conservative in their aircraft purchases, and biplanes remained popular with pilots because of their agility, and remained in service long after they had ceased to be competitive. Designs such as the [[Gloster Gladiator]], [[Fiat CR.42]], and [[Polikarpov I-15]] were common even in the late 1930s, and many were still in service as late as 1942. Up until the mid-1930s, the majority of fighters in the US, the UK, Italy and Russia remained fabric-covered biplanes.\n\nFighter armament eventually began to be mounted inside the wings, outside the arc of the propeller, though most designs retained two synchronized machine guns directly ahead of the pilot, where they were more accurate (that being the strongest part of the structure, reducing the vibration to which the guns were subjected to). Shooting with this traditional arrangement was also easier for the further reason that the guns shot directly ahead in the direction of the aircraft's flight, up to the limit of the guns range; unlike wing-mounted guns which to be effective required to be [[Gun harmonisation|harmonised]], that is, preset to shoot at an angle by ground crews so that their bullets would converge on a target area a set distance ahead of the fighter. Rifle-caliber .30 and .303 in (7.62&nbsp;mm) caliber guns remained the norm, with larger weapons either being too heavy and cumbersome or deemed unnecessary against such lightly built aircraft. It was not considered unreasonable to use World War I-style armament to counter enemy fighters as there was insufficient air-to-air combat during most of the period to disprove this notion.\n\nThe [[rotary engine]], popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, its development having reached the point where rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary [[radial engine]] though major advances led to inline engines, which gained ground with several exceptional engines\u2014including the {{convert|1145|cuin|l|abbr=on|adj=on}} V-12 [[Curtiss D-12]]. [[Aircraft engine]]s increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} in the 900-kg [[Fokker D.VII]] of 1918 to {{convert|900|hp|abbr=on}} in the 2,500-kg [[Curtiss P-36]] of 1936. The debate between the sleek [[Straight engine|in-line engines]] versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing in-line units. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) cooling system, but had increased drag. In-line engines often had a better [[power-to-weight ratio]], but there were radial engines that kept working even after having suffered significant battle damage.\n\n[[File:peashooter.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|An early monoplane fighter: the [[Boeing]] [[P-26 Peashooter]], which first flew in 1932]]\nSome air forces experimented with \"[[heavy fighter]]s\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of [[light bomber|light]] or [[medium bomber]] types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters.\n\nThe primary driver of fighter innovation, right up to the period of rapid re-armament in the late 1930s, were not military budgets, but civilian aircraft racing. Aircraft designed for these races introduced innovations like streamlining and more powerful engines that would find their way into the fighters of World War II. The most significant of these was the [[Schneider Trophy]] races, where competition grew so fierce, only national governments could afford to enter.\n\n[[File:Dewoitine D26 HB-RAI 1.jpg|thumb|left|Parasol monoplanes were popular in many European countries, and paved the way for cantilever low-wing monoplanes. This is a restored Swiss Air Force [[Dewoitine D.26]]]]\nAt the very end of the inter-war period in Europe came the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This was just the opportunity the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', and the Soviet Union's [[Soviet Air Forces|Red Air Force]] needed to test their latest aircraft. Each party sent numerous aircraft types to support their sides in the conflict. In the [[dogfight]]s over Spain, the latest [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters did well, as did the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16]]. The German design had considerably more room for development however and the lessons learned led to greatly improved models in World War II. The Russians, whose side lost, failed to keep up and despite newer models coming into service, I-16s were outfought by the improved Bf 109s in World War II, while remaining the most common Soviet front-line fighter into 1942.  For their part, the Italians developed several monoplanes such as the [[Fiat G.50]], but being short on funds, were forced to continue operating obsolete [[Fiat CR.42]] biplanes.\n\nFrom the early 1930s the Japanese had been at war against both the Chinese Nationalists and the Russians in China, and used the experience to improve both training and aircraft, replacing biplanes with modern cantilever monoplanes and creating a cadre of exceptional pilots for use in the Pacific War.  In the United Kingdom, at the behest of [[Neville Chamberlain]], (more famous for his 'peace in our time' speech) the entire British aviation industry was retooled, allowing it to change quickly from fabric covered metal framed biplanes to cantilever stressed skin monoplanes in time for the war with Germany.\n\nThe period of improving the same biplane design over and over was now coming to an end, and the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] finally started to supplant the [[Gloster Gladiator]] and [[Hawker Fury]] biplanes but many of the former remained in front-line service well past the start of World War II. While not a combatant themselves in Spain, they absorbed many of the lessons learned in time to use them.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War also provided an opportunity for updating fighter tactics. One of the innovations to result from the aerial warfare experience this conflict provided was the development of the \"[[finger-four]]\" formation by the German pilot [[Werner M\u00f6lders]]. Each fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (German: ''Staffel'') was divided into several flights (''Schw\u00e4rme'') of four aircraft. Each ''Schwarm'' was divided into two ''Rotten'', which was a pair of aircraft. Each ''Rotte'' was composed of a leader and a wingman. This flexible formation allowed the pilots to maintain greater situational awareness, and the two ''Rotten'' could split up at any time and attack on their own. The finger-four would become widely adopted as the fundamental tactical formation over the course of World War.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bf 109 G-2 trop RAF Museum London.jpg|thumb|left|[[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/Trop]] 'Black 6']]\n{{further|Aviation in World War II}}\nWorld War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] noted the effect of airpower: \"Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\"  Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as [[ground-attack aircraft|tactical air support]] and [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].\n\n[[File:Mitsubishi Zero-Yasukuni.jpg|thumb|The long-range [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] typified the highly maneuverable, but lightly armored, fighter design.]]\n[[File:Macchi MC-200 920901-F-1234P-073.jpg|thumb|[[Macchi MC.200]] in the markings of 372\u00b0 Sq. ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'']]\nFighter design varied widely among combatants.  The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese [[Nakajima Ki-27]], [[Nakajima Ki-43]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] and Italy's [[Fiat G.50]] and [[Macchi MC.200]].  In contrast, designers in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create [[g-force|''g''-forces]] unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower.  In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.\n\n====European theater====\n[[File:Flight! Yakovlev Yak-9UM HB-RYA (8355282184).jpg|alt=Yakovlev Yak-9 |thumb|The [[Yakovlev Yak-9|'''Yakovlev''' Yak-9]] was the most mass-produced Soviet fighter of all time. It remained in production from 1942 to 1948, with 16,769 built (14,579 during the war).]]\n[[File:Morane D-3801 J-143.jpg|thumb|left|[[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] D-3801]]\n\nDuring the [[invasion of Poland]] and the [[Battle of France]], Luftwaffe fighters\u2014primarily the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]\u2014held air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns.  During the [[Battle of Britain]], however, British [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters.  Additionally Britain's radar-based [[Dowding system]] directing fighters onto German attacks and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving the UK from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI NR.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire XVI]] was typical of World War II fighters optimized for high level speeds and good climb rates.]]\n[[File:P-47 Thunderbolt 42-25068 2012 (7977124689).jpg|thumb|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]]]]\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], [[Soviet Air Force|Soviet fighter forces]] were overwhelmed during the opening phases of [[Operation Barbarossa]].  This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the [[Great Purge]], and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent [[Polikarpov I-15|I-15]] [[biplane]] and the [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]]. More modern Soviet designs, including the [[MiG-3]], [[LaGG-3]] and [[Yak-1]], had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, [[Axis powers|Axis]] air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights.\n\nIn the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment.Since 1942 Soviet designs such as the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-5]] had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of [[Lend-Lease]], with the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids.  The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the [[Wehrmacht]].\n\n[[File:Me 262 flight show at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reproduction of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] in flight in 2006.

The [[Gloster Meteor]] was the first British jet fighter and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only [[jet aircraft]] to achieve combat operations during World War II.]]\n\nMeanwhile, air combat on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] had a much different character.  Much of this combat was centered around the [[strategic bombing]] campaigns of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] against German industry intended to wear down the Luftwaffe.  Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts.  The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped [[night fighter]]s for these battles.  The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany.  Unescorted [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf 109s and Fw 190s).  With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], American fighters were able to escort far into Germany on daylight raids and established control of the skies over Western Europe.\n\nBy the time of [[Operation Overlord]] in June 1944, the Allies had gained near complete air superiority over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].  This cleared the way both for intensified strategic bombing of German cities and industries, and for the [[tactical bombing]] of battlefield targets.  With the Luftwaffe largely cleared from the skies, Allied fighters increasingly served as attack aircraft.\n\nAllied fighters, by gaining air superiority over the European battlefield, played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Axis, which Reichmarshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander of the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' summed up when he said: \"When I saw [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"<ref>Sherman, Steven.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] primarily operated the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] flew the [[Nakajima Ki-27]] and the [[Nakajima Ki-43]], initially enjoying great success, as these fighters generally had better range, maneuverability, speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts.<ref name=\"Eden p. 370\">Eden p. 370</ref><ref>Ireland & Grove p. 182</ref> Additionally, Japanese pilots had received excellent training and many were combat veterans from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan's campaigns in China]].  They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies, who at this stage of the war were often disorganized, under-trained and poorly equipped, and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u20131942)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaysia and Singapore]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]] and [[Burma Campaign 1942\u20131943|Burma]].\n\n[[File:F4F-3 new pitot tube of later model.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat]], early 1942]]\nBy mid-1942, the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the [[Brewster Buffalo]] and the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan's Zero, others such as the Army's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] and the Navy's [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat]] possessed attributes such as superior firepower, ruggedness and dive speed, and the Allies soon developed tactics (such as the [[Thach Weave|Thach weave]]) to take advantage of these strengths.  These changes soon paid dividends, as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]] and [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]].  In China, the [[Flying Tigers]] also used the same tactics with some success, although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there.\n\n[[File:Ki-43-I captured in flight over Brisbane 1943.jpg|thumb|Captured Nakajima Ki-43-I under evaluation by the Allies]]\nBy 1943, the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign's air campaigns.  Several factors contributed to this shift.  First, second-generation Allied fighters such as the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcat]] and the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]], and later the [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], began arriving in numbers.  These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability.  Other problems with Japan's fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed, such as their lack of armor and light armament, which made them inadequate as bomber interceptors or ground-attack planes&nbsp;\u2013 roles Allied fighters excelled at.  Most importantly, Japan's training program failed to provide enough well-trained pilots to replace losses.  In contrast, the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs.\n\n[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|thumb|Lockheed [[P-38 Lightning]]s in formation]]\nBy mid-1944, Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater, which would not be contested again during the war.  The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], a lopsided Allied victory in which Japanese fliers were downed in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great turkey shoot.\n\n[[File:Hellcats F6F-3, May 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Grumman F6F-3 Hellcats, May 1943]]\nLate in the war, Japan did begin to produce new fighters such as the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] and the [[Kawanishi N1K]] to replace the venerable Zero, but these were produced only in small numbers, and in any case by that time Japan lacked trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount a sustained challenge to Allied fighters.  During the closing stages of the war, Japan's fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]], and was largely relegated to [[Kamikaze]] tactics.\n\n====Technological innovations====\nFighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. [[Reciprocating engine|Piston-engine]]s, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between {{convert|1000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}  and {{convert|1400|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while by the end of the war many could produce over {{convert|2,000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.  For example, the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a {{convert|1030|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin II]], while [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|variants]] produced in 1945 were equipped with the {{convert|2035|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon 61]]. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of [[compressibility]] created as aircraft and their propellers approached the [[sound barrier]], and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance.  German [[Fighter aircraft#First generation subsonic jet fighters (mid-1940s to mid-1950s)|jet]] and [[Fighter aircraft#Rocket-powered fighters|rocket]]-powered fighters entered combat in 1944, too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the [[Gloster Meteor]], also entered service.\n\n[[File:P-51-361.jpg|thumb|North American P-51D Mustang during WWII]]\nWorld War II fighters also increasingly featured [[monocoque]] construction, which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while adding structural strength. [[Laminar flow]] wings, which improved high speed performance, also came into use on fighters such as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], while the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] featured [[swept wing]]s that dramatically reduced [[Wave drag|drag]] at high subsonic speeds.\n\n[[File:FW190-D9.jpg|thumb|left|Focke-Wulf Fw 190D-9 fighter-bomber]]\n[[Armament]] also advanced during the war.  The rifle-caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era. Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons, which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 rather than relying on [[kinetic energy]] from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft, such as a fuel line or control cable, or the pilot. Cannons could bring down even [[heavy bomber]]s with just a few hits, but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast-moving fighters in a dogfight.  Eventually, most fighters mounted cannons, sometimes in combination with machine guns.\n\n[[File:ME-110G-2 at RAF Hendon.jpg|thumb|German Bf 110G-4 [[night fighter]] with nose-mounted radar at the [[RAF Museum]] in London]]\nThe British epitomized this shift. Their standard early war fighters mounted eight [[.303 British|{{convert|.303|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre]] machine guns, but by mid-war they often featured a combination of machine guns and [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20&nbsp;mm cannons]], and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a native cannon design, so instead placed multiple [[M2 Browning|.50&nbsp;caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[heavy machine gun]]s on their fighters.  Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and [[Air-to-ground weaponry|air-to-surface ordnance]] such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into [[close air support]] roles as [[fighter-bomber]]s. Although they carried less ordnance than [[light bomber|light]] and [[medium bomber|medium]] bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles.  Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which reduced [[Lift (force)|lift]] and increased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for the fighter escorts that bombers required.  Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], Britain's [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Hawker Tempest]], and America's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters.\n\n[[File:Northrop P-61 green airborne.jpg|left|thumb|A Northrop P-61 Black Widow of 419th Night Fighter Squadron]]\nWorld War II also saw the first use of airborne [[radar]] on fighters.  The primary purpose of these radars was to help [[night fighter]]s locate enemy bombers and fighters.  Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets, they could not be carried on conventional single-engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger [[heavy fighter]]s or [[light bomber]]s such as Germany's [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]], Britain's [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], and America's [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20]], which then served as night fighters.  The [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]], a purpose-built night fighter, was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design. Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar, and Germany's radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo-American efforts, while other combatants developed few radar-equipped fighters.\n\n===Post\u2013World War II period===\n[[File:LavochkinLa-9.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[Lavochkin La-9]]]]\n\nSeveral prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston-engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946. A typical example is the [[Lavochkin La-9]] 'Fritz', which was an evolution of the successful wartime [[Lavochkin La-7]] 'Fin'. Working through a series of prototypes, the La-120, La-126 and La-130, the [[Lavochkin|Lavochkin design bureau]] sought to replace the La-7's wooden airframe with a metal one, as well as fit a [[Laminar flow|laminar-flow]] wing to improve maneuver performance, and increased armament. The La-9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948; it also served as the basis for the development of a long-range escort fighter, the [[Lavochkin La-11|La-11]] 'Fang', of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947\u20131951. Over the course of the Korean War, however, it became obvious that the day of the piston-engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter.\n\n[[File:Ryan FR-1 Fireball VF-66 North Island 1945.jpg|thumb|A [[Ryan Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]] of [[VF-66]] at NAS North Island, 1945. This aircraft featured a piston engine for range and a jet engine in the tail for speed.]]\nThis period also witnessed experimentation with jet-assisted piston engine aircraft. La-9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary [[Pulse jet engine|pulsejet engines]] (the La-9RD) and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary [[ramjet|ramjet engines]] (the La-138); however, neither of these entered service. One that did enter service \u2013 with the U.S. Navy in March 1945 \u2013 was the [[FR Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]]; production was halted with the war's end on [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ-Day]], with only 66 having been delivered, and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947. The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop-turbojet-powered pre-production prototypes of the [[Consolidated Vultee XP-81]] fighter, but this program was also canceled by VJ Day, with 80% of the engineering work completed.\n\n==Rocket-powered fighters==\n{{main|Rocket-powered aircraft}}\n[[File:Me163efJM.jpg|thumb|The [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] was the fastest aircraft of WWII]]\n\nThe first [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was the [[Lippisch Ente]], which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928.<ref>Darling, David.

New York City: Peerage Books, 1983, p. 159. {{ISBN|0-907408-37-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe USSR experimented with a rocket-powered interceptor in the years immediately following World War II, the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270]]. Only two were built.\n\nIn the 1950s, the British developed mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and jet engines to cover the performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable [[gliding]] return. The [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following [[Saunders-Roe SR.177|SR.177]]) obsolete. The American [[Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor]] (the first U.S. fighter to exceed [[Mach number|Mach 1]] in level flight) met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service. The only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was [[JATO|Rocket-Assisted Take Off]] (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the [[zero-length launch]], RATO-based takeoff scheme from special [[launch platform]]s, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in [[surface-to-air missile]] technology.\n\n==Jet-powered fighters==\n{{See also|Jet aircraft|Jet engine}}\n\nIt has become common in the aviation community to classify jet fighters by \"generations\" for historical purposes.<ref>For one representation, see: Yoon, Joe. [http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0182.shtml \"Fighter Generations\"]. Aerospaceweb.org. Retrieved 5 October 2008.</ref> There are no official definitions of these generations; rather, they represent the notion that there are stages in the development of fighter design approaches, performance capabilities, and technological evolution. Also other authors have packed the fighters into different generations. For example, Richard P. Hallion of the Secretary of the Air Force's Action Group classified the F-16 as a sixth generation jet fighter.<ref>Hallion, Richard P. [http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj90/win90/1win90.htm \"A Troubling Past: Air Force Fighter Acquisition since 1945.\"] ''Airpower Journal'', Winter 1990.</ref>\n\nThe timeframes associated with each generation are inexact and are only indicative of the period during which their design philosophies and technology employment enjoyed a prevailing influence on fighter design and development. These timeframes also encompass the peak period of service entry for such aircraft.\n\n===First\u2013generation subsonic jet fighters (mid\u20131940s to mid\u20131950s)===\n{{Main|First-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262A at the National Museum of the USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Messerschmitt Me 262A at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial, subsonic jet fighter designs introduced late in World War II and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed [[swept wing|unswept wings]]. Guns and cannon remained the principal armament. The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet-powered aircraft forward. Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines were developed, and was approaching transonic flight speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off, making further speed increases nearly impossible.\n\n[[File:Gloster Meteor Mk III ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Gloster Meteor]]]]\nThe first jets were developed during World War II and saw combat in the last two years of the war. [[Messerschmitt]] developed the first operational jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]]A, primarily serving with [[JG 7]], the world's first jet fighter wing. It was considerably faster than contemporary piston-driven aircraft, and in the hands of a competent pilot, was quite difficult for Allied pilots to defeat. The design was never deployed in numbers sufficient to stop the Allied air campaign, and a combination of fuel shortages, pilot losses, and technical difficulties with the engines kept the number of sorties low. Nevertheless, the Me 262 indicated the obsolescence of piston-driven aircraft. Spurred by reports of the German jets, Britain's [[Gloster Meteor]] entered production soon after and the two entered service around the same time in 1944. Meteors were commonly used to intercept the [[V-1 flying bomb]], as they were faster than available piston-engined fighters at the low altitudes the flying bombs were flying. Nearer the end of World War II, the first military [[Light fighter#Early light jet fighters|jet-powered light fighter]] design, the [[Heinkel He 162]]A ''Spatz'' (sparrow), was intended to be a simple jet fighter for German home defense, with a few examples seeing squadron service with [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] by [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)#1945|April 1945]]. By the end of the war almost all work on piston-powered fighters had ended. A few designs combining piston and jet engines for propulsion \u2013 such as the [[Ryan FR Fireball]] \u2013 saw brief use, but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new fighters were jet-powered.\n\n[[File:Production P-80s af.jpg|thumb|left|USAF [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed P-80B Shooting Stars]] at Langley AFB]]\nDespite their advantages, the early jet fighters were far from perfect. The operational lifespan of turbines were very short and engines were temperamental, while power could be adjusted only slowly and acceleration was poor (even if top speed was higher) compared to the final generation of piston fighters. Many squadrons of piston-engined fighters were retained until the early to mid-1950s, even in the air forces of the major powers (though the types retained were the best of the World War II designs). Innovations including [[ejection seats]], [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]] and [[stabilator|all-moving tailplanes]] became widespread in this period.\n\nThe Americans began using jet fighters operationally post-war, the wartime [[Bell P-59]] having proven itself a failure. The [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] (soon re-designated F-80) was less elegant than the swept-wing Me 262, but had a cruise speed ({{convert|660|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}) as high as the maximum speed attainable by many piston-engined fighters. The British designed several new jets, including the distinctive single-engined [[twin boom]] [[de Havilland Vampire]] which was sold to the air forces of many nations.\n\nThe British transferred the technology of the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] jet engine to the Soviets, who soon put it to use in their advanced [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] fighter, which used fully [[swept wing]]s that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight-winged designs such as the F-80. Its top speed of {{convert|1075|km/h|0|abbr=on}} proved quite a shock to the American F-80 pilots who encountered them in the [[Korean War]], along with their armament of two 23&nbsp;mm cannons and a single 37&nbsp;mm cannon. Nevertheless, in the first jet-versus-jet dogfight, which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950, an F-80 shot down two North Korean MiG-15s.\n\n[[File:F2H Banshee VF-11 over Wonsan colour 1952.jpg|thumb|left|A US Navy [[McDonnell F2H Banshee|McDonnell F2H-2 Banshee]] over [[Wonsan]], North Korea, 1952]]\nThe Americans responded by rushing their own swept-wing fighter \u2013 the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] \u2013 into battle against the MiGs, which had similar [[Transonic speed|transsonic]] performance. The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses, but were similar enough that victory could go either way. While the Sabres were focused primarily on downing MiGs and scored favourably against those flown by the poorly trained North Koreans, the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service.\n\nThe world's navies also transitioned to jets during this period, despite the need for [[Aircraft catapult|catapult-launching]] of the new aircraft. The [[Grumman F9F Panther]] was adopted by the [[U.S. Navy]] as their primary jet fighter in the Korean War period, and it was one of the first jet fighters to employ an [[afterburner]]. The [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Sea Vampire]] was the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Radar was used on specialized night fighters such as the [[Douglas F3D Skyknight]], which also downed MiGs over Korea, and later fitted to the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]] and swept wing [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] and [[McDonnell F3H Demon]] as all-weather / night fighters. Early versions of [[Infra-red]] (IR) [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAMs) such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and radar guided missiles such as the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] whose descendants are still in use, were first introduced on swept wing subsonic Demon and Cutlass naval fighters.\n\n===Second\u2013generation jet fighters (mid\u20131950s to early 1960s)===\n[[File:Lightning.inflight.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[English Electric Lightning]]]]\n{{main|Second-generation jet fighter}}\n\nThe development of second-generation fighters was shaped by technological breakthroughs, lessons learned from the aerial battles of the [[Korean War]], and a focus on conducting operations in a [[nuclear warfare]] environment. Technological advances in [[aerodynamics]], [[Aircraft engine|propulsion]] and aerospace building materials (primarily [[aluminium alloy]]s) permitted designers to experiment with [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] innovations, such as [[swept wing]]s, [[delta wing]]s, and [[area rule|area-ruled]] fuselages. Widespread use of afterburning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation.\n\n[[File:Two Mirage III of the Royal Australian Air Force 1.JPEG|thumb|left|[[Dassault Mirage III]]]]\nFighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to carry aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning and tracking radars. Similarly, advances in guided missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive-homing [[Infrared homing|infrared-guided (IR) missiles]] became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow [[field of view]] (typically no more than 30\u00b0), which limited their effective use to only close-range, [[tail-chase engagement]]s. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These [[semi-active radar homing]] (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of \"[[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond-visual-range]]\" (BVR) combat, and much effort was placed in further development of this technology.\n\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21PF USAF.jpg|thumb|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21F]] interceptor]]\nThe prospect of a potential third world war featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptors]], such as the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]F; and [[fighter-bomber]]s, such as the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[Sukhoi Su-7B]]. [[Dogfight]]ing, per se, was de-emphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond visual ranges. As a result, interceptors were designed with a large missile payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of high speed, altitude ceiling and [[rate of climb]]. With a primary air defense role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defense interceptors often had limited range and little, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing, between air superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional [[gravity bomb]]s, and some were also equipped to deliver a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].\n\n===Third generation jet fighters (early 1960s to circa 1970)===\n{{main|Third-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:QF-4 Holloman AFB.jpg|thumb|U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]\n\nThe third generation witnessed continued maturation of second-generation innovations, but it is most marked by renewed emphases on maneuverability and traditional ground-attack capabilities. Over the course of the 1960s, increasing combat experience with guided missiles demonstrated that combat would devolve into close-in dogfights. Analog [[avionics]] began to appear, replacing older \"steam-gauge\" cockpit instrumentation. Enhancements to the aerodynamic performance of third-generation fighters included [[flight control surfaces]] such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], powered [[Leading edge slats|slats]], and [[blown flap]]s. A number of technologies would be tried for [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing]], but [[thrust vectoring]] would be successful on the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]].\n\nGrowth in air combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air-to-air missiles, radar systems, and other avionics. While guns remained standard equipment (early models of F-4 being a notable exception), air-to-air missiles became the primary weapons for air superiority fighters, which employed more sophisticated radars and medium-range RF AAMs to achieve greater \"stand-off\" ranges, however, kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) for spoofing radar seekers. Infrared-homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45\u00b0, which strengthened their tactical usability. Nevertheless, the low dogfight [[loss exchange ratio|loss-exchange ratios]] experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U.S. Navy to establish its famous \"[[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|TOPGUN]]\" fighter weapons school, which provided a graduate-level curriculum to train fleet fighter pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and [[Dissimilar air combat training|Dissimilar Air Combat Training]] (DACT) tactics and techniques.\n\n[[File:MiG-23 Flogger G.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[MiG-23]]MLA \"Flogger-G\"]]\nThis era also saw an expansion in ground-attack capabilities, principally in guided missiles, and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack, including [[Terrain-following radar|terrain-avoidance systems]]. [[Air-to-surface missile]]s (ASM) equipped with electro-optical (E-O) contrast seekers \u2013 such as the initial model of the widely used [[AGM-65 Maverick]] \u2013 became standard weapons, and [[laser-guided bomb]]s (LGBs) became widespread in effort to improve precision-attack capabilities. Guidance for such [[precision-guided munition]]s (PGM) was provided by externally mounted [[targeting pods]], which were introduced in the mid-1960s.\n\nIt also led to the development of new automatic-fire weapons, primarily [[Chain gun|chain-guns]] that use an electric motor to drive the mechanism of a cannon. This allowed a plane to carry a single multi-barrel weapon (such as the [[M61 Vulcan|20&nbsp;mm Vulcan]]), and provided greater accuracy and rates of fire. Powerplant reliability increased and jet engines became \"smokeless\" to make it harder to sight aircraft at long distances.\n\n[[File:KampfflugzeugF-8China.jpg|thumb|[[Shenyang J-8]]D in flight]]\nDedicated ground-attack aircraft (like the [[A-6 Intruder|Grumman A-6 Intruder]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[A-7 Corsair II|LTV A-7 Corsair II]]) offered longer range, more sophisticated night attack systems or lower cost than supersonic fighters. With [[variable-geometry]] wings, the supersonic [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] introduced the [[Pratt & Whitney TF30]], the first turbofan equipped with afterburner. The ambitious project sought to create a versatile common fighter for many roles and services. It would serve well as an all-weather bomber, but lacked the performance to defeat other fighters. The [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell F-4 Phantom]] was designed around radar and missiles as an [[night fighter|all-weather interceptor]], but emerged as a versatile strike bomber nimble enough to prevail in air combat, adopted by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. Despite numerous shortcomings that would be not be fully addressed until newer fighters, the Phantom claimed 280 aerial kills, more than any other U.S. fighter over Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/Where-Have-All-the-Phantoms-Gone.html?c=y&page=5|title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places \u2013 Air & Space Magazine|work=airspacemag.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> With range and payload capabilities that rivaled that of World War II bombers such as [[B-24 Liberator]], the Phantom would become a highly successful multirole aircraft.\n\n===Fourth generation jet fighters (circa 1970 to mid-1990s)===\n{{main|Fourth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F-16 CJ Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] taking off]]\n\nFourth-generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations, and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics and weapon systems. Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the [[Energy-Maneuverability theory|Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) theory]] developed by Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and mathematician Thomas Christie, based upon Boyd's combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter tactics instructor during the 1960s. E-M theory emphasized the value of [[aircraft specific energy]] maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting \"inside\" an adversary's decision-making cycle, a process Boyd called the \"[[OODA loop]]\" (for \"Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action\"). This approach emphasized aircraft designs that were capable of performing \"fast transients\" \u2013 quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction \u2013 as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone.\n\n[[File:CF-188A BANKING.jpg|thumb|left|A Royal Canadian Air Force [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet]]]]\nE-M characteristics were first applied to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft with a larger, higher-[[Lift (force)|lift]] wing. The small size would minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and increase the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]], while the larger wing would minimize [[wing loading]]; while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range, it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing. The efforts of Boyd's \"[[Fighter mafia|Fighter Mafia]]\" would result in the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]'s).\n\nThe F-16's maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called \"[[relaxed static stability]]\" (RSS), was made possible by introduction of the \"fly-by-wire\" (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight control system]] (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and system integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement and began to be replaced by digital flight control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. Likewise, [[FADEC|Full Authority Digital Engine Controls]] (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls, earned it the [[sobriquet]] of \"the electric jet\". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs.\n\n[[File:F-15C.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] ]]\nOther innovative technologies introduced in fourth-generation fighters include [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[fire-control radar]]s (providing a \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" capability), [[head-up display]]s (HUD), \"[[HOTAS|hands on throttle-and-stick]]\" (HOTAS) controls, and [[multi-function display]]s (MFD), all now essential equipment. Aircraft designers began to incorporate [[composite material]]s in the form of [[Composite honeycomb|bonded aluminum honeycomb]] structural elements and [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|graphite epoxy]] [[laminate]] skins to reduce weight. [[Infra-red search and track|Infrared search-and-track]] (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. \"All-aspect\" IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range [[Active radar homing|active-radar-homing]] RF AAM entered service with the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], which solely equipped the [[F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment.\n\n[[File:DeutschMiG-29G(DF-SD-05-07712).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mikoyan MiG-29]] ]]\nAnother revolution came in the form of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardisation of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and lubrication points, and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 [[man-hour]]s of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day. Some modern military aircraft only require 10 man-hours of work per hour of flight time, and others are even more efficient.\n\nAerodynamic innovations included [[Camber (aerodynamics)|variable-camber]] wings and exploitation of the [[Vortex lift|vortex lift effect]] to achieve higher [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] through the addition of [[Leading edge extension|leading-edge extension]] devices such as [[Strake (aviation)|strakes]].\n\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-27SKM at MAKS-2005 airshow.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Su-27]] 'Flanker']]\nUnlike interceptors of the previous eras, most fourth-generation air-superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters (although the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]] and [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado ADV]] are notable exceptions). The continually rising cost of fighters, however, continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters. The need for both types of fighters led to the \"high/low mix\" concept, which envisioned a high-capability and high-cost core of dedicated air-superiority fighters (like the F-15 and [[Su-27]]) supplemented by a larger contingent of lower-cost [[multi-role fighter]]s (such as the F-16 and [[MiG-29]]).\n\n[[File:Mirage 2000C in-flight 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage 2000]]]]\nMost fourth-generation fighters, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], [[HAL Tejas]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000]], are true multirole warplanes, designed as such from the start. This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became ''pass\u00e9'' (with the [[Panavia Tornado]] being an exception in this regard). Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated [[ground-attack aircraft]] such as the [[Sukhoi Su-25]] and the [[Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]].\n\nA typical [[US Air Force]] fighter [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of the period might contain a mix of one air superiority [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (F-15C), one strike fighter squadron (F-15E), and two multirole fighter squadrons (F-16C).<ref name=Worley>{{cite book|title=Shaping U.S. military forces: revolution or relevance in a post\u2013Cold War world|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99031-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1ME5BWMnmgC&pg=PA125|author=Duane Robert Worley|accessdate=20 January 2011|page=125}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most novel technology introduced for combat aircraft was ''[[Stealth technology|stealth]]'', which involves the use of special \"low-observable\" (L-O) materials and design techniques to reduce the susceptibility of an aircraft to detection by the enemy's sensor systems, particularly radars. The first [[stealth aircraft]] introduced were the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] attack aircraft (introduced in 1983) and the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] bomber (first flew in 1989). Although no stealthy fighters per se appeared among the fourth generation, some radar-absorbent coatings and other L-O treatments developed for these programs are reported to have been subsequently applied to fourth-generation fighters.\n\n===4.5th generation jet fighters (1990s to 2000)===\n\n[[File:F-18E landing 06-10304cr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet]] ]]\n\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a \"[[peace dividend]]\". Air force inventories were cut. Research and development programs working on \"fifth-generation\" fighters took serious hits. Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s, and those that survived were \"stretched out\". While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses, it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long-term. In this instance, however, it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers, avionics and other flight electronics, which had become possible largely due to the advances made in [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] and [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor]] technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth-generation designs \u2013 or redesigns \u2013 with significantly enhanced capabilities. These improved designs have become known as \"Generation 4.5\" fighters, recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations, and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth-generation technologies.\n\n[[File:RSAF Typhoon at Malta - Gordon Zammit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Eurofighter Typhoon]] ]]\nThe primary characteristics of this sub-generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials, modest signature reduction (primarily RF \"stealth\"), and highly integrated systems and weapons. These fighters have been designed to operate in a \"[[Network-centric warfare|network-centric]]\" battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft. Key weapons technologies introduced include [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond-visual-range]] (BVR) AAMs; [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-guided weapons, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radars; [[Helmet mounted display|helmet-mounted sights]]; and improved secure, jamming-resistant [[Data link|datalinks]]. Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4.5th generation fighters, and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of \"[[supercruise]]\" ability. Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal-aspect [[radar cross section]] (RCS) signature-reduction techniques including [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials]] (RAM), L-O coatings and limited shaping techniques.\n\n[[File:Arm\u00e9e de l'Air Rafale C.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French Air Force [[Dassault Rafale]] ]]\n\"Half-generation\" designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory to previous iterations; however, these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight, greater fuel fractions to increase range, and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors. Prime examples of such aircraft, which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of [[Carbon fiber|carbon-fibre composites]], include the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Dassault Rafale]], and [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]].\n\nApart from these fighter jets, most of the 4.5 generation aircraft are actually modified variants of existing airframes from the earlier fourth generation fighter jets. Such fighter jets are generally heavier and examples include the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], which is an evolution of the 1970s [[F/A-18 Hornet]] design, the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], which is a ground-attack/multi-role variant of the [[F-15 Eagle]], the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] variants of the [[Sukhoi Su-30]] and the [[Mikoyan MiG-29M|MiG-29M]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-35|MiG-35]], upgraded versions of the [[Mikoyan MiG-29]]. The Su-30MKI and MiG-35 feature [[thrust vectoring]] engine nozzles to enhance maneuvering.\n\n4.5 generation fighters first entered service in the early 1990s, and most of them are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level of stealth technology needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat.\n\nThe U.S. government has defined 4.5 generation fighter aircraft as those that \"(1) have advanced capabilities, including\u2014 (A) AESA radar; (B) high capacity data-link; and (C) enhanced avionics; and (2) have the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments.\"<ref>[http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543 CRS RL33543, Tactical Aircraft Modernization: Issues for Congress 9 July 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830143750/http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543/ |date=30 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |title=H.R.2647: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \u2013 U.S. Congress \u2013 OpenCongress |work=OpenCongress |accessdate=1 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103092023/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===Fifth generation jet fighters (2005 to the present)===\n{{main|Fifth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F22 Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|A flight of two USAF [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\nThe fifth generation was ushered in by the [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor]] in late 2005. Currently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction [[Active electronically scanned array|AESA]] radars with [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|high-bandwidth]], low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The [[Infra-red search and track]] sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced [[avionics]], [[glass cockpit]]s, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor [[data fusion]] for vastly improved [[situational awareness]] while easing the pilot's workload.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html LockMart's 5TH Generation Fighters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806082314/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html |date=6 August 2009 }}</ref>  Avionics suites rely on extensive use of [[VHSIC|very high-speed integrated circuit]] (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed [[Bus (computing)|data buses]]. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a \"first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability\".\n\n[[File:Sukhoi T-50 Maksimov.jpg|thumb|Russian Air Force [[Sukhoi Su-57]]]]\n[[File:J-20 at Airshow China 2016.jpg|thumb|PLAAF [[Chengdu J-20]]]]\nA key attribute of fifth-generation fighters is a small [[radar cross-section]]. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced to the point where it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, [[Thermosetting plastic|thermoset]] and [[Thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the [[Northrop YF-23]]), and coating internal and external metal areas with [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials and paint]] (RAM/RAP).\n\nThe AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters (and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4.5 aircraft designs, as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth-generation aircraft). In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features, it enables the fighter to function as a sort of \"mini-[[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]],\" providing high-gain [[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic support measures]] (ESM) and [[electronic warfare]] (EW) jamming functions.  Other technologies common to this latest generation of fighters includes integrated electronic warfare system (INEWS) technology, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI) avionics technology, centralized \"vehicle health monitoring\" systems for ease of maintenance, [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optics data transmission]], [[stealth technology]] and even hovering capabilities.  Maneuver performance remains important and is enhanced by thrust-vectoring, which also helps reduce takeoff and landing distances. Supercruise may or may not be featured; it permits flight at supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburner \u2013 a device that significantly increases IR signature when used in full military power.\n\n[[File:F-35A flight (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|USAF [[Lockheed Martin F-35A]]]]\nSuch aircraft are sophisticated and expensive. The U.S. Air Force originally planned to acquire 650 F-22s, but now only 187 will be built. As a result, its unit flyaway cost (FAC) is around US$150&nbsp;million. To spread the development costs \u2013 and production base \u2013 more broadly, the [[Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program enrolls eight other countries as cost- and risk-sharing partners. Altogether, the nine partner nations anticipate procuring over 3,000 [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] fighters at an anticipated average FAC of $80\u201385&nbsp;million. The F-35, however, is designed to be a family of three aircraft, a [[CTOL|conventional take-off and landing]] (CTOL) fighter, a [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical landing]] (STOVL) fighter, and a [[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR) fighter, each of which has a different unit price and slightly varying specifications in terms of fuel capacity (and therefore range), size and [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]].\n\nOther countries have initiated fifth-generation fighter development projects, with Russia's [[Sukhoi Su-57]] and [[Mikoyan LMFS]]. In December 2010, it was discovered that China is developing the 5th generation fighter [[Chengdu J-20]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/chinese-j20-stealth-fighter-image-military-power |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Jonathan |last1=Watts |first2=Julian |last2=Borger |title=Chinese jet fighter 'sighting' raises fears over region's military power balance |date=5 January 2011}}</ref>  The J-20 took its maiden flight in January 2011.

The power of air-to-air guns has increased greatly over time, and has kept them relevant in the guided missile era.<ref>Shaw, Robert (Cmdr, USN), ''Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering'', Naval Institute Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-87021-059-9}}, pp. 1\u201321.</ref> In WWI two rifle calibre machine guns was the typical armament <!-- majority of aircraft been French, German (7.92 mm) or British (0.303) --> producing a weight of fire of about {{convert|0.4|kg|abbr=on}} per second.  The standard WWII American fighter armament of six 0.50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns fired a bullet weight of approximately 3.7&nbsp;kg/sec (8.1&nbsp;lbs/sec), at a muzzle velocity of 856&nbsp;m/s (2,810&nbsp;ft/s). British and German aircraft tended to use a mix of machine guns and autocannon, the latter firing explosive projectiles. The modern [[M61 Vulcan]] 20&nbsp;mm rotating barrel Gatling gun that is standard on current American fighters fires a projectile weight of about 10&nbsp;kg/s (22&nbsp;lb/s), nearly three times that of six 0.50-cal machine guns, with higher velocity of 1,052&nbsp;m/s (3450&nbsp;ft/s) supporting a flatter trajectory, and with exploding projectiles.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p.6.</ref> Modern fighter gun systems also feature ranging radar and lead computing electronic gun sights to ease the problem of aim point to compensate for projectile drop and time of flight (target lead) in the complex three dimensional maneuvering of air-to-air combat. However, getting in position to use the guns is the challenge. The range of guns is longer than in the past but still quite limited compared to missiles, with modern gun systems having a maximum effective range of approximately 1,000 meters.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p. 15.</ref> High probability of kill also requires firing to usually occur from the rear hemisphere of the target.<ref>Shaw, 1985, pp. 16\u201324.</ref> Despite these limits, when pilots are well trained in air-to-air gunnery and these conditions are satisfied, gun systems are tactically effective and highly cost efficient. The cost of a gun firing pass is far less than firing a missile, and the projectiles are not subject to the thermal and electronic countermeasures than can sometimes defeat missiles. When the enemy can be approached to within gun range, the lethality of guns is approximately a 25% to 50% chance of \"kill per firing pass\".<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp. 113\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe range limitations of guns, and the desire to overcome large variations in fighter pilot skill and thus achieve higher force effectiveness, led to the development of the guided [[air-to-air missile]]. There are two main variations, heat-seeking (infrared homing), and radar guided. Radar missiles are typically several times heavier and more expensive than heat-seekers, but with longer range, greater destructive power, and ability to track through clouds.\n\nThe highly successful [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] heat-seeking (infrared homing) short-range missile was developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s. These small missiles are easily carried by lighter fighters, and provide effective ranges of approximately 10 to 35&nbsp;km (~6 to 22 miles). Beginning with the AIM-9L in 1977, subsequent versions of Sidewinder have added [[all-aspect]] capability, the ability to use the lower heat of air to skin friction on the target aircraft to track from the front and sides. The latest (2003 service entry) AIM-9X also features \"off-boresight\" and \"lock on after launch\" capabilities, which allow the pilot to make a quick launch of a missile to track a target anywhere within the pilot's vision. The AIM-9X development cost was U.S. $3 billion in mid to late 1990s dollars,<ref>\"AIM-9X SIDEWINDER AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE\", Raytheon Systems Company, available at http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/pdf/navy/00aim9x.pdf</ref> and 2015 per unit procurement cost is $0.6 million each. The missile weighs 85.3&nbsp;kg (188&nbsp;lbs), and has a maximum range of 35&nbsp;km (22 miles) at higher altitudes. Like most air-to-air missiles, lower altitude range can be as limited as only about one third of maximum due to higher drag and less ability to coast downward.<ref>''Modern Fighter Combat'', Mike Spick, p.14.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of heat-seeking missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War,<ref>Sprey, 1982, p.82.</ref> but improved to approximately 15%\u201340% over the course of the war. The [[AIM-4 Falcon]] used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%.<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp.116\u2013118.</ref> Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], achieving 60 kills and 10 losses.<ref>Coram, p.219</ref> However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of out of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%).<ref>{{citation |first=LtCol Patrick |last=Higby |title=Promise and Reality: Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Air-To-Air Combat |publisher=Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base |date= March 2005 |page=8 |url=http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf}}</ref> The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 [[Falklands War]].<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 27.</ref> But, in a conflict against opponents using thermal countermeasures, the United States only scored 11 kills out of 48 fired (Pk = 23%) with the follow-on AIM-9M in the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 28.</ref>\n\n[[File:AIM-120 AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|AIM-9 Sidewinder (underwing pylon) and AIM-120 AMRAAM (wingtip) carried by lightweight F-16 fighter]]\nRadar guided missiles fall into two main [[missile guidance]] types. In the historically more common [[semi-active radar homing]] case the missile homes in on radar signals transmitted from launching aircraft and reflected from the target. This has the disadvantage that the firing aircraft must maintain radar lock on the target and is thus less free to maneuver and more vulnerable to attack. A widely deployed missile of this type was the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], which entered service in 1954 and was produced in improving versions until 1997. In more advanced [[active radar homing]] the missile is guided to the vicinity of the target by internal data on its projected position, and then \u201cgoes active\u201d with an internally carried small radar system to conduct terminal guidance to the target. This eliminates the requirement for the firing aircraft to maintain radar lock, and thus greatly reduces risk. A prominent example is the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], which was first fielded in 1991 as the AIM-7 replacement, and which has no firm retirement date {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. The current AIM-120D version has a maximum high altitude range of greater than 160&nbsp;km (>99 miles), and cost approximately $2.4 million each (2016). As is typical with most other missiles, range at lower altitude may be as little as one third that of high altitude.\n\nIn the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] radar guided missiles in a row without a hit.<ref>Stevenson, p. 9.</ref> Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only four of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles.<ref>Burton, James (Col., U.S. Air Force), ''The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard'', Chapter 1, Kindle Location 471, Naval Institute Press, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-61251-369-0}}.</ref> The United States invested over $10 billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s.<ref>Stevenson, p. 36.</ref> Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over $130 million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, -19s, and -21s, with new cost of $0.3 million to $3 million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness.\n\nHowever, continuing heavy development investment and rapidly advancing electronic technology led to significant improvement in radar missile reliabilities from the late 1970s onward. Radar guided missiles achieved 75% Pk (9 kills out of 12 shots) in operations in the Gulf War in 1991.<ref>{{citation |first=LtCol Patrick |last=Higby |title=Promise and Reality: Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Air-To-Air Combat |publisher=Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base |date= March 2005 |page=13 |url=http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf}}</ref> The percentage of kills achieved by radar guided missiles also surpassed 50% of total kills for the first time by 1991. Since 1991, 20 of 61 kills worldwide have been beyond-visual-range using radar missiles.<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 23, available at https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/files/2008_RAND_Pacific_View_Air_Combat_Briefing.pdf</ref> Discounting an accidental friendly fire kill, in operational use the AIM-120D (the current main American radar guided missile) has achieved 9 kills out of 16 shots for a 56% Pk. Six of these kills were BVR, out of 13 shots, for a 46% BVR Pk.<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 20, available at https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/files/2008_RAND_Pacific_View_Air_Combat_Briefing.pdf</ref> Though all these kills were against less capable opponents who were not equipped with operating radar, electronic countermeasures, or a comparable weapon themselves, the BVR Pk was a significant improvement from earlier eras. However, a current concern is electronic countermeasures to radar missiles,<ref name=\"auto\">\"Can U.S. air-to-air missiles hit their targets through today's enemy electronic warfare?\", Military and Aerospace Electronics, April 12, 2016, http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2016/04/ew-missiles-challenge.html</ref> which are thought to be reducing the effectiveness of the AIM-120D. Some experts believe that {{as of|2016|lc=y}} the European [[Meteor (missile)|Meteor missile]], the Russian K-37M, and the Chinese PL-15 are more resistant to countermeasures and more effective than the AIM-120D.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nNow that higher reliabilities have been achieved, both types of missiles allow the fighter pilot to often avoid the risk of the short-range dogfight, where only the more experienced and skilled fighter pilots tend to prevail, and where even the finest fighter pilot can simply get unlucky. Taking maximum advantage of complicated missile parameters in both attack and defense against competent opponents does take considerable experience and skill,<ref>Shaw, pp.45\u201361.</ref> but against surprised opponents lacking comparable capability and countermeasures, air-to-air missile warfare is relatively simple. By partially automating air-to-air combat and reducing reliance on gun kills mostly achieved by only a small expert fraction of fighter pilots, air-to-air missiles now serve as highly effective force multipliers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of fighter aircraft]]\n* [[Warbird]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{citation |title=Gripen, the First Fourth Generation Fighter |first1=Jan |last1=Ahlgren|first2=Anders |last2=Linner |first3=Lars |last3=Wigert |publisher=Swedish Air Force and Saab Aerospace |date= 2002|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard |first=James |last=Burton |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date= 1993 |isbn=978-1-61251-369-0}}\n*{{citation |title= Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939 |first=Alvin |last=Coox |publisher=Stanford University Press |date= 1985 |isbn=0-8047-1160-7}}\n*{{citation |title=Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War |first=Robert |last=Coram |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |date= 2002 |isbn=0-316-88146-5}}\n*{{citation |title=The Fighter Aircraft Pocket Book|first=Roy|last=Cross|publisher=Jarrold and Sons, Ltd.|date= 1962|isbn=}}\n*{{citation |title= The Encyclopedia of Aircraft of WWII |first=Paul |last=Eden |publisher=Amber Books, Ltd, London |date= 2004 |isbn=1-904687-07-5}}\n*{{citation |title= Jane's War at Sea |first1=Eric |last1=Grove |first2=Bernard |last2=Ireland |publisher= Harper Collins Publishers, UK |date= 1997 |isbn=0-00-472065-2}}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Air Combat |first1=Bill|last1=Gunston|first2=Mike|last2=Spick|publisher=Crescent Books|date= 1983|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security |first=Grant T. |last=Hammond |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |date= 2001 |isbn=1-56098-941-6}}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Combat Aircraft Design |first=Klaus |last=Huenecke |publisher=Airlife Publishing Limited |date= 1987 |isbn=0-517-412659}}\n*{{citation |title=Fighter Facts and Fallacies |first=John |last=Lee |publisher=William Morrow and Company |date= 1942 |isbn=}}\n*{{citation |title=Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering |first=Robert |last=Shaw |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date= 1985 |isbn=0-87021-059-9}}\n*{{citation |title=Designed for the Kill: The Jet Fighter\u2014Development and Experience |first=Mike |last=Spick |publisher=United States Naval Institute |date= 1995 |isbn=0-87021-059-9}}\n*{{citation |title=An Illustrated Guide to Modern Fighter Combat |first=Mike |last=Spick |publisher=Salamander Books Limited |date= 1987 |isbn=0-86101-319-0}}\n*{{citation |title=Brassey's Modern Fighters |first=Mike |last=Spick |publisher=Pegasus Publishing Limited |date= 2000 |isbn=1-57488-247-3}}\n*{{citation |title=Comparing the Effectiveness of Air-to-Air Fighters: F-86 to F-18 |first=Pierre |last= Sprey |date=1982 |work= U.S. DoD Contract MDA 903-81-C-0312 |url= http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/09/08.pdf }}\n*{{citation |title=The Pentagon Paradox: The Development of the F-18 Hornet |first=James |last=Stevenson |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date= 1993 |isbn=1-55750-775-9}}\n*{{citation |title=Introduction to Airborne Radar |first=George |last=Stimson |publisher=Hughes Aircraft Company |date= 1983 |isbn=}}\n*{{citation |title=Northrop F-5 Case Study in Aircraft Design |first=William |last=Stuart |publisher=Northrop Corp. |date= 1978 |isbn=}} \n*{{citation |last=Wagner |first=Raymond |title= Mustang Designer: Edgar Schmued and the P-51 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |date=2000 |isbn= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://theaviationist.com/2011/01/13/fighter-generations-comparison-chart/ Fighter generations comparison chart on theaviationist.com]\n\n{{Military aircraft types (roles)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fighter Aircraft}}\n[[Category:Fighter aircraft| ]]", "sha1": "3m3trdrshdofz7tc1q12r5doqmzmzd2"}}, {"title": "February 25", "ns": "0", "id": "10930", "revision": {"id": "860746319", "parentid": "860744100", "timestamp": "2018-09-22T19:20:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lepetro", "id": "32810263"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n* [[138]] &ndash;

It is an [[abstract machine]] that can be in exactly one of a finite number of ''[[state (computer science)|states]]'' at any given time.  The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external [[Input (computer science)|inputs]]; the change from one state to another is called a ''transition''. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the conditions for each transition. Finite state machines are of two types - [[deterministic finite automaton|deterministic finite state machines]] and [[nondeterministic finite automaton|non-deterministic finite state machines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/finite-state-machines/|title=Finite State Machines - Brilliant Math & Science Wiki|author=|date=|website=brilliant.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.\n\nThe behavior of state machines can be observed in many devices in modern society that perform a predetermined sequence of actions depending on a sequence of events with which they are presented.  Simple examples are [[vending machine]]s, which dispense products when the proper combination of coins is deposited, [[elevator]]s, whose sequence of stops is determined by the floors requested by riders, [[traffic light]]s, which change sequence when cars are waiting, and [[combination lock]]s, which require the input of combination numbers in the proper order.\n\nThe finite state machine has less computational power than some other models of computation such as the [[Turing machine]].<ref name=\"Belzer\">{{cite book\n  | last = Belzer\n  | first = Jack\n  | authorlink = \n  | first2=Albert George |last2=Holzman |first3=Allen |last3=Kent\n  | title = Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology |volume=25\n  | publisher = CRC Press\n  | year = 1975\n  | location = USA\n  | pages = 73\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W2YLBIdeLIEC&printsec=frontcover&f=false\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 0-8247-2275-2}}</ref>  The computational power distinction means there are computational tasks that a Turing machine can do but a FSM cannot. This is because a FSM's [[Computer memory|memory]] is limited by the number of states it has.  FSMs are studied in the more general field of [[automata theory]].\n\n== Example: coin-operated turnstile ==\n[[File:Turnstile state machine colored.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|State diagram for a turnstile]]\n[[File:Torniqueterevolution.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A turnstile]]\nAn example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a [[turnstile]].<ref name=\"Koshy\">{{cite book\n  | last = Koshy\n  | first = Thomas\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Discrete Mathematics With Applications\n  | publisher = Academic Press\n  | year = 2004\n  | location = \n  | pages = 762\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=90KApidK5NwC&pg=PA762&f=false\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 0-12-421180-1}}</ref><ref name=\"\u2047\u2047\u2047?\">{{cite web\n |last       = Wright\n |first      = David R.\n |authorlink = \n |title      = Finite State Machines\n |work       = CSC215 Class Notes\n |publisher  = David R.

Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through.  Depositing a coin or [[Token coin|token]] in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through.  After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\n\nConsidered as a state machine, the turnstile has two possible states: '''''Locked''''' and '''''Unlocked'''''.<ref name=\"Koshy\" />  There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot ('''''coin''''') and pushing the arm ('''''push''''').  In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input '''''push''''' is given, it stays in the locked state.  Putting a coin in \u2013 that is, giving the machine a '''''coin''''' input \u2013 shifts the state from '''''Locked''''' to '''''Unlocked'''''.  In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional '''''coin''''' inputs does not change the state.  However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a '''''push''''' input, shifts the state back to '''''Locked'''''.\n\nThe turnstile state machine can be represented by a [[state transition table]], showing for each possible state, the transitions between them (based upon the inputs given to the machine) and the outputs resulting from each input:\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Current State\n! Input\n! Next State\n! Output\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Locked\n| coin || Unlocked || Unlocks the turnstile so that the customer can push through.\n|-\n| push || Locked || None\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Unlocked\n| coin || Unlocked || None\n|-\n| push || Locked || When the customer has pushed through, locks the turnstile.\n|}\nThe turnstile state machine can also be represented by a [[directed graph]] called a [[state diagram]] ''(above)''.  Each state is represented by a [[node (graph theory)|node]] (''circle'').  Edges (''arrows'') show the transitions from one state to another.  Each arrow is labeled with the input that triggers that transition.  An input that doesn't cause a change of state (such as a '''''coin''''' input in the '''''Unlocked''''' state) is represented by a circular arrow returning to the original state.  The arrow into the '''''Locked''''' node from the black dot indicates it is the initial state.\n\n== Concepts and terminology ==\nA ''state'' is a description of the status of a system that is waiting to execute a ''transition''. A transition is a set of actions to be executed when a condition is fulfilled or when an event is received.\nFor example, when using an audio system to listen to the radio (the system is in the \"radio\" state), receiving a \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next station. When the system is in the \"CD\" state, the \"next\" stimulus results in moving to the next track. Identical stimuli trigger different actions depending on the current state.\n\nIn some finite-state machine representations, it is also possible to associate actions with a state:\n* an entry action: performed ''when entering'' the state, and\n* an exit action: performed ''when exiting'' the state.\n\n== Representations ==\n[[File:UML state machine Fig5.png|thumb|Fig. 1 UML state chart example (a toaster oven)]]\n[[File:SdlStateMachine.png|thumb|Fig. 2 SDL state machine example]]\n[[File:Finite state machine example with comments.svg|thumb|Fig. 3 Example of a simple finite state machine]]\n\n{{hatnote|For an introduction, see [[State diagram]].}}\n\n=== State/Event table ===\nSeveral [[state transition table]] types are used. The most common representation is shown below: the combination of current state (e.g. B) and input (e.g. Y) shows the next state (e.g. C). The complete action's information is not directly described in the table and can only be added using footnotes. A FSM definition including the full actions information is possible using [[Virtual finite state machine#State Table|state tables]] (see also [[virtual finite-state machine]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\"\n|+ State transition table\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|Input|&nbsp; Current<br />state}} || State A || State B || State C\n|-\n!

Input Z\n| \u2026 || \u2026 || \u2026\n|}\n\n=== UML state machines ===\nThe [[Unified Modeling Language]] has a notation for describing state machines. [[UML state machine]]s overcome the limitations of traditional finite state machines while retaining their main benefits. UML state machines introduce the new concepts of [[UML state machine#Hierarchically nested states|hierarchically nested states]] and [[UML state machine#Orthogonal regions|orthogonal regions]], while extending the notion of [[UML state machine#Actions and transitions|actions]]. UML state machines have the characteristics of both [[Mealy machine]]s and [[Moore machine]]s. They support [[UML state machine#Actions and transitions|actions]] that depend on both the state of the system and the triggering [[UML state machine#Events|event]], as in Mealy machines, as well as [[UML state machine#Entry and exit actions|entry and exit actions]], which are associated with states rather than transitions, as in Moore machines.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== SDL state machines ===\nThe [[Specification and Description Language]] is a standard from [[ITU]] that includes graphical symbols to describe actions in the transition:\n* send an event\n* receive an event\n* start a timer\n* cancel a timer\n* start another concurrent state machine\n* decision\nSDL embeds basic data types called \"Abstract Data Types\", an action language, and an execution semantic in order to make the finite state machine executable.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Other state diagrams ===\nThere are a large number of variants to represent an FSM such as the one in figure 3.\n\n== Usage ==\nIn addition to their use in modeling reactive systems presented here, finite state machines are significant in many different areas, including [[electrical engineering]], [[linguistics]], [[computer science]], [[philosophy]], [[biology]], [[mathematic]]s, and [[logic]]. Finite state machines are a class of automata studied in [[automata theory]] and the [[theory of computation]].\nIn computer science, finite state machines are widely used in modeling of application behavior, design of [[Digital electronics|hardware digital systems]], [[software engineering]], [[compiler]]s, [[network protocol]]s, and the study of computation and languages.\n\n== Classification ==\nFinite state machines can be subdivided into transducers, acceptors, classifiers and sequencers.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keller |first= Robert M. |title=Computer Science: Abstraction to Implementation |url=http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/cs60book/%20%20%20All.pdf |year=2001 |publisher=Harvey Mudd College |page= 480| chapter=Classifiers, Acceptors, Transducers, and Sequencers| chapterurl =http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/cs60book/12%20Finite-State%20Machines.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Acceptors (recognizers) ===\n[[File:Fsm parsing word nice.svg|thumb|Fig. 4 Acceptor FSM: parsing the string \"nice\"]]\n\n'''Acceptors''' (also called '''recognizers''' and '''sequence detectors'''), produce binary output, indicating whether or not the received input is accepted. Each state of an FSM is either \"accepting\" or \"not accepting\". Once all input has been received, if the current state is an accepting state, the input is accepted; otherwise it is rejected. As a rule, input is a [[string (computer science)|sequence of symbols]] (characters); actions are not used. The example in figure 4 shows a finite state machine that accepts the string \"nice\". In this FSM, the only accepting state is state 7.\n\nA (possibly infinite) set of symbol sequences, aka. formal language, is called a [[regular language]] if there is some Finite State Machine that accepts exactly that set. For example, the set of binary strings with an even number of zeroes is a regular language (cf. Fig. 5), while the set of all strings whose length is a prime number is not.<ref>{{cite book | isbn=0-201-02988-X | author=John E. Hopcroft and Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation | location=Reading/MA | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=1979 }}</ref>{{rp|18,71}}\n\nA machine could also be described as defining a language, that would contain every string accepted by the machine but none of the rejected ones; that language is \"accepted\" by the machine. By definition, the languages accepted by FSMs are the [[regular language]]s\u2014; a language is regular if there is some FSM that accepts it.\n\nThe problem of determining the language accepted by a given finite state acceptor is an instance of the [[algebraic path problem]]\u2014itself a generalization of the [[shortest path problem]] to graphs with edges weighted by the elements of an (arbitrary) [[semiring]].<ref name=\"PoulyKohlas2012\">{{cite book|first1=Marc |last1=Pouly |first2=J\u00fcrg |last2=Kohlas |title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|at=Chapter 6.

S<sub>1</sub> is therefore an accepting state. This machine will finish in an accept state, if the binary string contains an even number of 0s (including any binary string containing no 0s). Examples of strings accepted by this DFA are [[\u03b5]] (the [[empty string]]), 1, 11, 11\u2026, 00, 010, 1010, 10110, etc.\n\n===Classifiers===\nA '''classifier''' is a generalization of a finite state machine that, similar to an acceptor, produces a single output on termination but has more than two terminal states.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Transducers ===\n[[File:Fsm Moore model door control.svg|thumb|Fig. 6 Transducer FSM: Moore model example]]\n{{Main article|Finite-state transducer }}\n\n[[Finite-state transducer|Transducers]] generate output based on a given input and/or a state using actions. They are used for control applications and in the field of [[computational linguistics]].\n\nIn control applications, two types are distinguished:\n\n;[[Moore machine]]: The FSM uses only entry actions, i.e., output depends only on the state. The advantage of the Moore model is a simplification of the behaviour. Consider an elevator door. The state machine recognizes two commands: \"command_open\" and \"command_close\", which trigger state changes. The entry action (E:) in state \"Opening\" starts a motor opening the door, the entry action in state \"Closing\" starts a motor in the other direction closing the door. States \"Opened\" and \"Closed\" stop the motor when fully opened or closed. They signal to the outside world (e.g., to other state machines) the situation: \"door is open\" or \"door is closed\".\n\n[[File:Fsm mealy model door control.svg|thumb|Fig. 7 Transducer FSM: Mealy model example]]\n;[[Mealy machine]]: The FSM also uses input actions, i.e., output depends on input and state. The use of a Mealy FSM leads often to a reduction of the number of states. The example in figure 7 shows a Mealy FSM implementing the same behaviour as in the Moore example (the behaviour depends on the implemented FSM execution model and will work, e.g., for [[Virtual finite-state machine|virtual FSM]] but not for [[event-driven finite-state machine|event-driven FSM]]). There are two input actions (I:): \"start motor to close the door if command_close arrives\" and \"start motor in the other direction to open the door if command_open arrives\". The \"opening\" and \"closing\" intermediate states are not shown.\n\n=== Generators ===\n'''Sequencers''', or '''generators''', are a subclass of the acceptor and transducer types that have a [[Arity#Nullary|single-letter input alphabet]]. They produce only one sequence which can be seen as an output sequence of acceptor or transducer outputs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Determinism ===\nA further distinction is between '''deterministic''' ([[Deterministic finite automaton|DFA]]) and '''non-deterministic''' ([[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NFA]], [[GNFA]]) automata. In a deterministic automaton, every state has exactly one transition for each possible input. In a non-deterministic automaton, an input can lead to one, more than one, or no transition for a given state. The [[powerset construction]] algorithm can transform any nondeterministic automaton into a (usually more complex) deterministic automaton with identical functionality.\n\nA finite state machine with only one state is called a \"combinatorial FSM\". It only allows actions upon transition ''into'' a state. This concept is useful in cases where a number of finite state machines are required to work together, and when it is convenient to consider a purely combinatorial part as a form of FSM to suit the design tools.<ref>Brutscheck, M., Berger, S., Franke, M., Schwarzbacher, A., Becker, S.: Structural Division Procedure for Efficient IC Analysis.

If an FSM <math>M</math> is in a state <math>q</math>, the next symbol is <math>x</math> and <math>\\delta(q,x)</math> is not defined, then <math>M</math> can announce an error (i.e. reject the input). This is useful in definitions of general state machines, but less useful when transforming the machine. Some algorithms in their default form may require total functions.\n\nA finite state machine has the same computational power as a [[Turing machine]] that is restricted such that its head may only perform \"read\" operations, and always has to move from left to right. That is, each formal language accepted by a finite state machine is accepted by such a kind of restricted Turing machine, and vice versa.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Black\n|first=Paul E\n|date=12 May 2008\n|title=Finite State Machine\n|journal=Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures\n|publisher=U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]\n|url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/finiteStateMachine.html}}</ref>\n\n* A ''[[finite-state transducer]]'' is a [[sextuple]] <math>(\\Sigma, \\Gamma, S, s_0, \\delta, \\omega)</math>, where:\n** <math>\\Sigma</math> is the input [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] (a finite non-empty set of symbols).\n** <math>\\Gamma</math> is the output alphabet (a finite, non-empty set of symbols).\n** <math>S</math> is a finite, non-empty set of states.\n** <math>s_0</math> is the initial state, an element of <math>S</math>.

A finite-state machine with no output function at all is known as a [[semiautomaton]] or [[transition system]].\n\nIf we disregard the first output symbol of a Moore machine, <math>\\omega (s_0)</math>, then it can be readily converted to an output-equivalent Mealy machine by setting the output function of every Mealy transition (i.e. labeling every edge) with the output symbol given of the destination Moore state. The converse transformation is less straightforward because a Mealy machine state may have different output labels on its incoming transitions (edges).

It is a [[declarative programming]] paradigm, which means programming is done with [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] or declarations<ref name=\"expression style\">{{cite web|url=https://wiki.haskell.org/Declaration_vs._expression_style#Expression_style|title=Declaration vs. expression style - HaskellWiki|publisher=}}</ref> instead of [[statement (computer science)|statements]]. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the [[function argument|argument]]s that are passed to the function, so calling a function ''f'' twice with the same value for an argument ''x'' produces the same result ''f(x)'' each time; this is in contrast to [[Subroutine|procedures]] depending on a [[local state|local]] or [[Global variable|global state]], which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.\n\nFunctional programming has its origins in [[lambda calculus]], a [[formal system]] developed in the 1930s to investigate [[computability]], the [[Entscheidungsproblem]], function definition, [[function application]], and [[recursion]]. Many functional [[programming language]]s can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. Another well-known declarative programming paradigm, ''[[logic programming]]'', is based on [[Relation (logic)|relations]].<ref name=\"hudak1989\"/>\n\nIn contrast, [[imperative programming]] changes state with commands in the [[source code]], the simplest example being [[assignment (computer science)|assignment]]. Imperative programming does have [[subroutine]] functions, but these are not functions in the mathematical sense. They can have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] that may change the value of program state. Functions without [[return value]]s therefore make sense. Because of this, they lack [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]], i.e., the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program.<ref name=\"hudak1989\">{{cite journal | last = Hudak | first = Paul | authorlink = Paul Hudak | title = Conception, evolution, and application of functional programming languages | journal = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Computing Surveys|volume=21|issue=3 | pages = 359\u2013411 |date=September 1989 | url = http://www.dbnet.ece.ntua.gr/~adamo/languages/books/p359-hudak.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.1145/72551.72554 }}</ref>\n\nFunctional programming languages have largely been emphasized in [[academic|academia]] rather than in commercial software development.

It is a mathematical abstraction rather than a programming language\u2014but it forms the basis of almost all current functional programming languages. An equivalent theoretical formulation, [[combinatory logic]], is commonly perceived as more abstract than lambda calculus and preceded it in invention.

To accomplish this, they had to invent a language and a paradigm that, viewed retrospectively, embeds functional programming.</ref> It is an [[assembly language|assembly-style language]] for manipulating lists of symbols. It does have a notion of ''generator'', which amounts to a function that accepts a function as an argument, and, since it is an assembly-level language, code can be data, so IPL can be regarded as having higher-order functions. However, it relies heavily on mutating list structure and similar imperative features.\n\n[[Kenneth E. Iverson]] developed [[APL (programming language)|APL]] in the early 1960s, described in his 1962 book ''A Programming Language'' ({{ISBN|9780471430148}}). APL was the primary influence on [[John Backus]]'s [[FP (programming language)|FP]]. In the early 1990s, Iverson and [[Roger Hui]] created [[J (programming language)|J]].

This led to new approaches to [[interactive theorem proving]] and has influenced the development of subsequent functional programming languages.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The lazy functional language, [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]], developed by David Turner, initially appeared in 1985 and had a strong influence on [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

In calculus, an example of a higher-order function is the [[differential operator]] <math>d/dx</math>, which returns the [[derivative]] of a function <math>f</math>.\n\nHigher-order functions are closely related to [[first-class function]]s in that higher-order functions and first-class functions both allow functions as arguments and results of other functions. The distinction between the two is subtle: \"higher-order\" describes a mathematical concept of functions that operate on other functions, while \"first-class\" is a computer science term that describes programming language entities that have no restriction on their use (thus first-class functions can appear anywhere in the program that other first-class entities like numbers can, including as arguments to other functions and as their return values).\n\nHigher-order functions enable [[partial application]] or [[currying]], a technique that applies a function to its arguments one at a time, with each application returning a new function that accepts the next argument. This lets a programmer succinctly express, for example, the [[successor function]] as the addition operator partially applied to the [[natural number]] one.\n\n=== Pure functions ===\n[[Pure function]]s (or expressions) have no [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]] (memory or I/O). This means that pure functions have several useful properties, many of which can be used to optimize the code:\n\n* If the result of a pure expression is not used, it can be removed without affecting other expressions.\n* If a pure function is called with arguments that cause no side-effects, the result is constant with respect to that argument list (sometimes called [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]]), i.e., if calling the pure function again with the same arguments returns the same result. (This can enable caching optimizations such as [[memoization]].)\n* If there is no data dependency between two pure expressions, their order can be reversed, or they can be performed in [[parallelization|parallel]] and they cannot interfere with one another (in other terms, the evaluation of any pure expression is [[thread-safe]]).\n* If the entire language does not allow side-effects, then any evaluation strategy can be used; this gives the compiler freedom to reorder or combine the evaluation of expressions in a program (for example, using [[deforestation (computer science)|deforestation]]).\n\nWhile most compilers for imperative programming languages detect pure functions and perform common-subexpression elimination for pure function calls, they cannot always do this for pre-compiled libraries, which generally do not expose this information, thus preventing optimizations that involve those external functions. Some compilers, such as [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], add extra keywords for a programmer to explicitly mark external functions as pure, to enable such optimizations. [[Fortran 95]] also lets functions be designated ''pure''.<ref name=fortran95>{{cite journal | title = ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG5/N2137 | publisher = International Organization for Standardization | date = July 6, 2017 | url = https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/19089292/N2137.pdf.flv?func=sspndocuments.Fetch&nodeid=19089292&viewType=1}}</ref> C++11 added <code>constexpr</code> keyword with similar semantics.\n\n=== Recursion ===\n{{Main|Recursion (computer science)}}\n\n[[Iteration]] (looping) in functional languages is usually accomplished via [[recursion]]. [[recursion (computer science)|Recursive function]]s invoke themselves, letting an operation be repeated until it reaches the [[Recursion (computer science)|base case]]. Although some recursion requires maintaining a stack, [[tail recursion]] can be recognized and optimized by a compiler into the same code used to implement iteration in imperative languages. The [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] language standard requires implementations to recognize and optimize tail recursion. Tail recursion optimization can be implemented by transforming the program into [[continuation passing style]] during compiling, among other approaches.\n\nCommon patterns of recursion can be factored out using higher order functions, with [[catamorphism]]s and [[anamorphism]]s (or \"folds\" and \"unfolds\") being the most obvious examples. Such higher order functions play a role analogous to built-in control structures such as [[Program loops|loops]] in [[imperative languages]].\n\nMost general purpose functional programming languages allow unrestricted recursion and are [[Turing complete]], which makes the [[halting problem]] [[undecidable problem|undecidable]], can cause unsoundness of [[equational reasoning]], and generally requires the introduction of [[inconsistency]] into the logic expressed by the language's [[type system]]. Some special purpose languages such as [[Coq]] allow only [[well-founded]] recursion and are [[strongly normalizing]] (nonterminating computations can be expressed only with infinite streams of values called [[codata (computer science)|codata]]). As a consequence, these languages fail to be Turing complete and expressing certain functions in them is impossible, but they can still express a wide class of interesting computations while avoiding the problems introduced by unrestricted recursion. Functional programming limited to well-founded recursion with a few other constraints is called [[total functional programming]].<ref name=totalfp>{{cite journal | last = Turner | first = D.A.|author-link=David Turner (computer scientist) | title = Total Functional Programming | journal = Journal of Universal Computer Science|volume=10| date = 2004-07-28 | pages = 751\u2013768 | url = http://www.jucs.org/jucs_10_7/total_functional_programming|doi=10.3217/jucs-010-07-0751|issue=7}}</ref>\n\n=== Strict versus non-strict evaluation ===\n{{Main|Evaluation strategy}}\n\nFunctional languages can be categorized by whether they use ''strict (eager)'' or ''non-strict (lazy)'' evaluation, concepts that refer to how function arguments are processed when an expression is being evaluated. The technical difference is in the [[denotational semantics]] of expressions containing failing or divergent computations. Under strict evaluation, the evaluation of any term containing a failing subterm fails. For example, the expression:\n\n<!-- language? -->\n print length([2+1, 3*2, 1/0, 5-4])\n\nfails under strict evaluation because of the division by zero in the third element of the list. Under lazy evaluation, the length function returns the value 4 (i.e., the number of items in the list), since evaluating it does not attempt to evaluate the terms making up the list. In brief, strict evaluation always fully evaluates function arguments before invoking the function. Lazy evaluation does not evaluate function arguments unless their values are required to evaluate the function call itself.\n\nThe usual implementation strategy for lazy evaluation in functional languages is [[graph reduction]].<ref>[http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages]. Simon Peyton Jones, published by Prentice Hall, 1987</ref> Lazy evaluation is used by default in several pure functional languages, including [[Miranda (programming language)|Miranda]], [[Clean (programming language)|Clean]], and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].\n\n{{Harvnb|Hughes|1984}} argues for lazy evaluation as a mechanism for improving program modularity through [[separation of concerns]], by easing independent implementation of producers and consumers of data streams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html |title=Why Functional Programming Matters |authorlink=John Hughes (computer scientist) |first=John |last=Hughes |year=1984 |ref=harv}}</ref> Launchbury 1993 <!-- a cite arguing more strongly against lazy evaluation would be preferable here, if someone knows of one. --> describes some difficulties that lazy evaluation introduces, particularly in analyzing a program's storage requirements, and proposes an [[operational semantics]] to aid in such analysis.<ref name=launchbury1993>{{cite web | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.2016 | author = John Launchbury | title = A Natural Semantics for Lazy Evaluation | year = 1993 }}</ref> Harper 2009 proposes including both strict and lazy evaluation in the same language, using the language's type system to distinguish them.<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160407095249/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf | archivedate = 2006-04-07 | title = Practical Foundations for Programming Languages | author = Robert W.

The use of [[algebraic datatypes]] makes manipulation of complex data structures convenient; the presence of strong compile-time type checking makes programs more reliable in absence of other reliability techniques like [[test-driven development]], while [[type inference]] frees the programmer from the need to manually declare types to the compiler in most cases.\n\nSome research-oriented functional languages such as [[Coq]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]], [[Cayenne (programming language)|Cayenne]], and [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]] are based on [[intuitionistic type theory]], which lets types depend on terms. Such types are called [[dependent type]]s. These type systems do not have decidable type inference and are difficult to understand and program with{{Citation needed| date = December 2011}}. But dependent types can express arbitrary propositions in [[predicate logic]]. Through the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]], then, well-typed programs in these languages become a means of writing formal [[mathematical proof]]s from which a compiler can generate [[formal verification|certified code]]. While these languages are mainly of interest in academic research (including in [[formalized mathematics]]), they have begun to be used in engineering as well.

This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Huges|first1=John|title=Why Functional Programming Matters|url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.pdf|website=chalmers.se/cse|publisher=Chalmers Tekniska H\u00a8ogskola}}</ref>\n\nConsider [[C (programming language)|C]] assignment statement <code>x = x * 10</code>, this changes the value assigned to the variable <code>x</code>. Let us say that the initial value of <code>x</code> was <code>1</code>, then two consecutive evaluations of the variable <code>x</code> yields <code>10</code> and <code>100</code> respectively. Clearly, replacing <code>x = x * 10</code> with either <code>10</code> or <code>100</code> gives a program with different meaning, and so the expression ''is not'' referentially transparent. In fact, assignment statements are never referentially transparent.\n\nNow, consider another function such as <code>int plusone(int x) {return x+1;}</code> ''is'' transparent, as it does not implicitly change the input x and thus has no such [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]].\nFunctional programs exclusively use this type of function and are therefore referentially transparent.\n\n=== Functional programming in non-functional languages ===\n\nIt is possible to use a functional style of programming in languages that are not traditionally considered functional languages.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hartel | first = Pieter |author2=Henk Muller |author3=Hugh Glaser | title = The Functional C experience | journal = Journal of Functional Programming | volume=14 |issue=2 | pages = 129\u2013135 |date=March 2004 | url = http://www.ub.utwente.nl/webdocs/ctit/1/00000084.pdf |format=PDF| doi=10.1017/S0956796803004817}}; {{cite web | title = Functional programming in Python, Part 3 | url = http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog3.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071016124848/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog3.html | archivedate = 2007-10-16 | author = David Mertz | accessdate = 2006-09-17 | work=IBM developerWorks}}([https://web.archive.org/web/20071016124848/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog.html Part 1], [https://web.archive.org/web/20071016124848/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-prog2.html Part 2])</ref> For example, both [[D (programming language)|D]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/function.html#pure-functions | title = Functions&nbsp;\u2014 D Programming Language 2.0 |publisher=Digital Mars | accessdate = |date = 30 December 2012 }}</ref> and [[Fortran 95]]<ref name=fortran95 /> explicitly support pure functions.\n\n[[JavaScript]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luafaq.org/#T1.2|title=Lua Unofficial FAQ (uFAQ) |publisher=}}</ref> and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] had [[First-class function|first class functions]] from their inception.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brendaneich.com/2008/04/popularity/|first=Brendan|last= Eich|title = Popularity|date = 3 April 2008|publisher=}}</ref> Python had support for \"[[anonymous function|lambda]]\", \"[[Map (higher-order function)|map]]\", \"[[Fold (higher-order function)|reduce]]\", and \"[[Filter (higher-order function)|filter]]\" in 1994, as well as closures in Python 2.2,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://python-history.blogspot.de/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html |title=Origins of Python's \"Functional\" Features |last=van Rossum |first=Guido |authorlink=Guido van Rossum |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-09-27 }}</ref> though Python 3 relegated  \"reduce\" to the <code>functools</code> standard library module.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://docs.python.org/dev/library/functools.html#functools.reduce | title = functools \u2014 Higher order functions and operations on callable objects | publisher=Python Software Foundation | date = 2011-07-31 | accessdate = 2011-07-31}}</ref> First-class functions have been introduced into other mainstream languages such as [[PHP]] 5.3, [[Visual Basic]] 9, [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] 3.0, and [[C++11]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nIn [[PHP]], [[anonymous class]]es, [[Closure (computer science)|closure]]s and lambdas are fully supported.

Arrays can be replaced by [[Map (computer science)|maps]] or random access lists, which admit purely functional implementation, but have [[logarithm]]ic access and update times. Therefore, purely functional data structures can be used in non-functional languages, but they may not be the most efficient tool, especially if persistence is not required.\n\n== Comparison to imperative programming ==\nFunctional programming is very different from [[imperative programming]]. The most significant differences stem from the fact that functional programming avoids [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which are used in imperative programming to implement state and I/O. Pure functional programming completely prevents side-effects and provides [[referential transparency (computer science)|referential transparency]].\n\nHigher-order functions are rarely used in older imperative programming. A traditional imperative program might use a loop to traverse and modify a list. A functional program, on the other hand, would probably use a higher-order \u201cmap\u201d function that takes a function and a list, generating and returning a new list by applying the function to each list item.\n\n=== Simulating state ===\nThere are tasks (for example, maintaining a bank account balance) that often seem most naturally implemented with state. Pure functional programming performs these tasks, and I/O tasks such as accepting user input and printing to the screen, in a different way.\n\nThe pure functional programming language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] implements them using [[monad (functional programming)|monads]], derived from [[category theory]]. Monads offer a way to abstract certain types of computational patterns, including (but not limited to) modeling of computations with mutable state (and other side effects such as I/O) in an imperative manner without losing purity. While existing monads may be easy to apply in a program, given appropriate templates and examples, many students find them difficult to understand conceptually, e.g., when asked to define new monads (which is sometimes needed for certain types of libraries).<ref>{{cite web | last = Newbern | first = J. | title = All About Monads: A comprehensive guide to the theory and practice of monadic programming in Haskell | url = http://monads.haskell.cz/html/index.html/html/ | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}</ref>\n\nAnother way that functional languages can simulate state is by passing around a [[data structure]] that represents the current state as a parameter to function calls. On each function call, a copy of this data structure is created with whatever differences are the result of the function. This is referred to as [[state-passing style]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n<!-- TO DO: Expand -->\n\nImpure functional languages usually include a more direct method of managing mutable state. [[Clojure]], for example, uses managed references that can be updated by applying pure functions to the current state. This kind of approach enables mutability while still promoting the use of pure functions as the preferred way to express computations.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n<!-- TO DO: Expand / example code?? -->\n\nAlternative methods such as [[Hoare logic]] and [[uniqueness type|uniqueness]] have been developed to track side effects in programs.

A leap day is added in various [[solar calendar]]s (calendars based on the Earth's revolution around the [[Sun]]), including the [[Gregorian calendar]] standard in most of the world. [[Lunisolar calendar]]s (whose months are based on the [[phases of the Moon]]) instead add a leap or [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] month.<ref name=\"gale\">{{cite encyclopedia|first1=Ed. K. Lee|last1=Lerner|first2=Brenda W.|last2=Lerner|title=Calendar|encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science|year=2004|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]]|location=Detroit, MI|pages=679\u201382|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gregorian calendar]], years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, [[1700]], [[1800]], and [[1900]] did not contain a leap day; neither will [[2100]], [[2200]], and [[2300]]. Conversely, [[1600]] and [[2000]] did and [[2400]] will. Years containing a leap day are called [[leap year]]s. Years not containing a leap day are called [[common year]]s. February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the [[Chinese calendar]], this day will only occur in years of the [[monkey (zodiac)|monkey]], [[dragon (zodiac)|dragon]], and [[rat (zodiac)|rat]].\n\nA leap day is observed because the [[Earth]]'s period of [[orbit]]al revolution around the [[Sun]] takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the [[Earth]]'s position in the [[Solar System]]; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The [[Julian calendar]] used in Christendom until the [[16th century]] added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to [[March 11]], and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the \"century rule\" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of [[Easter]] consistently close to the [[vernal equinox]].<ref name=\"gale\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=2390 |title=Calendar Reform |website=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher= |access-date=5 May 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Leap years==\n{{Main|Leap year}}\nAlthough most modern calendar years have 365 days, a complete revolution around the Sun (one [[solar year]]) takes approximately 365 days and 6 hours. An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Sun's apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the [[season]]s would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather, [[ecology]], or hours of daylight.\n\nA solar year is actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 days). As early as the 13th century it was recognized that the year is shorter than the 365.25 days assumed by the [[Julian calendar]]: the Earth's orbital period around the Sun was derived from the medieval [[Alfonsine tables]] as 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 16 seconds (365.2425 days). The currently accepted modern figure is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds. Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes for those four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The [[Gregorian calendar]] reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also [[Century leap year|divisible by 400]]. This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are common years.\n\n===Modern (Gregorian) calendar===\nThe Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days (146,097 days). Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.\n\n===Early Roman calendar===\n[[File:MissaleLeapYear.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Adding a leap day (after 23 February) shifts the commemorations in the 1962 [[Roman Missal]].]]\n{{main|Roman calendar}}\nThe calendar of the Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]] had only 355 days (even though it was not a lunar calendar) which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the ''[[Terminus (god)|Terminalia]]'' on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year, [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|a leap month]], called [[Intercalaris|''Mensis Intercalaris'']] (\"intercalary month\"), was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The (usual) second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides (13th) of February (in an ordinary year) or the Ides of Intercalaris (in an intercalary year) both counted down to the Kalends of March (i.e. they were known as \"the ''n''th day before the Kalends of March\"). The Nones (5th) and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.\n\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:<blockquote>When it was thought necessary to add (every two years) an intercalary month of 22 or 23 days, so that the civil year should correspond to the natural (solar) year, this intercalation was in preference made in February, between Terminalia [23rd] and Regifugium [24th].<ref>Censorinus, ''The Natal Day'', 20.28, tr. William Maude, New York 1900, available at [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Maude/Censorinus/DeDieNatale-Part2.html].</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Julian reform===\n{{main|Julian calendar}}\nThe set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the [[Julian calendar#Julian reform|Julian reform]] in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the [[Terminus (god)|Terminalia]] (February 23) was doubled, forming the \"''bis sextum''\"\u2014literally 'twice sixth', since February 24 was 'the sixth day before the [[Kalends]] of March' using Roman inclusive counting (March 1 was the Kalends of March and was also the first day of the calendar year). Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four; [[Augustus]] was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the ''bis sextum'' (February 24) was usually regarded as the intercalated or \"bissextile\" day since the 3rd century AD.<ref>Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens, ''The Oxford companion to the year'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 678\u2013680.</ref> February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} although this has only been formally enacted in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. In [[UK|Britain]], the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar.<ref>{{citation |publisher=The British Sundial Society |contribution-url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/news/ante-diem-bis-sextum-kalend/ |contribution=Ante Diem Bis Sextum Kalendras Martii |date=24 February 2016 |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/news/ |title=News }}.</ref>\n\n==Born on February 29==\nA person born on February 29 may be called a \"leapling\", a \"leaper\", or a \"leap-year baby\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leigh|first1=Rob|title=Leap year February 29: 29 things you need to know about leap years and their extra day|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/leap-years-29-things-you-746716|publisher=Mirror Online|accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref> In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their [[birthday]] on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] date, February 29.\n\n===Legal status===\nThe effective legal date of a leapling's birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 [[Age of majority|turns 18]], they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/43954/Part-B-Entitlement-to-register-March-2010.pdf|title=Part B \u2013 Entitlement to register|work=The Electoral Commission|date=February 2008|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name=HK>\"[http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/c3e01cbdb5665ae64825755c00352e38/98EF59AFAC7965F9482575EF00048ABE/$FILE/CAP_410_e_b5.pdf Cap 410, s.5 Chapter 410: Age of Majority (Related Provisions) Ordinance]\".

Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law<ref>{{citation|title=Re an Infant (1936) 31 MCR 42}}</ref> would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the person's birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.\n\nIn [[Taiwan|Taiwan (Republic of China)]], the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:\n\n:If a period fixed by weeks, months, and years does not commence from the beginning of a week, month, or year, it ends with the ending of the day which proceeds the day of the last week, month, or year which corresponds to that on which it began to commence. But if there is no corresponding day in the last month, the period ends with the ending of the last day of the last month.<ref>Article 121 of the [[s:Civil Code Part I General Principles|Civil Code Part I General Principles]] of the [[Republic of China]] in effect in Taiwan.</ref>\n\nThus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no \"... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.\"<ref name=\"IowaNews\">{{cite web|url=http://news-releases.uiowa.edu/2012/february/022712leap_day.html|title=Leap day not a significant concern in field of law, government|work=University of Iowa News Service|publisher=The University of Iowa|date=February 27, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Reitz speculates that \"March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day,\"<ref name=\"IowaNews\"/> using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.\n\n===In fiction===\nThere are many instances in children's literature where a person's claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.\n\nA similar device is used in the plot of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s 1879 [[comic opera]] ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. As a child, Frederic was [[apprentice]]d to a band of [[pirate]]s until his 21st birthday. Having passed his 21st year, he leaves the pirate band and falls in love. However, since he was born on February 29, his 21st ''birthday'' will not arrive until he is eighty-four, so he must leave his fianc\u00e9e and return to the pirates.<ref name=\"lyrics\">{{cite web|url=http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/pirates/web_op/pirates21.html|title=The Pirates of Penzance|first1=Arthur|last1=Sullivan|first2=W.S.|last2=Gilbert|work=Gilbert and Sullivan Archive|date=August 20, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n*[[1504]] &ndash;

Key was inspired upon viewing the American flag still flying over the fort at dawn, and wrote the poem \"Defence of Fort M'Henry\", which was published a week later.  The poem was adapted to the tune of the popular song \"To Anacreon in Heaven.\" The song with Key's lyrics became known as \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" and slowly gained in popularity as an unofficial anthem over the years, finally achieving official status a century later under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] as the United States national anthem.\n\nKey was a lawyer in Maryland and Washington D.C. for four decades, and worked on important cases like the [[Burr conspiracy]] trial, and argued numerous times before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Nominated for [[U.S. attorney]] by [[President Andrew Jackson]], he served from 1833 to 1841.\n\nKey owned slaves from 1800, during which time [[abolitionism|abolitionists]] ridiculed his words, that America was more like the \u201cLand of the Free and Home of the Oppressed\u201d.<ref>{{cite news |title=Where's the Debate on Francis Scott Key's Slave-Holding Legacy? |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/wheres-debate-francis-scott-keys-slave-holding-legacy-180959550/ |accessdate=August 13, 2018 |agency=Smithsonian}}</ref> He freed his slaves in the 1830s, paying one ex-slave as his farm foreman. Key publicly criticized slavery and gave free legal representation to some slaves seeking freedom, but also represented owners of runaway slaves as well. Representing both slaves and slave owners is emblematic of his complex relationship with slavery. As District Attorney, Key suppressed abolitionists and didn't support an immediate end to slavery. Referring to blacks as \"a distinct and inferior race of people\u201d, he was a leader of the [[American Colonization Society]] which sent freed slaves back to Africa.<ref name=\"Key\">{{cite news |title=The unexpected connection between slavery, NFL protests and the national anthem |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/29/sport/colin-kaepernick-flag-protest-has-history-trnd/index.html |accessdate=August 9, 2018 |agency=CNN}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Francis Scott Key's life was a lot more complicated than just writing The Star-Spangled Banner |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/francis-scott-keys-life-was-a-lot-more-complicated-than-just-writing-the-star-spangled-banner |accessdate=August 9, 2018 |newspaper=Washington Examiner}}</ref>\n\nKey was a devout Episcopalian.

More than a century after its first publication, the song was adopted as the American national anthem, first by an Executive Order from President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in{{nbsp}}1916 (which had little effect beyond requiring military bands to play what became known as the \"Service Version\") and then by a Congressional resolution in{{nbsp}}1931, signed by President [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chorusamerica.org/singers/star-spangled-mythbusting|title=Star-Spangled Mythbusting}}</ref>\n\n==Legal career==\n[[File:Francis Scott Key law office Frederick MD1.jpg|thumb|Key law office on Court Street in Frederick, Maryland]]\nKey was a leading attorney in Frederick, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. for many years, with an extensive real estate as well as trial practice. He and his family settled in Georgetown in 1805 or 1806, near the new national capital. There the young Key assisted his uncle, the prominent lawyer [[Philip Barton Key]], such as in the sensational conspiracy trial of [[Aaron Burr]] and the expulsion of [[John Smith (Ohio Senator)|Senator John Smith]] of [[Ohio]]. He made the first of his many arguments before the United States Supreme Court in 1807. In 1808 he assisted President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s attorney general in ''[[United States v.

Handbook of Texas Online.</ref>\n\nPresident Jackson nominated Key for [[United States Attorney for the District of Columbia]] in 1833. After the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] approved the nomination, he served from 1833 to 1841, while also handling his own private legal cases.<ref name=bookrags>{{cite web|title=Francis Scott Key {{!}} Biography|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/francis-scott-key/|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref> In 1835, in his most famous case, he prosecuted [[Richard Lawrence (failed assassin)|Richard Lawrence]] for his unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Andrew Jackson at the entrance doors and top steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], the first attempt to kill an American chief executive.\n\n===Slavery and American Colonization Society===\n\nKey purchased his first slave in 1800 or 1801 and owned six slaves in 1820.<ref>Leepson p. 25</ref> Mostly in the 1830s, Key [[manumitted]] (set free) seven slaves, one of whom (Clem Johnson) continued to work for him for wages as his farm's foreman, supervising several slaves.<ref>Leepson pp. 130\u2013131 post-Turner's rebellion emancipations of Romeo, William Ridout, Elizabeth Hicks, Clem Johnson.</ref>\n\nThroughout his career Key also represented several slaves seeking their freedom in court (for free), as well as several masters seeking return of their runaway slaves.<ref name=Morley/><ref>Leepson pp. 125 (successful in freeing Harry Quando),</ref> Key, Judge [[William Leigh (judge)|William Leigh]] of [[Halifax, Virginia|Halifax]], and bishop [[William Meade]] were administrators of the will of their friend [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], who died without children and left a will directing his executors to free his more than four hundred slaves.

In 1833, he secured a grand jury indictment against [[Benjamin Lundy]], editor of the anti-slavery publication, the ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', and his printer, William Greer, for [[Defamation|libel]] after Lundy published an article that declared, \"There is neither mercy nor justice for colored people in this district [of Columbia]\". Lundy's article, Key said in the indictment, \"was intended to injure, oppress, aggrieve, and vilify the good name, fame, credit & reputation of the Magistrates and constables\" of Washington. Lundy left town rather than face trial; Greer was acquitted.<ref>Morley, Jefferson, Snow-Storm in August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835 (Nan Talese/Doubleday, New York, 2012), 81</ref>\n\nIn August 1836, Key agreed to prosecute botanist and doctor Reuben Crandall, brother of controversial Connecticut school teacher [[Prudence Crandall]], who had recently moved to the national capital. Key secured an indictment for \"seditious libel\" after two marshals (who operated as slave catchers in their off hours) found Crandall had a trunk full of anti-slavery publications in his Georgetown residence, five days after the [[Snow Riot|Snow riot]], caused by rumors that a mentally ill slave had attempted to kill an elderly white woman. In an April 1837 trial that attracted nationwide attention, Key charged that Crandall's actions instigated slaves to rebel. Crandall's attorneys acknowledged he opposed slavery, but denied any intent or actions to encourage rebellion. Key, in his final address to the jury said:\n\n{{quote|Are you willing, gentlemen, to abandon your country, to permit it to be taken from you, and occupied by the abolitionist, according to whose taste it is to associate and amalgamate with the negro? Or, gentlemen, on the other hand, are there laws in this community to defend you from the immediate abolitionist, who would open upon you the floodgates of such extensive wickedness and mischief?\"}}\n\nThe jury acquitted Crandall.<ref>Morley, Jefferson, ''Snow-Storm in August: Washington City, Francis Scott Key and the Forgotten Race Riot of 1835'' (Nan Talese/Doubleday, New York, 2012), 211\u2013220</ref><ref>Leepson, pp. 169\u201372, 181\u201385</ref>\n\nThis defeat, as well as family tragedies in 1835, diminished Key's political ambition.

A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]] such as a [[regular grammar]] or [[context-free grammar]], also called its [[formation rule]].\n\nThe field of '''formal language theory''' studies primarily the purely [[syntax|syntactical]] aspects of such languages\u2014that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of [[natural language]]s.\nIn computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of [[programming language]]s and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or [[semantics]]. In [[computational complexity theory]], [[decision problem]]s are typically defined as formal languages, and [[complexity class]]es are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be [[parser|parsed by machines]] with limited computational power. In [[logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]], formal languages are used to represent the syntax of [[axiomatic system]]s, and [[Formalism (mathematics)|mathematical formalism]] is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.\n\n== History ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\nThe first formal language is thought to be the one used by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879), literally meaning \"concept writing\", and which Frege described as a \"formal language of pure thought.\"<ref name=\"Herken1995\">{{cite book|editor=Rolf Herken|title=The universal Turing machine: a half-century survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&pg=PA290|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82637-9|page=290|chapter=Influences of Mathematical Logic on Computer Science|author=Martin Davis}}</ref>\n\n[[Axel Thue]]'s early [[semi-Thue system]], which can be used for rewriting strings, was influential on [[formal grammar]]s.\n\n==Words over an alphabet==\n\nAn '''alphabet''', in the context of formal languages, can be any [[set (mathematics)|set]], although it often makes sense to use an [[alphabet]] in the usual sense of the word, or more generally a [[character set]] such as [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]].  The elements of an alphabet are called its '''letters'''.  An alphabet may contain an [[countable set|infinite]] number of elements;<ref>For example, [[first-order logic]] is often expressed using an alphabet that, besides symbols such as \u2227, \u00ac, \u2200 and parentheses, contains infinitely many elements ''x''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;\u2026 that play the role of variables.</ref> however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.\n\nA '''word''' over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., [[string (computer science)|string]]) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet \u03a3 is usually denoted by \u03a3<sup>*</sup> (using the [[Kleene star]]). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the ''empty word'', which is often denoted by e, \u03b5, \u03bb or even \u039b. By [[concatenation]] one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.\n\nIn some applications, especially in [[logic]], the alphabet is also known as the ''vocabulary'' and words are known as ''formulas'' or ''sentences''; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''formal language''' ''L'' over an alphabet \u03a3 is a [[subset]] of \u03a3<sup>*</sup>, that is, a set of [[#Words over an alphabet|words]] over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.\n\nIn computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with [[natural language]]s, the adjective \"formal\" is often omitted as redundant.\n\nWhile formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept \"formal language\" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less.  In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as [[regular language]]s or [[context-free language]]s.  The notion of a [[formal grammar]] may be closer to the intuitive concept of a \"language,\" one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.\n\n==Examples==\n\nThe following rules describe a formal language&nbsp;{{mvar|L}} over the alphabet \u03a3&nbsp;=&nbsp;{\u20090,\u20091,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095,\u20096,\u20097,\u20098,\u20099,\u2009+,\u2009=\u2009}:\n* Every nonempty string that does not contain \"+\" or \"=\" and does not start with \"0\" is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.\n* The string \"0\" is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.\n* A string containing \"=\" is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if there is exactly one \"=\", and it separates two valid strings of&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.\n* A string containing \"+\" but not \"=\" is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if every \"+\" in the string separates two valid strings of&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.\n* No string is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}} other than those implied by the previous rules.\nUnder these rules, the string \"23+4=555\" is in&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}, but the string \"=234=+\" is not. This formal language expresses [[natural number]]s, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their [[syntax]]), not what they mean ([[semantics]]). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that \"0\" means the number zero,   \"+\" means addition, \"23+4=555\" is false, etc.\n\n=== Constructions ===<!-- [[empty language]] redirects here -->\nFor finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language&nbsp;{{mvar|L}} as just {{mvar|L}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{\"a\",\u2009\"b\",\u2009\"ab\",\u2009\"cba\"}. The [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] case of this construction is the '''empty language''', which contains no words at all (<span class=\"nounderlines\">{{mvar|L}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[\u2205]]</span>).\n\nHowever, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as \u03a3&nbsp;=&nbsp;{a,&nbsp;b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: \"a\", \"abb\", \"ababba\", \"aaababbbbaab\",&nbsp;\u2026. Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{\"a\",\u2009\"b\",\u2009\"ab\",\u2009\"cba\"}. Here are some examples of formal languages:\n* {{mvar|L}} = \u03a3<sup>*</sup>, the set of ''all'' words over \u03a3;\n* {{mvar|L}} = {\"a\"}<sup>*</sup> = {\"a\"<sup>''n''</sup>}, where ''n'' ranges over the natural numbers and \"a\"<sup>''n''</sup><!-- I know it is ugly, but it is consistent with the notation in other examples. Should we use through the article, say, angle brackets \u2039a\u203a? --> means \"a\" repeated ''n'' times (this is the set of words consisting only of the symbol \"a\");\n* the set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language (the syntax of which is usually defined by a [[context-free grammar]]);\n* the set of inputs upon which a certain [[Turing machine]] halts; or\n* the set of maximal strings of [[alphanumeric]] [[ASCII]] characters on this line, i.e.,<br> the set {\"the\", \"set\", \"of\", \"maximal\", \"strings\", \"alphanumeric\", \"ASCII\", \"characters\", \"on\", \"this\", \"line\", \"i\", \"e\"}.\n\n== Language-specification formalisms ==\n\nFormal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as\n* those strings generated by some [[formal grammar]];\n* those strings described or matched by a particular [[regular expression]];\n* those strings accepted by some [[Automata theory|automaton]], such as a [[Turing machine]] or [[Finite state machine|finite state automaton]];\n* those strings for which some [[decision problem|decision procedure]] (an [[algorithm]] that asks a sequence of related YES/NO questions) produces the answer YES.\n\nTypical questions asked about such formalisms include:\n\n* What is their expressive power? (Can formalism ''X'' describe every language that formalism ''Y'' can describe? Can it describe other languages?)\n* What is their recognizability? (How difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a language described by formalism ''X''?)\n* What is their comparability? (How difficult is it to decide whether two languages, one described in formalism ''X'' and one in formalism ''Y'', or in ''X'' again, are actually the same language?).\n\nSurprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is \"it cannot be done at all\", or \"it is extremely expensive\" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. Formal languages may be classified in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing [[automata theory|automaton]]. [[Context-free grammar]]s and [[regular grammar]]s provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of [[parsing]], and are widely used in practical applications.\n\n== Operations on languages ==\n\nCertain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.\n\nExamples: suppose ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> are languages over some common alphabet.\n* The ''[[concatenation]]'' ''L''<sub>1</sub>''L''<sub>2</sub> consists of all strings of the form ''vw'' where ''v'' is a string from ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''w'' is a string from ''L''<sub>2</sub>.\n* The ''intersection'' ''L''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2229&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub> of ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> consists of all strings that are contained in both languages\n* The ''complement'' \u00ac''L'' of a language with respect to a given alphabet consists of all strings over the alphabet that are not in the language.\n* The [[Kleene star]]: the language consisting of all words that are concatenations of 0 or more words in the original language;\n* ''Reversal'':\n** Let ''e'' be the empty word, then ''e<sup>R</sup>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e'', and\n** for each non-empty word ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sub>1</sub>\u2026''x<sub>n</sub>'' over some alphabet, let ''w<sup>R</sup>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sub>n</sub>\u2026''x<sub>1</sub>'',\n** then for a formal language ''L'', ''L<sup>R</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{''w<sup>R</sup>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''w'' \u2208 ''L''}.\n* [[String homomorphism]]\n\nSuch [[string operations]] are used to investigate [[Closure (mathematics)|closure properties]] of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the [[context-free language]]s are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with [[regular language]]s, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of [[cone (formal languages)|trios]] and [[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]] studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Chapter 11: Closure properties of families of languages.</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=\"top\"|Closure properties of language families (<math>L_1</math> Op <math>L_2</math> where both <math>L_1</math> and <math>L_2</math> are in the language family given by the column).

A [[lexical analyzer]], generated by a tool like [[lex programming tool|<code>lex</code>]], identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. [[identifier]]s or [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]], which are themselves expressed in a simpler formal language, usually by means of [[regular expressions]]. At the most basic conceptual level, a [[parser]], usually generated by a [[parser generator]] like <code>[[yacc]]</code>, attempts to decide if the source program is valid, that is if it belongs to the programming language for which the compiler was built.\n\nOf course, compilers do more than just parse the source code \u2013 they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an [[abstract syntax tree]]. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an [[executable]] containing [[machine code]] that runs directly on the hardware, or some [[intermediate code]] that requires a [[virtual machine]] to execute.\n\n=== Formal theories, systems and proofs ===\n[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] divisions within a [[formal system]]. [[string (computer science)|Strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into nonsense and [[well-formed formula]]s.  The set of well-formed formulas is divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]\n\n{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)|Formal system}}\n\nIn [[mathematical logic]], a ''formal theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] expressed in a formal language.\n\nA ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems <math>\\mathcal{FS}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{FS'}</math> may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).\n\nA ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or [[proposition]]s) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.\n\n====Interpretations and models====\n{{main|Formal semantics (logic)||Interpretation (logic)|Model theory}}\n\nFormal languages are entirely syntactic in nature but may be given [[semantics]] that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical [[logic]], the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] assigns a meaning to each of the formulas\u2014usually, a [[truth value]].\n\nThe study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].  In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of [[model theory]].  In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within [[Structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structures]], and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a ''model'' for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Combinatorics on words]]\n* [[Free monoid]]\n* [[Formal method]]\n* [[Grammar framework]]\n* [[Mathematical notation]]\n* [[Associative array]]\n* [[String (computer science)]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citation footnotes ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== General references ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.

Friedman]] that advocates [[free market]] principles. It was primarily a response to an earlier landmark book and television series: ''[[The Age of Uncertainty]]'', by the noted economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]]. Milton Friedman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics]] in 1976.\n\n==Overview==\n''Free to Choose: A Personal Statement'' maintains that the free market works best for all members of a society, provides examples of how the free market engenders prosperity, and maintains that it can solve problems where other approaches have failed. Published in January 1980, the 297 page book contains 10 chapters. The book was on the United States best sellers list for 5 weeks.\n\n[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] telecast the series, beginning in January 1980. The general format was that of Dr. Friedman visiting and narrating a number of success and failure stories in history, which he attributes to capitalism or the lack thereof (e.g. Hong Kong is commended for its free markets, while India is excoriated for relying on [[centralized planning]] especially for its [[protectionism|protection]] of its traditional [[textile industry]]). Following the primary show, Dr. Friedman would engage in discussion moderated by [[Robert McKenzie (psephologist)|Robert McKenzie]] with a number of selected debaters drawn from trade unions, academy and the business community, such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] (then of [[G.D. Searle & Company]]) and [[Frances Fox Piven]] of [[City University of New York]]. The interlocutors would offer objections to or support for the proposals put forward by Friedman, who would in turn respond. After the final episode, Friedman sat down for an interview with [[Lawrence E. Spivak|Lawrence Spivak]].\n\n[http://www.freetochoose.net The series] was rebroadcast in 1990 with [[Linda Chavez]] moderating the episodes. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Steve Allen]] and others give personal introductions for each episode in the series. This time, after the documentary part, Friedman sits down with a single opponent to debate the issues raised in the episode.\n\n===Guest debaters===\nGuest debaters included:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Gregory Anrig]] (Commissioner of [[Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education|Massachusetts Department of Education]]) \u2013 Episode 6\n* [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] (economist) \u2013 Episode 2\n* [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] (economist) \u2013 Vol. 3 Episode 5\n* William H.

The authors argue against government [[Fuel tax|taxation on gas]] and [[Tobacco tax|tobacco]] and government regulation of the public school systems. The Friedmans argue that the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] exacerbated the [[Great Depression]] by neglecting to prevent the decline of the [[money supply]] in the years leading up to it.\n\nOn the subject of [[Welfare state|welfare]], the Friedmans argue that current welfare practices are creating \"wards of the state\" as opposed to \"self-reliant individuals\" and suggest a [[negative income tax]] as a less harmful alternative. The Friedmans also argue for abolishing the [[Food and Drug Administration]], tighter control of Fed money supply, and the repeal of laws favoring [[Trade union|labor unions]].\n\n==Video chapters (1980 version)==\n# The Power of the Market\n# The Tyranny of Control\n# Anatomy of Crisis\n# From Cradle to Grave\n# Created Equal\n# What's Wrong with Our Schools?\n# Who Protects the Consumer?\n# Who Protects the Worker?\n# How to Cure Inflation\n# How to Stay Free\n\n==Video chapters (1990 version)==\n# The Power of the Market \u2013 Introduction by Arnold Schwarzenegger\n# The Tyranny of Control \u2013 Introduction by George Shultz\n# Freedom and Prosperity (featured only in the 1990 version) \u2013 Introduction by Ronald Reagan\n# The Failure of Socialism (original title: \"What's Wrong With Our Schools?\") \u2013 Introduction by David Friedman\n# Created Equal \u2013 Introduction by Steve Allen\n\n== References ==\n* Angus Burgin, ''Age of Certainty: Galbraith, Friedman, and the Public Life of Economic Ideas''.

It is used annually as a racetrack for the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]], [[Supercars Championship]] [[Melbourne 400]] and associated support races. The circuit has [[FIA]] Grade 1 licence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/tableaulicencescircuit.pdf|title=LIST OF FIA LICENSED CIRCUITS|date=6 February 2015|publisher=[[FIA]]|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> In spite of being a circuit on public roads it has characteristics of a natural{{what|date=October 2018}} road course considering it being fast and flowing combined with extensive runoff in many corners.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe current contract for the Grand Prix at the circuit concludes in 2023.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/australian-grand-prix-stays-in-melbourne-until-2023-20150912-gjl961.html</ref> [[Tobacco]] advertising has been banned since 2007.<ref>https://www.theage.com.au/national/tobacco-ad-ban-wont-jeopardise-gp-bracks-20060330-ge21gn.html</ref>\n\n==Design==\nThe circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake, a small man-altered lake (originally a large lagoon formed as part of the ancient Yarra River course) just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne.  The road sections that are used were rebuilt prior to the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness.  As a result, compared to other circuits that are held on public roads, the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface. Before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the Formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track. Many of the new tracks, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]] and [[Yas Marina Circuit|Abu Dhabi]] have imitated that feature.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive, drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times.  However, the flat terrain around the lake, coupled with a track design that features few true straights, means that the track is not conducive to overtaking or easy spectating unless in possession of a [[grandstand]] seat.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:Albert park and lake.jpg|200px|thumb|left|An overhead view of part of the circuit as viewed from the [[Eureka Tower]] observation deck]]\n\nEach year, most of the trackside fencing, pedestrian overpasses, grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure are erected approximately two months prior to the Grand Prix weekend and removed within 6 weeks after the event.  Land around the circuit (including a large aquatic centre, a [[golf course]], a [[Lakeside Stadium]], some restaurants and rowing boathouses) has restricted access during that entire period. Dissent is still prevalent among nearby local residents and users of those others facilities, and some still maintain a silent [[protest]] against the event.  Nevertheless, the event is reasonably popular in Melbourne and Australia (with a large European population and a general interest in motorsport). [[Middle Park (stadium)|Middle Park]], the home of [[South Melbourne FC]] was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\nOn 4 July 2008, the official F1 site (Formula1.com) reported that more than 300,000 people attended the four-day Melbourne Grand Prix, though actual ticket sales were later disputed by the local media. The Grand Prix will continue until at least 2020 after securing a new contract with [[Formula One]] Management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/new-melbourne-grand-prix-deal-better-for-victoria-denis-napthine-20140803-zzwil.html|title=New Melbourne Grand Prix deal better for Victoria: Denis Napthine|first=Richard|last=Willingham|date=3 August 2014|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017|via=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> There has never been a night race at [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], however, the 2009 event started at 5:00 p.m.\n\n==Everyday access==\nDuring the nine months of the year when the track is not required for Grand Prix preparation or the race weekend, most of the track can be driven by ordinary street-registered vehicles either clockwise or anti-clockwise.\n\nOnly the sections between turns 3, 4 and 5, then 5 and 6, differ significantly from the race track configuration. Turn 4 is replaced by a car park access road running directly from turns 3 to 5. Between turns 5 and 6, the road is blocked. It is possible to drive from turn 5 on to Albert Road and back on to the track at turn 7 though two sets of lights control the flow of this option. The only set of lights on the actual track is halfway between turns 12 and 13, where drivers using Queens Road are catered for. The chicanes at turns 11 and 12 are considerably more open than that used in the Grand Prix, using the escape roads. Turn 9 is also a car park and traffic is directed down another escape road.\n\nThe speed limit is generally {{convert|40|km/h}}, while some short sections have a speed limit of {{convert|50|km/h}}, which is still slower than an F1 car under pit lane speed restrictions. The back of the track, turns 7 to 13 inclusive, is known as Lakeside Drive. Double lines separate the two-way traffic along most of Lakeside Drive with short road islands approximately every 50 metres which means overtaking is illegal here. [[Black swan|Black Swans]] live and breed in Albert Park, and frequently cross the road causing traffic delays, sometimes with up to five cygnets (young swans).\n\nApproximately 80% of the track edge is lined with short parkland-style chain-linked fencing leaving normal drivers less room for error than F1 drivers have during race weekend.

The principality's first [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] was organised in 1929 by [[Antony Nogh\u00e8s]], under the auspices of [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Louis II]], through the [[Automobile Club de Monaco]] (ACM), of which he was president.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. \"Monaco Grand Prix\" in Ward, Ian, Executive Editor. ''The World of Automobiles'', Volume 12 (London: Orbis, 1974), p. 1382.</ref> The ACM organised the [[Monte Carlo Rally|Rallye Automobile Monte Carlo]], and in 1928 applied to the ''Association Internationale des Automobiles Clubs Reconnus'' (AIACR), the international governing body of motorsport, to be upgraded from a regional French club to full national status. Their application was refused due to the lack of a major motorsport event held wholly within Monaco's boundaries. The rally could not be considered as it mostly used the roads of other European countries.<ref name=\"motorsport07\" />\n\nTo attain full national status, Nogh\u00e8s proposed the creation of an automobile Grand Prix in the streets of [[Monte Carlo]]. He obtained the official sanction of Prince Louis II, and the support of [[People from Monaco|Monegasque]] ''Grand Prix'' driver [[Louis Chiron]]. Chiron thought Monaco's topography well-suited to setting up a race track.<ref name=\"motorsport07\" />\n\nThe [[1929 Monaco Grand Prix|first race]], held on 14 April 1929, was won by [[William Grover-Williams]] (using the pseudonym \"Williams\"), driving a [[Factory-backed|works]] [[Bugatti]] [[Bugatti Type 35|Type 35B]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The first Grand Prix of Monaco|journal=Motor Sport Magazine|issue=May 1929|page=11|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/may-1929/11/first-grand-prix-monaco|accessdate=4 August 2016}}; Kettlewell, p. 1382.</ref><ref name = \"GP.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cir-047.html|title=Monaco |accessdate=15 February 2007}}</ref> It was an invitation-only event, but not all of those invited decided to attend.

Starting fifteenth, Caracciola drove a fighting race, taking his [[Mercedes-Benz SSK|SSK]] into the lead before wasting 4\u00bd minutes on refuelling and a tyre change to finish second.<ref name=\"Kettlewell, p. 1382\">Kettlewell, p. 1382.</ref><ref name=\"GP.com\"/> Another driver who competed using a pseudonym was \"[[Georges Philippe]]\", the [[Philippe de Rothschild|Baron Philippe de Rothschild]].

However, there was no race in 1951. In 1952, the first of the two years in which the World Drivers' Championship was run to less powerful [[Formula Two]] regulations, the race was run to [[sports car racing|sports car]] rules instead, and it did not form part of the World Championship.<ref name=\"GP.com\" />\n\nNo races were held in 1953 or 1954.<ref name=\"racingcircuits.info\"/>\n\nSince [[1955 Monaco Grand Prix|1955]], the Monaco Grand Prix has continuously been part of the Formula One World Championship.<ref name=F1/> That year, [[Maurice Trintignant]] won in Monte Carlo for the first time and Chiron again scored points and at 56 became the oldest driver to compete in a Formula One Grand Prix.

Between 1954 and 1961 Fangio's former Mercedes colleague, [[Stirling Moss]], went one better, as did Trintignant, who won the race again in [[1958 Monaco Grand Prix|1958]] driving a [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]].

For the 1969 event, [[Traffic barrier|Armco barriers]] were placed at specific points for the first time in the circuit's history; before that, the circuit's conditions were (aside from the removal of people's production cars parked on the side of the road) virtually identical to everyday civilian use. If a driver went off, he would crash into whatever was next to the track (buildings, trees, lamp posts, glass windows, and even a train station); and in Alberto Ascari's and Paul Hawkins's cases, the harbour water, because the concrete road the course used had no Armco to protect the drivers from going off the track and into the Mediterranean. The circuit gained more Armco in specific points for the next two races, and by 1972, the circuit was almost completely Armco-lined. And for the first time in its history, the Monaco circuit was altered that year; the pits were moved next to the waterfront straight between the chicane and Tabac and the chicane was moved further forward right before Tabac and was the junction point between the pits and the course. The course was changed again for the 1973 race; the [[Rainier III Nautical Stadium]] was constructed where the straight that went behind the pits was and the circuit introduced a double chicane that went around the new swimming pool (this chicane complex is known as \"Swimming Pool\"). This created space for a whole new pit facility; and in 1976 the course was altered yet again; the Sainte Devote corner was made slower and a chicane was placed right before the pit straight.<ref name=\"racingcircuits.info\">{{Cite web|url=http://racingcircuits.info/europe/monaco/monte-carlo/#.WLBrgTsrJhE|title=Monte Carlo|website=RacingCircuits.info|access-date=28 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor the next two races, By the early 1970s, as [[Brabham]] team owner [[Bernie Ecclestone]] started to marshal the collective bargaining power of the [[Formula One Constructors Association]] (FOCA), Monaco was prestigious enough to become an early bone of contention. Historically the number of cars permitted in a race was decided by the race organiser, in this case the ACM, which had always set a low number of around 16. In 1972 Ecclestone was starting to negotiate deals which relied on FOCA guaranteeing at least 18 entrants for every race. A stand-off over this issue left the 1972 race in jeopardy until the ACM gave in and agreed that 26 cars could participate&nbsp;\u2013 the same number permitted at most other circuits. Two years later, in 1974, the ACM got the numbers back down to 18.<ref name=\"Lovell, Terry 2004\">Lovell, Terry (2004) ''Bernie's Game''</ref>\n\nBecause of its tight confines, slow average speeds and punishing nature, Monaco has often thrown up unexpected results. In the [[1982 Monaco Grand Prix|1982]] race [[Ren\u00e9 Arnoux]] led the first 15&nbsp;laps, before retiring. [[Alain Prost]] then led until four laps from the end, when he spun off on the wet track, hit the barriers and lost a wheel, giving [[Riccardo Patrese]] the lead. Patrese himself spun with only a lap and a half to go, letting [[Didier Pironi]] through to the front, followed by [[Andrea de Cesaris]]. On the last lap, Pironi ran out of fuel in the tunnel, but De Cesaris also ran out of fuel before he could overtake. In the meantime Patrese had bump-started his car and went through to score his first Grand Prix win.<ref>Henry, Alan (1985) Brabham, the Grand Prix Cars, p. 237 Osprey {{ISBN|0-905138-36-8}} Henry lists Pironi as having stopped with electrical trouble, but the official results show that the Ferrari driver ran out of fuel.</ref>\n\nIn 1983 the ACM became entangled in the disagreements between [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA) and FOCA. The ACM, with the agreement of Bernie Ecclestone, negotiated an individual television rights deal with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the [[United States]]. This broke an agreement enforced by FISA for a single central negotiation of television rights. [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], president of FISA, announced that the Monaco Grand Prix would not form part of the Formula One world championship in 1985. The ACM fought their case in the French courts. They won the case and the race was eventually reinstated.<ref name=\"Lovell, Terry 2004\"/>\n\n====Prost/Senna era====\nFor the decade from 1984 to 1993 the race was won by only two drivers, arguably the two best drivers in Formula One at the time- [[France|Frenchman]] Prost and Brazilian [[Ayrton Senna]]. Prost, already a winner of the [[List of Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race winners|support race for Formula Three cars]] in 1979, took his first Monaco win at the [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix|1984 race]]. The race started 45&nbsp;minutes late after heavy rain. Prost led briefly before [[Nigel Mansell]] overtook him on lap 11. Mansell crashed out five laps later, letting Prost back into the lead. On lap&nbsp;27, Prost led from Ayrton Senna's [[Toleman]] and [[Stefan Bellof]]'s [[Tyrrell Racing|Tyrrell]]. Senna was catching Prost and Bellof was catching both of them in the only naturally aspirated car in the race. However, on lap 31, the race was controversially stopped with conditions deemed to be undriveable. Later, FISA fined the clerk of the course, [[Jacky Ickx]], $6,000 and suspended his licence for not consulting the stewards before stopping the race.<ref>The Chequered Flag p. 320, Lines 55\u201356 Weidenfeld & Nicolson {{ISBN|0-297-83550-5}}</ref> The drivers received only half of the points that would usually be awarded, as the race had been stopped before two-thirds of the intended race distance had been completed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spurgeon|first1=Brad|title=When Ayrton Senna Became a Star|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/sports/autoracing/when-ayrton-senna-became-a-star.html?_r=0|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=4 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804133825/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/sports/autoracing/when-ayrton-senna-became-a-star.html?_r=0 |archivedate=4 August 2016|date=21 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nProst won 1985 after polesitter Senna retired with a blown Renault engine in his Lotus after over-revving it at the start, and Michele Alboreto in the Ferrari retook the lead twice, but he went off the track at Sainte-Devote, where Brazilian Nelson Piquet and Italian Riccardo Patrese had a huge accident only a few laps previously and oil and debris littered the track. Prost passed Alboreto, who retook the Frenchman, and then he punctured a tyre after running over bodywork debris from the Piquet/Patrese accident, which dropped him to 4th. He was able to pass his Roman countrymen Andrea De Cesaris and Elio de Angelis, but finished 2nd behind Prost. The French Prost dominated 1986 after starting from pole position, a race where the Nouvelle Chicane had been changed on the grounds of safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2010/05/14/changing-tracks-monte-carlo/|title=Changing tracks: Monte-Carlo|date=14 May 2010|website=F1 Fanatic|access-date=24 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nSenna holds the record for the most victories in Monaco, with six, including five consecutive wins between [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|1989]] and [[1993 Monaco Grand Prix|1993]], as well as eight podium finishes in ten starts. His [[1987 Monaco Grand Prix|1987]] win was the first time a car with an active suspension had won a Grand Prix. He won this race after Briton Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Honda went out with a broken exhaust. His win was very popular with the people of Monaco, and when he was arrested on the Monday following the race, for riding a motorcycle without wearing a helmet, he was released by the officers after they realised who he was.<ref>Grand Prix 1987, p. 60. {{ISBN|0-908081-27-8}}</ref> Senna dominated 1988, and was able to get ahead of his teammate Prost while the Frenchman was held up for most of the race by Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Ferrari. By the time Prost got past Berger, he pushed as hard as he could and set a lap some 6 seconds faster than Senna's- at which the Brazilian panicked; he then set 2 fastest laps, and while pushing as hard as possible, he bit the barrier at the Portier corner and crashed into the Armco separating the road from the Mediterranean. Senna was so upset that he went back to his Monaco flat and was not heard from again; Prost went on to win for the fourth time. Senna dominated 1989 while Prost was stuck behind backmarker Rene Arnoux and others; the Brazilian also dominated 1990 and 1991. At the [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix|1992 event]] Nigel Mansell, who had won all five races held to that point in the season, took pole and dominated the race in his [[Williams FW14]]B-[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]]. However, with seven laps remaining, Mansell suffered a loose wheel nut and was forced into the pits, emerging behind Ayrton Senna's [[McLaren]]-Honda, who was on worn tyres. Mansell, on fresh tyres, set a lap record almost two seconds quicker than Senna's and closed from 5.2 to 1.9 seconds in only two laps. The pair duelled around Monaco for the final four laps but Mansell could find no way past, finishing just two-tenths of a second behind the Brazilian.<ref>{{cite web\n | title =Grand Prix results: Monaco GP, 1992\n | work = GrandPrix.com\n | url =http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr522.html\n | accessdate =23 February 2007 }}</ref><ref>Autocourse 1992 pp.150, 153</ref> It was Senna's fifth win at Monaco, equalling Graham Hill's record.

Both of them beat Senna to the first corner, but Prost had to serve a time penalty for jumping the start and Schumacher retired with hydrualic active suspension problems, and Senna took his sixth win to break Graham Hill's record for most wins at the Monaco Grand Prix.

For many years, the numbers of cars admitted to Grands Prix was at the discretion of the race organisers&nbsp;\u2013 Monaco had the smallest grids, ostensibly because of its narrow and twisting track.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=286&fArticleId=3261116|title=It's a battle of supremacy at Monaco Grand Prix|date=25 May 2006|work=[[The Mercury (South Africa)|The Mercury]]|accessdate=11 August 2009}}</ref> Only 18 cars were permitted to enter the [[1975 Monaco Grand Prix]], compared to 23 to 26 cars at all other rounds that year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Barrie (ed.)|title=The World Championship 1975&nbsp;\u2013 [[John Player & Sons|John Player]] Motorsport yearbook 1976|publisher=Queen Anne Press Ltd.|year=1976|isbn=0-362-00254-1}}</ref>\n\nThe erecting of the circuit takes six weeks, and the removal after the race takes three weeks.<ref>Allsop, Derek.

Graham Hill is the only driver to have won the Triple Crown, by winning all three races. The practice session for Monaco overlaps with that for the Indianapolis 500, and the races themselves sometimes clash. As the two races take place on opposite sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and form part of different championships, it is difficult for one driver to compete effectively in both during his career. [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] and [[Fernando Alonso]] are the only active drivers to have won two of the three events.\n\nIn awarding its first Gold medal for motor sport to [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]], the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) characterised the Monaco Grand Prix as contributing \"an exceptional location of glamour and prestige\" to motor sport.<ref name=\"FIA Gold Medal\" /> It has been run under the patronage of three generations of [[Monaco]]'s royal family: [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Louis II]], [[Rainier III]] and [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Albert II]], all of whom have taken a close interest in the race.

''Adjacent'' means that two regions share a common boundary curve segment, not merely a corner where three or more regions meet.<ref>From {{harvtxt|Gonthier|2008}}: \"Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of the plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open sets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a common point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if and only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a way that any two adjacent regions have different colors.\"</ref>\n\nUnlike the [[five color theorem]], a theorem that states that five colors are enough to color a map, which was proved in the 1800s, the four color theorem was proved in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]], but only after many false proofs and counterexamples. It was the first major [[theorem]] to be [[computer-assisted proof#List of theorems proved with the help of computer programs|proved using a computer]]. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the [[computer-assisted proof]] was [[Non-surveyable proof|infeasible for a human to check by hand]].{{sfnp|Swart|1980}} Since then the proof has gained wide acceptance, although some doubters remain.{{sfnp|Wilson|2014|loc=216\u2013222}}\n\nTo dispel any remaining doubts about the Appel\u2013Haken proof, a simpler proof using the same ideas and still relying on computers was published in 1997 by Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas. Additionally, in 2005, the theorem was proved by [[Georges Gonthier]] with general-purpose [[proof assistant|theorem-proving software]].\n\n==Precise formulation of the theorem==\n[[File:World map with four colours.svg|thumb|A map of the world using just four colors for countries. The map also uses a fifth unique color (white) for oceans and lakes. This could be eliminated by recoloring, but then some [[landlocked country|landlocked countries]] would share color with the ocean, and some lakes and the ocean would differ.]]\nThe intuitive statement of the four color theorem, i.e. \"that given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, called a map, the regions can be colored using at most four colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color\", needs to be interpreted appropriately to be correct.\n\nFirst, all corners, points that belong to (technically, are in the closure of) three or more countries, must be ignored. In addition, bizarre maps (using regions of finite area but infinite perimeter) can require more than four colors.{{sfnp|Hudson|2003}} Second, for the purpose of the theorem, every \"country\" has to be a [[connected space|connected region]], or [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]]. In the real world, [[Enclave and exclave|this is not true]] (e.g., the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] as part of [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Kaliningrad Oblast|Kaliningrad]] as part of Russia are not contiguous). Because all the territory of a particular country must be the same color, four colors may not be sufficient. For instance, consider a simplified map:\n\n[[File:4CT Inadequacy Example.svg|center]]\n\nIn this map, the two regions labeled ''A'' belong to the same country, and must be the same color. This map then requires five colors, since the two ''A'' regions together are contiguous with four other regions, each of which is contiguous with all the others. A similar construction also applies if a single color is used for all bodies of water, as is usual on real maps. For maps in which more than one country may have multiple disconnected regions, six or more colors might be required.\n\nA simpler statement of the theorem uses [[graph theory]]. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an [[undirected graph]] that has a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] for each region and an [[edge (graph theory)|edge]] for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is [[planar graph|planar]] (it is important to note that we are talking about the graphs that have some limitations according to the map they are transformed from only): it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location to each shared boundary point of the region. Conversely any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be [[graph coloring|colored]] with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short, \"every planar graph is four-colorable\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Thomas|1998|p=849}}; {{harvtxt|Wilson|2014}}).</ref>\n\n[[File:Four Colour Planar Graph.svg|center]]\n\n==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Mathematics]] -->\n\n===Early proof attempts===\n[[File:DeMorganFourColour.png|thumb|Letter of De Morgan to [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]], 23 Oct. 1852]]\nAs far as is known, the conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852<ref name=MacKenzie>Donald MacKenzie, ''Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust'' (MIT Press, 2004) p103</ref> when [[Francis Guthrie]], while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. At the time, Guthrie's brother, Frederick, was a student of [[Augustus De Morgan]] (the former advisor of Francis) at [[University College London]]. Francis inquired with Frederick regarding it, who then took it to De Morgan (Francis Guthrie graduated later in 1852, and later became a professor of mathematics in South Africa). According to De Morgan:\n\n<blockquote>\"A student of mine [Guthrie] asked me to day to give him a reason for a fact which I did not know was a fact\u2014and do not yet. He says that if a figure be any how divided and the compartments differently colored so that figures with any portion of common boundary ''line'' are differently colored\u2014four colors may be wanted but not more\u2014the following is his case in which four colors ''are'' wanted. Query cannot a necessity for five or more be invented\u2026\" {{Harv|Wilson|2014|p=18}}</blockquote>\n\n\"F.G.\", perhaps one of the two Guthries, published the question in ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' in 1854,<ref>{{harvtxt|F. G.|1854}}; {{harvtxt|McKay|2012}}</ref> and De Morgan posed the question again in the same magazine in 1860.<ref name=Athenaeum1860>{{citation|journal=[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]|date=April 14, 1860|first=Augustus|last=De Morgan (anonymous)|authorlink=Augustus De Morgan|pages=501\u2013503|title=The Philosophy of Discovery, Chapters Historical and Critical. By W. Whewell.}}</ref> Another early published reference by {{harvs|first=Arthur|last=Cayley|authorlink=Arthur Cayley|year=1879|txt}} in turn credits the conjecture to De Morgan.\n\nThere were several early failed attempts at proving the theorem. De Morgan believed that it followed from a simple fact about four regions, though he didn't believe that fact could be derived from more elementary facts.\n<blockquote>This arises in the following way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, each of which has boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.<ref name=Athenaeum1860 /></blockquote>\n\nOne alleged proof was given by [[Alfred Kempe]] in 1879, which was widely acclaimed;<ref name=\"rouse_ball_1960\">[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''The Four Color Theorem'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 222\u2013232.</ref> another was given by [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] in 1880. It was not until 1890 that Kempe's proof was shown incorrect by [[Percy Heawood]], and in 1891, Tait's proof was shown incorrect by [[Julius Petersen]]\u2014each false proof stood unchallenged for 11 years.{{sfnp|Thomas|1998|p=848}}\n\nIn 1890, in addition to exposing the flaw in Kempe's proof, Heawood proved the [[five color theorem]] and generalized the four color conjecture to surfaces of arbitrary genus.{{sfnp|Heawood|1890}}\n\nTait, in 1880, showed that the four color theorem is equivalent to the statement that a certain type of graph (called a [[snark (graph theory)|snark]] in modern terminology) must be non-[[planar graph|planar]].{{sfnp|Tait|1880}}\n\nIn 1943, [[Hugo Hadwiger]] formulated the [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)|Hadwiger conjecture]],{{sfnp|Hadwiger|1943}} a far-reaching generalization of the four-color problem that still remains unsolved.\n\n===Proof by computer===\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s German mathematician [[Heinrich Heesch]] developed methods of using computers to search for a proof. Notably he was the first to use [[discharging method (discrete mathematics)|discharging]] for proving the theorem, which turned out to be important in the unavoidability portion of the subsequent Appel&ndash;Haken proof. He also expanded on the concept of reducibility and, along with Ken Durre, developed a computer test for it. Unfortunately, at this critical juncture, he was unable to procure the necessary supercomputer time to continue his work.{{sfnp|Wilson|2014}}\n\nOthers took up his methods and his computer-assisted approach. While other teams of mathematicians were racing to complete proofs, [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|University of Illinois]] announced, on June 21, 1976,<ref>Gary Chartrand and Linda Lesniak, ''Graphs & Digraphs'' (CRC Press, 2005) p.221</ref> that they had proved the theorem. They were assisted in some algorithmic work by [[John A. Koch]].{{sfnp|Wilson|2014}}\n\nIf the four-color conjecture were false, there would be at least one map with the smallest possible number of regions that requires five colors. The proof showed that such a minimal counterexample cannot exist, through the use of two technical concepts:<ref>{{harvtxt|Wilson|2014}}; {{harvtxt|Appel|Haken|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Thomas|1998|pp=852\u2013853}}</ref>\n\n# An ''unavoidable set'' is a set of configurations such that every map that satisfies some necessary conditions for being a minimal non-4-colorable [[maximal planar graph|triangulation]] (such as having minimum degree 5) must have at least one configuration from this set.\n# A ''reducible configuration'' is an arrangement of countries that cannot occur in a minimal counterexample. If a map contains a reducible configuration, then the map can be reduced to a smaller map. This smaller map has the condition that if it can be colored with four colors, then the original map can also. This implies that if the original map cannot be colored with four colors the smaller map can't either and so the original map is not minimal.\n\nUsing mathematical rules and procedures based on properties of reducible configurations, Appel and Haken found an unavoidable set of reducible configurations, thus proving that a minimal counterexample to the four-color conjecture could not exist. Their proof reduced the infinitude of possible maps to 1,936 reducible configurations (later reduced to 1,476) which had to be checked one by one by computer and took over a thousand hours. This reducibility part of the work was independently double checked with different programs and computers. However, the unavoidability part of the proof was verified in over 400 pages of [[microfiche]], which had to be checked by hand with the assistance of Haken's daughter [[Dorothea Blostein]] {{Harv|Appel|Haken|1989}}.\n\nAppel and Haken's announcement was widely reported by the news media around the world, and the math department at the [[University of Illinois]] used a postmark stating \"Four colors suffice.\" At the same time the unusual nature of the proof\u2014it was the first major theorem to be proved with extensive computer assistance\u2014and the complexity of the human-verifiable portion aroused considerable controversy {{Harv|Wilson|2014}}.\n\nIn the early 1980s, rumors spread of a flaw in the Appel&ndash;Haken proof. Ulrich Schmidt at [[RWTH Aachen]] examined Appel and Haken's proof for his master's thesis {{Harv|Wilson|2014|loc=225}}. He had checked about 40% of the unavoidability portion and found a significant error in the discharging procedure {{Harv|Appel|Haken|1989}}. In 1986, Appel and Haken were asked by the editor of ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' to write an article addressing the rumors of flaws in their proof. They responded that the rumors were due to a \"misinterpretation of [Schmidt's] results\" and obliged with a detailed article {{Harv|Wilson|2014|loc=225\u2013226}}. Their [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''Every Planar Map is Four-Colorable'', a book claiming a complete and detailed proof (with a microfiche supplement of over 400 pages), appeared in 1989 and explained Schmidt's discovery and several further errors found by others {{Harv|Appel|Haken|1989}}.\n\n===Simplification and verification===\nSince the proving of the theorem, efficient algorithms have been found for 4-coloring maps requiring only [[Big O notation|O]](''n''<sup>2</sup>) time, where ''n'' is the number of vertices. In 1996, [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Neil Robertson]], [[Daniel P. Sanders]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Paul Seymour]], and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Robin Thomas]] created a [[polynomial time|quadratic-time]] algorithm, improving on a [[quartic function|quartic]]-time algorithm based on Appel and Haken\u2019s proof<ref>{{harvtxt|Thomas|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Robertson|Sanders|Seymour|Thomas|1996}}).</ref> This new proof is similar to Appel and Haken's but more efficient because it reduces the complexity of the problem and requires checking only 633 reducible configurations. Both the unavoidability and reducibility parts of this new proof must be executed by computer and are impractical to check by hand.{{sfnp|Thomas|1998|pp=852\u2013853}} In 2001, the same authors announced an alternative proof, by proving the [[snark theorem]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Thomas|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Pegg|Melendez|Berenguer|Sendra|2002}}).</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[Benjamin Werner]] and [[Georges Gonthier]] formalized a proof of the theorem inside the [[Coq]] proof assistant. This removed the need to trust the various computer programs used to verify particular cases; it is only necessary to trust the Coq kernel.{{sfnp|Gonthier|2008}}\n\n==Summary of proof ideas==\nThe following discussion is a summary based on the introduction to ''Every Planar Map is Four Colorable'' {{Harv|Appel|Haken|1989}}. Although flawed, Kempe's original purported proof of the four color theorem provided some of the basic tools later used to prove it. The explanation here is reworded in terms of the modern graph theory formulation above.\n\nKempe's argument goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not ''[[triangulation (geometry)|triangulated]]'', i.e. do not have exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices in order to make every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this [[planar graph|triangulated graph]] is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and without loss of generality we assume the graph is triangulated.\n\nSuppose ''v'', ''e'', and ''f'' are the number of vertices, edges, and regions (faces). Since each region is triangular and each edge is shared by two regions, we have that 2''e'' = 3''f''. This together with [[Euler characteristic#Planar graphs|Euler's formula]], ''v'' \u2212 ''e'' + ''f'' = 2, can be used to show that 6''v'' \u2212 2''e'' = 12. Now, the ''degree'' of a vertex is the number of edges abutting it. If ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> is the number of vertices of degree ''n'' and ''D'' is the maximum degree of any vertex,\n:<math>6v - 2e = 6\\sum_{i=1}^D v_i - \\sum_{i=1}^D iv_i = \\sum_{i=1}^D (6 - i)v_i = 12.</math>\nBut since 12 > 0 and 6 \u2212 ''i'' \u2264 0 for all ''i'' \u2265 6, this demonstrates that there is at least one vertex of degree 5 or less.\n\nIf there is a graph requiring 5 colors, then there is a ''minimal'' such graph, where removing any vertex makes it four-colorable. Call this graph ''G''. Then ''G'' cannot have a vertex of degree 3 or less, because if ''d''(''v'') \u2264 3, we can remove ''v'' from ''G'', four-color the smaller graph, then add back ''v'' and extend the four-coloring to it by choosing a color different from its neighbors.\n\nKempe also showed correctly that ''G'' can have no vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex ''v'' and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of ''v'' are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a [[Kempe chain]]. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, and there may be a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. Suppose it is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and ''v'' can now be added back and colored red.\n\nThis leaves only the case where ''G'' has a vertex of degree 5; but Kempe's argument was flawed for this case. Heawood noticed Kempe's mistake and also observed that if one was satisfied with proving only five colors are needed, one could run through the above argument (changing only that the minimal counterexample requires 6 colors) and use Kempe chains in the degree 5 situation to prove the [[five color theorem]].\n\nIn any case, to deal with this degree 5 vertex case requires a more complicated notion than removing a vertex. Rather the form of the argument is generalized to considering ''configurations'', which are connected subgraphs of ''G'' with the degree of each vertex (in G) specified. For example, the case described in degree 4 vertex situation is the configuration consisting of a single vertex labelled as having degree 4 in ''G''. As above, it suffices to demonstrate that if the configuration is removed and the remaining graph four-colored, then the coloring can be modified in such a way that when the configuration is re-added, the four-coloring can be extended to it as well. A configuration for which this is possible is called a ''reducible configuration''. If at least one of a set of configurations must occur somewhere in G, that set is called ''unavoidable''. The argument above began by giving an unavoidable set of five configurations (a single vertex with degree 1, a single vertex with degree 2, ..., a single vertex with degree 5) and then proceeded to show that the first 4 are reducible; to exhibit an unavoidable set of configurations where every configuration in the set is reducible would prove the theorem.\n\nBecause ''G'' is triangular, the degree of each vertex in a configuration is known, and all edges internal to the configuration are known, the number of vertices in ''G'' adjacent to a given configuration is fixed, and they are joined in a cycle. These vertices form the ''ring'' of the configuration; a configuration with ''k'' vertices in its ring is a ''k''-ring configuration, and the configuration together with its ring is called the ''ringed configuration''. As in the simple cases above, one may enumerate all distinct four-colorings of the ring; any coloring that can be extended without modification to a coloring of the configuration is called ''initially good''. For example, the single-vertex configuration above with 3 or less neighbors were initially good. In general, the surrounding graph must be systematically recolored to turn the ring's coloring into a good one, as was done in the case above where there were 4 neighbors; for a general configuration with a larger ring, this requires more complex techniques. Because of the large number of distinct four-colorings of the ring, this is the primary step requiring computer assistance.\n\nFinally, it remains to identify an unavoidable set of configurations amenable to reduction by this procedure. The primary method used to discover such a set is the [[discharging method (discrete mathematics)|method of discharging]]. The intuitive idea underlying discharging is to consider the planar graph as an electrical network. Initially positive and negative \"electrical charge\" is distributed amongst the vertices so that the total is positive.\n\nRecall the formula above:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^D (6 - i)v_i = 12.</math>\n\nEach vertex is assigned an initial charge of 6-deg(''v''). Then one \"flows\" the charge by systematically redistributing the charge from a vertex to its neighboring vertices according to a set of rules, the ''discharging procedure''. Since charge is preserved, some vertices still have positive charge. The rules restrict the possibilities for configurations of positively charged vertices, so enumerating all such possible configurations gives an unavoidable set.\n\nAs long as some member of the unavoidable set is not reducible, the discharging procedure is modified to eliminate it (while introducing other configurations). Appel and Haken's final discharging procedure was extremely complex and, together with a description of the resulting unavoidable configuration set, filled a 400-page volume, but the configurations it generated could be checked mechanically to be reducible. Verifying the volume describing the unavoidable configuration set itself was done by peer review over a period of several years.\n\nA technical detail not discussed here but required to complete the proof is ''[[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] reducibility''.\n\n==False disproofs==\nThe four color theorem has been notorious for attracting a large number of false proofs and disproofs in its long history. At first, ''[[The New York Times]]'' refused as a matter of policy to report on the Appel\u2013Haken proof, fearing that the proof would be shown false like the ones before it {{Harv|Wilson|2014}}. Some alleged proofs, like Kempe's and Tait's mentioned above, stood under public scrutiny for over a decade before they were refuted. But many more, authored by amateurs, were never published at all.\n\n{{double image|right|4CT Non-Counterexample 1.svg|150|4CT Non-Counterexample 2.svg|150|The map (left) has been colored with five colors, but for example four of the ten regions can be changed to obtain a coloring with only four colors (right).}}\n\nGenerally, the simplest, though invalid, counterexamples attempt to create one region which touches all other regions. This forces the remaining regions to be colored with only three colors. Because the four color theorem is true, this is always possible; however, because the person drawing the map is focused on the one large region, they fail to notice that the remaining regions can in fact be colored with three colors.\n\nThis trick can be generalized: there are many maps where if the colors of some regions are selected beforehand, it becomes impossible to color the remaining regions without exceeding four colors. A casual verifier of the counterexample may not think to change the colors of these regions, so that the counterexample will appear as though it is valid.\n\nPerhaps one effect underlying this common misconception is the fact that the color restriction is not [[transitive relation|transitive]]: a region only has to be colored differently from regions it touches directly, not regions touching regions that it touches. If this were the restriction, planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers of colors.\n\nOther false disproofs violate the assumptions of the theorem in unexpected ways, such as using a region that consists of multiple disconnected parts, or disallowing regions of the same color from touching at a point.\n\n==Three-coloring==\n\nWhile every planar map can be colored with four colors, it is [[NP-complete]] in [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] to decide whether an arbitrary planar map can be colored with just three colors.<ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Dailey | first1 = D.

To prove this, one can combine a proof of the theorem for finite planar graphs with the [[De Bruijn\u2013Erd\u0151s theorem (graph theory)|De Bruijn\u2013Erd\u0151s theorem]] stating that, if every finite subgraph of an infinite graph is ''k''-colorable, then the whole graph is also ''k''-colorable {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1967}}. This can also be seen as an immediate consequence of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s [[compactness theorem]] for [[first-order logic]], simply by expressing the colorability of an infinite graph with a set of logical formulae.\n\nOne can also consider the coloring problem on surfaces other than the plane ([[#Reference-Mathworld-Map coloring|Weisstein]]). The problem on the [[sphere]] or [[cylinder]] is equivalent to that on the plane. For closed (orientable or non-orientable) surfaces with positive [[genus (mathematics)|genus]], the maximum number ''p'' of colors needed depends on the surface's [[Euler characteristic]] \u03c7 according to the formula\n:<math>p=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{49 - 24 \\chi}}{2}\\right\\rfloor,</math>\nwhere the outermost brackets denote the [[floor function]].\n\nAlternatively, for an [[orientable]] surface the formula can be given in terms of the genus of a surface, ''g'':\n::<math>p=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{7 + \\sqrt{1 + 48g }}{2}\\right\\rfloor</math> ([[#Reference-Mathworld-Map coloring|Weisstein]]).\n\n[[File:Szilassi polyhedron 3D model.svg|thumb|left|150px|Interactive Szilassi polyhedron model with each face a different color.

J. Heawood]] in 1890 and proved by [[Gerhard Ringel]] and [[John William Theodore Youngs|J. W. T. Youngs]] in 1968. The only exception to the formula is the [[Klein bottle]], which has Euler characteristic 0 (hence the formula gives p = 7) and requires only 6 colors, as shown by [[Philip Franklin|P. Franklin]] in 1934 ([[#Reference-Mathworld-Map coloring|Weisstein]]).\n\nFor example, the [[torus]] has Euler characteristic \u03c7 = 0 (and genus ''g'' = 1) and thus ''p'' = 7, so no more than 7 colors are required to color any map on a torus. This upper bound of 7 is sharp: certain [[toroidal polyhedron|toroidal polyhedra]] such as the [[Szilassi polyhedron]] require seven colors.\n\n[[File:Tietze-Moebius.svg|thumb|[[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze's]] subdivision of a [[M\u00f6bius strip]] into six mutually adjacent regions, requiring six colors. The vertices and edges of the subdivision form an embedding of [[Tietze's graph]] onto the strip.]]\nA [[M\u00f6bius strip]] requires six colors {{harv|Tietze|1910}} as do [[1-planar graph]]s (graphs drawn with at most one simple crossing per edge) {{harv|Borodin|1984}}. If both the vertices and the faces of a planar graph are colored, in such a way that no two adjacent vertices, faces, or vertex-face pair have the same color, then again at most six colors are needed {{harv|Borodin|1984}}.\n\nThere is no obvious extension of the coloring result to three-dimensional solid regions. By using a set of ''n'' flexible rods, one can arrange that every rod touches every other rod. The set would then require ''n'' colors, or ''n''+1 if you consider the empty space that also touches every rod. The number ''n'' can be taken to be any integer, as large as desired. Such examples were known to Fredrick Guthrie in 1880 {{Harv|Wilson|2014}}. Even for axis-parallel [[cuboid]]s (considered to be adjacent when two cuboids share a two-dimensional boundary area) an unbounded number of colors may be necessary ({{harvnb|Reed|Allwright|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Magnant|Martin|2011}}).\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Relation to other areas of mathematics==\n\n[[Dror Bar-Natan]] gave a statement concerning [[Lie algebras]] and [[Vassiliev invariant]]s which is equivalent to the four color theorem.{{sfnp|Bar-Natan|1997}}\n\n==Use outside of mathematics==\nDespite the motivation from [[map coloring|coloring political maps of countries]], the theorem is not of particular interest to [[cartographers]].

Books on cartography and the history of mapmaking do not mention the four-color property\" {{Harv|Wilson|2014|loc=2}}. The theorem also does not guarantee the usual cartographic requirement that non-contiguous regions of the same country (such as Great Britain and Northern Ireland) be colored identically.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Discrete mathematics|Mathematics}}\n* [[Apollonian network]]\n* [[Graph coloring]]\n* [[Gr\u00f6tzsch's theorem]]: [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] planar graphs are 3-colorable.\n* [[Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem]]: how many colors are needed to color the plane so that no two points at unit distance apart have the same color?\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation |last=Allaire |first=Frank |year=1978 |chapter=Another proof of the four colour theorem.

He is married and has no children. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor, a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. Two uncaring [[Emergency medical technician|EMTs]] come over to pump Mildred's stomach, drain her poisoned blood, and fill her with new blood. After the EMTs leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag watches over Mildred, watching the new blood fill her pallid cheeks. Montag then goes outside, overhearing Clarisse and her family talk about the way life is in this hedonistic, illiterate society. Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of his wife's near-death. The next day, Montag finds Mildred in the kitchen, with no memory of what happened and talking incessantly about being hungry from an alleged hangover she has from a party she thought she attended last night. Over the next few days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home. She tells him about how her simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers and how she's forced to go to therapy for her behavior and thoughts. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes absent. He senses something is wrong.<ref name=koster_p35>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=35|quote=Montag does not realize at first that she is gone, or that he misses her; he simply feels that something is the matter.}}</ref>\n\nIn the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and [[self-immolation|burn herself alive]]. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her when they first met and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads for the bathroom to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of vapid, interactive entertainment, and fast, reckless driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of \"The Hound\", an eight-legged<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=32|quote=The Mechanical Hound is an eight-legged glass and metal contraption that serves as a surveillance tool and programmable killing machine for the firemen, who use it to track down suspected book hoarders and readers.}}</ref> robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.\n\nMontag awakens ill the next morning, with Mildred nagging him to get up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more involved in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short [[attention span]] while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. After an awkward encounter between Millie and Montag over the book hidden under Montag's pillow, Beatty is suspicious that Montag may have a book. Beatty casually adds a passing threat as he leaves, telling Montag that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the next 24 hours. If not, the other firemen would come and burn his house down for him. Despite the subtlety of the statement, the encounter leaves Montag shaken. He then decides to take action once and for all.\n\nAfter Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator. Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.\n\n===\"The Sieve and the Sand\"===\nWhen a sniffing occurs at their front door, Montag recognizes it as The Hound. Montag and Mildred discuss the stolen books, and Mildred refuses to go along with it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the \"parlor walls\" (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.\n\nMontag, concedes that Mildred is a lost cause and he will need help to understand the books. Montag remembers an old man named Faber he once met in a park a year ago, an English professor before books were banned. He telephones Faber with questions about books, and Faber soon hangs up on him. Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house. He tries to read it on the way, but gets distracted by a radio jingle advert and nearly goes insane. At Faber's house, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.\n\nAt home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the \"parlor walls\". Not interested in this insipid entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they are about the upcoming war, the thought of losing loved ones to death, their unruly children, and who they voted for in the last election. Enraged by their idiocy, Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition fireman do once a year: they find a book from the past and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite the poem ''[[Dover Beach]]'', causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. At the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book. Mildred's friends leave in disgust, while Mildred takes more sleeping pills.\n\nIn the aftermath of the parlor party, Montag hides his books in his backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible. He finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen. Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. Thus Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds, and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive in the firetruck recklessly to the destination: Montag's house.\n\n===\"Burning Bright\"===\nBeatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends reported him after what happened the other night. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall family to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi, never once looking back. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower. As soon as he has incinerated the house, Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse's Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. Before he escapes, however, he realizes that Beatty had wanted to die a long time ago and had purposely goaded Montag, as well as provided him with a weapon.\n\nMontag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled [[Bibliophiles|book-lovers]] who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another Mechanical Hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves Faber's house. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream. Montag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, led by a man named Granger.  Granger shows Montag the ongoing manhunt on a portable battery TV, and predicts that \u201cMontag\u201d will be caught within the next few minutes.  As predicted, an innocent man is then caught and killed.\n\nThe drifters are all former intellectuals.  They have each memorized books should the day come that society comes to an end, then rebuilds itself anew; this time, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. While learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (including Mildred) was immediately killed. Montag and the group are injured and dirtied, but manage to survive the shock wave.\n\nThe following morning, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relationship to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger explains that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember its mistakes and try never to repeat them. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that way people can take a long look at themselves and reflect on their lives. When the meal is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''[[Guy Montag]]''' is the [[protagonist]] and fireman who presents the dystopia through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, a man in conflict about it, and someone resolved to be free of it. Through most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes what he hears.\n* '''Clarisse McClellan''' walks with Montag on his trips home and is one month short of her 17th birthday.<ref group=note>Clarisse tells Montag she is \"seventeen and crazy\", later admitting that she will actually be seventeen \"next month\".</ref><ref name=koster_p31>{{cite book|editor-last=De Koster|editor-first=Katie|title=Readings on Fahrenheit 451|year=2000|series=Literary Companion Series|publisher=Greenhaven Press|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=1-56510-857-4|page=31|quote=Montag's new neighbor, the sixteen-year-old Clarisse, appears in only a few scenes at the beginning of the novel.}}</ref> She is an unusual sort of person in the bookless, hedonistic society: outgoing, naturally cheerful, unorthodox, and intuitive. She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking \"why\" instead of \"how\" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after their first meeting, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family left following her death. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old school teacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.\n* '''Mildred \"Millie\" Montag''' is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her \"parlor walls\" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described in the book as \"thin as a [[praying mantis]] from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon.\" Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by reading ''Dover Beach'' and unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him, and dies when the city is bombed.\n* '''Captain Beatty''' is Montag's boss and the book's main antagonist. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content, and contradicting facts and opinions. After attempting to force Montag to burn his house, Montag kills him with a flamethrower, only to later realize that Beatty had given him the flamethrower and goaded him on purpose, so Montag could kill him. However, it is still unclear whether or not Beatty was ever on Montag's side, or if he was just suicidal. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for the ''Fahrenheit 451'' play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.\n* '''Stoneman '''and '''Black''' are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they're told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently realizes how damaging it is to society. Black is later framed by Montag for possessing books.\n* '''Faber''' is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. He helps Montag escape the city after guiding him, getting on a bus to [[St. Louis]] and escaping the city before it is bombed. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, [[Faber-Castell]].\n* '''Mrs. Ann Bowles '''and '''Mrs. Clara Phelps''' are Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag reads ''Dover Beach'' to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading \"silly awful hurting words\".\n* '''Granger''' is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.\n\n==Title==\nThe title page of the book explains the title as follows: ''Fahrenheit 451\u2014The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns...''.

The following are some notable incidents:\n* In 1987, ''Fahrenheit 451'' was given \"third tier\" status by the [[Bay District Schools|Bay County School Board]] in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], [[Florida]] under then-superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier classification system.<ref name=karolides2011_p501_502>{{cite book|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|edition=Second|year=2011|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|pages=501\u201302}}</ref> Third tier was meant for books to be removed from the classroom for \"a lot of vulgarity\".<ref name=karolides2011_p501_502/> After a resident class-action lawsuit, a media stir, and student protests, the school board abandoned their tier-based censorship system and approved all the currently used books.<ref name=karolides2011_p501_502/>\n* In 1992, [[Venado Middle School]] in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]], [[California]] gave copies of ''Fahrenheit 451'' to students with all \"obscene\" words blacked out.<ref name=karolides2011_p489>{{cite book|last1=Karolides|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Bald|first2=Margaret|last3=Sova|first3=Dawn B.|title=120 Banned Books: Censorship Histories of World Literature|edition=Second|year=2011|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=978-0-8160-8232-2|page=489|quote=In 1992, students of Venado Middle School in Irvine, California, were issued copies of the novel with numerous words blacked out.

Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]], he was concerned about [[censorship in the United States]]. During a radio interview in 1956,<ref>{{cite web |others=Narrated by Norman Rose |title=Ticket to the Moon (tribute to SciFi) |date=December 4, 1956 |website=Biography in Sound |publisher=NBC Radio News |url=https://oldradioprograms.us/My%20Old%20Radio%20Shows/B/Biographies%20In%20Sound/Biographies%20In%20Sound%20(NBC)-1956-12-04-Ticket%20To%20The%20Moon%20-%20Tribute%20To%20Scifi.mp3 |format=mp3 |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |at=27:10\u201327:57}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Definitive Biography in Sound Radio Log|url=http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/DigitalDeliToo/dd2jb-Biography-In-Sound.html|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}</ref> Bradbury said:<blockquote>I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.</blockquote>\n\nAs time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of ''Fahrenheit 451'' were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:<blockquote>In writing the short novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was ''not'' fiction.<ref>Quoted by [[Kingsley Amis]] in ''New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction'' (1960). Bradbury directly foretells this incident early in the work: \"And in her ears the little Seashells, the thimble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talking coming in.\" p.12</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis story echoes Mildred's \"Seashell ear-thimbles\" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that ''Fahrenheit 451'' is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature.<ref name=LAweekly>{{cite web|title=Ray Bradbury: Fahrenheit 451 Misinterpreted|last=Johnston|first=Amy E.

And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican, [[Mattachine]]/[[Four Square Gospel]] feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse.&nbsp;[...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel ''Fahrenheit 451'', described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever.&nbsp;[...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. [[Judy-Lynn del Rey]], one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Ray|authorlink=Ray Bradbury|date=2003|title=Fahrenheit 451|edition=50th anniversary|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-34296-8|pages=175\u201379}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBook-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in ''Fahrenheit 451''.<ref name=LAweekly/> Nevertheless, the role on censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eller|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Touponce|first2=William F.|title=Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction|date=2004|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=9780873387798|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rnWY_tjp9WgC&lpg=PA186&dq=%22The%20main%20target%20of%20%27%27Fahrenheit%20451%27%27%20is%20not%20censorship%2C%20as%20is%20often%20supposed%2C%20but%20rather%20mass%20culture%22&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q=%22The%20main%20target%20of%20%27%27Fahrenheit%20451%27%27%20is%20not%20censorship%2C%20as%20is%20often%20supposed%2C%20but%20rather%20mass%20culture%22|page=91|quote=The main target of ''Fahrenheit 451'' is not censorship, as is often supposed, but rather mass culture...}}</ref>{{better source|date=March 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Literature suppressed on social grounds|last=Sova|first=Dawn B.|publisher=Facts On File|year=2006|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=133\u2013135|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nA variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own.

At least part of it was performed at the Colony Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] in 1979, but it was not in print until 1986 and the official world premiere was only in November 1988 by the [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne, Indiana Civic Theatre]]. The stage adaptation diverges considerably from the book and seems influenced by Truffaut's movie. For example, fire chief Beatty's character is fleshed out and is the wordiest role in the play. As in the movie, Clarisse does not simply disappear but in the finale meets up with Montag as a book character (she as [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], he as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).<ref name=play>[http://home.wlv.ac.uk/~in5379/books/451_play.htm Fahrenheit 451 (play)], BradburyMedia; accessed September 17, 2016.</ref>\n\nThe UK premiere of Bradbury's stage adaptation was not until 2003 in [[Nottingham]],<ref name=play/> while it took until 2006 before the Godlight Theatre Company produced and performed its [[New York City]] premiere at [[59E59 Theaters]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|authorlink=Neil Genzlinger|title=Godlight Theater's 'Fahrenheit 451' Offers Hot Ideas for the Information Age|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2006/03/25/theater/reviews/25fahr.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1364390999-4fShVjfkzVUOVr8NqZtCcg|accessdate=March 2, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 2006}}</ref> After the completion of the New York run, the production then transferred to the [[Edinburgh Festival]] where it was a 2006 [[Edinburgh Festival]] ''Pick of the Fringe''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Edinburgh festival 2006 \u2013 Reviews \u2013 Theatre 'F' \u2013 8 out of 156|publisher=Edinburghguide.com|url=http://www.edinburghguide.com/festival/2006/fringe/review_theatre.php?page=f|accessdate=June 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Off-Broadway]] theatre [[The American Place Theatre]] presented a [[one man show]] adaptation of ''Fahrenheit 451'' as a part of their 2008\u20132009 Literature to Life season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Literature to Life \u2013 Citizenship & Censorship: Raise Your Civic Voice in 2008\u201309 |publisher=The American Place Theatre|url=http://www.americanplacetheatre.org/stage/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=331&Itemid=1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110220249/http://www.americanplacetheatre.org/stage/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=331&Itemid=1|archivedate=November 10, 2009|deadurl=yes}}</ref>\n\n''Fahrenheit 451'' inspired the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] production ''Time Has Fallen Asleep in the Afternoon Sunshine'', which was performed at the [[Birmingham Central Library]] in April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Edvardsen|first=Mette|title=''Time Has Fallen Asleep In The Afternoon Sunshine'' Presented at Birmingham Central Library|url=http://birmingham-rep.co.uk/event/time-has-fallen-asleep-in-the-afternoon-sunshine|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Radio===\n[[BBC Radio]] produced a one-off dramatization of the novel in 1982<ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Bradbury Radio Plays|publisher=Diversity Website|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/ray-bradbury.html|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> starring [[Michael Pennington]].<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC iPlayer \u2013 Ray Bradbury \u2013 Fahrenheit 451|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vs0f0 |accessdate=February 19, 2012}}</ref> It was broadcast again on February 12, 2012, and April 7 and 8, 2013, on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vs0f0/broadcasts|title=Ray Bradbury \u2013 Fahrenheit 451|work=BBC Radio 4 Extra|accessdate=November 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Computer games===\n{{main|Fahrenheit 451 (video game)}}\nIn 1984, the novel was adapted into a computer [[text adventure]] [[Fahrenheit 451 (video game)|game of the same name]] by the software company [[Telarium|Trillium]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fahrenheit 451|work=Antic's Amiga Plus|volume=5|date=May 1985|page=81|first=Gil|last=Merciez|issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Comics===\nIn June 2009, a [[graphic novel]] edition of the book was published.

Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half.<ref>Sagredo Garde, I\u00f1aki. ''Navarra. Castillos que defendieron el Reino''.

He was accompanied by Anjiro, two other Japanese men, Father [[Cosme de Torr\u00e8s]], and Brother Jo\u00e3o Fernandes. He had taken with him presents for the \"[[Emperor of Japan|King of Japan]]\" since he was intending to introduce himself as the [[Apostolic Nuncio]].\n\nEuropeans had already come to Japan: the Portuguese had landed in 1543 on the island of [[Tanegashima]], where they introduced matchlock firearms to Japan.<ref name=\"Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480\">Diego Pacheco. \"Xavier and Tanegashima.\" ''Monumenta Nipponica'', Vol. 29, No. 4 (Winter, 1974), pp. 477\u2013480</ref>\n\nFrom Amboina, he wrote to his companions in Europe: \"I asked a Portuguese merchant, \u2026 who had been for many days in Anjir\u014d\u2019s country of Japan, to give me \u2026 some information on that land and its people from what he had seen and heard. ...All the Portuguese merchants coming from Japan tell me that if I go there I shall do great service for God our Lord, more than with the pagans of India, for they are a very reasonable people.

As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. [[Shimazu Takahisa]] (1514\u20131571), ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alc\u00e1\u00e7ova would later write in 1554:\n\n<blockquote> In Cangoxima, the first place Father Master Francisco stopped at, there were a good number of Christians, although there was no one there to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian.<ref name=\"Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480\"/> </blockquote>\n\nHe was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550.<ref name=butler/> From October to December 1550, he resided in [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]]. Shortly before Christmas, he left for [[Kyoto]] but failed to meet with the Emperor. He returned to Yamaguchi in March 1551, where the daimyo of the province gave him permission to preach. However, lacking fluency in the Japanese language, he had to limit himself to reading aloud the translation of a catechism.\n\nFrancis was the first Jesuit to go to Japan as a missionary.<ref>[[Shusaku Endo]] (1969), ''[[Silence (novel)|Silence]]'', p. vii, Translator's Preface, William Johnston, Taplinger Publishing Company, New York</ref> He brought with him paintings of the Madonna and the Madonna and Child. These paintings were used to help teach the Japanese about Christianity. There was a huge language barrier as Japanese was unlike other languages the missionaries had previously encountered. For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language.\n\nHaving learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes. Five of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, these not gifts for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.<ref name=crawley />\n\nFor forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans also began proselytising in Asia as well.

As Xavier learned more about the religious nuances of the word, he changed to ''Deusu''<ref name=butler/> from the Latin and Portuguese ''Deus''.

Xavier worked for more than two years in Japan and saw his successor-Jesuits established. He then decided to return to India. Historians debate the exact path he returned by, but from evidence attributed to the captain of his ship, he may have travelled through Tanegeshima and Minato, and avoided Kagoshima because of the hostility of the daimyo.<ref name=\"Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480\"/> During his trip, a tempest forced him to stop on an island near [[Guangzhou]], China, where he met Diogo Pereira, a rich merchant and an old friend from [[Kochi|Cochin]]. Pereira showed him a letter from Portuguese prisoners in Guangzhou, asking for a Portuguese ambassador to speak to the Chinese Emperor on their behalf. Later during the voyage, he stopped at Malacca on 27 December 1551, and was back in Goa by January 1552.\n\nOn 17 April he set sail with Diogo Pereira on the ''Santa Cruz'' for China. He planned to introduce himself as Apostolic Nuncio and Pereira as ambassador of the King of Portugal. But then he realized that he had forgotten his testimonial letters as an Apostolic Nuncio. Back in Malacca, he was confronted by the ''capit\u00e3o'' \u00c1lvaro de Ata\u00edde da Gama who now had total control over the harbour. The ''capit\u00e3o'' refused to recognize his title of Nuncio, asked Pereira to resign from his title of ambassador, named a new crew for the ship, and demanded the gifts for the Chinese Emperor be left in Malacca.\n\nIn late August 1552, the ''Santa Cruz'' reached the Chinese island of [[Shangchuan]], 14&nbsp;km away from the southern coast of mainland China, near [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], Guangdong, 200&nbsp;km south-west of what later became [[Hong Kong]]. At this time, he was accompanied only by a Jesuit student, \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called Ant\u00f3nio, and a [[Malabars|Malabar]] servant called Christopher. Around mid-November he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money. Having sent back \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, he remained alone with Ant\u00f3nio. He died from a fever at Shangchuan, Taishan, China, on 3 December 1552, while he was waiting for a boat that would take him to mainland China.\n\n==Burials and relics==\n[[File:Casket of Saint Francis Xavier.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Casket of Saint Francis Xavier in the [[Basilica of Bom Jesus]] in [[Goa]], [[India]]]]\n{{multiple image\n| footer    =\n| align     = right\n| image1    = Reliquary of St. Francis Xavier's humerus.jpg\n| width1    = 152\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Saint Francis Xavier's [[humerus]].

The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the  XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\n\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, [[Marg\u00e3o]], in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), [[Batpal]], [[Canacona]], Goa. and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\n\n====Other places====\nOther pilgrimage centres include Saint Francis Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of [[Il Gesu]], Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (Place of death), and more.\n\nSaint Francis Xavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. In [[Magdalena de Kino]] in [[Sonora]], Mexico, in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre [[Eusebio Kino]] in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many of the region. Also [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\n\n===Novena of grace===\n{{further|Novena of Grace}}\n[[File:Unzenhell3.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Fumaroles at Mt. Unzen, Japan]]\nThe [[Novena of Grace]] is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary [[Marcello Mastrilli]]. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=17UZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Marcello%20Mastrilli&pg=PA234#v=onepage&q=Marcello%20Mastrilli&f=false \"Japanese Sketches\"] in ''The Month'', Volume 11 (1869) p.241</ref> Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from [[Mount Unzen|Mt. Unzen]], known as the ''Hell mouth'' or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-674-02448-9}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:VisionStFrancisBoccacio.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Vision of St. Francis Xavier'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]\nSaint Francis Xavier is noteworthy for his [[missionary work]], both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since [[Saint Paul]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said of both [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from [[Paris]] and Rome, but a unique desire \u2014 a unique passion, it could be said \u2014 moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\"<ref name=benedict/> By consulting with the earlier ancient [[Christians of St. Thomas]] in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Timor]]). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools.<ref>{{Citation|title=Category:Jesuit schools in India|date=2018-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Jesuit_schools_in_India&oldid=833714981|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-24}}</ref> Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. However, following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.\n\nA small chapel designed by [[Achille-Antoine Hermitte]] was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.\nIt was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth.<ref>{{citation |title=Achille-Antoine Hermitte\u2019s Surviving Building / \u963f\u57fa\u91cc\u2027 \u5b89\u7576\u2027 \u57c3\u723e\u7c73\u7279\u7684\u5016\u5b58\u5efa\u7bc9 |last1=Davies |last2=\u6234\u5049\u601d  |first1=Stephen|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |volume=56 |year=2016 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |via=[[JSTOR]] |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/jroyaaisasocihkb.56.92 |accessdate=2018-07-17}}</ref> \nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native [[Navarre]], which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the [[Javierada]], an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at [[Pamplona]] to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.\n\n===Namesake===\n[[File:Saint Francis Xavier statue, Jakarta Cathedral, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Santo Fransiskus Xaverius'', at Jesuit [[Jakarta Cathedral|''Gereja Katedral Santa Perawan Maria Diangkat Ke Surga'']], in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Statue of Staint Francis Xavier.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Saint Francis Xavier, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], [[United States]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier - Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos.png|thumb|upright|Effigy of Saint Francis Xavier in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Discoveries]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]]]\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, he is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where ''Francisco Javier'' or ''Javier'' are common male [[given names]].<ref name=\"INE\">''[http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/nombyapel/nombres_mas_frecuentes_en.xls The most frequent names, simple and exact for the national total and exact for the province of residence]'', [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica]].

In India, the spelling ''Xavier'' is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in [[Goa]] and the southern states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], and [[Karnataka]]. The names ''Francisco Xavier'', ''Ant\u00f3nio Xavier'', ''Jo\u00e3o Xavier'', ''Caetano Xavier'', ''Domingos Xavier'' et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. ''Fransiskus Xaverius'' is commonly used as a name for [[Indonesia]]n Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and [[Bavaria]] the name is spelled as ''Xaver'' (pronounced (\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250)) and often used in addition to Francis as ''Franz-Xaver'' (frant\u0361s\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\"; in the 2000s, however, \"Xavier\" by itself has become more popular than \"Francis\", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A.<ref name=\"ssa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=ssa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for [[John Sevier]], originated from the name Xavier.\n\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland)|St. Francis Xavier Shrine]] at [[Warwick, Maryland]], (founded 1720, the school of the American founding father [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]] (1737\u20131832) \u2013 longest living signer and only Catholic at the [[Continental Congress]] to sign the [[Declaration of Independence]], 1776), and cousin to the first American-born Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]],  [[Archbishop of Baltimore|Bishop and later Archbishop of Baltimore]], 1790\u20131815, There are also the American educational teaching order [[Xaverian Brothers]], the [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] in [[Dyersville, Iowa]], and the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] (founded in 1692, and known for its [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]).\n\n===In art===\n[[Rubens]] painted ''St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead'' for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles.<ref>Rubens, William Unger, S.

''The American Art Review'', Vol. 1, No. 2 (Dec. 1879), p. 66</ref> The [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague, Czech Republic, features a [[Statue of Francis Xavier, Charles Bridge|statue of Francis Xavier]].\n\n===Missionary===\nShortly before leaving Xavier had issued a famous instruction to Father [[Gaspar Barazeuz]] who was leaving to go to Ormuz (a kingdom on an island in the [[Persian Gulf]], formerly attached to the [[Persia|Empire of Persia]], now part of [[Iran]]), that he should mix with sinners:\n\n<blockquote> And if you wish to bring forth much fruit, both for yourselves and for your neighbours, and to live consoled, converse with sinners, making them unburden themselves to you. These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.<ref name=\"Ante Kadi\u010d 1961 pp. 12-18\"/></blockquote>\n\nModern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Church]], and used the [[Goa]] government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in [[Japan]] was subsequently destroyed by persecution, [[Protestant]] missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the [[Nagasaki]] area.<ref name=\"ctlibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/131christians/missionaries/xavier.html |title=Francis Xavier - Christian History &amp; Biography - ChristianityTodayLibrary.com |publisher=ctlibrary.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrancis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern [[Indonesia]], and he was known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" where in 1546\u20131547 he worked in the [[Maluku Islands]] among the people of [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Ternate]], and [[Morotai]] (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission.

Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric.

Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while it was alive, such as [[animal tracks]] or [[feces]] ([[coprolite]]s). These types of fossil are called [[trace fossil]]s or ''ichnofossils'', as opposed to ''body fossils''. Some fossils are [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and are called ''chemofossils'' or [[biosignature]]s.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Fossilization processes==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe process of fossilization varies according to tissue type and external conditions.\n\n===Permineralization===\n[[File:Permian Silicified Sclerobionts.JPG|thumb|Silicified (replaced with silica) fossils from the Road Canyon Formation (Middle Permian of Texas)]]\n[[Permineralization]] is a process of fossilization that occurs when an organism is buried. The empty spaces within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich [[groundwater]]. Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying the empty spaces. This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the [[cell wall]] of a [[plant cell]]. Small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death or soon after the initial decay process. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of [[skin]], [[feather]]s or even soft tissues. This is a form of [[diagenesis]].\n\n===Casts and molds===\n{{anchor|Cast}} <!--[[Cast (geology)]] and [[Casting (geology)]] redirect here-->\n[[File:Aviculopecten subcardiformis01.JPG|thumb|External mold of a [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] from the [[Logan Formation]], Lower [[Carboniferous]], Ohio]]\nIn some cases the original remains of the organism completely dissolve or are otherwise destroyed. The remaining organism-shaped hole in the rock is called an ''external mold''. If this hole is later filled with other minerals, it is a ''cast''. An [[endocast]] or ''internal mold'' is formed when sediments or minerals fill the internal cavity of an organism, such as the inside of a [[bivalve]] or [[snail]] or the hollow of a [[skull]].\n\n===Authigenic mineralization===\nThis is a special form of cast and mold formation. If the chemistry is right, the organism (or fragment of organism) can act as a nucleus for the precipitation of minerals such as siderite, resulting in a nodule forming around it. If this happens rapidly before significant decay to the organic tissue, very fine three-dimensional morphological detail can be preserved. Nodules from the Carboniferous [[Mazon Creek fossil beds]] of Illinois, USA, are among the best documented examples of such mineralization.\n\n===Replacement and recrystallization===\n[[File:MatmorScleractinian.JPG|thumb|Recrystallized [[scleractinia]]n coral (aragonite to calcite) from the [[Jurassic]] of southern Israel]]\nReplacement occurs when the shell, bone or other tissue is replaced with another mineral. In some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss of original material. A shell is said to be ''recrystallized'' when the original skeletal compounds are still present but in a different crystal form, as from [[aragonite]] to [[calcite]].\n\n===Adpression (compression-impression)===\n[[Compression fossil]]s, such as those of fossil ferns, are the result of chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an expression of [[diagenesis]]. Often what remains is a [[carbonaceous film]] known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock\u2014an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: ''adpression''.<ref name=\"ShuteCleal 1986\">{{cite journal|last1=Shute |first1=C. H. |last2=Cleal |first2=C.

Cyanobacteria (as well as [[extremophile]] [[Gammaproteobacteria]]) are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of [[oxygen]] in the primeval earth's [[atmosphere]] through their continuing [[photosynthesis]]. Cyanobacteria use [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sunlight]] to create their food. A layer of [[mucus]] often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the mucus, which can be cemented by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of [[limestone]]. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed [[oncolite]]s are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the [[fossil record]].

They can easily be mistaken for real fossils. Some pseudofossils, such as [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendrite]]s, are formed by naturally occurring fissures in the rock that get filled up by percolating minerals. Other types of pseudofossils are kidney ore (round shapes in iron ore) and [[moss agate]]s, which look like moss or plant leaves.

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] concurred with Aristotle's view that fossils were the remains of ancient life.<ref>[http://www.wmnh.com/wmas0002.htmCorrelating Earth's History]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Paul R. Janke</ref> For example, da Vinci noticed discrepancies with the biblical flood narrative as an explanation for fossil origins:\n\n{{quote|If the Deluge had carried the shells for distances of three and four hundred miles from the sea it would have carried them mixed with various other natural objects all heaped up together; but even at such distances from the sea we see the oysters all together and also the shellfish and the cuttlefish and all the other shells which congregate together, found all together dead; and the solitary shells are found apart from one another as we see them every day on the sea-shores.}}\n\n{{quote|And we find oysters together in very large families, among which some may be seen with their shells still joined together, indicating that they were left there by the sea and that they were still living when the strait of Gibraltar was cut through.

His observations on fossils, which he stated to be the petrified remains of creatures some of which no longer existed, were published posthumously in 1705.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/history-of-geology/july-2-1635-robert-hooke-the-last-virtuoso-of-silly-science/ |title=July 18, 1635: Robert Hooke - The Last Virtuoso of Silly Science |last=Bressan |first=David |work=Scientific American Blog Network |access-date=2018-02-11 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith (1769\u20131839)]], an English canal engineer, observed that rocks of different ages (based on the [[law of superposition]]) preserved different assemblages of fossils, and that these assemblages succeeded one another in a regular and determinable order. He observed that rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained. He termed this the principle of ''faunal succession''. This principle became one of Darwin's chief pieces of evidence that biological evolution was real.\n\n[[Georges Cuvier]] came to believe that most if not all the animal fossils he examined were remains of extinct species. This led Cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called [[catastrophism]]. Near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants he said:\n\n:''All of these facts, consistent among themselves, and not opposed by any report, seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours, destroyed by some kind of catastrophe.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/History/cuvier.xhtml|title=Cuvier|website=palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nInterest in fossils, and geology more generally, expanded during the early nineteenth century.  In Britain, [[Mary Anning]]'s discoveries of fossils, including the first complete [[ichthyosaur]] and a complete [[plesiosaurus]] skeleton, sparked both public and scholarly interest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mary Anning |url=http://www.lymeregismuseum.co.uk/collection/mary-anning/ |website=Lyme Regis Museum |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Linnaeus and Darwin===\n\nEarly [[Natural science|naturalists]] well understood the similarities and differences of living species leading [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] to develop a hierarchical classification system still in use today. Darwin and his contemporaries first linked the hierarchical structure of the tree of life with the then very sparse fossil record. Darwin eloquently described a process of descent with modification, or evolution, whereby organisms either adapt to natural and changing environmental pressures, or they perish.\n\nWhen Darwin wrote ''[[On the Origin of Species|On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life]]'', the oldest animal fossils were those from the [[Cambrian]] Period, now known to be about 540&nbsp;million years old. He worried about the absence of older fossils because of the implications on the validity of his theories, but he expressed hope that such fossils would be found, noting that: \"only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy.\" Darwin also pondered the sudden appearance of many groups (i.e. [[phylum|phyla]]) in the oldest known Cambrian fossiliferous strata.<ref>Darwin, C (1859) On the Origin of Species. Chapter 10: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record.</ref>\n\n===After Darwin===\n\nSince Darwin's time, the fossil record has been extended to between 2.3 and 3.5&nbsp;billion years.<ref>Schopf JW (1999) Cradle of Life: The Discovery of the Earth's Earliest Fossils, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ.</ref> Most of these Precambrian fossils are microscopic bacteria or [[Micropaleontology|microfossils]]. However, macroscopic fossils are now known from the late Proterozoic. The [[Ediacara biota]] (also called Vendian biota) dating from 575&nbsp;million years ago collectively constitutes a richly diverse assembly of early multicellular [[eukaryote]]s.\n\nThe fossil record and faunal succession form the basis of the science of [[biostratigraphy]] or determining the age of rocks based on embedded fossils. For the first 150 years of [[geology]], biostratigraphy and superposition were the only means for determining the [[Relative dating|relative age]] of rocks. The [[geologic time scale]] was developed based on the relative ages of rock strata as determined by the early paleontologists and [[Stratigraphy|stratigrapher]]s.\n\nSince the early years of the twentieth century, [[absolute dating]] methods, such as [[radiometric dating]] (including [[K\u2013Ar dating|potassium/argon]], [[Argon\u2013argon dating|argon/argon]], [[uranium-lead dating|uranium series]], and, for very recent fossils, [[radiocarbon dating]]) have been used to verify the relative ages obtained by fossils and to provide absolute ages for many fossils. Radiometric dating has shown that the earliest known stromatolites are over 3.4&nbsp;billion years old.\n\n===Modern era===\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = The fossil record is life's evolutionary epic that unfolded over four&nbsp;billion years as environmental conditions and genetic potential interacted in accordance with natural selection.|source = The Virtual Fossil Museum<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fossilmuseum.net/| title=The Virtual Fossil Museum - Fossils Across Geological Time and Evolution| accessdate=4 March 2007}}</ref>|width = 40%|bgcolor =}}\n\nPaleontology has joined with [[evolutionary biology]] to share the interdisciplinary task of outlining the tree of life, which inevitably leads backwards in time to Precambrian microscopic life when cell structure and functions evolved.

(Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ)</ref> Molecular biologists, using [[phylogenetics]], can compare protein [[amino acid]] or [[nucleotide]] sequence homology (i.e., similarity) to evaluate taxonomy and evolutionary distances among organisms, with limited statistical confidence. The study of fossils, on the other hand, can more specifically pinpoint when and in what organism a mutation first appeared. Phylogenetics and paleontology work together in the clarification of science's still dim view of the appearance of life and its evolution.<ref>Paul CRC and Donovan SK, (1998) An overview of the completeness of the fossil record. in The Adequacy of the Fossil Record (Paul CRC and Donovan SK eds). 111\u2013131 (John Wiley, New York).</ref>\n\n[[File:Eldredgeops-rana-crassituberculata.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Phacopid]] [[trilobite]] ''Eldredgeops rana crassituberculata''.

Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 2000.</ref> Eldredge's interpretation of the ''Phacops'' fossil record was that the aftermaths of the lens changes, but not the rapidly occurring evolutionary process, were fossilized. This and other data led [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to publish their seminal paper on [[punctuated equilibrium]] in 1971.\n\n[[Synchrotron]] [[X-ray]] [[Tomography|tomographic]] analysis of early Cambrian bilaterian [[embryo]]nic microfossils yielded new insights of [[Animal|metazoan]] evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously unattainable three-dimensional resolution at the limits of fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the worm-like ''[[Markuelia]]'' and a putative, primitive [[protostome]], ''[[Pseudooides]]'', provide a peek at [[germ layer]] embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of [[arthropod]] development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from [[China]] and [[Siberia]] underwent rapid [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests ''Markuelia'' has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of [[Priapulida]], [[Nematode|Nematoda]] and [[Arthropod]]a.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Donoghue | first1 = PCJ | last2 = Bengtson | first2 = S | last3 = Dong | first3 = X | last4 = Gostling | first4 = NJ | last5 = Huldtgren | first5 = T | last6 = Cunningham | first6 = JA | last7 = Yin | first7 = C | last8 = Yue | first8 = Z | last9 = Peng | first9 = F ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy of fossil embryos | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7103| pages = 680\u2013683 | doi=10.1038/nature04890| pmid = 16900198 | displayauthors = etal | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..680D }}</ref>\n\n==Trading and collecting==\n\n{{Main article|Fossil trading|Fossil collecting}}\n\n''Fossil trading'' is the practice of buying and selling fossils.

With several exceptions, schools must have a student's consent prior to the disclosure of [[Privacy in education|education records]] ''after that student is 18 years old''. The law applies only to educational agencies and institutions that receive funding under a program administered by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]].\n\nOther regulations under this act, effective starting January 3, 2012, allow for greater disclosures of personal and directory student identifying information and regulate student IDs and e-mail addresses.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mendelsohn|first=Stephen A.|title=U.S. Department of Education Amends its FERPA Regulations to Allow for Certain Additional Student Disclosures|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-department-education-amends-its-ferpa-regulations-to-allow-certain-additional-student-dis|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=2 January 2012}}</ref> For example, schools may provide external companies with a student's personally identifiable information without the student's consent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mendelsohn|first=Stephen A.|title=U.S. Department of Education Amends its FERPA Regulations to Allow for Certain Additional Student Disclosures|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-department-education-amends-its-ferpa-regulations-to-allow-certain-additional-student-dis|accessdate=9 March 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=2 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nExamples of situations affected by FERPA include school employees divulging information to anyone other than the student about the student's grades or behavior, and school work posted on a bulletin board with a grade. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record.\n\nThis privacy policy also governs how state agencies transmit testing data to federal agencies. For example, see [[Education Data Network]].\n\nThis U.S. federal law also gave students 18 years of age or older, or students of any age if enrolled in any post-secondary educational institution, the right of privacy regarding grades, enrollment, and even billing information unless the school has specific permission from the student to share that specific type of information.\n\nFERPA also permits a school to disclose [[personally identifiable information]] from education records of an \"eligible student\" (a student age 18 or older or enrolled in a postsecondary institution at any age) to his or her parents if the student is a \"dependent student\" as that term is defined in Section 152 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]]. Generally, if either parent has claimed the student as a dependent on the parent's most recent income tax statement, the school may non-consensually disclose the student's education records to both parents.<ref>FERPA General Guidance for Parents, U.S. Department of Education, http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/parents.html</ref>\n\nThe law allowed students who apply to an educational institution such as [[graduate school]] permission to view recommendations submitted by others as part of the application. However, on standard application forms, students are given the option to waive this right.\n\nFERPA specifically excluded employees of an educational institution if they are not students.\n\nThe act is also referred to as the ''Buckley Amendment'', for one of its proponents, Senator [[James L. Buckley]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\n==Access to public records==\nThe citing of FERPA to conceal public records that are not \"educational\" in nature has been widely criticized, including by the act's primary Senate sponsor.<ref>Jill Riepenhoff & Todd Jones, \"Secrecy 101,\" The Columbus Dispatch, Dec. 17, 2010, http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2010/10/14/secrecy-redirect.html</ref> For example, in the Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo case, an important part of the debate was determining the relationship between peer-grading and \"education records\" as defined in FERPA. In the Court of Appeals, it was ruled that students placing grades on the work of other students made such work into an \"education record.\" Thus, peer-grading was determined as a violation of FERPA privacy policies because students had access to other students' academic performance without full consent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dinger|first=Daniel|date=|title=Johnny saw my test score, so I'm suing my teacher: Falvo v.

These three stages are encoding, storage and retrieval.<ref name=\"role of forgetting\" /> Many different factors influence the actual process of forgetting. An example of one of these factors could be the amount of time the new information is stored in the memory. Events involved with forgetting can happen either before or after the actual memory process. The amount of time the information is stored in the memory, depending on the minutes hours or even days, can increase or decrease depending on how well the information is encoded.<ref name=\"impairing forgetting\">{{cite journal|author1=Sangha, S.|author2=Scheibenstock, A.|author3=Martens, K.|author4=Varshney, N.|author5=Cooke, R.|author6=Lukowiak, K.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2005|title=Impairing forgetting by preventing new learning and memory|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=119|issue=3|pages=787\u2013796|pmid=15998200|url=http://www.niu.edu/user/tj0dgw1/pdf/learning/lukowiak%202005.pdf|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.119.3.787}}</ref>\nStudies show that retention improves with increased rehearsal.

Staying active is important because overall it keeps the body healthy. When the body is healthy the brain is healthy and less inflamed as well.<ref name=\"cardio\" /> Older adults who were more active were found to have had less episodes of forgetting compared to those older adults who were less active. A healthy diet can also contribute to a healthier brain and aging process which in turn results in less frequent forgetting.<ref name=\"cardio\" /> Reviewing information in ways that involve active retrieval seems to slow the rate of forgetting. Paul Connerton stated that there are seven types of forgetting, which are repressive erasure, prescriptive forgetting, formation of new identity, structural amnesia, annulment, planned obsolescence, and humiliated silence.<ref>Paul Connerton. (2008) \"Seven Types of Forgetting\". pp. 59\u201371</ref>\n\n==History==\nOne of the first to study the mechanisms of forgetting was the German psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] (1885). Using himself as the sole subject in his experiment, he memorized lists of three letter nonsense syllable words&mdash;two consonants and one vowel in the middle.  He then measured his own capacity to relearn a given list of words after a variety of given time period. He found that forgetting occurs in a systematic manner, beginning rapidly and then leveling off. Although his methods were primitive, his basic premises have held true today and have been reaffirmed by more methodologically sound methods.<ref>Murre J.M.J., Dros J. (2015) \"Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus\u2019 Forgetting Curve\". ''[[PLOS ONE]] 10(7): e0120644''. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120644 doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120644]</ref>  The Ebbinghaus ''forgetting curve'' is the name of his results which he plotted out and made 2 conclusions.  The first being that much of what we forget is lost soon after it is originally learned.  The second being that the amount of forgetting eventually levels off.<ref>Hockenbury, Sandra. (2010)</ref>\n\nAround the same time,{{when|date=May 2016}} psychologist Sigmund Freud theorized that people intentionally forgot things in order to push bad thoughts and feelings deep into their unconscious, a process he called \"[[Psychological repression|repression]]\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Memory: Forgetting|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/memory/section3.rhtml|publisher=Spark Notes|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\nThere is debate as to whether (or how often) memory repression really occurs<ref name=McNally2004>{{cite journal | author = McNally, R.J. | year = 2004 | title = The Science and Folklore of Traumatic Amnesia | journal = Clinical Psychology Science and Practice | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 29\u201333 | doi = 10.1093/clipsy/bph056}}</ref> and mainstream psychology holds that true memory repression occurs only very rarely.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.caic.org.au/fms-sra/rmt.htm\n|title=Repressed Memories and Recovered Memory Therapy\n|publisher=Jan Groenveld\n|accessdate=<!--November 2008-->\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nModern terminology divides [[motivated forgetting]] into unconscious repression (which is disputed) and conscious [[thought suppression]].  [[Psychogenic amnesia]] is another controversial diagnosis of retrograde amnesia without physical injury to the brain.\n\n==Measurements==\nThe four ways forgetting can be measured are as follows:\n\n===Free recall===\nFree recall is a basic paradigm used to study human memory. In a free recall task, a subject is presented a list of to-be-remembered items, one at a time. For example, an experimenter might read a list of 20 words aloud, presenting a new word to the subject every 4 seconds. At the end of the presentation of the list, the subject is asked to recall the items (e.g., by writing down as many items from the list as possible). It is called a free recall task because the subject is free to recall the items in any order that he or she desires.\n\n===Prompted (cued) recall===\nPrompted recall is a slight variation of free recall that consists of presenting hints or prompts to increase the likelihood that the behavior will be produced.  Usually these prompts are stimuli that were not there during the training period. Thus in order to measure the degree of forgetting, one can see how many prompts the subject misses or the number of prompts required to produce the behavior.<ref name=learningandbehavior>{{cite book|last=Chance|first=Paul|title=Learning and behavior|date=2014|publisher=Jon-David Hague|isbn=1-111-83277-3|pages=346\u2013371|edition=Seventh}}</ref>\n\n===Relearning method===\nThis method measures forgetting by the amount of training required to reach the previous level of performance.  German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885) used this method on himself.  He memorized lists of nonsensical syllables until he could repeat the list two times without error.  After a certain interval, he relearned the list and saw how long it would take him to do this task.  If it took fewer times, then there had been less forgetting.  His experiment was one of the first to study forgetting.<ref name=learningandbehavior />\n\n===Recognition===\n{{see also|Recall (memory)}}\nFor this type of measurement, a participant has to [[recall (memory)|identify material that was previously learned]].  The participant is asked to remember a list of material. Later on they are shown the same list of material with additional information and they are asked to identify the material that was on the original list. The more they recognize, the less information is forgotten.<ref name=learningandbehavior />\n\n==Theories==\nThe four main theories of forgetting apparent in the study of psychology are as follows:\n\n=== Cue-dependent forgetting ===\n\n[[Cue-dependent forgetting]] (also, [[context-dependent memory|context-dependent forgetting]]) or retrieval failure, is the failure to recall a [[memory]] due to missing [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] or cues that were present at the time the memory was [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]]. Encoding is the first step in creating and remembering a memory. How well something has been encoded in the memory can be measured by completing specific tests of retrieval. Examples of these tests would be explicit ones like cued recall or implicit tests like word fragment completion.<ref name=\"memory encoding\">Craik, F. M., & Rose, N. S. (2011). Memory encoding and aging: A neurocognitive perspective. Neuroscience And Biobehavioral Reviews</ref> Cue-dependent forgetting is one of five [[cognitive psychology]] theories of forgetting. This theory states that a memory is sometimes temporarily forgotten purely because it cannot be retrieved, but the proper cue can bring it to mind. A good [[metaphor]] for this is searching for a book in a library without the [[Library of Congress Classification|reference number]], title, author or even subject. The information still exists, but without these cues retrieval is unlikely. Furthermore, a good [[Information retrieval|retrieval]] cue must be consistent with the original encoding of the information. If the sound of the word is [[Emphatic consonant|emphasized]] during the encoding process, the cue that should be used should also put emphasis on the [[phonetic]] quality of the word. Information is available however, just not readily available without these cues. Depending on the age of a person, retrieval cues and skills may not work as well. This is usually common in older adults but that is not always the case. When information is encoded into the memory and retrieved with a technique called [[spaced retrieval]], this helps older adults retrieve the events stored in the memory better.<ref name=\"role of forgetting\" /> There is also evidence from different studies that show age related changes in memory.<ref name=\"memory encoding\" /> These specific studies have shown that episodic memory performance does in fact decline with age and have made known that older adults produce vivid rates of forgetting when two items are combined and not encoded.<ref name=\"role of forgetting\" />\n\n=== Organic causes ===\nForgetting that occurs through physiological damage or dilapidation to the brain are referred to as organic causes of forgetting. These theories encompass the loss of information already retained in [[long-term memory]] or the inability to encode new information again. Examples include [[Alzheimer's]], [[amnesia]], [[dementia]], consolidation theory and the gradual slowing down of the central nervous system due to [[Memory and aging|aging]].\n\n=== Interference theories and that ===\n[[Interference theory]] refers to the idea that when the learning of something new causes forgetting of older material on the basis of competition between the two. This essentially states that memory's information may become confused or combined with other information during encoding, resulting in the distortion or disruption of memories.<ref name=simply />  In nature, the interfering items are said to originate from an overstimulating environment. Interference theory exists in three branches: '''Proactive, Retroactive and Output'''. Retroactive and Proactive inhibition each referring in contrast to the other. Retroactive interference is when new information (memories) interferes with older information. On the other hand, proactive interference is when old information interferes with the retrieval of new information.<ref>Underwood, B.J. (1957). 'Interference and forgetting' in Psychological Review</ref> This is sometimes thought to occur especially when memories are similar.  Output Interference occurs when the initial act of recalling specific information interferes with the retrieval of the original information. This theory shows an astonishing contradiction: an extremely intelligent individual is expected to forget more hastily than one who has a slow mentality. For this reason, an intelligent individual has stored up more memory in his mind which will cause interferences and impair their ability to recall specific information.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc=1922558|year=1964|title=Forgetting|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=90|issue=13|pages=794|pmid=20327804}}</ref>  Based off current research, testing interference has only been carried out by recalling from a list of words rather than using situation from daily lives, thus it's hard to generalize the findings for this theory.<ref name=simply />\n\n=== Trace decay theory ===\nDecay theory states that when something new is learned, a neurochemical, physical \"memory trace\" is formed in the brain and over time this trace tends to disintegrate, unless it is occasionally used. Decay theory states the reason we eventually forget something or an event is because the memory of it fades with time. If we do not attempt to look back at an event, the greater the interval time between the time when the event from happening and the time when we try to remember, the memory will start to fade. Time is the greatest impact in remembering an event.<ref>{{cite web|title=The  Decay Theory of Forgetting|url=http://www.psychologyandsociety.com/Decaytheory.html}}</ref>\n\nTrace decay theory explains memories that are stored in both short-term and long-term memory system, and assumes that the memories leave a trace in the brain.<ref name=simply>{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Forgetting|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/forgetting.html|publisher=Simply Psychology|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>  According to this theory, short-term memory (STM) can only retain information for a limited amount of time, around 15 to 30 seconds unless it is rehearsed. If it is not rehearsed, the information will start to gradually fade away and decay. Donald Hebb proposed that incoming information causes a series of neurons to create a neurological memory trace in the brain which would result in change in the morphological and/or chemical changes in the brain and would fade with time.  Repeated firing causes a structural change in the synapses. Rehearsal of repeated firing maintains the memory in STM until a structural change is made. Therefore, forgetting happens as a result of automatic decay of the memory trace in brain. This theory states that the events between learning and recall have no effects on recall; the important factor that affects is the duration that the information has been retained. Hence, as longer time passes more of traces are subject to decay and as a result the information is forgotten.\n\nOne major problem about this theory is that in real-life situation, the time between encoding a piece of information and recalling it, is going to be filled with all different kinds of events that might happen to the individual. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that forgetting is a result of only the time duration. It is also important to consider the effectiveness of this theory.  Although it seems very plausible, it is about impossible to test.  It is difficult to create a situation where there is a blank period of time between presenting the material and recalling it later.<ref name=simply />\n\nThis theory is supposedly contradicted by the fact that one is able to ride a bike even after not having done so for decades. \"[[Flashbulb memories]]\" are another piece of seemingly contradicting evidence. It is believed that certain memories \"trace decay\" while others don't.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Sleep is believed to play a key role in halting trace decay,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} although the exact mechanism of this is unknown.\n\n==Impairments and lack of forgetting==\n{{main|Memory disorder}}\nForgetting can have very different causes than simply removal of stored content. Forgetting can mean access problems, availability problems, or can have other reasons such as [[amnesia]] caused by an accident.\n\nAn inability to forget can cause distress, as with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and [[hyperthymesia]] (in which people have an extremely detailed [[autobiographical memory]]).\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Amnesia]]\n* [[Cue-dependent forgetting]]\n* [[Experience curve effects]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Hyperthymesia]]\n* [[Language attrition]]\n* [[Lotus tree]]\n* [[Memory]]\n* [[Pseudodementia]]\n* [[Repressed memory]]\n* [[Tip of the tongue]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation\n | last = Wixted\n | first = J.\n | contribution = The psychology and neuroscience of forgetting.\n | year = 2004\n | title = Annual Review of Psychology\n | volume = 55\n | pages = 235\u2013269\n |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://psy.ucsd.edu/~jwixted/Reprints/AnnualReview.pdf}}\n* McLeod, S.

Through an acting career that spanned nearly six decades, Wray attained international recognition as an actress in horror films. She has been dubbed one of the first \"[[scream queen]]s\".\n\nAfter appearing in minor film roles, Wray gained media attention after being selected as one of the \"[[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]\" in 1926. This led to her being contracted to [[Paramount Pictures]] as a teenager, where she made more than a dozen feature films. After leaving Paramount, she signed deals with various film companies, being cast in her first horror film roles, in addition to many other types of roles, including in ''[[The Bowery (1933 film)|The Bowery]]'' (1933) and ''[[Viva Villa]]'' (1934), both of which starred [[Wallace Beery]]. For [[RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.]], she starred in the film for which she is most identified, ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). After the success of ''King Kong'', Wray made numerous appearances in both film and television, before retiring in 1980.\n\n==Early life==\nWray was born on a ranch near [[Cardston, Alberta|Cardston]] in the province of [[Alberta]], Canada, to Mormon parents, Elvina Marguerite Jones, who was from [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], and Joseph Heber Wray, who was from [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[England]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/wrayf.html|title=Ancestry of Fay Wray|publisher=Wargs.com|accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref> She was one of six children<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northernstars.ca/actorsvz/wray_fay_bio.html|title=Fay Wray - Northern Stars|publisher=Northernstars.ca|accessdate=2011-03-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611015949/http://www.northernstars.ca/actorsvz/wray_fay_bio.html|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}</ref> and was a granddaughter of [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel Webster Jones]].

In 1919, the Wray family returned to Salt Lake City, and then relocated to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], where Fay attended [[Hollywood High School]].\n\n==Early acting career==\n[[File:Fay Wray Stars of the Photoplay.jpg|thumb|upright|Wray publicity shot from 1930]]\nIn 1923, Wray appeared in her first film at the age of 16, when she landed a role in a short historical film sponsored by a local newspaper.<ref>SL Tribune, 26 January 2009</ref> In the 1920s, Wray landed a major role in the silent film ''The Coast Patrol'' (1925), as well as uncredited bit parts at the [[Hal Roach Studios]].\n\nIn 1926, the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers selected Wray as one of the \"[[WAMPAS Baby Stars]]\", a group of women whom they believed to be on the threshold of movie stardom. She was at the time under contract to [[Universal Studios]], mostly co-starring in low-budget [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] opposite [[Buck Jones]].\n\nThe following year, Wray was signed to a contract with [[Paramount Pictures]]. In 1926, director [[Erich von Stroheim]] cast her as the main female lead in his film ''[[The Wedding March (1928 film)|The Wedding March]]'', released by Paramount two years later. While the film was noted for its high budget and production values, it was a financial failure, but gave Wray her first lead role.

Today, we approximate forgetting with an exponential curve<ref>Wo\u017aniak Piotr A., Gorzela\u0144czyk Edward J. \nand Murakowski Janusz A. (1995) \"Two components of long-term memory.\".

Pubmed ID (PMID): [http://www.ane.pl/pdf/5535.pdf 8713361]</ref>:\n\n:<math>R = e^{-\\frac{t}{S}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>R</math> is retrievability (a measure of how easy it is to retrieve a piece of information from memory), <math>S</math> is stability of memory (determines how fast <math>R</math> falls over time in the absence of training, testing or other recall), and <math>t</math> is time.\n\nHermann Ebbinghaus ran a limited, incomplete study on himself and published his hypothesis in 1885 as ''{{lang|de|\u00dcber das Ged\u00e4chtnis}}'' (later translated into English as ''Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology''). Ebbinghaus studied the memorisation of nonsense syllables, such as \"WID\" and \"ZOF\" (CVCs or Consonant-Vowel-Consonant) by repeatedly testing himself after various time periods and recording the results. He plotted these results on a graph creating what is now known as the \"forgetting curve\". From his discovery regarding the \"forgetting curve\", Ebbinghaus came up with the effects of \"overlearning\". Essentially, if you practiced something more than what is usually necessary to memorize it, you would have effectively achieved overlearning. Overlearning ensures that information is more impervious to being lost or forgotten, and the forgetting curve for this overlearned material is shallower.<ref>\"Human Memory. Herman Ebbinghaus\".  [http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/Ebbinghaus.html Lecture notes in Psychology published at Dr. Bruce Abbott's homepage at IPFW]</ref>\n\nIn 2015, an attempt to replicate the forgetting curve with one study subject has shown the experimental results similar to Ebbinghaus' original data.<ref>Murre J.M.J., Dros J. (2015) \"Replication and Analysis of Ebbinghaus\u2019 Forgetting Curve\". ''[[PLOS ONE]] 10(7): e0120644''.

He further hypothesized that the basal forgetting rate differs little between individuals.  He concluded that the difference in performance (e.g. at school) can be explained by mnemonic representation skills.\n\nHe went on to hypothesize that basic training in mnemonic techniques can help overcome those differences in part. He asserted that the best methods for increasing the strength of memory are:\n# better memory representation (e.g. with [[mnemonic]] techniques)\n# repetition based on [[active recall]] (especially [[spaced repetition]]).\nHis premise was that each repetition in learning increases the optimum interval before the next repetition is needed (for near-perfect retention, initial repetitions may need to be made within days, but later they can be made after years).

A CPLD has a somewhat restrictive structure consisting of one or more programmable sum-of-products logic arrays feeding a relatively small number of clocked registers. The result of this is less flexibility, with the advantage of more predictable timing delays and a higher logic-to-interconnect ratio. The FPGA architectures, on the other hand, are dominated by interconnect. This makes them far more flexible (in terms of the range of designs that are practical for implementation within them) but also far more complex to design for.\n\nIn practice, the distinction between FPGAs and CPLDs is often one of size as FPGAs are usually much larger in terms of resources than CPLDs.  Typically only FPGAs contain more complex [[Functional unit|embedded functions]] such as [[Adder (electronics)|adders]], [[Binary multiplier|multipliers]], [[Computer memory|memory]], and [[SerDes|serializer/deserializers]].  Another common distinction is that CPLDs contain embedded [[flash memory]] to store their configuration while FPGAs usually, but not always, require external [[non-volatile memory]].\n\nWhen a design requires simple [[glue logic]] or similar functionality to existing [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]] without much need for changes, or when you need an instant-on circuit, CPLDs are generally preferred. For most other applications FPGAs are generally preferred. Sometimes both CPLDs and FPGAs are used in a single system design. In those designs, CPLDs generally perform glue logic functions as mentioned before and are responsible for \u201c[[booting]]\u201d the FPGA as well as controlling [[Reset (computing)|reset]] and boot sequence of the complete board. Therefore, depending on the application it may be judicious to use both FPGAs and CPLDs in a single design.<ref>https://numato.com/kb/cpld-vs-fpga-differences-one-use/</ref>\n\n=== Security considerations ===\nWith respect to [[Hardware security|security]], FPGAs have both advantages and disadvantages as compared to ASICs or secure microprocessors.  FPGAs' flexibility makes malicious modifications during [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication]] a lower risk.<ref name=\"paper\">Huffmire Paper \"[http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MDT.2008.166 Managing Security in FPGA-Based Embedded Systems].\" Nov-Dec 2008. Retrieved Sept 22, 2009</ref>  Previously, for many FPGAs, the design [[bitstream]] was exposed while the FPGA loads it from external memory (typically on every power-on).  All major FPGA vendors now offer a spectrum of security solutions to designers such as bitstream [[encryption]] and [[authentication]]. For example, [[Altera]] and [[Xilinx]] offer [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] (up to 256 bit) encryption for bitstreams stored in an external flash memory.\n\nFPGAs that store their configuration internally in nonvolatile flash memory, such as [[Microsemi]]'s ProAsic 3 or [[Lattice Semiconductor|Lattice]]'s XP2 programmable devices, do not expose the bitstream and do not need [[encryption]].

Generally, all the routing channels have the same width (number of wires). Multiple I/O pads may fit into the height of one row or the width of one column in the array.\n\nAn application circuit must be mapped into an FPGA with adequate resources.  While the number of CLBs/LABs and I/Os required is easily determined from the design, the number of routing tracks needed may vary considerably even among designs with the same amount of logic.  For example, a [[crossbar switch]] requires much more routing than a [[systolic array]] with the same gate count.  Since unused routing tracks increase the cost (and decrease the performance) of the part without providing any benefit, FPGA manufacturers try to provide just enough tracks so that most designs that will fit in terms of [[Lookup table#Hardware LUTs|lookup tables]] (LUTs) and I/Os can be routed.  This is determined by estimates such as those derived from [[Rent's rule]] or by experiments with existing designs.  {{As of|2018}}, [[Network on a chip|network-on-chip]] architectures for routing and interconnection are being developed.\n\nIn general, a logic block consists of a few logical cells (called ALM, LE, slice etc.). A typical cell consists of a 4-input LUT{{Clarify timeframe|date=June 2016}}, a [[Adder (electronics)|full adder]] (FA) and a [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip-flop]], as shown above. The LUTs are in this figure split into two 3-input LUTs. In ''normal mode'' those are combined into a 4-input LUT through the left [[multiplexer]] (mux). In ''arithmetic'' mode, their outputs are fed to the adder. The selection of mode is programmed into the middle multiplexer. The output can be either synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the programming of the mux to the right, in the figure example. In practice, entire or parts of the adder are [[Shannon expansion|stored as functions]] into the LUTs in order to save [[Circuit utilization|space]].<ref>http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/cyc2/cyc2_cii51002.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altera.com/literature/hb/stratix-iv/stx4_5v1_01.pdf |title=Documentation: Stratix IV Devices |publisher=Altera.com |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2013-05-01}}</ref><ref>http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug070.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Hard blocks ===\nModern FPGA families expand upon the above capabilities to include higher level functionality fixed into the silicon. Having these common functions embedded into the silicon reduces the area required and gives those functions increased speed compared to building them from primitives. Examples of these include multipliers, generic DSP blocks, embedded processors, high speed I/O logic and embedded memories.\n\nHigher-end FPGAs can contain high speed [[multi-gigabit transceiver]]s and ''hard IP cores'' such as processor cores, [[Ethernet]] [[Medium access control|MACs]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]]/[[PCI Express]] controllers, and external memory controllers.  These cores exist alongside the programmable fabric, but they are built out of [[Transistor|transistors]] instead of LUTs so they have ASIC-level [[Computer performance|performance]] and [[Electric energy consumption|power consumption]] without consuming a significant amount of fabric resources, leaving more of the fabric free for the application-specific logic.  The multi-gigabit transceivers also contain high performance analog input and output circuitry along with high-speed serializers and deserializers, components which cannot be built out of LUTs.  Higher-level PHY{{Define?|date=October 2018}} layer functionality such as [[line code|line coding]] may or may not be implemented alongside the serializers and deserializers in hard logic, depending on the FPGA.\n\n=== Clocking ===\nMost of the circuitry built inside of an FPGA is synchronous circuitry that requires a clock signal.  FPGAs contain dedicated global and regional routing networks for clock and reset so they can be delivered with minimal [[Clock skew|skew]].  Also, FPGAs generally contain analog [[Phase-locked loop|PLL]] and/or [[Delay-locked loop|DLL]] components to synthesize new clock frequencies as well as attenuate [[jitter]].  Complex designs can use multiple clocks with different frequency and phase relationships, each forming separate clock domains.  These clock signals can be generated locally by an oscillator or they can be recovered from a high speed serial data stream.  Care must be taken when building [[clock domain crossing]] circuitry to avoid [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]].  FPGAs generally contain block RAMs that are capable of working as dual port RAMs with different clocks, aiding in the construction of building FIFOs and dual port buffers that connect differing clock domains.\n\n=== 3D architectures ===\nTo shrink the size and power consumption of FPGAs, vendors such as [[Tabula (company)|Tabula]] and [[Xilinx]] have introduced [[three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D or stacked architectures]].<ref>Dean Takahashi, VentureBeat. \"[https://venturebeat.com/2011/05/02/intel-connection-helped-chip-startup-tabula-raise-108m Intel connection helped chip startup Tabula raise $108M].\" May 2, 2011.

Retrieved May 12, 2011.</ref>  The multi-die construction also allows different parts of the FPGA to be created with different process technologies, as the process requirements are different between the FPGA fabric itself and the very high speed 28 Gbit/s serial transceivers.  An FPGA built in this way is called a ''[[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] FPGA''.<ref>http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp380_Stacked_Silicon_Interconnect_Technology.pdf</ref>\n\nAltera's heterogeneous approach involves using a single monolithic FPGA die and connecting other die/technologies to the FPGA using Intel's embedded multi-die interconnect bridge (EMIB) technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/foundry/emib.html|title=Intel Custom Foundry EMIB|work=Intel}}</ref>\n\n== Design and programming ==\n{{See|Logic synthesis|Verification and validation|Place and route}}\nTo define the behavior of the FPGA, the user provides a design in a [[hardware description language]] (HDL) or as a [[schematic]] design.  The HDL form is more suited to work with large structures because it's possible to specify high-level functional behavior rather than drawing every piece by hand. However, schematic entry can allow for easier visualization of a design.\n\nUsing an [[electronic design automation]] tool, a technology-mapped [[netlist]] is generated. The netlist can then be fit to the actual FPGA architecture using a process called [[Place and route|place-and-route]], usually performed by the FPGA company's proprietary place-and-route software. The user will validate the map, place and route results via [[timing analysis]], [[simulation]], and other [[verification and validation]] methodologies. Once the design and validation process is complete, the binary file generated, typically using the FPGA vendor's proprietary software, is used to (re-)configure the FPGA. This file is transferred to the FPGA/CPLD via a [[Serial communication|serial interface]] ([[Joint Test Action Group|JTAG]]) or to an external memory device like an [[EEPROM]].\n\nThe most common HDLs are [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]] as well as extensions such as [[SystemVerilog]]. However, in an attempt to reduce the complexity of designing in HDLs, which have been compared to the equivalent of [[assembly language]]s, there are moves{{by whom|date=July 2015}} to raise the abstraction level through the introduction of [[Hardware description language#HDL and programming languages|alternative languages]].{{When|date=October 2018}}  [[National Instruments]]' [[LabVIEW]] graphical programming language (sometimes referred to as \"G\") has an FPGA add-in module available to target and program FPGA hardware.\n\nTo simplify the design of complex systems in FPGAs, there exist libraries of predefined complex functions and circuits that have been tested and optimized to speed up the design process. These predefined circuits are commonly called ''[[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]]'', and are available from FPGA vendors and third-party IP suppliers (rarely free, and typically released under proprietary licenses).  Other predefined circuits are available from developer communities such as [[OpenCores]] (typically released under [[Free and open-source software|free and open source]] licenses such as the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], [[BSD license|BSD]] or similar license), and other sources.  Such designs are known as \"[[open-source hardware]].\"\n\nIn a typical [[Design flow (EDA)|design flow]], an FPGA application developer will simulate the design at multiple stages throughout the design process. Initially the [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] description in [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]] is simulated by creating [[Test bench|test benches]] to simulate the system and observe results. Then, after the [[Logic synthesis|synthesis]] engine has mapped the design to a netlist, the netlist is translated to a [[Logic gate|gate-level]] description where simulation is repeated to confirm the synthesis proceeded without errors. Finally the design is laid out in the FPGA at which point [[Propagation delay|propagation delays]] can be added and the simulation run again with these values [[Back annotation|back-annotated]] onto the netlist.\n\nMore recently, [[OpenCL]] (Open Computing Language) is being used by programmers to take advantage of the performance and power efficiencies that FPGAs provide.  OpenCL allows programmers to develop code in the C programming language and target FPGA functions as OpenCL kernels using OpenCL constructs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://streamcomputing.eu/blog/2014-09-16/use-opencl-fpgas/|title=Why use OpenCL on FPGAs?|work=StreamComputing}}</ref> For further information, see [[high-level synthesis]] and [[C to HDL]].\n\n== Basic process technology types ==\n*[[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] \u2013 based on static memory technology.

Study subjects are shielded from all time cues, often by a constant light [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]], by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light/dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light. Also, limited amounts of food may be made available at short intervals so as to avoid entrainment to mealtimes. Subjects are thus forced to live by their internal circadian \"clocks\".\n\n==Background==\nThe individual's or animal's circadian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circadian system, the internal \"body clock\". The researcher can precisely determine, for example, the daily cycles of [[gene]]-activity, [[body temperature]], [[blood pressure]], [[hormone]] secretion and/or [[sleep]] and activity/[[alertness]]. Alertness in humans can be determined by many kinds of verbal and non-verbal tests; activity in animals by observation, for example of wheel-running in [[rodent]]s.\n\nWhen animals or people ''free-run'', experiments can be done to see what sort of signals, known as [[zeitgeber]]s, are effective in entrainment. Also, much work has been done to see how long or short a circadian cycle to which different organisms can be entrained. For example, some animals can be entrained to a 22-hour day, but they can not be entrained to a 20-hour day. In recent studies funded by the U.S. space industry, it has been shown that most humans can be entrained to a 23.5-hour day and to a 24.65-hour day.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Scheer |first=Frank A.J.L. |author2=Kenneth P.

Depictions of Fenrir have been identified on various objects, and scholarly theories have been proposed regarding Fenrir's relation to other canine beings in Norse mythology.

High says that one example of T\u00fdr's bravery is that when the [[\u00c6sir]] were luring Fenrir (referred to here as ''Fenris\u00falfr'') to place the fetter [[Gleipnir]] on the wolf, T\u00fdr placed his hand within the wolf's mouth as a pledge. This was done at Fenrir's own request because he did not trust that the \u00c6sir would let him go. As a result, when the \u00c6sir refused to release him, he bit off T\u00fdr's hand at a location \"now called the wolf-joint\" (the [[wrist]]), causing T\u00fdr to be one-handed and \"not considered to be a promoter of settlements between people.\"<ref name=FAULKES25>Faulkes (1995:25).</ref>\n\n====''Gylfaginning'' chapter 34====\nIn chapter 34, High describes Loki, and says that Loki had three children with a female named [[Angrbo\u00f0a]] located in the land of [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; Fenris\u00falfr, the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. High continues that, once the gods found that these three children were being brought up in the land of [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], and when the gods \"traced prophecies that from these siblings great mischief and disaster would arise for them\" the gods expected a lot of trouble from the three children, partially due to the nature of the mother of the children, yet worse so due to the nature of their father.<ref name=\"FAULKES26-27\">Faulkes (1995:26\u201327).</ref>\n\nHigh says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him. Upon their arrival, Odin threw J\u00f6rmungandr into \"that deep sea that lies round all lands\", and then threw Hel into [[Niflheim]], and bestowed upon her authority over [[Norse cosmology|nine worlds]]. However, the \u00c6sir brought up the wolf \"at home\", and only T\u00fdr had the courage to approach Fenrir, and give Fenrir food. The gods noticed that Fenrir was growing rapidly every day, and since all prophecies foretold that Fenrir was destined to cause them harm, the gods formed a plan. The gods prepared [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|three]] [[fetter]]s: The first, greatly strong, was called Leyding. They brought Leyding to Fenrir and suggested that the wolf try his strength with it. Fenrir judged that it was not beyond his strength, and so let the gods do what they wanted with it. At Fenrir's first kick the bind snapped, and Fenrir loosened himself from Leyding. The gods made a second fetter, twice as strong, and named it Dromi. The gods asked Fenrir to try the new fetter, and that should he break this feat of engineering, Fenrir would achieve great fame for his strength. Fenrir considered that the fetter was very strong, yet also that his strength had grown since he broke Leyding, yet that he would have to take some risks if he were to become famous. Fenrir allowed them to place the fetter.<ref name=FAULKES27>Faulkes (1995:27).</ref>\n\nWhen the \u00c6sir exclaimed that they were ready, Fenrir shook himself, knocked the fetter to the ground, strained hard, and kicking with his feet, snapped the fetter \u2013 breaking it into pieces that flew far into the distance. High says that, as a result, to \"loose from Leyding\" or to \"strike out of Dromi\" have become sayings for when something is achieved with great effort. The \u00c6sir started to fear that they would not be able to bind Fenrir, and so Odin sent [[Freyr]]'s messenger [[Sk\u00edrnir]] down into the land of [[Svart\u00e1lfaheimr]] to \"some [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]]\" and had them make a fetter called [[Gleipnir]]. The dwarves constructed [[Gleipnir]] from six mythical ingredients. After an exchange between Gangleri and High, High continues that the fetter was smooth and soft as a silken ribbon, yet strong and firm. The messenger brought the ribbon to the \u00c6sir, and they thanked him heartily for completing the task.<ref name=FAULKES28>Faulkes (1995:28).</ref>\n\nThe \u00c6sir went out on to the lake [[Amsvartnir]] sent for Fenrir to accompany them, and continued to the island Lyngvi (Old Norse \"a place overgrown with [[Calluna|heather]]\").<ref name=SIMEK198>Simek (2007:198).</ref> The gods showed Fenrir the silken fetter [[Gleipnir]], told him to tear it, stated that it was much stronger than it appeared, passed it among themselves, used their hands to pull it, and yet it did not tear. However, they said that Fenrir would be able to tear it, to which Fenrir replied:\n[[Image:The binding of Fenrir by George Wright.jpg|thumb|\"The Binding of Fenrir\" (1908) by [[George Hand Wright|George Wright]]]]\n<blockquote>\n\"It looks to me that with this ribbon as though I will gain no fame from it if I do tear apart such a slender band, but if it is made with art and trickery, then even if it does look thin, this band is not going on my legs.\"<ref name=FAULKES28/>\n</blockquote>\nThe \u00c6sir said Fenrir would quickly tear apart a thin silken strip, noting that Fenrir earlier broke great iron binds, and added that if Fenrir wasn't able to break slender [[Gleipnir]] then Fenrir is nothing for the gods to fear, and as a result would be freed. Fenrir responded:\n<blockquote>\n\"If you bind me so that I am unable to release myself, then you will be standing by in such a way that I should have to wait a long time before I got any help from you. I am reluctant to have this band put on me. But rather than that you question my courage, let someone put his hand in my mouth as a pledge that this is done in good faith.\"<ref name=FAULKES28-29>Faulkes (1995:28\u201329).</ref>\n</blockquote>\nWith this statement, all of the \u00c6sir look to one another, finding themselves in a dilemma. Everyone refused to place their hand in Fenrir's mouth until T\u00fdr put out his right hand and placed it into the wolf's jaws. When Fenrir kicked, [[Gleipnir]] caught tightly, and the more Fenrir struggled, the stronger the band grew. At this, everyone laughed, except T\u00fdr, who there lost his right hand. When the gods knew that Fenrir was fully bound, they took a cord called Gelgja (Old Norse \"fetter\")<ref name=ORCHARD54>Orchard (1997:54).</ref> hanging from [[Gleipnir]], inserted the cord through a large stone slab called [[Gj\u00f6ll]] (Old Norse \"scream\"),<ref name=ORCHARD57>Orchard (1997:57).</ref> and the gods fastened the stone slab deep into the ground. After, the gods took a great rock called Thviti (Old Norse \"hitter, batterer\"),<ref name=SIMEK334>Simek (2007:334).</ref> and thrust it even further into the ground as an anchoring peg. Fenrir reacted violently; he opened his jaws very wide, and tried to bite the gods. \nThen the gods thrust a sword into his mouth. Its hilt touched the lower jaw and its point the upper one; by means of it the jaws of the wolf were spread apart and the wolf gagged.\nFenrir \"howled horribly,\" saliva ran from his mouth, and this saliva formed the river V\u00e1n (Old Norse \"hope\").<ref>Simek (2007:350)</ref> There Fenrir will lie until Ragnar\u00f6k. Gangleri comments that Loki created a \"pretty terrible family\" though important, and asks why the \u00c6sir did not just kill Fenrir there since they expected great malice from him. High replies that \"so greatly did the gods respect their [[V\u00e9 (shrine)|holy places]] and places of sanctuary that they did not want to defile them with the wolf's blood even though the prophecies say that he will be the death of Odin.\"<ref name=FAULKES29>Faulkes (1995:29).</ref>\n[[Image:Odin und Fenriswolf Freyr und Surt.jpg|thumb|\"Odin and Fenriswolf, [[Freyr]] and [[Surtr|Surt]]\" (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\n\n====''Gylfaginning'' chapters 38 and 51====\nIn chapter 38, High says that there are [[Einherjar|many men]] in [[Valhalla]], and many more who will arrive, yet they will \"seem too few when the wolf comes.\"<ref name=FAULKES32>Faulkes (1995:32).</ref> In chapter 51, High foretells that as part of the events of Ragnar\u00f6k, after Fenrir's son [[Sk\u00f6ll]] has swallowed the [[S\u00f3l (Sun)|sun]] and his other son [[Hati Hr\u00f3\u00f0vitnisson]] has swallowed the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]], the stars will disappear from the sky.

During the battle, Fenris\u00falfr will eventually swallow Odin, killing him, and Odin's son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] will move forward and kick one foot into the lower jaw of the wolf.

Because Loki was Odin's blood brother?\" Referring to the same chapter, Lindow comments that neither of the phrases that Fenrir's binding result in have left any other traces. Lindow compares Fenrir's role to his father Loki and Fenrir's sibling J\u00f6rmungandr, in that they all spend time with the gods, are bound or cast out by them, return \"at the end of the current mythic order to destroy them, only to be destroyed himself as a younger generation of gods, one of them his slayer, survives into the new world order.\"<ref name=LINDOW111-114>Lindow (2001:111\u2013114).</ref> He also points to Fenrir's binding as part of a recurring theme of the [[bound monster]], where an enemy of the gods is bound but destined to break free at Ragnarok.<ref name=LINDOW82-83>Lindow (2001:82-83).</ref>\n\n[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] parallels have been proposed between myths of Fenrir and the [[Persian mythology|Persian]] demon [[Ahriman]]. The [[Yasht]]s refer to a story where Taxma Urupi rode Angra Mainyu as a horse for thirty years. An elaboration of this allusion is found only in a late Parsi commentary. The ruler [[Taxmoruw]] (Taxma Urupi) managed to lasso Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) and keep him tied up while taking him for a ride three times a day. After thirty years Ahriman outwitted and swallowed Taxmoruw. In a sexual encounter with Ahriman, [[Jamshid]], Taxmoruw's brother, inserted his hand into Ahriman's anus and pulled out his brother's corpse. His hand withered from contact with the diabolic innards. The suggested parallels with Fenrir myths are the binding of an evil being by a ruler figure and the subsequent swallowing of the ruler figure by the evil being (Odin and Fenrir), trickery involving the thrusting of a hand into a monster's orifice and the affliction of the inserted limb (T\u00fdr and Fenrir).<ref>Puhvel (1988:118\u2013119).</ref>\n\nEthologist [[Valerius Geist]] wrote that Fenrir's maiming and ultimate killing of Odin, who had previously nurtured him, was likely based on true experiences of wolf-behaviour, seeing as wolves are genetically encoded to rise up the pack hierarchy and have on occasion been recorded to rebel against and kill their parents. Geist states that \"apparently, even the ancients knew that wolves may turn on their parents and siblings and kill them.\"<ref name=\"Geist1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.vargfakta.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Geist-when-do-wolves-become-dangerous-to-humans-pt-1.pdf\n| title=When do wolves become dangerous to humans? | date=2007-09-29 | accessdate= 2015-01-05 | format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Modern influence==\n{{see also|Norse mythology in popular culture}}\nFenrir has been depicted in the artwork \"Odin and Fenris\" (1909) and \"The Binding of Fenris\" (around 1900) by Dorothy Hardy, \"Odin und Fenriswolf\" and \"Fesselung des Fenriswolfe\" (1901) by [[Emil Doepler]], and is the subject of the metal sculpture \"Fenrir\" by [[Arne Vinje Gunnerud]] located on the island of [[Ask\u00f8y]], [[Norway]].<ref name=SIMEK81>Simek (2007:81).</ref>\n\nFenrir appears in modern literature in the poem \"Om Fenrisulven og Tyr\" (1819) by [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] (collected in ''Nordens Guder''), the novel ''Der Fenriswolf'' by K. H. Strobl, and ''Til kamp mod d\u00f8dbideriet'' (1974) by E. K. Reich and E.

The character is named \"Fenris Ulf\" in early American editions of the book, as well as in the [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film)|1979 animated adaptation]].\n\nFenrir was also the influence for [[Carcharoth]], an evil wolf serving Morgoth in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fantasy world of [[Middle-earth]].\n\nFenrir appears as a son of [[Loki]] in the [[Supernatural (season 13)|thirteenth season]] episode \"Unfinished Business\" of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' who sold the archangel [[Gabriel]] to the Prince of Hell [[Asmodeus]]. An enraged Gabriel tracks down Fenrir and after a battle, kills Fenrir with a specially-crafted wooden sword through the heart. However, Fenrir succeeds in injuring Gabriel in return as the archangel is in a weakened state due to his long captivity by the Prince of Hell Asmodeus. Fenrir was previously mentioned in [[Supernatural (season 9)|season 9]]'s \"Sharp Teeth\" under the alternate name of Fenris, an episode in which he was worshipped by a werewolf cult that wished Fenris to bring on Ragnarok so they could gain domination over humankind. The cult was wiped out by protagonist [[Dean Winchester]] after he discovered their plot.\n\n; In American comics\n* [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris Wolf]] is a [[Marvel Comics]] character, and also appears in the 2017 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' as a gigantic wolf.\n\n; In video games\n* Fenrir and Fenris appear as recurring enemies in the video game ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]''.\n* Fenrir is a playable character in the game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]'' by Hi-Rez Studios.\n* Fenryr, a wolf that's a reference to Fenrir, is a boss in the Norse-themed Halls of Valor dungeon added in the 2016 ''[[World_of_Warcraft:_Legion|Legion]]'' expansion to the 2004 MMORPG ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.\n* Fenrir is the name given to Cloud Strife's motorcycle in the Final Fantasy movie Advent Children.\n* Fenryr, a wolf that's a reference to Fenrir, is a summonable character in the MMORPG ''[[Final Fantasy 11]]'' and is also a server for the game.\n* Fenris is an elven warrior and former slave in [[Dragon Age II]], so named because his owner called him his \"little wolf\".\n* Fenrir is the name of the pet dog owned by Crymaria in the game [[Valkyria Chronicles 4]].\n* Fenrir is the name of a mercenary group in [[Danganronpa]]\n* The Fenrir is a Keychain for Sora's and Player's Keyblades that appears in [[Kingdom Hearts II]] and [[Kingdom Hearts Union \u03c7]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Crumlin-Pedersen, Ole & Thye, Birgitte Munch (eds.)

The franchise centers on a series of fantasy and [[science fantasy]] [[role-playing video game]]s (RPGs). The [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first game in the series]] was published in 1987; it was a success and spawned sequels. The series has since branched into other [[Video game genres|genres]] such as [[tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing]], [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer online role-playing]], [[racing video game|racing]], [[third-person shooter]], [[Fighting game|fighting]], and [[Rhythm game|rhythm]]. The franchise has also branched out into other media, including [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] films, [[anime]], [[manga]], and [[novel]]s.\n\n''Final Fantasy'' installments are generally stand-alone stories each with different settings, plots and main characters, however, as a corpus they feature identical elements that define the franchise. Recurring elements include plot thematics, character names, and [[game mechanics]]. Plots center on a group of heroes battling a great evil while exploring the characters' internal struggles and relationships. Character names are frequently derived from the history, languages, pop culture, and mythologies of cultures worldwide.\n\nThe series has been both commercially and critically successful, with more than {{Nowrap|142 million}} units sold worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]] of all time. The series is well known for its innovation, visuals, and music, such as the inclusion of [[full motion video]]s, [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]] character models, and music by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. ''Final Fantasy'' has been a driving force in the [[video game industry]], and the series has affected Square Enix's business practices and its relationships with other [[video game developer]]s. It has popularized many features now common in role-playing games, also popularizing the genre as a whole in markets outside Japan.\n\n== Media ==\n{{Further|List of Final Fantasy media}}\n\n=== Games ===\n{{Main|List of Final Fantasy video games}}\n\nThe [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first installment]] of the series premiered in Japan on December 18, 1987. Subsequent games are numbered and given a story unrelated to previous games, so the numbers refer to volumes rather than to sequels. Many ''Final Fantasy'' games have been [[Internationalization and localization|localized]] for markets in North America, Europe, and Australia on numerous [[video game console]]s, [[personal computer]]s (PC), and [[mobile phone]]s. Future installments will appear on [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation consoles]]. As of November 2016, the series includes the main installments from ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' to ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', as well as direct sequels and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, both released and confirmed as being in development.

Most famously, every game since ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;II'', including subsequent remakes of the original ''Final Fantasy'', features a character named [[Cid (Final Fantasy)|Cid]]. Cid's appearance, personality, goals, and role in the game (non-playable ally, party member, villain) vary dramatically. However, two characteristics many versions of Cid have in common are 1) being a scientist or engineer, and 2) being tied in some way to an airship the party eventually acquires. Every Cid has at least one of these two traits.\n\n[[Biggs and Wedge]], inspired by two ''[[Star Wars]]'' characters of the same name, appear in numerous games as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief.<ref name=\"IGN-Evo\"/><ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\"/> The later games in the series feature several males with [[effeminacy|effeminate]] characteristics.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0228.1154.25773.htm| title = Ten Gaming Clich\u00e9s| first = Jeff| last = Cork| publisher = ''[[Game Informer]]''| date = February 28, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010053837/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0228.1154.25773.htm| archivedate = October 10, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html |title=Final Fantasy&nbsp;XII Q&A |date=November 20, 2003 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60hTInmD0?url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/441/441293p1.html |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Recurring creatures include [[Chocobo]]s and [[Moogle]]s.<ref name=\"IGN-Evo\"/> Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments as a means of long-distance travel for characters.

Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the \"Open Combat\" system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat.

Introduced in the first game, character classes have been used differently in each game. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story, while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.<ref name=\"IGN-Evo\"/><ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\"/><ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveXIII\"/>\n\n[[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Magic|Magic]] is another common RPG element in the series. The method by which characters gain magic varies between installments, but is generally divided into classes organized by color: \"White magic\", which focuses on spells that assist teammates; \"Black magic\", which focuses on harming enemies; \"Red magic\", which is a combination of white and black magic, \"Blue magic\", which mimics enemy attacks; and \"Green magic\" which focuses on applying [[status effect]]s to either allies or enemies.<ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Main\"/><ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\"/><ref name=\"VM-FFHistory\"/> Other types of magic frequently appear such as \"Time magic\", focusing on the themes of time, space, and gravity; and \"Summoning magic\", which [[Evocation|evokes]] legendary creatures to aid in battle and is a feature that has persisted since ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;III''. Summoned creatures are often referred to by names like \"Espers\" or \"Eidolons\" and have been inspired by mythologies from [[Arabian mythology|Arabic]], [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] cultures.<ref name=\"GS-FFHistory-Series\"/><ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveXIII\"/>\n\nDifferent means of transportation have appeared through the series. The most common is the airship for long range travel, accompanied by chocobos for travelling short distances, but others include sea and land vessels.

According to Sakaguchi, any title that created the \"''FF''\" abbreviation would have done.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/news/201505/24079276.html|title=\u300eFF\u300f\u306f\u3069\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u4e16\u754c\u306b\u5e83\u304c\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b\uff1f\u3000\u5742\u53e3\u535a\u4fe1\u6c0f\u3068\u6d5c\u6751\u5f18\u4e00\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u901a\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u4ee3\u8868\u304c\"\u56fd\u969b\u65e5\u672c\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u7814\u7a76\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\"\u306b\u3066\u8a9e\u308b|publisher=''[[Famitsu]]''|date=May 24, 2015|accessdate=2015-05-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526221313/http://www.famitsu.com/news/201505/24079276.html|archivedate=May 26, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThe game indeed reversed Square's lagging fortunes, and it became the company's flagship franchise.<ref name=\"Edge177\"/><ref name=\"IntroSE\"/> Following the success, Square immediately developed a second installment. Because Sakaguchi assumed ''Final Fantasy'' would be a stand-alone game, its story was not designed to be expanded by a sequel. The developers instead chose to carry over only thematic similarities from its predecessor, while some of the [[gameplay]] elements, such as the character advancement system, were overhauled. This approach has continued throughout the series; each major ''Final Fantasy'' game features a new setting, a new cast of characters, and an upgraded battle system.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveII\"/> Video game writer John Harris attributed the concept of reworking the game system of each installment to [[Nihon Falcom]]'s ''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'' series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |author=John Harris |title=Game Design Essentials: 20 RPGs - Dragon Slayer |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |page=13 |date=July 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012154920/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4066/game_design_essentials_20_rpgs.php?page=13 |archivedate=October 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> with which Square was previously involved as a publisher.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kurt Kalata |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |title=Dragon Slayer |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60hNUNOGQ?url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/dragonslayer/dragonslayer.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The company regularly released new games in the main series.

Battle screens use more detailed, full versions of characters in a side-view perspective. This practice was used until ''Final Fantasy&nbsp;VI'', which uses detailed versions for both screens. The NES sprites are 26&nbsp;[[pixel]]s high and use a [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] of 4&nbsp;colors. 6&nbsp;[[Film frame|frames of animation]] are used to depict different character statuses like \"healthy\" and \"fatigued\". The SNES installments use updated graphics and effects, as well as higher quality audio than in previous games, but are otherwise similar to their predecessors in basic design. The SNES sprites are 2&nbsp;pixels shorter, but have larger palettes and feature more animation frames: 11&nbsp;colors and 40&nbsp;frames respectively. The upgrade allowed designers to have characters be more detailed in appearance and express more emotions. The first game includes [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) the player could interact with, but they are mostly static in-game objects. Beginning with the second game, Square used predetermined pathways for NPCs to create more dynamic scenes that include comedy and drama.<ref name=\"GT-FFRetrospectiveIV\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185| title = Final Fantasy Retrospective Part&nbsp;IV| publisher = [[GameTrailers]]| date = August 5, 2007| accessdate = August 4, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611203037/http://www.gametrailers.com/video/part-iv-final-fantasy/23185 |archivedate=June 11, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Square showed an [[Final Fantasy VI#Legacy|interactive SGI technical demonstration]] of ''Final Fantasy VI'' for the then [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|next generation of consoles]].

The C=C double bonds can give either [[Cis-trans isomerism|''cis'' or ''trans'']]  isomers.  \n\n; ''cis'' : A ''cis'' configuration means that the two hydrogen atoms adjacent to the double bond stick out on the same side of the chain. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the ''cis'' isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the ''cis'' configuration, the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many ''cis'' bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations. For example, [[oleic acid]], with one double bond, has a \"kink\" in it, whereas [[linoleic acid]], with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend. [[Alpha-linolenic acid|\u03b1-Linolenic acid]], with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore can affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.\n; ''trans'' : A ''trans'' configuration, by contrast, means that the adjacent two hydrogen atoms lie on ''opposite'' sides of the chain.

If indicated from the -COOH end, then the C-1, C-2, C-3, \u2026.(etc.) notation is used (blue numerals in the diagram on the right, where C-1 is the \u2013COOH carbon). If the position is counted from the other, \u2013CH<sub>3</sub>, end then the position is indicated by the \u03c9-''n'' notation (numerals in red, where \u03c9-1 refers to the methyl carbon).\n\nThe positions of the double bonds in a fatty acid chain can, therefore, be indicated in two ways, using the C-''n'' or the \u03c9-''n'' notation. Thus, in an 18 carbon fatty acid, a double bond between C-12 (or \u03c9-7) and C-13 (or \u03c9-6) is reported either as \u0394<sup>12</sup> if counted from the \u2013COOH end (indicating only the \u201cbeginning\u201d of the double bond), or as \u03c9-6 (or omega-6) if counting from the \u2013CH<sub>3</sub> end. The \u201c\u0394\u201d is the Greek letter \u201cdelta\u201d, which translates into \u201cD\u201d ( for '''D'''ouble bond) in the Roman alphabet. Omega (\u03c9) is the last letter in the Greek alphabet, and is therefore used to indicate the \u201clast\u201d carbon atom in the fatty acid chain. Since the \u03c9-''n'' notation is used almost exclusively to indicate the positions of the double bonds close to the \u2013CH<sub>3</sub> end in [[essential fatty acid]]s, there is no necessity for an equivalent \u201c\u0394\u201d-like notation - the use of the \u201c\u03c9-''n''\u201d notation always refers to the position of a double bond.\n\nFatty acids with an [[odd number]] of carbon atoms are called [[odd-chain fatty acid]]s, whereas the rest are even-chain fatty acids. The difference is [[gluconeogenesis#Precursors|relevant to gluconeogenesis]].\n\n===Naming of fatty acids===\nThe following table describes the most common systems of naming fatty acids.\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!System\n!Example\n!Explanation\n|-\n!Trivial nomenclature\n|[[Palmitoleic acid]]\n|'''[[Trivial name]]s''' (or '''common names''') are non-systematic historical names, which are the most frequent naming system used in literature.

As the chain length increases, the solubility of the fatty acids in water decreases, so that the longer-chain fatty acids have minimal effect on the [[pH]] of an aqueous solution.  Even those fatty acids that are insoluble in water will dissolve in warm [[ethanol]], and can be [[titration|titrated]] with [[sodium hydroxide]] solution using [[phenolphthalein]] as an indicator.  This analysis is used to determine the free fatty acid content of fats; i.e., the proportion of the triglycerides that have been [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]]d.\n\nNeutralization of fatty acids, i.e. [[saponification]], is a widely practiced route to [[metallic soap]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Klaus Schumann, Kurt Siekmann|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a24_247|isbn=978-3527306732|chapter=Soaps}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrogenation and hardening===\n[[Hydrogenation]] of unsaturated fatty acids is widely practiced. Typical conditions involve 2.0\u20133.0 MPa of H<sub>2</sub> pressure, 150&nbsp;\u00b0C, and nickel supported on silica as a catalyst.  This treatment affords saturated fatty acids.  The extent of hydrogenation is indicated by the [[iodine number]].  Hydrogenated fatty acids are less prone toward [[rancidification]].  Since the saturated fatty acids are [[melting point|higher melting]] than the unsaturated precursors, the process is called hardening. Related technology is used to convert vegetable oils into [[margarine]]. The hydrogenation of triglycerides (vs fatty acids) is advantageous because the carboxylic acids degrade the nickel catalysts, affording nickel soaps. During partial hydrogenation, unsaturated fatty acids can be isomerized from ''cis'' to ''trans'' configuration.<ref name=Ullmann>{{Ullmann|last=Anneken|first=David J.|displayauthors=etal|title=Fatty Acids|DOI=10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2}}</ref>\n\nMore forcing hydrogenation, i.e. using higher pressures of H<sub>2</sub> and higher temperatures, converts fatty acids into [[fatty alcohol]]s.  Fatty alcohols are, however, more easily produced from fatty acid [[ester]]s.\n\nIn the [[Varrentrapp reaction]] certain unsaturated fatty acids are cleaved in molten alkali, a reaction at one time of relevance to structure elucidation.\n\n===Auto-oxidation and rancidity===\n{{Main|Rancidification}}\nUnsaturated fatty acids undergo a chemical change known as [[auto-oxidation]]. The process requires oxygen (air) and is accelerated by the presence of trace metals. Vegetable oils resist this process to a small degree because they contain antioxidants, such as [[tocopherol]].  Fats and oils often are treated with [[chelation|chelating agents]] such as [[citric acid]] to remove the metal catalysts.\n\n===Ozonolysis===\nUnsaturated fatty acids are susceptible to degradation by ozone.  This reaction is practiced in the production of [[azelaic acid]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>7</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>) from [[oleic acid]].<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\n===Analysis===\nIn chemical analysis, fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of methyl esters; additionally, a separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/chromsci/25.7.302| pmid = 3611285| title = Separation of Fatty Acids or Methyl Esters Including Positional and Geometric Isomers by Alumina Argentation Thin-Layer Chromatography| journal = Journal of Chromatographic Science| volume = 25| issue = 7| pages = 302\u20136| year = 1987| last1 = Breuer | first1 = B.| last2 = Stuhlfauth | first2 = T.| last3 = Fock | first3 = H. P.}}</ref>\n\n==Circulation==\n\n===Digestion and intake===\n{{Main|Digestion#Fat digestion}}\n[[Short-chain fatty acid|Short-]] and [[medium-chain fatty acids]] are absorbed directly into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the [[portal vein]] just as other absorbed nutrients do. However, [[long-chain fatty acids]] are not directly released into the intestinal capillaries. Instead they are absorbed into the fatty walls of the intestine [[Intestinal villus|villi]] and reassembled again into [[triglyceride]]s. The triglycerides are coated with [[cholesterol]] and protein (protein coat) into a compound called a [[chylomicron]].\n\nFrom within the cell, the chylomicron is released into a [[lymphatic]] capillary called a [[lacteal]], which merges into larger lymphatic vessels. It is transported via the lymphatic system and the [[thoracic duct]] up to a location near the heart (where the arteries and veins are larger). The thoracic duct empties the chylomicrons into the bloodstream via the left [[subclavian vein]]. At this point the chylomicrons can transport the triglycerides to tissues where they are stored or metabolized for energy.\n\n===Metabolism===\n{{Main|Fatty acid metabolism}}\nWhen metabolized, fatty acids yield large quantities of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Many cell types can use either [[glucose]] or fatty acids for this purpose. Fatty acids (provided either by ingestion or by drawing on triglycerides stored in fatty tissues) are distributed to cells to serve as a fuel for muscular contraction and general metabolism. They are broken down to CO<sub>2</sub> and water by the intra-cellular [[mitochondria]], releasing large amounts of energy, captured in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] through [[beta oxidation]] and the [[citric acid cycle]].\n\n====Essential fatty acids====\n{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}\nFatty acids that are required for good health but cannot be made in sufficient quantity from other substrates, and therefore must be obtained from food, are called essential fatty acids. There are two series of essential fatty acids: one has a double bond [[Omega-3 fatty acid|three carbon atoms]] away from the methyl end; the other has a double bond [[Omega-6 fatty acid|six carbon atoms]] away  from the methyl end. Humans lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbons 9 and 10, as counted from the carboxylic acid side.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolsover|first=Stephen R.|title=Cell Biology: A Short Course|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3a6p9pA5gZ8C&pg=PA42+|date=15 February 2004|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-46159-3|pages=42ff|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Two essential fatty acids are [[linoleic acid]] (LA) and [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (ALA). These fatty acids are widely distributed in plant oils. The human body has a limited ability to convert ALA into the longer-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s \u2014 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA), which can also be obtained from fish. Omega-3 and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids are [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] precursors to [[Cannabinoid#Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoids]] with [[Nociception|antinociceptive]], [[anxiolytic]], and [[Nervous system|neurogenic]] properties.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsden|first=Christopher E.|last2=Zamora|first2=Daisy|last3=Makriyannis|first3=Alexandros|last4=Wood|first4=JodiAnne T.|last5=Mann|first5=J.

They are taken in through the intestine in [[chylomicron]]s, but also exist in [[very low density lipoprotein]]s (VLDL) and [[low density lipoprotein]]s (LDL) after processing in the liver. In addition, when released from [[adipocytes]], fatty acids exist in the blood as [[free fatty acids]].\n\nIt is proposed that the blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin, together with [[lactic acid]] and [[pyruvic acid]], is distinctive and enables animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090721091839.htm\n | title=Electronic Nose Created To Detect Skin Vapors\n | date=July 21, 2009\n | publisher=Science Daily\n | accessdate=2010-05-18\n}}</ref>\n\n==Industrial uses==\nFatty acids are mainly used in the production of [[soap]], both for cosmetic purposes and, in the case of [[metallic soap]]s, as lubricants.  Fatty acids are also converted, via their methyl esters, to [[fatty alcohol]]s and [[fatty amine]]s, which are precursors to surfactants, detergents, and lubricants.<ref name=Ullmann/> Other applications include their use as  [[Emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], texturizing agents, wetting agents, [[Defoamer|anti-foam agents]], or stabilizing agents.<ref name=\"buildingblocks\">{{cite web| url=http://www.aciscience.org/docs/Fatty_Acids_Building_Blocks_for_Industry.pdf | title= Fatty Acids: Building Blocks for Industry | access-date=22 Apr 2018 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=aciscience.org |publisher= American Cleaning Institute |quote=}}</ref>\n\nEsters of fatty acids with simpler alcohols (such as methyl-, ethyl-, n-propyl-, isopropyl- and butyl esters) are used as emollients in cosmetics and other personal care products and as synthetic lubricants.

The film's screenwriter was inspired to write the script after he was in a car accident. Yglesias began writing the story after reading about [[United Airlines Flight 232]], that crashed in Sioux City, Iowa in 1989.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/article/1993/10/15/fearless-screenwriters-real-life-brush-death Fearless screenwriter] accessed 11/23/2016</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=September 2015}}\nWhile taking a business trip, [[architect]] Max Klein ([[Jeff Bridges]]) survives a crash of a flight headed from San Francisco to Houston. As the plane descends, Max inexplicably becomes at peace when he accepts he is going to die. The revelation inspires him to comfort many of the fearful passengers, even moving to sit next to Byron Hummel (Daniel Cerny), a young boy flying alone. The [[psychological trauma]] of the experience transforms Max's personality and he enters an [[altered state of consciousness]], rethinking his life and becoming preoccupied with the eternal meanings and the existential questions of life and death itself. Max's reaction to this awakening itself questions the reality of what is real and unreal and what his mind perceives as real through his interaction with others and the chance of living again in everyday life.\n\nImmediately after the crash, Max, one of the plane's few survivors, rents a car and drives from the crash site in [[Bakersfield]] to Los Angeles, stopping on the way to visit his old high school sweetheart, Alison ([[Debra Monk]]), whom he hasn't seen in 20 years. During their meal at a restaurant Alison notices Max eating a strawberry and inquires about his [[food allergy|allergy]] to them. Max grins and explains he's \"gotten past\" his allergic reaction and somehow, confidently finishes it with no problems. He's tracked down at a hotel room the next morning by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|F.B.I.]] agents who question his odd choice to not contact his wife and family or remain at the crash site with the other survivors. The airline sends a representative who compensates him with train tickets to go home to San Francisco. Max declines the tickets, stating adamantly that he wants to fly home and has no fear of air travel anymore. On the flight he meets Dr. Bill Perlman ([[John Turturro]]), an airline-contracted [[psychiatrist]] who offers to counsel Max for [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].\n\nDr. Perlman accompanies Max back to his home where his wife Laura ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) begins noticing his strange behavior. Max matter-of-factly tells Nan Gordon ([[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]]), the wife of his friend and business partner, that her husband Jeff ([[John de Lancie]]) died in the crash. The media dubs Max \"The Good Samaritan\" and tries to interview him as Byron comes to publicly thank him for the way he comforted the passengers during the crash, but Max avoids making a statement. Over time Max becomes distant from Laura and his son Jonah (Spencer Vrooman) because of his preoccupation with his near death experience. He begins drawing abstract pictures of the crash and his sense of a hole opening in the sky before him.  He comes to think of himself as invulnerable to death causing Dr. Perlman to become concerned that Max is [[delusion]]al. Perlman encourages Max to meet with another survivor, Carla Rodrigo ([[Rosie Perez]]), in the hope that the two can help support one another. Carla, who lost her baby son in the crash, struggles with [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]], punishing herself for not holding onto him tightly enough when his seat belt on the plane malfunctioned. Max and Carla bond and develop a close friendship as he helps her to get past her depression and free herself from her guilt.\n\nMax, Laura and Nan meet with attorney Steven Brillstein ([[Tom Hulce]]), who encourages Max to exaggerate his testimony in order to increase Nan's [[settlement offer|compensation settlement offer]] from the airline. Max states his discomfort with lying but reluctantly agrees when he considers Nan's financial predicament as a [[widow]]. The unease of lying causes Max to have a [[panic attack]] and he runs out of the office to the roof of the building where he climbs onto the ledge. As Max stands on the ledge, looking down at the streets below, his panic attack subsides and he rejoices in his fearlessness. Laura follows Max onto the roof and upon finding him, blindly spinning around on the ledge with his overcoat billowing across his face, she believes him to be [[Suicide crisis|suicidal]].\n\nEventually Max's increasingly dramatic attempts (culminating with an intentional car crash into a brick wall) at pushing the boundaries between life and death succeed in jolting Carla from her uncertain state. Afterwards, Carla meets with Laura and the two clarify the misunderstanding that she and Max are past a co-dependency state and are in fact, in love with each other. Moreover, Carla explains that she regards Max as he sees himself - an angel - and Laura now understands their shared delusion. However, after Carla reluctantly parts company with Max, he remains aloof in his relationship with his wife and son, struggling to come to terms with his implied immortality. One night, Brillstein arrives at the Klein home to celebrate the pending settlement offer, and brings a basket with an assortment of fruits. Max eats one of the strawberries but, unlike at the restaurant, this time he experiences an immediate allergic reaction and suffocates. As he lies choking, Max goes into a state of vision where he sees various flashbacks and starts toward the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel (in the guise of an aisle in the airplane fuselage) as Laura's voice is overheard repeatedly \"calling him back\" to the world. Max accepts the reality of his imminent death when suddenly he's [[Artificial respiration|resuscitated]] by Laura. He survives and (it's implied) recovers his emotional connection to his family, to the world and to the reality of yet another chance at life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jeff Bridges]] as Max Klein\n* [[Isabella Rossellini]] as Laura Klein\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Carla Rodrigo\n* [[Tom Hulce]] as Brillstein\n* [[John Turturro]] as Dr. Bill Perlman\n* [[Benicio del Toro]] as Manny Rodrigo\n* [[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]] as Nan Gordon\n* [[John de Lancie]] as Jeff Gordon\n* [[Debra Monk]] as Alison\n* [[William Newman (actor)|William Newman]] as the Elderly Man\n\n==Aesthetic elements==\nA book containing the painting ''[[Ascent of the Blessed|The Ascent into the Empyrean]]''<!--- the name used in the film; there are several for the same painting ---> by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] is shown, and it is said that the dying go into the light of heaven \"naked and alone\".

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he won a record four [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the [[Great Depression]], implementing his [[New Deal]] domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the [[New Deal Coalition]], which realigned American politics into the [[Fifth Party System]] and defined [[modern American liberalism|American liberalism]] throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by [[World War II]]. He is often rated by scholars as one of the three [[greatest U.S. presidents]], along with [[George Washington]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n\nRoosevelt was born in [[Hyde Park, New York]], to a [[Roosevelt family|Dutch American family]] made well known by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th President of the United States. FDR attended [[Groton School]], [[Harvard College]], and [[Columbia Law School]], and went on to practice law in [[New York City]]. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. They had six children. He won election to the [[New York State Senate]] in 1910, and then served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[Woodrow Wilson]] during [[World War I]]. Roosevelt was [[James M. Cox]]'s running mate on the Democratic Party's [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]] national ticket, but Cox was defeated by [[Warren G. Harding]]. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|paralytic illness]], believed at the time to be [[polio]], and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded the [[Warm Springs Historic District|treatment center]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], for people with [[poliomyelitis]]. In spite of being unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office by winning election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1928. He was in office from 1929 to 1933 and served as a reform Governor, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States at the time.\n\nIn the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]], Roosevelt defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Herbert Hoover]] in a landslide. Roosevelt took office while the United States was in the midst of [[Great Depression in the United States|the Great Depression]], the worst economic crisis in the country's history. During the [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|first 100 days]] of the [[73rd United States Congress]], Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the [[New Deal]]\u2014a variety of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the [[National Recovery Administration]] and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. The economy having improved rapidly from 1933 to 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide [[United States presidential election, 1936|reelection in 1936]]. However, the economy then relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. After the 1936 election, Roosevelt sought passage of the [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]] (the \"court packing plan\"), which would have expanded the size of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The bipartisan [[Conservative Coalition]] that formed in 1937 prevented passage of the bill and blocked the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under Roosevelt include the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[National Labor Relations Act of 1935|National Labor Relations Act]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]], and [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].\n\nRoosevelt ran successfully for reelection in [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]]. His victory made him the only U.S. President to serve for more than two terms. With [[World War II]] looming after 1938, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Soviet Union]] while the U.S. remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, an event he famously called \"[[Infamy Speech|a date which will live in infamy]]\", Roosevelt obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day, and a few days later, on Germany and Italy. Assisted by his top aide [[Harry Hopkins]] and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] and Chinese [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in leading the Allies against the [[Axis Powers]]. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a [[Europe first]] strategy, making the defeat of Germany a priority over that of Japan. He also initiated the development of the world's first [[Nuclear bomb|atomic bomb]] and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the [[United Nations]] and other post-war institutions. Roosevelt won reelection in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]] but with his physical health declining during the war years, he died in April 1945, just {{Age in weeks| month1=01 |day1=20| year1=1945| month2=04| day2=12|  year2=1945}} weeks into his fourth term. The Axis Powers surrendered to the Allies in the months following Roosevelt's death, during the presidency of Roosevelt's successor, [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\n==Early life and marriage==\n===Childhood and education===\n[[File:Springwood Estate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Home of Franklin D.

Roosevelt's re-election as governor had established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination. Roosevelt rallied the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] supporters of the Wilson administration while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the [[Southern United States|South]] and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives such as Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee. Smith hoped to deny Roosevelt the two-thirds support necessary to win the party's presidential nomination at the [[1932 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago, and then emerge as the nominee after multiple rounds of balloting. Roosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1932|1932 Democratic primaries]], but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Speaker of the House [[John Nance Garner]], who controlled the votes of Texas and California, threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot.

The [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA), under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, was designed to distribute relief to state governments.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 322}} The [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), under the leadership of Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, was created to oversee the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 322}} The most popular of all New Deal agencies&nbsp;\u2013 and Roosevelt's favorite&nbsp;\u2013 was the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed young men to work on local rural projects. Roosevelt also expanded a Hoover agency, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], making it a major source of financing for railroads and industry. Congress gave the [[Federal Trade Commission]] broad new regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also made agricultural relief a high priority and set up the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA). The AAA tried to force higher prices for commodities by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and to cut herds.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=318\u2013323}}\n\nReform of the economy was the goal of the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules of operation for all firms within specific industries, such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the rules which were approved by NIRA officials. Industry needed to raise wages as a condition for approval. Provisions encouraged unions and suspended [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] laws. NIRA was found to be unconstitutional by unanimous decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] in May 1935; Roosevelt strongly protested the decision.{{Sfn|Hawley|1995|p=124}} Roosevelt reformed the financial regulatory structure of the nation with the [[1933 Banking Act|Glass\u2013Steagall Act]], creating the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. The act also sought to curb speculation by limiting affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=331\u2013332}} In 1934, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] was created to regulate the trading of [[Security (finance)|securities]], while the [[Federal Communications Commission]] was established to [[Telecommunications policy of the United States|regulate telecommunications]].{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=346}}\n\nRecovery was pursued through federal spending.{{sfn|Savage|1991|p=160}} The NIRA included $3.3&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.3|1933|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) of spending through the Public Works Administration. Roosevelt worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA)&nbsp;\u2014 which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. [[Executive Order 6102]] declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the [[deflation]] which was paralyzing the economy.{{Sfn|Freidel|1952\u201373|pp=4, 320\u201339}}\n\nRoosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget&nbsp;\u2014 including a reduction in military spending from $752&nbsp;million in 1932 to $531&nbsp;million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits&nbsp;\u2014 by removing 500,000 veterans and widows from the pension rolls and reducing benefits for the remainder, as well as cutting the salaries of federal employees and reducing spending on research and education. But the veterans were well organized and strongly protested, and most benefits were restored or increased by 1934.{{Sfn|Freidel|1952\u201373|pp=4, 448\u201352}} Veterans groups such as the [[American Legion]] and the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President's veto and passed the [[Adjusted Compensation Payment Act|Bonus Act]] in January 1936.{{Sfn|Dallek|2017|p=249}} It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joshua K. |last=Hausman |title=Fiscal Policy and Economic Recovery: The Case of the 1936 Veterans' Bonus |work=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=1100\u20131143 |date=April 2016 |doi=10.1257/aer.20130957 |url=http://behl.berkeley.edu/files/2013/02/WP2013-06_Hausman.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Second New Deal (1935\u20131936)====\n[[File:Signing Of The Social Security Act.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act into law, August 14, 1935]]\n\nRoosevelt expected that his party would lose several races in the [[United States elections, 1934|1934 Congressional elections]], as the president's party had done in most previous [[United States midterm election|midterm elections]], but the Democrats picked up seats in both houses of Congress. Empowered by the public's apparent vote of confidence in his administration, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the [[74th United States Congress|74th Congress]] was the creation of a [[social insurance]] program.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 349\u2013351}} The [[Social Security Act]] established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.\"<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/history/Gulick.html Social Security History]. Ssa.gov. Retrieved on July 14, 2013.</ref> Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and the handicapped.{{sfn |Norton|2009|p= 670}} Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act only applied to roughly sixty percent of the labor force, as farmers, domestic workers, and other groups were excluded.{{sfn |Smith|2007|p= 353}}\n\nRoosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like the PWA, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, Roosevelt established the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed over three million people in its first year of existence. The WPA undertook numerous construction projects and provided funding to the [[National Youth Administration]] and arts organizations.{{sfn |Smith|2007|pp= 353\u2013356}}\n\n[[File:1936 FDR \"Don't Be Fooled by Figures\" Re-election handbill.jpg|thumb|1936 re-election handbill for Roosevelt promoting his economic policy]]\n\nSenator Robert Wagner wrote the [[National Labor Relations Act]], which guaranteed workers the rights to [[collective bargaining]] through unions of their own choice. The act also established the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.{{sfn|Kennedy|1999|p=291}} The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.<ref>Colin Gordon, ''New Deals: Business, Labor, and Politics in America, 1920\u20131935'' (1994)  p. 225</ref> When the [[Flint sit-down strike]] threatened the production of [[General Motors]], Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | pp = 463\u2013467}}\n\nWhile the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by [[Al Smith]], fought back with the [[American Liberty League]], savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].{{Sfn|Fried|2001|pp = 120\u2013123}} But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide.{{Sfn | Fried | 2001 | pp = 120\u2013123}} By contrast, labor unions, energized by the Wagner Act, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's reelections in 1936, 1940 and 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=350}}\n\nBiographer James M. Burns suggests that Roosevelt's policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology, and that he \"was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below.\"{{Sfn|Burns|1956|p=226}} Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. \"The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,\" he wrote. \"It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another.

The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].{{Sfn|Smith|2007|pp=373\u2013375}} Roosevelt lost high income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities.

The United States had frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1823, and the United States had occupied several Latin American nations in the [[Banana Wars]] that had occurred following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrew]] U.S. forces from [[Haiti]] and reached new treaties with [[Cuba]] and [[Panama]], ended their status as U.S. [[protectorate]]s. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the [[Montevideo Convention]] on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|1963|pp=203\u201310}} Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=341\u2013343}} Roosevelt hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue, and \"both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.\"{{sfn|Doenecke|Stoler|2005|p=18}}\n\nThe rejection of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] during the Wilson administration marked the dominance of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]] in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt's Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator [[Gerald Nye]] and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the \"merchants of death\" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=254}} This effort took the form of the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]]; the president asked for, but was refused, a provision to give him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=255}} Focused on domestic policy, Roosevelt largely acquiesced to Congress's non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=417\u2013418}} In the interim, [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] proceeded to [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|overcome]] [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]], and the Italians joined [[Nazi Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] in supporting General [[Francisco Franco]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] cause in the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=256}} As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939, Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Spanish Republicans]].{{Sfn|Dallek|1995|p=180}} When [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan invaded China]] in 1937, isolationism limited Roosevelt's ability to aid China,{{Sfn|Dallek|1995|pp=146\u2013147}} despite atrocities like the [[Nanking Massacre]] and the [[USS Panay incident]].{{sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=188\u201390}}\n\n[[File:FDR-George-VI-Potomac-June-9-1939-2-detail-crop.jpg|thumb|The Roosevelts with [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], sailing from Washington, D.C., to [[Mount Vernon]], Virginia on the [[USS Potomac (AG-25)|USS ''Potomac'']] during the first U.S. visit of a reigning British monarch (June 9, 1939)]]\n[[File:FDR foreign trips.svg|thumb|Foreign trips of Roosevelt during his presidency<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/travels/president/roosevelt-franklin-d |title=Travels of President Franklin D.

Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.{{sfn|Burns|1956|p=420}} In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the nation's first peacetime draft, and with the support of the Roosevelt administration the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]] passed in September.

The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]],{{efn|The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] ratified in 1951, would bar any individual from winning more than two presidential elections.}} had been established by [[George Washington]] when he refused to run for a third term in the [[United States presidential election, 1796|1796 presidential election]]. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through [[Western Europe]] and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat [[Wendell Willkie]], the popular Republican nominee.{{Sfn|Burns|1956|pp=408\u201330}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|1940 electoral vote results]]\n\nAt the [[1940 Democratic National Convention|July 1940 Democratic Convention]] in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Vice President Garner, who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies.<ref name=moe1/> To replace Garner on the ticket, Roosevelt turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states.{{sfn|Dallek|2017|pp=389\u2013390}} The choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party's conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and \"eccentric\" in his private life to be an effective running mate.

The \"[[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Big Three]]\" of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], together with Chinese Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]]; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries.

With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an [[Operation Downfall|American invasion of Japan]] would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as [[Sakhalin Island]]. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the [[United Nations Security Council]], which would be charged with ensuring [[International security|international peace and security]]. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany.

The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Midway]]. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] or [[leapfrogging]] through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions.{{Sfn | Burns | 1970 | p = 228}} Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.{{Sfn | Brands | 2009 | p = 785}}\n\n====Home front====\n{{Main|United States home front during World War II}}\n\nThe home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million.{{Efn|WPA workers were counted as unemployed by this set of statistics.<ref>{{Citation|place=US|publisher=Bureau of the Census|title=Statistical Abstract|year=1946|page=173}}</ref>}} There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded.{{Sfn|Schweikart|Allen|2004|p=602}} The [[Revenue Act of 1942]] instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the [[excess profits tax]]), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal [[withholding tax]].{{sfn |Leuchtenburg|2015|pp= 221\u2013222}} In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a [[Individual Income Tax Act of 1944|smaller revenue bill]] raising $2 billion.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=436}}\n\nIn 1942, with the United States now in the conflict, war production increased dramatically, but fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=333}} The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|p=343}}{{sfn|Herman|2012|pp=139\u201344, 151, 246}} Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4 million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40 billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=571\u2013572}} The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the [[Board of Economic Warfare]], and [[Jesse H.

Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies.{{Sfn|Burns|1970|pp=339\u201342}} In 1943, Roosevelt established the [[Office of War Mobilization]] to oversee the home front; the agency was led by [[James F.

Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator [[Harry S.

He was prevented from accepting more Jewish immigrants by the restrictive [[Immigration Act of 1924]], the prevalence of [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] and [[antisemitism]] among voters and members of Congress, and some resistance in the [[American Jew]]ish community to the acceptance of Eastern European Jewish immigrants.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=426\u2013428}} Hitler chose to implement the \"[[Final Solution]]\"\u2014the extermination of the European Jewish population\u2014by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]], which condemned the ongoing [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and promised to try its perpetrators as [[War crime|war criminals]]. In January 1944, Roosevelt established the [[War Refugee Board]] to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the [[extermination camps]] or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt.{{sfn|Smith|2007|pp=607\u2013613}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Historical reputation===\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->| image1 = FDR-Memorial-Grosvenor-Square.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = FDR Memorial in [[Grosvenor Square]], London (1948)\n<!-- Image 2 -->| image2 = FDR Memorial wall.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = The Four Freedoms engraved on a wall at the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.

Roosevelt's themes|other uses|Four Freedoms (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:FDR Memorial wall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Engraving of the Four Freedoms at the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe '''Four Freedoms''' were goals articulated by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on Monday, January 6, 1941.  In an address known as the [[s:The Four Freedoms speech|Four Freedoms speech]] (technically the '''1941 State of the Union address'''), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people \"everywhere in the world\" ought to enjoy:\n\n# [[Freedom of speech]]\n# [[Freedom of worship]]\n# [[Freedom from want]]\n# [[Freedom from fear]]\n\nRoosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the surprise Japanese attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|U.S. forces in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] that caused the United States to declare war on Japan, December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the [[national security of the United States]] and the threat to other democracies from [[World War II|world war]] that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. In the speech, he made a break with the tradition of [[United States non-interventionism]] that had long been held in the United States. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare.\n\nIn that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: \"As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone.\" In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which include economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of \"adequate health care\". The first two freedoms, of speech and [[Freedom of religion|religion]], are protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] in the [[United States Constitution]]. His inclusion of the latter two freedoms went beyond the traditional Constitutional values protected by the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]]. Roosevelt endorsed a broader human [[Rights|right]] to [[Right to an adequate standard of living|economic security]] and anticipated what would become known decades later as the \"[[human security]]\" [[paradigm]] in [[social science]] and [[economic development]]. He also included the \"[[freedom from fear]]\" against national aggression and took it to the new [[United Nations]] he was setting up.\n\n==Historical context==\nIn the 1930s many Americans, arguing that the involvement in World War I had been a mistake, were adamantly against continued intervention in European affairs.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\">Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 11</ref> With the Neutrality Acts established after 1935, U.S. law banned the sale of armaments to countries that were at war and placed restrictions on travel with belligerent vessels.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 393\u201394</ref>\n\nWhen [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the neutrality laws were still in effect, and ensured that no substantial support could be given to Britain and France. With the revision of the Neutrality Act in 1939, Roosevelt adopted a \"methods-short-of-war policy\" whereby supplies and armaments could be given to European Allies, provided no declaration of war could be made and no troops committed.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929\u20131945 (1999) 427\u2013434</ref> By December 1940, Europe was largely at the mercy of Adolf Hitler and Germany's Nazi regime. With Germany's defeat of France in June 1940, Britain and its overseas Empire stood alone against the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Winston Churchill, as Prime Minister of Britain, called for Roosevelt and the United States to supply them with armaments in order to continue with the war effort.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe [[1939 New York World's Fair]] had celebrated Four Freedoms - religion, speech, press and assembly - and commissioned [[Leo Friedlander]] to create sculptures representing them. [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Fiorello La Guardia]] described the resulting statues as the \"heart of the fair\". Later Roosevelt would declare his own \"Four Essential Freedoms\" and call on [[Walter Russell]] to create a ''[[Four Freedoms Monument]]'' that was eventually dedicated at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FD0Qfub9MC&pg=PP71&dq=%22norman+rockwell%22+%22freedom+of+speech%22+%22four+freedoms%22+%22Saturday+Evening+Post%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FIHDUsryNqWQ3AX5Ag&ved=0CGgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22norman%20rockwell%22%20%22freedom%20of%20speech%22%20%22four%20freedoms%22%20%22Saturday%20Evening%20Post%22&f=false|title=Liberty's Refuge: The Forgotten Freedom of Assembly|author=Inazu, John D.|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=0300173156|pages=|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Declarations==\n{{listen\n|title=State of the Union (Four Freedoms) (January 6, 1941)\n|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg\n|description =[[Franklin D.

Roosevelt's hope was to provide a rationale for why the United States should abandon the isolationist policies that emerged from World War I.  In the address, Roosevelt critiqued Isolationism, saying: \"No realistic American can expect from a dictator's peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion\u2013or even good business. Such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors. \"Those, who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"<ref name=\"speech\">{{cite web|url=http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/fdr-the-four-freedoms-speech-text/ |title=FDR, \"The Four Freedoms,\" Speech Text &#124; |publisher=Voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu |date=January 6, 1941 |accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe speech coincided with the introduction of the Lend-Lease Bill, which promoted Roosevelt's plan to become the \"arsenal of democracy\"<ref>The Public Papers and Addresses of Franklin D.

Roosevelt, excerpted from the State of the Union Address to the Congress, January 6, 1941 </blockquote>\n[[File:Four Freedoms Flag or United Nations Honour Flag ca 1943-1948.svg|thumb|220px|The four freedoms flag or \"[[United Nations Honor Flag]]\" ca. 1943\u20131948]]\n\nThe declaration of the Four Freedoms as a justification for war would resonate through the remainder of the war, and for decades longer as a frame of remembrance.<ref name=\"Bodnar, John 2010\"/> The Freedoms became the staple of America's war aims, and the center of all attempts to rally public support for the war. With the creation of the Office of War Information (1942), as well as the famous paintings of Norman Rockwell, the Freedoms were advertised as values central to American life and examples of American exceptionalism.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 12</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n\nThe Four Freedoms Speech was popular, and the goals were influential in the postwar politics. However, in 1941 the speech received heavy criticism from anti-war elements.<ref>Kennedy, David M., Freedom From Fear: the American people in depression and war, 1929-1945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999) 470\u201376</ref> Critics argued that the Four Freedoms were simply a charter for Roosevelt's [[New Deal]], social reforms that had already created sharp divisions within Congress. Conservatives who opposed social programs and increased government intervention argued against Roosevelt's attempt to justify and depict the war as necessary for the defense of lofty goals.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14\u201315</ref>\n\nWhile the Freedoms did become a forceful aspect of American thought on the war, they were never the exclusive justification for the war. Polls and surveys conducted by the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) revealed that \"self-defense\", and vengeance for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] were still the most prevalent reasons for war.<ref>Bodnar, John, The \"Good War\" in American Memory. (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010) 14</ref>\n\n==Limitations==\n\nIn a 1942 radio address, President Roosevelt declared the Four Freedoms embodied \"rights of men of every creed and every race, wherever they live.\"<ref>Foner, Eric, The Story of American Freedom. (New York: W.W. Norton, 1998) 223</ref>\n\nOn February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt authorized [[Japanese American internment]] and [[internment of Italian Americans]] with [[Executive Order 9066]], which allowed local military commanders to designate \"military areas\" as \"exclusion zones,\" from which \"any or all persons may be excluded.\" This power was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the entire Pacific coast, including all of California and much of Oregon, Washington and Arizona, except for those in internment camps.<ref name=korematsu_roberts>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&court=US&vol=323&page=214 ''Korematsu v.

First-order logic uses [[Quantification (logic)|quantified variables]] over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as ''Socrates is a man'' one can have expressions in the form \"there exists X such that X is [[Socrates]] and X is a man\" and ''there exists'' is a quantifier while ''X'' is a variable.<ref>Hodgson, Dr. J. P. E., [http://people.sju.edu/~jhodgson/ugai/1order.html \"First Order Logic\"], [[Saint Joseph's University]], [[Philadelphia]], 1995.</ref> This distinguishes it from [[propositional logic]], which does not use quantifiers or relations.<ref>[[George Edward Hughes|Hughes, G. E.]], & [[Max Cresswell|Cresswell, M. J.]], ''A New Introduction to Modal Logic'' ([[London]]: [[Routledge]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=_CB5wiBeaA4C&pg=PA161#v=onepage&q&f=false p.161].</ref>\n\nA theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified [[domain of discourse]] over which the quantified variables range, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many predicates defined on that domain, and a set of axioms believed to hold for those things. Sometimes \"theory\" is understood in a more formal sense, which is just a set of sentences in first-order logic.\n\nThe adjective \"first-order\" distinguishes first-order logic from [[higher-order logic]] in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which one or both of predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers are permitted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mendelson|first=Elliott|title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic|year=1964|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|page=56}}</ref> In first-order theories, predicates are often associated with sets. In interpreted higher-order theories, predicates may be interpreted as sets of sets.\n\nThere are many [[deductive system]]s for first-order logic which are both [[Soundness#Logical systems|sound]] (all provable statements are true in all models) and [[Completeness (logic)|complete]] (all statements which are true in all models are provable). Although the [[logical consequence]] relation is only [[semidecidability|semidecidable]], much progress has been made in [[automated theorem proving]] in first-order logic. First-order logic also satisfies several [[metalogic]]al theorems that make it amenable to analysis in [[proof theory]], such as the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] and the [[compactness theorem]].\n\nFirst-order logic is the standard for the formalization of mathematics into [[Axiomatic system|axioms]] and is studied in the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n[[Peano arithmetic]] and [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] are axiomatizations of [[number theory]] and [[set theory]], respectively, into first-order logic.\nNo first-order theory, however, has the strength to uniquely describe  a structure with an infinite domain, such as the [[natural number]]s or the [[real line]]. Axiom systems that do fully describe these two structures (that is, [[categorical theory|categorical]] axiom systems) can be obtained in stronger logics such as [[second-order logic]].\n\nThe foundations of first-order logic were developed independently by [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].<ref>Eric M. Hammer: Semantics for Existential Graphs, ''Journal of Philosophical Logic'', Volume 27, Issue 5 (October 1998), page 489: \"Development of first-order logic independently of Frege, anticipating prenex and Skolem normal forms\"</ref> For a history of first-order logic and how it came to dominate formal logic, see Jos\u00e9 Ferreir\u00f3s (2001).\n\n==Introduction==\nWhile [[propositional logic]] deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]]s and [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]].\n\nA predicate takes an entity or entities in the [[domain of discourse]] as input while outputs are either True or False. Consider the two sentences \"Socrates is a philosopher\" and \"Plato is a philosopher\". In [[Propositional calculus|propositional logic]], these sentences are viewed as being unrelated and might be denoted, for example, by variables such as ''p'' and ''q''. The predicate \"is a philosopher\" occurs in both sentences, which have a common structure of \"''a'' is a philosopher\". The variable ''a'' is instantiated as \"Socrates\" in the first sentence and is instantiated as \"Plato\" in the second sentence. While first-order logic allows for the use of predicates, such as \"is a philosopher\" in this example, propositional logic does not.<ref>[[Ben Goertzel|Goertzel, B.]], Geisweiller, N., Coelho, L., Jani\u010di\u0107, P., & Pennachin, C., ''Real-World Reasoning: Toward Scalable, Uncertain Spatiotemporal, Contextual and Causal Inference'' ([[Amsterdam]] & [[Paris]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Atlantis Press]], 2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=g7UAIhnmJpsC&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 29].</ref>\n\nRelationships between predicates can be stated using [[logical connective]]s. Consider, for example, the first-order formula \"if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar\". This formula is a [[material conditional|conditional]] statement with \"''a'' is a philosopher\" as its hypothesis and \"''a'' is a scholar\" as its conclusion. The truth of this formula depends on which object is denoted by ''a'', and on the interpretations of the predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\".\n\nQuantifiers can be applied to variables in a formula. The variable ''a'' in the previous formula can be universally quantified, for instance, with the first-order sentence \"For every ''a'', if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar\". The [[universal quantifier]] \"for every\" in this sentence expresses the idea that the claim \"if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar\" holds for ''all'' choices of ''a''.\n\nThe ''[[negation]]'' of the sentence \"For every ''a'', if ''a'' is a philosopher, then ''a'' is a scholar\" is logically equivalent to the sentence \"There exists ''a'' such that ''a'' is a philosopher and ''a'' is not a scholar\". The [[existential quantifier]] \"there exists\" expresses the idea that the claim \"''a'' is a philosopher and ''a'' is not a scholar\" holds for ''some'' choice of ''a''.\n\nThe predicates \"is a philosopher\" and \"is a scholar\" each take a single variable. In general, predicates can take several variables. In the first-order sentence \"Socrates is the teacher of Plato\", the predicate \"is the teacher of\" takes two variables.\n\nAn interpretation (or model) of a first-order formula specifies what each predicate means and the entities that can instantiate the variables. These entities form the [[domain of discourse]] or universe, which is usually required to be a nonempty set. For example, in an interpretation with the domain of discourse consisting of all human beings and the predicate \"is a philosopher\" understood as \"was the author of the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''\", the sentence \"There exists ''a'' such that ''a'' is a philosopher\" is seen as being true, as witnessed by Plato.\n\n==Syntax==\nThere are two key parts of first-order logic. The [[syntax]] determines which collections of symbols are legal expressions in first-order logic, while the [[semantics]] determine the meanings behind these expressions.\n\n===Alphabet===\nUnlike natural languages, such as English, the language of first-order logic is completely formal, so that it can be mechanically determined whether a given expression is legal.  There are two key types of legal expressions: '''terms''', which intuitively represent objects, and '''formulas''', which intuitively express predicates that can be true or false. The terms and formulas of first-order logic are strings of '''symbols''', where all the symbols together form the '''alphabet''' of the language. As with all [[formal language]]s, the nature of the symbols themselves is outside the scope of formal logic; they are often regarded simply as letters and punctuation symbols.\n\nIt is common to divide the symbols of the alphabet into '''logical symbols''', which always have the same meaning, and '''non-logical symbols''', whose meaning varies by interpretation. For example, the logical symbol <math>\\land</math> always represents \"and\"; it is never interpreted as \"or\". On the other hand, a non-logical predicate symbol such as Phil(''x'') could be interpreted to mean \"''x'' is a philosopher\", \"''x'' is a man named Philip\", or any other unary predicate, depending on the interpretation at hand.\n\n====Logical symbols====\nThere are several logical symbols in the alphabet, which vary by author but usually include:\n* The quantifier symbols [[Universal quantification|\u2200]] and [[Existential quantification|\u2203]]\n* The [[logical connective]]s: \u2227 for [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], \u2228 for [[disjunction]],  \u2192 for [[material conditional|implication]], \u2194 for [[logical biconditional|biconditional]], \u00ac for negation.  Occasionally other logical connective symbols are included.  Some authors use C''pq'', instead of \u2192, and E''pq'', instead of \u2194, especially in contexts where \u2192 is used for other purposes. Moreover, the horseshoe \u2283 may replace \u2192; the triple-bar \u2261 may replace \u2194; a tilde (~), N''p'', or F''pq'', may replace \u00ac; ''||'', or A''pq'' may replace \u2228; and &, K''pq'', or the middle dot, \u22c5, may replace [[\u2227]], especially if these symbols are not available for technical reasons. (''Note'': the aforementioned symbols C''pq'', E''pq'', N''p'', A''pq'', and K''pq'' are used in [[Polish notation]].)\n* Parentheses, brackets, and other punctuation symbols. The choice of such symbols varies depending on context.\n* An infinite set of '''variables''', often denoted by lowercase letters at the end of the alphabet ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ... . Subscripts are often used to distinguish variables: {{nowrap|1= ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...&nbsp;.}}\n* An '''equality symbol''' (sometimes, '''identity symbol''') =; see [[#Equality_and_its_axioms|the section on equality below]].\n\nIt should be noted that not all of these symbols are required \u2013 only one of the quantifiers, negation and conjunction, variables, brackets and equality suffice. There are numerous minor variations that may define additional logical symbols:\n* Sometimes the truth constants T, V''pq'', or \u22a4, for \"true\" and F, O''pq'', or \u22a5, for \"false\" are included. Without any such logical operators of valence 0, these two constants can only be expressed using quantifiers.\n* Sometimes additional logical connectives are included, such as the [[Sheffer stroke]], D''pq'' (NAND), and [[exclusive or]], J''pq''.\n\n====Non-logical symbols====<!-- This section is linked from [[Axiom of empty set]] -->\nThe [[non-logical symbols]] represent predicates (relations), functions and constants on the domain of discourse. It used to be standard practice to use a fixed, infinite set of non-logical symbols for all purposes. A more recent practice is to use different non-logical symbols according to the application one has in mind. Therefore, it has become necessary to name the set of all non-logical symbols used in a particular application. This choice is made via a '''[[signature (logic)|signature]]'''.<ref>The word ''language'' is sometimes used as a synonym for signature, but this can be confusing because \"language\" can also refer to the set of formulas.</ref>\n\nThe traditional approach is to have only one, infinite, set of non-logical symbols (one signature) for all applications. Consequently, under the traditional approach there is only one language of first-order logic.<ref>More precisely, there is only one language of each variant of one-sorted first-order logic: with or without equality, with or without functions, with or without propositional variables, ....</ref> This approach is still common, especially in philosophically oriented books.\n# For every integer ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0 there is a collection of [[arity|''n''-'''ary''']], or ''n''-'''place''', '''predicate symbols'''. Because they represent [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] between ''n'' elements, they are also called '''relation symbols'''. For each arity ''n'' we have an infinite supply of them:\n#:''P''<sup>''n''</sup><sub>0</sub>, ''P''<sup>''n''</sup><sub>1</sub>, ''P''<sup>''n''</sup><sub>2</sub>, ''P''<sup>''n''</sup><sub>3</sub>, ...\n# For every integer ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0 there are infinitely many ''n''-ary '''function symbols''':\n#:''f<sup> n</sup>''<sub>0</sub>, ''f<sup> n</sup>''<sub>1</sub>, ''f<sup> n</sup>''<sub>2</sub>, ''f<sup> n</sup>''<sub>3</sub>, ...\n\nIn contemporary mathematical logic, the signature varies by application. Typical signatures in mathematics are {1, \u00d7} or just {\u00d7} for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, or {0, 1, +, \u00d7, <} for [[ordered field]]s. There are no restrictions on the number of non-logical symbols. The signature can be [[empty set|empty]], finite, or infinite, even [[uncountable]]. Uncountable signatures occur for example in modern proofs of the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]].\n\nIn this approach, every non-logical symbol is of one of the following types.\n# A '''predicate symbol''' (or '''relation symbol''') with some '''valence''' (or '''arity''', number of arguments) greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by uppercase letters ''P'', ''Q'', ''R'',... .\n#* Relations of valence 0 can be identified with [[propositional variable]]s. For example, ''P'', which can stand for any statement.\n#* For example, ''P''(''x'') is a predicate variable of valence 1. One possible interpretation is \"''x'' is a man\".\n#* ''Q''(''x'',''y'') is a predicate variable of valence 2. Possible interpretations include \"''x'' is greater than ''y''\" and \"''x'' is the father of ''y''\".\n# A '''function symbol''', with some valence greater than or equal to 0. These are often denoted by lowercase letters ''f'', ''g'', ''h'',... .\n#* Examples: ''f''(''x'') may be interpreted as for \"the father of ''x''\". In [[arithmetic]], it may stand for \"-x\". In [[set theory]], it may stand for \"the [[power set]] of x\". In arithmetic, ''g''(''x'',''y'') may stand for \"''x''+''y''\". In set theory, it may stand for \"the union of ''x'' and ''y''\".\n#* Function symbols of valence 0 are called '''constant symbols''', and are often denoted by lowercase letters at the beginning of the alphabet ''a'', ''b'', ''c'',... . The symbol ''a'' may stand for Socrates. In arithmetic, it may stand for 0. In set theory, such a constant may stand for the empty set.\n\nThe traditional approach can be recovered in the modern approach by simply specifying the \"custom\" signature to consist of the traditional sequences of non-logical symbols.\n\n===Formation rules===\nThe [[formation rule]]s define the terms and formulas of first order logic.<ref>[[Raymond Smullyan|Smullyan, R. M.]], ''First-order Logic'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Dover Publications]], 1968), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kgvhQ-oSZiUC&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 5].</ref> When terms and formulas are represented as strings of symbols, these rules can be used to write a [[formal grammar]] for terms and formulas. These rules are generally [[Context-free grammar|context-free]] (each production has a single symbol on the left side), except that the set of symbols may be allowed to be infinite and there may be many start symbols, for example the variables in the case of [[First-order logic#Terms|terms]].\n\n====Terms====\nThe set of '''[[Term (mathematics)|terms]]''' is [[inductive definition|inductively defined]] by the following rules:\n# '''Variables.''' Any variable is a term.\n# '''Functions.''' Any expression ''f''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) of ''n'' arguments (where each argument ''t''<sub>''i''</sub> is a term and ''f'' is a function symbol of valence ''n'') is a term. In particular, symbols denoting individual constants are nullary function symbols, and are thus terms.\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1 and 2 are terms. For example, no expression involving a predicate symbol is a term.\n\n====Formulas====\nThe set of '''[[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]]''' (also called '''well-formed formulas'''<ref>Some authors who use the term \"well-formed formula\" use \"formula\" to mean any string of symbols from the alphabet. However, most authors in mathematical logic use \"formula\" to mean \"well-formed formula\" and have no term for non-well-formed formulas. In every context, it is only the well-formed formulas that are of interest.</ref> or '''WFFs''') is inductively defined by the following rules:\n# '''Predicate symbols.''' If ''P'' is an ''n''-ary predicate symbol and ''t''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub> are terms then ''P''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>n</sub>) is a formula.\n# '''[[logical equality|Equality]].''' If the equality symbol is considered part of logic, and ''t''<sub>''1''</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub> are terms, then ''t''<sub>1</sub> = ''t''<sub>2</sub> is a formula.\n# '''Negation.''' If \u03c6 is a formula, then <math>\\lnot</math>\u03c6 is a formula.\n# '''Binary connectives.''' If \u03c6 and \u03c8 are formulas, then (\u03c6 <math>\\rightarrow</math> \u03c8) is a formula. Similar rules apply to other binary logical connectives.\n# '''Quantifiers.''' If <math>\\varphi</math>  is a formula and ''x'' is a variable, then <math>\\forall x \\varphi</math> (for all x, <math>\\varphi</math> holds) and <math>\\exists x \\varphi</math> (there exists x such that <math>\\varphi</math>) are formulas.\nOnly expressions which can be obtained by finitely many applications of rules 1\u20135 are formulas. The formulas obtained from the first two rules are said to be '''[[atomic formula]]s'''.\n\nFor example,\n:<math>\\forall x \\forall y (P(f(x)) \\rightarrow\\neg (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))</math>\nis a formula, if ''f'' is a unary function symbol, ''P'' a unary predicate symbol, and Q a ternary predicate symbol. On the other hand, <math>\\forall x\\, x \\rightarrow</math> is not a formula, although it is a string of symbols from the alphabet.\n\nThe role of the parentheses in the definition is to ensure that any formula can only be obtained in one way by following the inductive definition (in other words, there is a unique [[parse tree]] for each formula). This property is known as '''unique readability''' of formulas. There are many conventions for where parentheses are used in formulas. For example, some authors use colons or full stops instead of parentheses, or change the places in which parentheses are inserted. Each author's particular definition must be accompanied by a proof of unique readability.\n\nThis definition of a formula does not support defining an if-then-else function <tt>ite(c, a, b)</tt>, where \"c\" is a condition expressed as a formula, that would return \"a\" if c is true, and \"b\" if it is false. This is because both predicates and functions can only accept terms as parameters, but the first parameter is a formula.  Some languages built on first-order logic, such as SMT-LIB 2.0, add this.<ref>The SMT-LIB Standard: Version 2.0, by Clark Barrett, Aaron Stump, and Cesare Tinelli.  http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/language.shtml</ref>\n\n====Notational conventions====\nFor convenience, conventions have been developed about the precedence of the logical operators, to avoid the need to write parentheses in some cases. These rules are similar to the [[order of operations]] in arithmetic. A common convention is:\n* <math>\\lnot</math> is evaluated first\n* <math>\\land</math> and <math>\\lor</math> are evaluated next\n* Quantifiers are evaluated next\n* <math>\\to</math> is evaluated last.\nMoreover, extra punctuation not required by the definition may be inserted to make formulas easier to read. Thus the formula\n:<math>(\\lnot \\forall x P(x) \\to \\exists x \\lnot P(x))</math>\nmight be written as\n:<math>(\\lnot [\\forall x P(x)]) \\to \\exists x [\\lnot P(x)].</math>\n\nIn some fields, it is common to use infix notation for binary relations and functions, instead of the prefix notation defined above. For example, in arithmetic, one typically writes \"2 + 2 = 4\" instead of \"=(+(2,2),4)\". It is common to regard formulas in infix notation as abbreviations for the corresponding formulas in prefix notation, cf. also [[Term (logic)#Term structure vs. representation|term structure vs. representation]].\n\nThe definitions above use infix notation for binary connectives such as <math>\\to</math>. A less common convention is [[Polish notation]], in which one writes <math>\\rightarrow</math>, <math>\\wedge</math>, and so on in front of their arguments rather than between them. This convention allows all punctuation symbols to be discarded. Polish notation is compact and elegant, but rarely used in practice because it is hard for humans to read it. In Polish notation, the formula\n:<math>\\forall x \\forall y (P(f(x)) \\rightarrow\\neg (P(x) \\rightarrow Q(f(y),x,z)))</math>\nbecomes {{nowrap|1=\"\u2200x\u2200y\u2192Pfx\u00ac\u2192 PxQfyxz\".}}\n\n===<span id=\"sentence\"></span>Free and bound variables===\n{{Main article|Free variables and bound variables}}\n\nIn a formula, a variable may occur '''free''' or '''bound''' (or both). Intuitively, a variable occurrence is free in a formula if it is not quantified: in <math>\\forall y\\, P(x,y)</math>, the sole occurrence of variable ''x'' is free while that of ''y'' is bound. The free and bound variable occurrences in a formula are defined inductively as follows.\n# '''Atomic formulas.''' If \u03c6 is an atomic formula then ''x'' occurs free in \u03c6 if and only if ''x'' occurs in \u03c6. Moreover, there are no bound variables in any atomic formula.\n# '''Negation.''' ''x'' occurs free in <math>\\neg</math>\u03c6 if and only if ''x'' occurs free in \u03c6. ''x'' occurs bound in <math>\\neg</math>\u03c6 if and only if ''x'' occurs bound in \u03c6.\n# '''Binary connectives.''' ''x'' occurs free in (\u03c6 <math>\\rightarrow</math> \u03c8) if and only if ''x'' occurs free in either \u03c6 or \u03c8. ''x'' occurs bound in (\u03c6 <math>\\rightarrow</math> \u03c8) if and only if ''x'' occurs bound in either \u03c6 or \u03c8. The same rule applies to any other binary connective in place of <math>\\rightarrow</math>.\n# '''Quantifiers.''' ''x'' occurs free in <math>\\forall</math>''y'' \u03c6 if and only if x occurs free in \u03c6 and ''x'' is a different symbol from ''y''. Also, ''x'' occurs bound in <math>\\forall</math>''y'' \u03c6 if and only if ''x'' is ''y'' or ''x'' occurs bound in \u03c6.  The same rule holds with <math>\\exists</math> in place of <math>\\forall</math>.\n\nFor example, in <math>\\forall</math>''x'' <math>\\forall</math>''y'' (''P''(''x'')<math>\\rightarrow</math> ''Q''(''x'',''f''(''x''),''z'')), ''x'' and ''y'' occur only bound,<ref>''y'' occurs bound by rule 4, although it doesn't appear in any atomic subformula</ref>  ''z'' occurs only free, and ''w'' is neither because it does not occur in the formula.\n\nFree and bound variables of a formula need not be disjoint sets: in the formula <math>P(x) \\rightarrow \\forall x\\, Q(x)</math>, the first occurrence of ''x'', as argument of ''P'', is free while the second one, as argument of ''Q'', is bound.\n\nA formula in first-order logic with no free variable occurrences is called a '''first-order [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]'''. These are the formulas that will have well-defined [[truth value]]s under an interpretation. For example, whether a formula such as Phil(''x'') is true must depend on what ''x'' represents. But the sentence <math>\\exists x \\operatorname{Phil}(x)</math> will be either true or false in a given interpretation.\n\n===Example: ordered abelian groups===\nIn mathematics the language of ordered [[abelian groups]] has one constant symbol 0, one unary function symbol \u2212, one binary function symbol +, and one binary relation symbol \u2264. Then:\n*The expressions +(''x'', ''y'') and +(''x'', +(''y'', \u2212(''z''))) are '''terms'''. These are usually written as ''x'' + ''y'' and ''x'' + ''y'' \u2212 ''z''.\n*The expressions +(''x'', ''y'') = 0 and \u2264(+(''x'', +(''y'', \u2212(''z''))), +(''x'', ''y'')) are '''atomic formulas'''. These are usually written as ''x'' + ''y'' = 0 and ''x'' + ''y'' \u2212 ''z'' &nbsp;\u2264&nbsp; ''x'' + ''y''.\n*The expression <math>(\\forall x \\forall y \\, [\\mathop{\\leq}(\\mathop{+}(x, y), z) \\to \\forall x\\, \\forall y\\, \\mathop{+}(x, y) = 0)]</math> is a '''formula''', which is usually written as <math>\\forall x \\forall y ( x + y \\leq z) \\to \\forall x \\forall y (x+y = 0).</math> This formula has one free variable, ''z''.\n\nThe axioms for ordered abelian groups can be expressed as a set of sentences in the language. For example, the axiom stating that the group is commutative is usually written <math>(\\forall x)(\\forall y)[x+ y = y + x].</math>\n\n==Semantics==\nAn [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a first-order language assigns a denotation to all non-logical constants in that language. It also determines a [[domain of discourse]] that specifies the range of the quantifiers. The result is that each term is assigned an object that it represents, and each sentence is assigned a truth value. In this way, an interpretation provides semantic meaning to the terms and formulas of the language. The study of the interpretations of formal languages is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]]. What follows is a description of the standard or [[Truth definition#Tarski.27s Theory|Tarskian]] semantics for first-order logic. (It is also possible to define [[Game semantics#Classical logic|game semantics for first-order logic]], but aside from requiring the [[axiom of choice]], game semantics agree with Tarskian semantics for first-order logic, so game semantics will not be elaborated herein.)\n\nThe domain of discourse ''D'' is a nonempty set of \"objects\" of some kind. Intuitively, a first-order formula is a statement about these objects; for example, <math>\\exists x P(x)</math> states the existence of an object ''x'' such that the predicate ''P'' is true where referred to it. The domain of discourse is the set of considered objects. For example, one can take <math>D</math> to be the set of integer numbers.\n\nThe interpretation of a function symbol is a function. For example, if the domain of discourse consists of integers, a function symbol ''f'' of arity 2 can be interpreted as the function that gives the sum of its arguments. In other words, the symbol ''f'' is associated with the function ''I(f)'' which, in this interpretation, is addition.\n\nThe interpretation of a constant symbol is a function from the one-element set ''D''<sup>0</sup> to ''D'', which can be simply identified with an object in ''D''. For example, an interpretation may assign the value <math>I(c)=10</math> to the constant symbol <math>c</math>.\n\nThe interpretation of an ''n''-ary predicate symbol is a set of ''n''-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and ''n'' elements of the domain of discourse, one can tell whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation ''I(P)'' of a binary predicate symbol ''P'' may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate ''P'' would be true if its first argument is less than the second.\n\n===First-order structures===\n{{Main article|Structure (mathematical logic)}}\n\nThe most common way of specifying an interpretation (especially in mathematics) is to specify a '''structure''' (also called a '''model'''; see below). The structure consists of a nonempty set ''D'' that forms the domain of discourse and an interpretation ''I'' of the non-logical terms of the signature.  This interpretation is itself a function:\n* Each function symbol ''f'' of arity ''n'' is assigned a function ''I(f)'' from <math>D^n</math> to <math>D</math>. In particular, each constant symbol of the signature is assigned an individual in the domain of discourse.\n* Each predicate symbol ''P'' of arity ''n'' is assigned a relation ''I(P)'' over <math>D^n</math> or, equivalently, a function from <math>D^n</math> to <math> \\{\\mathrm{true, false}\\}</math>. Thus each predicate symbol is interpreted by a [[Boolean-valued function]] on ''D''.\n\n===Evaluation of truth values===\nA formula evaluates to true or false given an interpretation, and a '''variable assignment''' \u03bc that associates an element of the domain of discourse with each variable. The reason that a variable assignment is required is to give meanings to formulas with free variables, such as <math>y = x</math>. The truth value of this formula changes depending on whether ''x'' and ''y'' denote the same individual.\n\nFirst, the variable assignment \u03bc can be extended to all terms of the language, with the result that each term maps to a single element of the domain of discourse. The following rules are used to make this assignment:\n# '''Variables.''' Each variable ''x'' evaluates to \u03bc(''x'')\n# '''Functions.''' Given terms <math>t_1, \\ldots, t_n</math> that have been evaluated to elements <math>d_1, \\ldots, d_n</math> of the domain of discourse, and a ''n''-ary function symbol ''f'', the term <math>f(t_1, \\ldots, t_n)</math> evaluates to <math>(I(f))(d_1,\\ldots,d_n)</math>.\n\nNext, each formula is assigned a truth value. The inductive definition used to make this assignment is called the [[T-schema]].\n# '''Atomic formulas (1).''' A formula <math>P(t_1,\\ldots,t_n)</math> is associated the value true or false depending on whether <math>\\langle v_1,\\ldots,v_n \\rangle \\in I(P)</math>, where <math>v_1,\\ldots,v_n</math> are the evaluation of the terms <math>t_1,\\ldots,t_n</math> and <math>I(P)</math> is the interpretation of <math>P</math>, which by assumption is a subset of <math>D^n</math>.\n# '''Atomic formulas (2).''' A formula <math>t_1 = t_2</math> is assigned true if <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math> evaluate to the same object of the domain of discourse (see the section on equality below).\n# '''Logical connectives.''' A formula in the form <math>\\neg \\phi</math>, <math>\\phi \\rightarrow\n\\psi</math>, etc. is evaluated according to the [[truth table]] for the connective in question, as in propositional logic.\n# '''Existential quantifiers.''' A formula <math>\\exists x \\phi(x)</math> is true according to ''M'' and <math>\\mu</math> if there exists an evaluation <math>\\mu'</math> of the variables that only differs from <math>\\mu</math> regarding the evaluation of ''x'' and such that \u03c6 is true according to the interpretation ''M'' and the variable assignment <math>\\mu'</math>. This formal definition captures the idea that <math>\\exists x \\phi(x)</math> is true if and only if there is a way to choose a value for ''x'' such that \u03c6(''x'') is satisfied.\n# '''Universal quantifiers.''' A formula <math>\\forall x \\phi(x)</math> is true according to ''M'' and <math>\\mu</math> if \u03c6(''x'') is true for every pair composed by the interpretation ''M'' and some variable assignment <math>\\mu'</math> that differs from <math>\\mu</math> only on the value of ''x''. This captures the idea that <math>\\forall x \\phi(x)</math> is true if every possible choice of a value for ''x'' causes \u03c6(''x'') to be true.\n\nIf a formula does not contain free variables, and so is a sentence, then the initial variable assignment does not affect its truth value. In other words, a sentence is true according to ''M'' and <math>\\mu</math> if and only if it is true according to ''M'' and every other variable assignment <math>\\mu'</math>.\n\nThere is a second common approach to defining truth values that does not rely on variable assignment functions. Instead, given an interpretation ''M'', one first adds to the signature a collection of constant symbols, one for each element of the domain of discourse in ''M''; say that for each ''d'' in the domain the constant symbol ''c''<sub>''d''</sub> is fixed. The interpretation is extended so that each new constant symbol is assigned to its corresponding element of the domain. One now defines truth for quantified formulas syntactically, as follows:\n# '''Existential quantifiers (alternate).''' A formula <math>\\exists x \\phi(x)</math> is true according to ''M'' if there is some ''d'' in the domain of discourse such that <math>\\phi(c_d)</math> holds. Here <math>\\phi(c_d)</math> is the result of substituting  ''c''<sub>''d''</sub> for every free occurrence of ''x'' in \u03c6.\n# '''Universal quantifiers (alternate).''' A formula <math>\\forall x \\phi(x)</math> is true according to ''M'' if, for every ''d'' in the domain of discourse, <math>\\phi(c_d)</math> is true according to ''M''.\nThis alternate approach gives exactly the same truth values to all sentences as the approach via variable assignments.\n\n===Validity, satisfiability, and logical consequence===\n{{see also|Satisfiability}}\nIf a sentence \u03c6 evaluates to True under a given interpretation ''M'', one says that ''M'' '''satisfies''' \u03c6; this is denoted <math>M \\vDash \\varphi</math>. A sentence is '''satisfiable''' if there is some interpretation under which it is true.\n\nSatisfiability of formulas with free variables is more complicated, because an interpretation on its own does not determine the truth value of such a formula. The most common convention is that a formula with free variables is said to be satisfied by an interpretation if the formula remains true regardless which individuals from the domain of discourse are assigned to its free variables. This has the same effect as saying that a formula is satisfied if and only if its [[universal closure]] is satisfied.\n\nA formula is '''logically valid''' (or simply '''valid''') if it is true in every interpretation. These formulas play a role similar to [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in propositional logic.\n\nA formula \u03c6 is a '''logical consequence''' of a formula \u03c8 if every interpretation that makes \u03c8 true also makes \u03c6 true. In this case one says that \u03c6 is logically implied by \u03c8.\n\n===Algebraizations===\nAn alternate approach to the semantics of first-order logic proceeds via [[abstract algebra]]. This approach generalizes the  [[Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra]]s of propositional logic.  There are three ways of eliminating quantified variables from first-order logic that do not involve replacing quantifiers with other variable binding term operators:\n*[[Cylindric algebra]], by [[Alfred Tarski]] and his coworkers;\n*[[Polyadic algebra]], by [[Paul Halmos]];\n*[[Predicate functor logic]], mainly due to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Willard Quine]].\nThese [[algebra]]s are all [[lattice (order)|lattices]] that properly extend the [[two-element Boolean algebra]].\n\nTarski and Givant (1987) showed that the fragment of first-order logic that has no [[atomic sentence]] lying in the scope of more than three quantifiers has the same expressive power as [[relation algebra]]. This fragment is of great interest because it suffices for [[Peano arithmetic]] and most [[axiomatic set theory]], including the canonical [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]. They also prove that first-order logic with a primitive [[ordered pair]] is equivalent to a relation algebra with two ordered pair [[projection function]]s.\n\n===First-order theories, models, and elementary classes===\nA '''first-order theory''' of a particular signature is a set of [[axiom]]s, which are sentences consisting of symbols from that signature. The set of axioms is often finite or [[recursively enumerable]], in which case the theory is called '''effective'''. Some authors require theories to also include all logical consequences of the axioms. The axioms are considered to hold within the theory and from them other sentences that hold within the theory can be derived.\n\nA first-order structure that satisfies all sentences in a given theory is said to be a '''model''' of the theory. An '''[[elementary class]]''' is the set of all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes are a main subject of study in [[model theory]].\n\nMany theories have an '''[[intended interpretation]]''', a certain model that is kept in mind when studying the theory. For example, the intended interpretation of [[Peano arithmetic]] consists of the usual [[natural number]]s with their usual operations. However, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem shows that most first-order theories will also have other, [[nonstandard model]]s.\n\nA theory is '''[[consistency|consistent]]''' if it is not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory. A theory is '''[[complete theory|complete]]''' if, for every formula in its signature, either that formula or its negation is a logical consequence of the axioms of the theory. [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] shows that effective first-order theories that include a sufficient portion of the theory of the natural numbers can never be both consistent and complete.\n\nFor more information on this subject see [[List of first-order theories]] and [[Theory (mathematical logic)]]\n\n===Empty domains===\n{{Main article|Empty domain}}\nThe definition above requires that the domain of discourse of any interpretation must be a nonempty set. There are settings, such as [[inclusive logic]], where empty domains are permitted. Moreover, if a class of algebraic structures includes an empty structure (for example, there is an empty [[poset]]), that class can only be an elementary class in first-order logic if empty domains are permitted or the empty structure is removed from the class.\n\nThere are several difficulties with empty domains, however:\n* Many common rules of inference are only valid when the domain of discourse is required to be nonempty. One example is the rule stating that <math>\\phi \\lor \\exists x \\psi</math> implies <math>\\exists x (\\phi \\lor \\psi)</math> when ''x'' is not a free variable in <math>\\phi</math>. This rule, which is used to put formulas into [[prenex normal form]], is sound in nonempty domains, but unsound if the empty domain is permitted.\n* The definition of truth in an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, because there are no variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) This truth definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (\u03bc above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that this truth value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.\nThus, when the empty domain is permitted, it must often be treated as a special case. Most authors, however, simply exclude the empty domain by definition.\n\n==Deductive systems==\nA '''deductive system''' is used to demonstrate, on a purely syntactic basis, that one formula is a logical consequence of another formula. There are many such systems for first-order logic, including [[Hilbert-style deductive system]]s, [[natural deduction]], the [[sequent calculus]], the [[Method of analytic tableaux|tableaux method]], and [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]. These share the common property that a deduction is a finite syntactic object; the format of this object, and the way it is constructed, vary widely.  These finite deductions themselves are often called '''derivations''' in proof theory. They are also often called proofs, but are completely formalized unlike natural-language [[mathematical proofs]].\n\nA deductive system is '''sound''' if any formula that can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is '''complete''' if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems discussed in this article are both sound and complete. They also share the property that it is possible to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called '''effective'''.\n\nA key property of deductive systems is that they are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.\n\nIn general, logical consequence in first-order logic is only [[semidecidability|semidecidable]]: if a sentence A logically implies a sentence B then this can be discovered (for example, by searching for a proof until one is found, using some effective, sound, complete proof system). However, if A does not logically imply B, this does not mean that A logically implies the negation of B. There is no effective procedure that, given formulas A and B, always correctly decides whether A logically implies B.\n\n===Rules of inference===\n{{Further information|List of rules of inference}}\nA '''[[rule of inference]]''' states that, given a particular formula (or set of formulas) with a certain property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule is sound (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity in the sense that whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.\n\nFor example, one common rule of inference is the '''rule of substitution'''. If ''t'' is a term and \u03c6 is a formula possibly containing the variable ''x'', then \u03c6[''t''/''x''] is the result of replacing all free instances of ''x'' by ''t'' in \u03c6. The substitution rule states that for any \u03c6 and any term ''t'', one can conclude \u03c6[''t''/''x''] from \u03c6 provided that no free variable of ''t'' becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of ''t'' becomes bound, then to substitute ''t'' for ''x'' it is first necessary to change the bound variables of \u03c6 to differ from the free variables of ''t''.)\n\nTo see why the restriction on bound variables is necessary, consider the logically valid formula \u03c6 given by <math>\\exists x (x = y)</math>, in the signature of (0,1,+,\u00d7,=) of arithmetic. If ''t'' is the term \"x + 1\", the formula \u03c6[''t''/''y''] is <math>\\exists x ( x = x+1)</math>, which will be false in many interpretations. The problem is that the free variable ''x'' of ''t''  became bound during the substitution. The intended replacement can be obtained by renaming the bound variable ''x'' of \u03c6 to something else, say ''z'', so that the formula after substitution is <math>\\exists z ( z = x+1)</math>, which is again logically valid.\n\nThe substitution rule demonstrates several common aspects of rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; one can tell whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, as is often the case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.\n\n===Hilbert-style systems and natural deduction===\nA deduction in a Hilbert-style deductive system is a list of formulas, each of which is a '''logical axiom''', a hypothesis that has been assumed for the derivation at hand, or follows from previous formulas via a rule of inference. The logical axioms consist of several [[axiom schema]]s of logically valid formulas; these encompass a significant amount of propositional logic. The rules of inference enable the manipulation of quantifiers. Typical Hilbert-style systems have a small number of rules of inference, along with several infinite schemas of logical axioms. It is common to have only [[modus ponens]] and [[universal generalization]] as rules of inference.\n\nNatural deduction systems resemble Hilbert-style systems in that a deduction is a finite list of formulas. However, natural deduction systems have no logical axioms; they compensate by adding additional rules of inference that can be used to manipulate the logical connectives in formulas in the proof.\n\n===Sequent calculus===\n{{Further information | Sequent calculus}}\n\nThe sequent calculus was developed to study the properties of natural deduction systems. Instead of working with one formula at a time, it uses  '''sequents''', which are expressions of the form\n:<math>A_1, \\ldots, A_n \\vdash B_1, \\ldots, B_k,</math>\nwhere A<sub>1</sub>, ..., A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, ..., B<sub>''k''</sub> are formulas and the turnstile symbol <math>\\vdash</math> is used as punctuation to separate the two halves. Intuitively, a sequent expresses the idea that <math>(A_1 \\land \\cdots\\land A_n)</math> implies <math>(B_1\\lor\\cdots\\lor B_k)</math>.\n\n===Tableaux method===\n[[File:Prop-tableau-4.svg|thumb|right|150px|A tableaux proof for the [[propositional logic|propositional]] formula {{nowrap|1=((a \u2228 \u00acb) \u039b b) \u2192 a.}}]]\n\n{{Further information | Method of analytic tableaux}}\n\nUnlike the methods just described, the derivations in the tableaux method are not lists of formulas. Instead, a derivation is a tree of formulas. To show that a formula A is provable, the tableaux method attempts to demonstrate that the negation of A is unsatisfiable. The tree of the derivation has <math>\\lnot A</math> at its root; the tree branches in a way that reflects the structure of the formula. For example, to show that <math>C \\lor D</math> is unsatisfiable requires showing that C and D are each unsatisfiable; this corresponds to a branching point in the tree with parent <math>C \\lor D</math> and children C and D.\n\n===Resolution===\nThe [[resolution (logic)|resolution rule]] is a single rule of inference that, together with [[Unification (computing)#Definition of unification for first-order logic|unification]], is sound and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.\n\nThe resolution method works only with formulas that are disjunctions of atomic formulas; arbitrary formulas must first be converted to this form through [[Skolemization]]. The resolution rule states that from the hypotheses <math>A_1 \\lor\\cdots\\lor A_k \\lor C</math> and <math>B_1\\lor\\cdots\\lor B_l\\lor\\lnot C</math>, the conclusion <math>A_1\\lor\\cdots\\lor A_k\\lor B_1\\lor\\cdots\\lor B_l</math> can be obtained.\n\n===Provable identities===\nMany identities can be proved, which establish equivalences between particular formulas. These identities allow for rearranging formulas by moving quantifiers across other connectives, and are useful for putting formulas in [[prenex normal form]]. Some provable identities include:\n:<math>\\lnot \\forall x \\, P(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists x \\, \\lnot P(x)</math>\n:<math>\\lnot \\exists x \\, P(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\forall x \\, \\lnot P(x)</math>\n:<math>\\forall x \\, \\forall y \\, P(x,y) \\Leftrightarrow \\forall y \\, \\forall x \\, P(x,y)</math>\n:<math>\\exists x \\, \\exists y \\, P(x,y) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists y \\, \\exists x \\, P(x,y)</math>\n:<math>\\forall x \\, P(x) \\land \\forall x \\, Q(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\forall x \\, (P(x) \\land Q(x)) </math>\n:<math>\\exists x \\, P(x) \\lor \\exists x \\, Q(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists x \\, (P(x) \\lor Q(x)) </math>\n:<math>P \\land \\exists x \\, Q(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\exists x \\, (P \\land Q(x)) </math> (where <math>x</math> must not occur free in <math>P</math>)\n:<math>P \\lor \\forall x \\, Q(x) \\Leftrightarrow \\forall x \\, (P \\lor Q(x)) </math> (where <math>x</math> must not occur free in <math>P</math>)\n\n==Equality and its axioms==\nThere are several different conventions for using equality (or identity) in first-order logic. The most common convention, known as '''first-order logic with equality''', includes the equality symbol as a primitive logical symbol which is always interpreted as the real equality relation between members of the domain of discourse, such that the \"two\" given members are the same member. This approach also adds certain axioms about equality to the deductive system employed. These equality axioms are:{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n# '''Reflexivity'''. For each variable ''x'', ''x'' = ''x''.\n# '''Substitution for functions.''' For all variables ''x'' and ''y'', and any function symbol ''f'',\n#:''x'' = ''y'' \u2192 ''f''(...,''x'',...) = ''f''(...,''y'',...).\n# '''Substitution for formulas'''. For any variables ''x'' and ''y'' and any formula \u03c6(''x''), if \u03c6' is obtained by replacing any number of free occurrences of ''x'' in \u03c6 with ''y'', such that these remain free occurrences of ''y'', then\n#:''x'' = ''y'' \u2192 (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6').\n\nThese are [[axiom schema]]s, each of which specifies an infinite set of axioms. The third schema is known as '''[[Identity of indiscernibles#Indiscernibility of identicals|Leibniz's law]]''', \"the principle of substitutivity\", \"the indiscernibility of identicals\", or \"the replacement property\". The second schema, involving the function symbol ''f'', is (equivalent to) a special case of the third schema, using the formula\n:''x'' = ''y'' \u2192 (''f''(...,''x'',...) = z \u2192 ''f''(...,''y'',...) = z).\n\nMany other properties of equality are consequences of the axioms above, for example:\n# '''Symmetry.''' If ''x'' = ''y'' then ''y'' = ''x''.\n# '''Transitivity.''' If ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'' then ''x'' = ''z''.\n\n===First-order logic without equality===\nAn alternate approach considers the equality relation to be a non-logical symbol. This convention is known as '''first-order logic without equality'''. If an equality relation is included in the signature, the axioms of equality must now be added to the theories under consideration, if desired, instead of being considered rules of logic. The main difference between this method and first-order logic with equality is that an interpretation may now interpret two distinct individuals as \"equal\" (although, by Leibniz's law, these will satisfy exactly the same formulas under any interpretation). That is, the equality relation may now be interpreted by an arbitrary [[equivalence relation]] on the domain of discourse that is [[congruence relation|congruent]] with respect to the functions and relations of the interpretation.\n\nWhen this second convention is followed, the term '''normal model''' is used to refer to an interpretation where no distinct individuals ''a'' and ''b'' satisfy ''a'' = ''b''. In first-order logic with equality, only normal models are considered, and so there is no term for a model other than a normal model. When first-order logic without equality is studied, it is necessary to amend the statements of results such as the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] so that only normal models are considered.\n\nFirst-order logic without equality is often employed in the context of [[second-order arithmetic]] and other higher-order theories of arithmetic, where the equality relation between sets of natural numbers is usually omitted.\n\n===Defining equality within a theory===\nIf a theory has a binary formula ''A''(''x'',''y'') which satisfies reflexivity and Leibniz's law, the theory is said to have equality, or to be a theory with equality. The theory may not have all instances of the above schemas as axioms, but rather as derivable theorems. For example, in theories with no function symbols and a finite number of relations, it is possible to [[definitional extension|define]] equality in terms of the relations, by defining the two terms ''s'' and ''t'' to be equal if any relation is unchanged by changing ''s'' to ''t'' in any argument.\n\nSome theories allow other ''ad hoc'' definitions of equality:\n* In the theory of [[partial order]]s with one relation symbol \u2264, one could define ''s'' = ''t'' to be an abbreviation for ''s'' \u2264 ''t'' <math>\\wedge</math> ''t'' \u2264 ''s''.\n* In set theory with one relation <math>\\in</math>, one may define ''s'' = ''t'' to be an abbreviation for <math>\\forall</math>''x'' (''s'' <math>\\in</math> ''x'' <math>\\leftrightarrow</math> ''t'' <math>\\in</math> ''x'') <math>\\wedge</math> <math>\\forall</math>''x'' (''x'' <math>\\in</math> ''s'' <math>\\leftrightarrow</math> ''x'' <math>\\in</math>  ''t''). This definition of equality then automatically satisfies the axioms for equality. In this case, one should replace the usual [[axiom of extensionality]], which can be stated as <math>\\forall x \\forall y [ \\forall z (z \\in x \\Leftrightarrow z \\in y) \\Rightarrow x = y]</math>, with an alternative formulation <math>\\forall x \\forall y [ \\forall z (z \\in x \\Leftrightarrow z \\in y) \\Rightarrow \\forall z (x \\in z \\Leftrightarrow y \\in z) ]</math>, which says that if  sets ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they also belong to the same sets.\n\n==Metalogical properties==\nOne motivation for the use of first-order logic, rather than [[higher-order logic]], is that first-order logic has many [[metalogic]]al properties that stronger logics do not have. These results concern general properties of first-order logic itself, rather than properties of individual theories. They provide fundamental tools for the construction of models of first-order theories.\n\n===Completeness and undecidability===\n[[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]], proved by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] in 1929, establishes that there are sound, complete, effective deductive systems for first-order logic, and thus the first-order logical consequence relation is captured by finite provability. Naively, the statement that a formula \u03c6 logically implies a formula \u03c8 depends on every model of \u03c6; these models will in general be of arbitrarily large cardinality, and so logical consequence cannot be effectively verified by checking every model. However, it is possible to enumerate all finite derivations and search for a derivation of \u03c8 from \u03c6. If \u03c8 is logically implied by \u03c6, such a derivation will eventually be found. Thus first-order logical consequence is [[semidecidable]]: it is possible to make an effective enumeration of all pairs of sentences (\u03c6,\u03c8) such that \u03c8 is a logical consequence of&nbsp;\u03c6.\n\nUnlike [[propositional logic]], first-order logic is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]] (although semidecidable), provided that the language has at least one predicate of arity at least 2 (other than equality). This means that there is no [[decision procedure]] that determines whether arbitrary formulas are logically valid. This result was established independently by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] in 1936 and 1937, respectively, giving a negative answer to the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] posed by [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Their proofs demonstrate a connection between the unsolvability of the decision problem for first-order logic and the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]].\n\nThere are systems weaker than full first-order logic for which the logical consequence relation is decidable. These include propositional logic and [[monadic predicate logic]], which is first-order logic restricted to unary predicate symbols and no function symbols. Other logics with no function symbols which are decidable are the [[guarded fragment]] of first-order logic, as well as [[two-variable logic]]. The [[Bernays\u2013Sch\u00f6nfinkel class]] of first-order formulas is also decidable. Decidable subsets of first-order logic are also studied in the framework of [[description logics]].\n\n===The L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem===\nThe [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] shows that if a first-order theory of [[cardinality]] \u03bb has an infinite model, then it has models of every infinite cardinality greater than or equal to \u03bb. One of the earliest results in [[model theory]], it implies that it is not possible to characterize [[countable set|countability]] or uncountability in a first-order language. That is, there is no first-order formula \u03c6(''x'') such that an arbitrary structure M satisfies \u03c6 if and only if the domain of discourse of M is countable (or, in the second case, uncountable).\n\nThe L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem implies that infinite structures cannot be [[categorical theory|categorically]] axiomatized in first-order logic. For example, there is no first-order theory whose only model is the real line: any first-order theory with an infinite model also has a model of cardinality larger than the continuum. Since the real line is infinite, any theory satisfied by the real line is also satisfied by some [[nonstandard model]]s. When the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem is applied to first-order set theories, the nonintuitive consequences are known as [[Skolem's paradox]].\n\n===The compactness theorem===\nThe [[compactness theorem]] states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. This implies that if a formula is a logical consequence of an infinite set of first-order axioms, then it is a logical consequence of some finite number of those axioms. This theorem was proved first by Kurt G\u00f6del as a consequence of the completeness theorem, but many additional proofs have been obtained over time. It is a central tool in model theory, providing a fundamental method for constructing models.\n\nThe compactness theorem has a limiting effect on which collections of first-order structures are elementary classes. For example, the compactness theorem implies that any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models has an infinite model. Thus the class of all finite [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] is not an elementary class (the same holds for many other algebraic structures).\n\nThere are also more subtle limitations of first-order logic that are implied by the compactness theorem. For example, in computer science, many situations can be modeled as a [[directed graph]] of states (nodes) and connections (directed edges).  Validating such a system may require showing that no \"bad\" state can be reached from any \"good\" state. Thus one seeks to determine if the good and bad states are in different [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]] of the graph. However, the compactness theorem can be used to show that connected graphs are not an elementary class in first-order logic, and there is no formula \u03c6(''x'',''y'') of first-order logic, in the [[logic of graphs]], that expresses the idea that there is a path from ''x'' to ''y''. Connectedness can be expressed in [[second-order logic]], however, but not with only existential set quantifiers, as <math>\\Sigma_1^1</math> also enjoys compactness.\n\n===Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem===\n{{Main article|Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem}}\n\n[[Per Lindstr\u00f6m]] showed that the metalogical properties just discussed actually characterize first-order logic in the sense that no stronger logic can also have those properties (Ebbinghaus and Flum 1994, Chapter XIII). Lindstr\u00f6m defined a class of abstract logical systems, and a rigorous definition of the relative strength of a member of this class. He established two theorems for systems of this type:\n* A logical system satisfying Lindstr\u00f6m's definition that contains first-order logic and satisfies both the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and the compactness theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.\n* A logical system satisfying Lindstr\u00f6m's definition that has a semidecidable logical consequence relation and satisfies the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem must be equivalent to first-order logic.\n\n==Limitations==\nAlthough first-order logic is sufficient for formalizing much of mathematics, and is commonly used in computer science and other fields, it has certain limitations. These include limitations on its expressiveness and limitations of the fragments of natural languages that it can describe.\n\nFor instance, first-order logic is undecidable, meaning a sound, complete and terminating decision algorithm for provability is impossible. This has led to the study of interesting decidable fragments such as C<sub>2</sub>, first-order logic with two variables and the counting quantifiers <math>\\exists^{\\ge n}</math> and <math>\\exists^{\\le n}</math> (these quantifiers are, respectively, \"there exists at least ''n''\" and \"there exists at most ''n''\").<ref>Horrocks 2010{{Citation not found}}</ref>\n\n===Expressiveness===\nThe [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] shows that if a first-order theory has any infinite model, then it has infinite models of every cardinality. In particular, no first-order theory with an infinite model can be [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]. Thus there is no first-order theory whose only model has the set of natural numbers as its domain, or whose only model has the set of real numbers as its domain.  Many extensions of first-order logic, including infinitary logics and higher-order logics, are more expressive in the sense that they do permit categorical axiomatizations of the natural numbers or real numbers. This expressiveness comes at a metalogical cost, however: by [[Lindstr\u00f6m's theorem]], the compactness theorem and the downward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem cannot hold in any logic stronger than first-order.\n\n===Formalizing natural languages===\nFirst-order logic is able to formalize many simple quantifier constructions in natural language, such as \"every person who lives in Perth lives in Australia\". But there are many more complicated features of natural language that cannot be expressed in (single-sorted) first-order logic. \"Any logical system which is appropriate as an instrument for the analysis of natural language needs a much richer structure than first-order predicate logic\".<ref>Gamut 1991, p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of these are inessential in the sense that they merely change notation without affecting the semantics. Others change the expressive power more significantly, by extending the semantics through additional quantifiers or other new logical symbols. For example, infinitary logics permit formulas of infinite size, and modal logics add symbols for possibility and necessity.\n\n===Restricted languages===\nFirst-order logic can be studied in languages with fewer logical symbols than were described above.\n* Because <math>\\exists x \\phi(x)</math> can be expressed as <math>\\neg \\forall x \\neg \\phi(x)</math>, and <math>\\forall x \\phi(x)</math> can be expressed as <math>\\neg \\exists x \\neg \\phi(x)</math>, either of the two quantifiers <math>\\exists</math> and <math>\\forall</math> can be dropped.\n* Since <math>\\phi \\lor \\psi</math> can be expressed as <math>\\lnot (\\lnot \\phi \\land \\lnot \\psi)</math> and <math>\\phi \\land \\psi</math> can be expressed as <math>\\lnot(\\lnot \\phi \\lor \\lnot \\psi)</math>, either <math>\\vee</math> or <math>\\wedge</math> can be dropped. In other words, it is sufficient to have <math>\\neg</math> and <math>\\vee</math>, or <math>\\neg</math> and <math>\\wedge</math>, as the only logical connectives.\n* Similarly, it is sufficient to have only <math>\\neg</math> and <math>\\rightarrow</math> as logical connectives, or to have only the [[Sheffer stroke]] (NAND) or the [[Peirce arrow]] (NOR) operator.\n* It is possible to entirely avoid function symbols and constant symbols, rewriting them via predicate symbols in an appropriate way. For example, instead of using a constant symbol <math> \\; 0 </math>  one may use a predicate  <math> \\; 0(x) </math>  (interpreted as  <math> \\; x=0 </math> ), and replace every predicate such as  <math>\\; P(0,y) </math> with <math> \\forall x \\;(0(x) \\rightarrow P(x,y)) </math>. A function such as <math> f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) </math> will similarly be replaced by a predicate  <math> F(x_1,x_2,...,x_n,y) </math> interpreted as <math> y = f(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) </math>. This change requires adding additional axioms to the theory at hand, so that interpretations of the predicate symbols used have the correct semantics.\n\nRestrictions such as these are useful as a technique to reduce the number of inference rules or axiom schemas in deductive systems, which leads to shorter proofs of metalogical results. The cost of the restrictions is that it becomes more difficult to express natural-language statements in the formal system at hand, because the logical connectives used in the natural language statements must be replaced by their (longer) definitions in terms of the restricted collection of logical connectives. Similarly, derivations in the limited systems may be longer than derivations in systems that include additional connectives. There is thus a trade-off between the ease of working within the formal system and the ease of proving results about the formal system.\n\nIt is also possible to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a [[pairing function]]. This is a function of arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an [[ordered pair]] containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case it is necessary that the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.\n\n===Many-sorted logic===\n{{main|Many-sorted logic}}\n{{unreferenced section|reason=delocalize \"citation needed\" tag; the entire second paragraph is what is challenged|date=June 2013}}\nOrdinary first-order interpretations have a single domain of discourse over which all quantifiers range. '''Many-sorted first-order logic''' allows variables to have different '''sorts''', which have different domains. This is also called '''typed first-order logic''', and the sorts called '''types''' (as in [[data type]]), but it is not the same as first-order [[type theory]]. Many-sorted first-order logic is often used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].\n\nWhen there are only finitely many sorts in a theory, many-sorted first-order logic can be reduced to single-sorted first-order logic.<ref>\nHerbert Enderton. \"A Mathematical Introduction to Logic\" (2nd Edition). Academic Press, 2001, pp.296-299.</ref> \nOne introduces into the single-sorted theory a unary predicate symbol for each sort in the many-sorted theory, and adds an axiom saying that these unary predicates partition the domain of discourse. For example, if there are two sorts, one adds predicate symbols <math>P_1(x)</math> and <math>P_2(x)</math> and the axiom\n:<math>\\forall x ( P_1(x) \\lor P_2(x)) \\land \\lnot \\exists x (P_1(x) \\land P_2(x))</math>.\nThen the elements satisfying <math>P_1</math> are thought of as elements of the first sort, and elements satisfying <math>P_2</math> as elements of the second sort. One can quantify over each sort by using the corresponding predicate symbol to limit the range of quantification. For example, to say there is an element of the first sort satisfying formula \u03c6(''x''), one writes\n:<math>\\exists x (P_1(x) \\land \\phi(x))</math>.\n\n===Additional quantifiers===\nAdditional quantifiers can be added to first-order logic.\n* Sometimes it is useful to say that \"''P(x)'' holds for exactly one ''x''\", which can be expressed as <math>\\exists!</math>''x'' ''P''(''x'').  This notation, called [[uniqueness quantification]], may be taken to abbreviate a formula such as <math>\\exists</math>''x'' (''P''(''x'')  <math>\\wedge\\forall</math>''y'' (''P''(''y'') <math>\\rightarrow</math> (''x'' = ''y''))).\n*'''First-order logic with extra quantifiers''' has new quantifiers ''Qx'',..., with meanings such as \"there are many ''x'' such that ...\". Also see [[branching quantifier]]s and the [[plural quantification|plural quantifier]]s of [[George Boolos]] and others.\n* '''[[Bounded quantifier]]s''' are often used in the study of set theory or arithmetic.\n\n===Infinitary logics===\n{{Main article|Infinitary logic}}\nInfinitary logic allows infinitely long sentences. For example, one may allow a conjunction or disjunction of infinitely many formulas, or quantification over infinitely many variables. Infinitely long sentences arise in areas of mathematics including  [[topology]] and [[model theory]].\n\nInfinitary logic generalizes first-order logic to allow formulas of infinite length. The most common way in which formulas can become infinite is through infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. However, it is also possible to admit generalized signatures in which function and relation symbols are allowed to have infinite arities, or in which quantifiers can bind infinitely many variables. Because an infinite formula cannot be represented by a finite string, it is necessary to choose some other representation of formulas; the usual representation in this context is a tree. Thus formulas are, essentially, identified with their parse trees, rather than with the strings being parsed.\n\nThe most commonly studied infinitary logics are denoted ''L''<sub>\u03b1\u03b2</sub>, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are each either [[cardinal number]]s or the symbol \u221e. In this notation, ordinary first-order logic is ''L''<sub>\u03c9\u03c9</sub>.\nIn the logic ''L''<sub>\u221e\u03c9</sub>, arbitrary conjunctions or disjunctions are allowed when building formulas, and there is an unlimited supply of variables. More generally, the logic that permits conjunctions or disjunctions with less than \u03ba constituents is known as ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u03c9</sub>. For example, ''L''<sub>\u03c9<sub>1</sub>\u03c9</sub> permits [[countable set|countable]] conjunctions and disjunctions.\n\nThe set of free variables in a formula of ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u03c9</sub> can have any cardinality strictly less than \u03ba, yet only finitely many of them can be in the scope of any quantifier when a formula appears as a subformula of another.<ref>Some authors only admit formulas with finitely many free variables in ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u03c9</sub>, and more generally only formulas with <&nbsp;\u03bb free variables in ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u03bb</sub>.</ref> In other infinitary logics, a subformula may be in the scope of infinitely many quantifiers. For example, in ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u221e</sub>, a single universal or existential quantifier may bind arbitrarily many variables simultaneously. Similarly, the logic ''L''<sub>\u03ba\u03bb</sub> permits simultaneous quantification over fewer than \u03bb variables, as well as conjunctions and disjunctions of size less than \u03ba.\n\n===Non-classical and modal logics===\n*'''[[intuitionistic logic|Intuitionistic first-order logic]]''' uses intuitionistic rather than classical propositional calculus; for example, \u00ac\u00ac\u03c6 need not be equivalent to \u03c6.\n*First-order '''[[modal logic]]''' allows one to describe other possible worlds as well as this contingently true world which we inhabit. In some versions, the set of possible worlds varies depending on which possible world one inhabits. Modal logic has extra ''modal operators'' with meanings which can be characterized informally as, for example  \"it is necessary that \u03c6\" (true in all possible worlds) and \"it is possible that \u03c6\" (true in some possible world). With standard first-order logic we have a single domain and each predicate is assigned one extension. With first-order modal logic we have a ''domain function'' that assigns each possible world its own domain, so that each predicate gets an extension only relative to these possible worlds. This allows us to model cases where, for example, Alex is a Philosopher, but might have been a Mathematician, and might not have existed at all. In the first possible world ''P''(''a'') is true, in the second ''P''(''a'') is false, and in the third possible world there is no ''a'' in the domain at all.\n*'''[[t-norm fuzzy logics|first-order fuzzy logics]]''' are first-order extensions of propositional fuzzy logics rather than classical [[propositional calculus]].\n\n===Fixpoint logic===\n'''Fixpoint logic''' extends first-order logic by adding the closure under the least fixed points of positive operators.<ref>{{cite book | title=Computer Science Logic: 6th Workshop, CSL'92, San Miniato, Italy, September 28 - October 2, 1992.

Thus\n:<math>\\exists a ( \\text{Phil}(a))</math>\nis a legal first-order formula, but\n:<math>\\exists \\text{Phil} ( \\text{Phil}(a))</math>\nis not, in most formalizations of first-order logic. [[Second-order logic]] extends first-order logic by adding the latter type of quantification. Other [[higher-order logic]]s allow quantification over even higher [[type theory|types]] than second-order logic permits. These higher types include relations between relations, functions from relations to relations between relations, and other higher-type objects.  Thus the \"first\" in first-order logic describes the type of objects that can be quantified.\n\nUnlike first-order logic, for which only one semantics is studied, there are several possible semantics for second-order logic. The most commonly employed semantics for second-order and higher-order logic is known as '''full semantics'''. The combination of additional quantifiers and the full semantics for these quantifiers makes higher-order logic stronger than first-order logic. In particular, the (semantic) logical consequence relation for second-order and higher-order logic is not semidecidable; there is no effective deduction system for second-order logic that is sound and complete under full semantics.\n\nSecond-order logic with full semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, it is possible to create axiom systems in second-order logic that uniquely characterize the natural numbers and the real line. The cost of this expressiveness is that second-order and higher-order logics have fewer attractive metalogical properties than first-order logic. For example, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem and compactness theorem of first-order logic become false when generalized to higher-order logics with full semantics.\n\n==Automated theorem proving and formal methods==\n{{further|Automated theorem proving#First-order theorem proving}}\n\n[[Automated theorem proving]] refers to the development of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the [[search algorithm|search space]] can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but [[Computational complexity theory|computationally infeasible]] for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated [[heuristic function]]s are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.\n\nThe related area of automated [[proof verification]] uses computer programs to check that human-created proofs are correct.  Unlike complicated automated theorem provers, verification systems may be small enough that their correctness can be checked both by hand and through automated software verification. This validation of the proof verifier is needed to give confidence that any derivation labeled as \"correct\" is actually correct.\n\nSome proof verifiers, such as [[Metamath]], insist on having a complete derivation as input.  Others, such as [[Mizar system|Mizar]] and [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]], take a well-formatted proof sketch (which may still be very long and detailed) and fill in the missing pieces by doing simple proof searches or applying known decision procedures: the resulting derivation is then verified by a small, core \"kernel\". Many such systems are primarily intended for interactive use by human mathematicians: these are known as [[proof assistant]]s.  They may also use formal logics that are stronger than first-order logic, such as type theory. Because a full derivation of any nontrivial result in a first-order deductive system will be extremely long for a human to write,<ref>Avigad ''et al.'' (2007) discuss the process of formally verifying a proof of the [[prime number theorem]]. The formalized proof required approximately 30,000 lines of input to the Isabelle proof verifier.</ref> results are often formalized as a series of lemmas, for which derivations can be constructed separately.\n\nAutomated theorem provers are also used to implement [[formal verification]] in computer science.  In this setting, theorem provers are used to verify the correctness of programs and of hardware such as [[CPU|processors]] with respect to a [[formal specification]]. Because such analysis is time-consuming and thus expensive, it is usually reserved for projects in which a malfunction would have grave human or financial consequences.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Logic}}\n* [[ACL2]] \u2014 A Computational Logic for Applicative Common Lisp.\n* [[Equiconsistency]]\n* [[Extension by definitions]]\n* [[Herbrandization]]\n* [[Higher-order logic]]\n* [[List of logic symbols]]\n* [[L\u00f6wenheim number]]\n* [[Nonfirstorderizability]]\n* [[Prenex normal form]]\n* [[Relational algebra]]\n* [[Relational model]]\n* [[Second-order logic]]\n* [[Skolem normal form]]\n* [[Tarski's World]]\n* [[Truth table]]\n* [[Type (model theory)]]\n* [[Prolog]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Peter B.

Functors were first considered in [[algebraic topology]], where algebraic objects (such as the [[fundamental group]]) are associated to [[topological space]]s, and maps between these algebraic objects are associated to [[continuous function|continuous]] maps between spaces.   Nowadays, functors are used throughout modern mathematics to relate various categories.   Thus, functors are important in all areas within mathematics to which [[category theory]] is applied.\n\nThe word ''functor'' was borrowed by mathematicians from the [[philosopher]] [[Rudolf Carnap]],<ref>{{citation|first1=Saunders|last1=Mac Lane|authorlink1=Saunders Mac Lane|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|year=1971|isbn=978-3-540-90035-1|page=30}}</ref> who used the term in a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] context;<ref>[[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap, Rudolf]] (1937).

The [[Hom functor]] is a natural example; it is contravariant in one argument, covariant in the other.\n\nA '''multifunctor''' is a generalization of the functor concept to ''n'' variables. So, for example, a bifunctor is a multifunctor with {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}.\n\n== Examples ==\n'''[[Diagram (category theory)|Diagram]]''': For categories ''C'' and ''J'', a diagram of type ''J'' in ''C'' is a covariant functor <math>D \\colon J\\to C</math>.\n\n'''[[Presheaf (category theory)|(Category theoretical) presheaf]]''': For categories ''C'' and ''J'', a ''J''-presheaf on ''C'' is a contravariant functor <math>D \\colon C\\to J</math>.\n\n'''Presheaves:''' If ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then the [[open set]]s in ''X'' form a [[partially ordered set]] Open(''X'') under inclusion. Like every partially ordered set, Open(''X'') forms a small category by adding a single arrow {{nowrap|''U'' \u2192 ''V''}} if and only if <math>U \\subseteq V</math>. Contravariant functors on Open(''X'') are called ''[[presheaf|presheaves]]'' on ''X''. For instance, by assigning to every open set ''U'' the [[associative algebra]] of real-valued continuous functions on ''U'', one obtains a presheaf of algebras on ''X''.\n\n'''Constant functor:''' The functor {{nowrap|''C'' \u2192 ''D''}} which maps every object of ''C'' to a fixed object ''X'' in ''D'' and every morphism in ''C'' to the identity morphism on ''X''. Such a functor is called a ''constant'' or ''selection'' functor.\n\n'''Endofunctor''': A functor that maps a category to itself; e.g., [[polynomial functor]].\n\n'''Identity functor''': in category ''C'', written 1<sub>''C''</sub> or id<sub>''C''</sub>, maps an object to itself and a morphism to itself. The identity functor is an endofunctor.\n\n'''Diagonal functor''': The [[diagonal functor]] is defined as the functor from ''D'' to the functor category ''D''<sup>''C''</sup> which sends each object in ''D'' to the constant functor at that object.\n\n'''Limit functor''': For a fixed [[index category]] ''J'', if every functor {{nowrap|''J'' \u2192 ''C''}} has a [[limit (category theory)|limit]] (for instance if ''C'' is complete), then the limit functor {{nowrap|''C''<sup>''J''</sup> \u2192 ''C''}} assigns to each functor its limit. The existence of this functor can be proved by realizing that it is the [[Adjoint functors|right-adjoint]] to the [[diagonal functor]] and invoking the [[Freyd adjoint functor theorem]]. This requires a suitable version of the [[axiom of choice]]. Similar remarks apply to the [[colimit functor]] (which is covariant).\n\n'''Power sets:''' The power set functor {{nowrap|''P'' : '''Set''' \u2192 '''Set'''}} maps each set to its [[power set]] and each function <math> f \\colon X \\to Y</math> to the map which sends <math>U \\subseteq X</math> to its image <math>f(U) \\subseteq Y</math>. One can also consider the contravariant power set functor which sends <math> f \\colon X \\to Y </math> to the map which\nsends <math>V \\subseteq Y</math> to its [[inverse image]] <math>f^{-1}(V) \\subseteq X.</math>\n\n'''{{visible anchor|Dual vector space}}:''' The map which assigns to every [[vector space]] its [[dual space]] and to every [[linear operator|linear map]] its dual or transpose is a contravariant functor from the category of all vector spaces over a fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] to itself.\n\n'''Fundamental group:''' Consider the category of [[pointed topological space]]s, i.e. topological spaces with distinguished points. The objects are pairs {{nowrap|(''X'', ''x''<sub>0</sub>)}}, where ''X'' is a topological space and ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a point in ''X''. A morphism from {{nowrap|(''X'', ''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} to {{nowrap|(''Y'', ''y''<sub>0</sub>)}} is given by a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} with {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) = ''y''<sub>0</sub>}}.\n\nTo every topological space ''X'' with distinguished point ''x''<sub>0</sub>, one can define the [[fundamental group]] based at ''x''<sub>0</sub>, denoted {{nowrap|\u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'', ''x''<sub>0</sub>)}}. This is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of [[homotopy]] classes of loops based at ''x''<sub>0</sub>. If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is a morphism of [[pointed space]]s, then every loop in ''X'' with base point ''x''<sub>0</sub> can be composed with ''f'' to yield a loop in ''Y'' with base point ''y''<sub>0</sub>. This operation is compatible with the homotopy [[equivalence relation]] and the composition of loops, and we get a [[group homomorphism]] from {{nowrap|\u03c0(''X'', ''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} to {{nowrap|\u03c0(''Y'', ''y''<sub>0</sub>)}}. We thus obtain a functor from the category of pointed topological spaces to the [[category of groups]].\n\nIn the category of topological spaces (without distinguished point), one considers homotopy classes of generic curves, but they cannot be composed unless they share an endpoint. Thus one has the '''fundamental [[groupoid]]''' instead of the fundamental group, and this construction is functorial.\n\n'''Algebra of continuous functions:''' a contravariant functor from the category of [[topology|topological spaces]] (with continuous maps as morphisms) to the category of real [[associative algebra]]s is given by assigning to every topological space ''X'' the algebra C(''X'') of all real-valued continuous functions on that space. Every continuous map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} induces an [[algebra homomorphism]] {{nowrap|C(''f'') : C(''Y'') \u2192 C(''X'')}} by the rule {{nowrap|1=C(''f'')(''\u03c6'') = ''\u03c6'' \u2218 ''f''}} for every ''\u03c6'' in C(''Y'').\n\n'''Tangent and cotangent bundles:''' The map which sends every [[differentiable manifold]] to its [[tangent bundle]] and every [[smooth map]] to its [[derivative]] is a covariant functor from the category of differentiable manifolds to the category of [[vector bundle]]s.\n\nDoing this constructions pointwise gives the [[tangent space]], a covariant functor from the category of pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. Likewise, [[cotangent space]] is a contravariant functor, essentially the composition of the tangent space with the [[#Dual vector space|dual space]] above.\n\n'''Group actions/representations:''' Every [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' can be considered as a category with a single object whose morphisms are the elements of ''G''. A functor from ''G'' to '''Set''' is then nothing but a [[group action]] of ''G'' on a particular set, i.e. a ''G''-set. Likewise, a functor from ''G'' to the [[category of vector spaces]], '''Vect'''<sub>''K''</sub>, is a [[linear representation]] of ''G''. In general, a functor {{nowrap|''G'' \u2192 ''C''}} can be considered as an \"action\" of ''G'' on an object in the category ''C''. If ''C'' is a group, then this action is a group homomorphism.\n\n'''Lie algebras:''' Assigning to every real (complex) [[Lie group]] its real (complex) [[Lie algebra]] defines a functor.\n\n'''Tensor products:''' If ''C'' denotes the category of vector spaces over a fixed field, with [[linear operator|linear maps]] as morphisms, then the [[tensor product]] <math>V \\otimes W</math> defines a functor {{nowrap|''C'' \u00d7 ''C'' \u2192 ''C''}} which is covariant in both arguments.<ref>{{citation|first1=Michiel|last1=Hazewinkel|authorlink1=Michiel Hazewinkel|first2=Nadezhda Mikha\u012dlovna|last2=Gubareni|authorlink2=Nadezhda Mikha\u012dlovna|first3=Nadiya|last3=Gubareni|authorlink3=Nadiya Gubareni|first4=Vladimir V.|last4=Kirichenko|authorlink4=Vladimir V.

Another example is the functor {{nowrap|'''Rng''' \u2192 '''Ab'''}} which maps a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] to its underlying additive [[abelian group]]. Morphisms in '''Rng''' ([[ring homomorphism]]s) become morphisms in '''Ab''' (abelian group homomorphisms).\n\n'''Free functors:''' Going in the opposite direction of forgetful functors are free functors. The free functor {{nowrap|''F'' : '''Set''' \u2192 '''Grp'''}} sends every set ''X'' to the [[free group]] generated by ''X''. Functions get mapped to group homomorphisms between free groups. Free constructions exist for many categories based on structured sets. See [[free object]].\n\n'''Homomorphism groups:''' To every pair ''A'', ''B'' of [[group (mathematics)|abelian groups]] one can assign the abelian group Hom(''A'',''B'') consisting of all [[group homomorphism]]s from ''A'' to ''B''. This is a functor which is contravariant in the first and covariant in the second argument, i.e. it is a functor {{nowrap|'''Ab'''<sup>op</sup> \u00d7 '''Ab''' \u2192 '''Ab'''}} (where '''Ab''' denotes the [[category of abelian groups]] with group homomorphisms). If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''A''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''B''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''B''<sub>2</sub>}} are morphisms in '''Ab''', then the group homomorphism {{nowrap|Hom(''f'', ''g'')}}: {{nowrap|Hom(''A''<sub>2</sub>, ''B''<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 Hom(''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''B''<sub>2</sub>)}} is given by {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' \u21a6 ''g'' \u2218 ''\u03c6'' \u2218 ''f''}}. See [[Hom functor]].\n\n'''Representable functors:''' We can generalize the previous example to any category ''C''. To every pair ''X'', ''Y'' of objects in ''C'' one can assign the set {{nowrap|Hom(''X'', ''Y'')}} of morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y''. This defines a functor to '''Set''' which is contravariant in the first argument and covariant in the second, i.e. it is a functor {{nowrap|''C''<sup>op</sup> \u00d7 ''C'' \u2192 '''Set'''}}. If {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>2</sub>}} and {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y''<sub>1</sub> \u2192 ''Y''<sub>2</sub>}} are morphisms in ''C'', then the group homomorphism {{nowrap|Hom(''f'', ''g'') : Hom(''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''Y''<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 Hom(''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''Y''<sub>2</sub>)}} is given by {{nowrap|''\u03c6'' \u21a6 ''g'' \u2218 ''\u03c6'' \u2218 ''f''}}.\n\nFunctors like these are called [[representable functor]]s. An important goal in many settings is to determine whether a given functor is representable.\n\n== Properties ==\nTwo important consequences of the functor [[axiom]]s are:\n* ''F'' transforms each [[commutative diagram]] in ''C'' into a commutative diagram in ''D'';\n* if ''f'' is an [[isomorphism]] in ''C'', then ''F''(''f'') is an isomorphism in ''D''.\n\nOne can compose functors, i.e. if ''F'' is a functor from ''A'' to ''B'' and ''G'' is a functor from ''B'' to ''C'' then one can form the composite functor {{nowrap|''G'' \u2218 ''F''}} from ''A'' to ''C''. Composition of functors is associative where defined. Identity of composition of functors is identity functor. This shows that functors can be considered as morphisms in categories of categories, for example in the [[category of small categories]].\n\nA small category with a single object is the same thing as a [[monoid]]: the morphisms of a one-object category can be thought of as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid [[homomorphism]]s. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.\n\n== Relation to other categorical concepts ==\nLet <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{D}</math> be categories. The collection of all functors <math>\\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}</math> form the objects of a category: the [[functor category]]. Morphisms in this category are [[natural transformation]]s between functors.\n\nFunctors are often defined by [[universal property|universal properties]]; examples are the [[tensor product]], the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] and [[direct product]] of groups or vector spaces, construction of free groups and modules, [[direct limit|direct]] and [[inverse limit|inverse]] limits. The concepts of [[limit (category theory)|limit and colimit]] generalize several of the above.\n\nUniversal constructions often give rise to pairs of [[adjoint functors]].\n\n== Computer implementations ==\nFunctors sometimes appear in [[functional programming]]. For instance, the programming language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] has a [[type class|class]] <code>Functor</code> where [[Map (higher-order function)#Generalization|<code>fmap</code>]] is a [[polytypic function]] used to map [[function (computer programming)|functions]] (''morphisms'' on ''Hask'', the category of Haskell types)<ref>It's not entirely clear that Haskell datatypes truly form a category.

The next year he initiated efforts to emigrate to the United States, but was unable to make arrangements to receive a research fellowship. On 26 January 1942, Felix Hausdorff, along with his wife and his sister-in-law, committed suicide by taking an overdose of [[veronal]], rather than comply with German orders to move to the Endenich camp, and there suffer the likely implications, about which he held no illusions.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood and youth===\nHausdorff's father, the [[Jewish]] merchant Louis Hausdorff (1843\u20131896), moved in the autumn of 1870 with his young family to [[Leipzig]] and worked over time at various companies, including a linen-and cotton goods factory. He was an educated man and had become a [[Morenu]] at the age of 14. There are several treatises from his pen, including a long work on the Aramaic translations of the Bible from the perspective of [[Talmud]]ic law.\n\nHausdorff's mother, Hedwig (1848\u20131902), who is also referred to in various documents as Johanna, came from the Jewish Tietz family. From another branch of this family came [[Hermann Tietz]], founder of the first department store, and later co-owner of the department store chain called \"Hermann Tietz\". During the period of Nazi dictatorship the name was \"Aryanised\" to [[Hertie]].\n\nFrom 1878 to 1887 Felix Hausdorff attended the Nicolai School in Leipzig, a facility that had a reputation as a hotbed of humanistic education. He was an excellent student, class leader for many years and often recited self-written Latin or German poems at school celebrations. In his graduation in 1887 (with two Oberprimen), he was the only one who reached the highest grade.\n\nThe choice of subject was not easy for Hausdorff. Magda Dierkesmann, who was often a guest in the home of Hausdorff as a student in Bonn in the years 1926\u20131932, reported in 1967 that:\n\n{{quote|His versatile musical talent was so great that only the insistence of his father made him give up his plan to study music and become a composer.}}\n\nThe decision was made to study the sciences in high school.\n\n===Degree, doctorate and habilitation===\n\nFrom summer term 1887 to summer semester 1891 Hausdorff studied [[mathematics]] and [[astronom]]y, mainly in his native city of Leipzig, interrupted by one semester in [[Freiburg]] (summer semester 1888) and Berlin (winter semester 1888/1889). The surviving testimony of other students show him as extremely versatile interested young man, who, in addition to the mathematical and astronomical lectures, attended lectures in physics, chemistry and geography, and also lectures on philosophy and history of philosophy as well as on issues of language, literature and social sciences. In Leipzig he heard lectures on the history of music from musicologist Paul. His early love of music lasted a lifetime; in Hausdorff's house there were impressive musical evenings with the landlord at the piano, according to witness statements made by various participants. Even as a student in Leipzig, he was an admirer and connoisseur of the music of Richard Wagner.\n\nIn later semesters of his studies, Hausdorff was close to [[Heinrich Bruns]] (1848\u20131919). \nBruns was professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at the University of Leipzig. Under him, Hausdorff graduated in 1891 with a work on the theory of astronomical refraction of light in the atmosphere. Two publications on the same subject followed, and in 1895 his habilitation also followed with a thesis on the absorbance of light in the atmosphere. These early astronomical works of Hausdorff have\u2014despite their excellent mathematical working through\u2014not gained importance.\nFirstly, the underlying idea of Bruns has not proved viable (there were needs for refraction observations near the astronomical horizon, which\u2014as Julius Bauschinger could show a little later\u2014in principle can not be obtained with the required accuracy). On the other hand, the progress in the direct measurement of atmospheric data ([[weather balloon]] ascents) has since made the painstaking accuracy of this data from refraction observations unnecessary. In the time between PhD and habilitation Hausdorff completed the yearlong-volunteer military requirement and worked for two years as a [[human computer]] at the [[observatory]] in Leipzig.\n\n===Docent in Leipzig===\nWith his habilitation, Hausdorff became a lecturer at the University of Leipzig and began an extensive teaching in a variety of mathematical areas. In addition to teaching and research in mathematics, he went with his literary and philosophical inclinations. A man of varied interests, educated, highly sensitive and sophisticated in thinking, feeling and experiencing, he frequented in his Leipzig period with a number of famous writers, artists and publishers such as [[Hermann Conradi]], [[Richard Dehmel]], [[Otto Erich Hartleben]], [[Gustav Kirstein]], [[Max Klinger]], [[Max Reger]] and [[Frank Wedekind]]. The years 1897 to about 1904 mark the high point of his literary and philosophical creativity, during which time 18 of his 22 pseudonymous works were published, including a book of poetry, a play, an epistemological book and a volume of aphorisms.\n\nHausdorff married Charlotte Goldschmidt in 1899, daughter of Jewish doctor Siegismund Goldschmidt. Her stepmother was the famous suffragist and preschool teacher Henriette Goldschmidt. In 1900 Hausdorff's only child, daughter Lenore (Nora), was born, who survived the era of National Socialism and died very old in 1991 in Bonn.\n\n===First professorship===\nIn December 1901 Hausdorff was appointed as adjunct associate professor at the University of Leipzig. The often repeated assertion that Hausdorff got a call from [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and rejected it cannot be verified and is probably wrong. When applying in Leipzig, Dean Kirchner had been led to very positive vote of his colleagues, written by Heinrich Bruns, still accompanied by the following words:\n\n{{quote|The faculty, however, considers itself obliged to report to the Royal Ministry, that the above application in the second November of this year faculty meeting had taken place was not accepted by all, but with 22 votes to 7. The minority was opposed, because Dr. Hausdorff is of the Mosaic faith.<ref>Archiv der Universit\u00e4t Leipzig, PA 547</ref>}}\n\nThis quote emphasizes the undisguised [[anti-Semitism]] present, which especially took a sharp upturn after the [[Gr\u00fcnderkrach]] in 1873 throughout the German Reich. Leipzig was a center of anti-Semitic movement, especially among the student body. This may well be the reason that Hausdorff did not feel at ease at Leipzig. Another reason was perhaps the stresses due to the hierarchical posturing of the Leipzig professors.\n\nAfter his habilitation, Hausdorff wrote another work on optics, on non-Euclidean geometry, and on hypercomplex number systems, as well as two papers on probability theory. However, his main area of work soon became set theory, especially the theory of ordered sets. It was initially a philosophical interest, which led him around 1897 to study [[Georg Cantor]]'s work. Already, in the summer semester of 1901, Hausdorff gave a lecture on set theory. This was one of the first lectures on set theory at all; [[Ernst Zermelo]]'s lectures in G\u00f6ttingen College during the winter semester of 1900/1901 was a little earlier. That year, he published his first paper on order types in which he examined a generalization of well-orderings called [[graded order types]], where a [[linear order]] is graded if no two of its segments share the same [[order type]]. He generalized the [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein theorem]] which said the collection of countable order types has the cardinality of the continuum and showed that the collection of all graded types of an [[Idempotence|idempotent]] cardinality {{var|m}} has a cardinality of 2<sup>{{var|m}}</sup>.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Handbook of the History of Logic: Sets and extensions in the twentieth century|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF_QckMFy-oC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=graded+order+type&source=bl&ots=o9-NYP4Jbh&sig=RBZQG6WaELmuNWMXMM4z7vME04Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiB9brdtOLKAhWIRyYKHSDiBWIQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=graded%2520order%2520type&f=false|publisher = Elsevier|date = 2012-01-01|isbn = 9780444516213|language = en|first = Dov M.|last = Gabbay}}</ref>\n\nFor the summer semester 1910 Hausdorff was appointed as professor to the University of Bonn. In Bonn, he began a lecture on set theory, which he repeated in the summer semester 1912, substantially revised and expanded.\n\nIn the summer of 1912 he also began work on his magnum opus, the book ''Basics of set theory''. It was completed in Greifswald, where Hausdorff had been appointed for the summer semester as full professor in 1913, and was released in April 1914.\n\nThe [[University of Greifswald]] was the smallest of the Prussian universities. Also, the mathematical institute was small; in the summer semester 1916 and winter semester 1916/17 Hausdorff was the only mathematician in Greifswald. This brought with it that he was almost fully occupied in teaching the basic courses. It was a substantial improvement of his academic situation when Hausdorff was appointed in 1921 to Bonn. Here he could develop a thematically wide-spanned teaching and always lecture on the latest research. He gave a particularly noteworthy lecture on probability theory (NL Hausdorff: Capsule 21: Fasz 64) in the summer semester 1923, in which he grounded this theory in measure-theoretic axiomatic theory, and this occurred ten years before [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A. N. Kolmogorov]]'s \"Basic concepts of probability theory\" (reprinted in full in the collected works, Volume V). In Bonn, Hausdorff had [[Eduard Study]], and later with [[Otto Toeplitz]], outstanding mathematicians as well as colleagues and friends.\n\n===Hausdorff under the Nazi dictatorship===\nThe [[National Socialist]] party's state doctrine established [[anti-Semitism]] and the seizure of power. Hausdorff was not initially concerned by the \"[[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]]\", adopted in 1933, because he had been a German official since before 1914. However, he was not completely spared, as one of his lectures was interrupted by Nazi students. He stopped his 1934/1935 winter semester Calculus III course from 20 November on. During that time, there was a working session of the National Socialist German Student Union (NSDStB) at the University of Bonn, which chose \"Race and Ethnicity\" as their theme for the semester. The assumption is that this event is related to the cancellation of Hausdorff's class, because otherwise he never, in his long career as a university teacher, stopped a class.\n\nIn March 31, 1935, after some going back and forth, Hausdorff was finally given emeritus status. No words of thanks were given for 40 years of successful work in the German higher education system. He worked tirelessly and published, in addition to the expanded edition of his work on set theory, seven works on topology and descriptive set theory, all published in Polish magazines: one in ''[[Studia Mathematica]]'', the others in ''[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]]''.\n\nHis [[Nachlass]] shows that Hausdorff was still working mathematically at these increasingly difficult times and following current developments of interest. He was selflessly supported at this time by [[Erich Bessel-Hagen]], a loyal friend to the Hausdorff family who obtained books and magazines from the Library of the Institute, which Hausdorff was no longer allowed to enter as a Jew.\n\nAbout the humiliations to which Hausdorff and his family especially were exposed to after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, much is known and from many different sources, such as from the letters of Bessel-Hagen.<ref>Neuenschwander, E.: ''Felix Hausdorffs letzte Lebensjahre nach Dokumenten aus dem Bessel-Hagen-Nachla\u00df''. In: Brieskorn 1996, S.&nbsp;253\u2013270.</ref>\n\nIn vain, Hausdorff asked the mathematician [[Richard Courant]] in 1939 for a research fellowship to be able to emigrate into the USA.\n\n[[File:Abschiedsbrief Felix Hausdorffs \u2013 Seite 1.png|thumb|The first page of his farewell letter to Hans Wollstein]]\n\nIn mid-1941, the Bonn Jews began to be deported to the Monastery \"To Perpetual Adoration\" in [[Endenich]], from which the nuns had been expelled. The transports to the death camps in the east occurred later. After Felix Hausdorff, his wife and his wife's sister, Edith Pappenheim (who was living with them) were ordered in January 1942 to move to the Endenich camp, they committed suicide on 26 January 1942 by taking an overdose of [[veronal]]. Their final resting place is located on the [[Poppelsdorfer cemetery]] in Bonn. Between their placement in temporary camps and his suicide, he gave his handwritten ''[[Nachlass]]'' to the Egyptologist and presbyter [[Hans Bonnet]], who saved as much of them as possible, despite the destruction of his house by a bomb.\n\nSome of his fellow Jews may have had illusions about the camp Endenich, but not Hausdorff. E. Neuenschwander discovered in the estate of Bessel-Hagen the farewell letter that Hausdorff wrote to his Jewish lawyer Hans Wollstein.<ref>Nachlass Bessel-Hagen, Universit\u00e4tsarchiv Bonn.

Forgive us our desertion! We wish you and all our friends to experience better times.\n\nYour truly devoted\n\nFelix Hausdorff}}\n\nUnfortunately, this desire was not fulfilled. Hausdorff's lawyer Wollstein was murdered in [[Auschwitz]].\n\n[[File:Hausdorff-strasse.jpg|thumb|Hausdorffstra\u00dfe (Bonn)]]\n\nHausdorff's library was sold by his son-in-law and sole heir, Arthur K\u00f6nig. The handwritten ''[[Nachlass]]'' was adopted by a family friend, the Bonn Egyptologist Hans Bonnet, for storage. It is now in the University and State Library of Bonn. The ''Nachlass'' is catalogued.<ref>Siehe Findbuch Nachlass Hausdorff</ref>\n\n==Work and reception==\n\n=== Hausdorff as philosopher and writer (Paul Mongr\u00e9) ===\nHis volume of aphorisms in 1897 was the first published work of Hausdorff under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9. It is entitled ''Sant' Ilario. Thoughts from the landscape of Zarathustra''. The subtitle of ''Sant 'Ilario'' \"Thoughts from the landscape Zarathustra\" plays first on the fact that Hausdorff had completed his book during a recovery stay on the Ligurian coast to Genoa and that Friedrich Nietzsche in this same area wrote the first two parts of Thus Spoke Zarathustra: he also alludes to the spiritual closeness to Nietzsche. In an article on Sant 'Ilario in the weekly paper [[Die Zukunft]], Hausdorff acknowledged [[Wiktionary:expressis verbis|expressis verbis]] to Nietzsche.\n\nHausdorff was not trying to copy or even exceed Nietzsche. \"Of Nietzsche imitation no trace\", says a contemporary review. He follows Nietzsche in an attempt to liberate individual thinking, to take the liberty of questioning outdated standards. Hausdorff maintained critical distance to the late works of Nietzsche. In his essay on the book [[The Will to Power (manuscript)|''The Will to Power'']] compiled from notes left in the Nietzsche Archive he says:\n\n{{quote|In Nietzsche glows a fanatic. His morality of breeding, erected on our present biological and physiological foundations of knowledge: that could be a world historical scandal against which the [[Inquisition]] and [[witch trials]] fade into harmless aberrations.}}\n\nHis critical standard he took from Nietzsche himself,\n\n{{quote|From the kind, modest, understanding Nietzsche and from the free spirit of the cool, dogma-free, unsystematic skeptic Nietzsche ...}}\n\nIn 1898 appeared\u2014also under the pseudonym Paul Mongr\u00e9\u2014Hausdorff's epistemological experiment ''Chaos in cosmic selection''. The critique of metaphysics put forward in this book had its starting point in Hausdorff's confrontation with Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence. It ultimately gets to destroying any kind of metaphysics. Of the world itself, from the transcendent world core\u2014as Hausdorff expressed\u2014we know nothing and we know nothing. We must assume \"the world itself\" as undetermined and undeterminable, as a mere chaos. The world of our experience, our cosmos is the result of the selection, the selection that we have always instinctively made according to our possibilities of understanding and make more. From that chaos would also be seen other orders, other Kosmoi, conceivably. At any rate, from the world of our cosmos you can not conclude the existence of a transcendent world.\n\nIn 1904, in the magazine The New Rundschau, Hausdorff's play appeared, the one-act play ''The doctor in his honor''. It is a crude satire on the duel and on the traditional concepts of honor and nobility of the Prussian officer corps, which in the developing bourgeois society were increasingly anachronistic. ''The doctor in his honor'' was Hausdorff's greatest literary success. In 1914\u20131918 there were numerous performances in more than thirty cities. Hausdorff later wrote an epilogue to the play, but it was not performed at that time. Only in 2006 did this epilogue have its premier at the annual meeting of the German Mathematical Society in Bonn.\n\nBesides the works above mentioned Hausdorff wrote numerous essays that appeared in some of the leading literary magazines of the time, as well as a book of poems, ''Ecstasy'' (1900). Some of his poems were set to music by Austrian composer [[Joseph Marx]].\n\n===Theory of ordered sets===\nHausdorff's entry into a thorough study of ordered sets was prompted in part by Cantor's continuum problem: which place does the [[cardinal number]] <math>\\aleph = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math> take in the series <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha}</math>. In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, \"it has plagued almost like a monomania\".<ref>Nieders\u00e4chsische Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek zu G\u00f6ttingen, Handschriftenabteilung, NL Hilbert, Nr. 136.</ref> He saw in the set <math> \\mathrm{card} (T(\\aleph_0)) = \\aleph</math> a new strategy to attack the problem. Cantor had suspected <math>\\aleph = \\aleph_1</math>, but had only shown <math>\\aleph \\geq \\aleph_1</math>. <math>\\aleph_1</math> is the \"number\" of possible [[well-ordering]]s of a [[countable set]] ; <math>\\aleph</math> had now emerged as the \"number\" of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more special than general orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901 with the publication of theoretical studies of \"graded sets\". We know from the results of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor's strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the [[Cantor&ndash;Bendixson theorem|Cantor-Bendixson principle]] for closed sets to general uncountable sets.\n\nIn 1904 Hausdorff published the recursion named after him:\n\nFor each non-limit ordinal <math>\\mu</math> we have <math>\\aleph_{\\mu}^{\\aleph_{\\alpha}} = \\aleph_{\\mu} \\; \\aleph_{\\mu -1}^{\\aleph_{\\alpha}}.</math>\n\nThis formula was, together with the later notion of cofinality introduced by Hausdorff, the basis for all further results for [[Aleph exponentiation]]. Hausdorff' excellent knowledge of the problems of this type of sequence was also empowered by his efforts to uncover the error in [[Julius K\u00f6nig]]'s lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 in Heidelberg. There K\u00f6nig had argued that the continuum can not be well-ordered, so its cardinality is no Aleph, and thus caused a great stir. The assertion that it was Hausdorff who clarified the mistake has a special weight because a false image was drawn in the historical literature for more than 50 years of the events in Heidelberg.<ref>Detaillierte Angaben findet man in den gesammelten Werken, Band&nbsp;II, S.&nbsp;9\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn the years 1906\u20131909 Hausdorff did his fundamental work on ordered sets. Only a few points can be touched briefly. Of fundamental importance to the whole theory is the concept of [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]]ity that Hausdorff introduced. An ordinal is called regular if it is cofinal with any smaller ordinal; otherwise it is singular. Hausdorff's question whether there are regular numbers with index a limit ordinal, was the starting point for the theory of inaccessible cardinals. Hausdorff had already noticed that such numbers, if they exist, must be of \"exorbitant size\".<ref>H.: Gesammelte Werke. Band&nbsp;II: ''Grundz\u00fcge der Mengenlehre.'' Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg etc. 2002. Kommentare von U.&nbsp;Felgner, S.&nbsp;598\u2013601.</ref>\n\nOf fundamental importance is the following theorem of Hausdorff: for each unbounded ordered dense set <math>A</math> there are two uniquely determined regular initial numbers <math>\\omega_{\\xi}, \\omega_{\\eta}</math> so that <math>A</math> is cofinal with <math>\\omega_{\\xi}</math> and coinitial with <math>\\omega_{\\eta}^*</math> (* Denotes the inverse order). This theorem provides, for example, a technique to characterize elements and gaps in ordered sets. Thus Hausdorff utilized the gap characters and element characters introduced by him.\n\nIf <math>W</math> is a predetermined set of characters (element and gap characters), the question arises whether there are ordered sets whose character set is exactly <math>W</math>. One can easily find a necessary condition for <math>W</math>. Hausdorff was able to show that this condition is also sufficient. For this one needs a rich reservoir of ordered sets; Hausdorff had created this with his theory of general products and powers.<ref>H.: Gesammelte Werke. Band&nbsp;II: ''Grundz\u00fcge der Mengenlehre.'' Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg etc. 2002. S.&nbsp;604\u2013605.</ref> In this reservoir such interesting structures are found as the Hausdorff <math>\\eta_{\\alpha}</math> normal-types, in connection with which Hausdorff first formulated the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]]. Hausdorff's <math>\\eta_{\\alpha}</math>-sets formed the starting point for the study of the important model theory of [[saturated structure]].<ref>Siehe dazu den Essay von U. Felgner: ''Die Hausdorffsche Theorie der <math>\\eta_{\\alpha}</math>-Mengen und ihre Wirkungsgeschichte'' in H.: Gesammelte Werke. Band&nbsp;II: ''Grundz\u00fcge der Mengenlehre''. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg etc. 2002. S.&nbsp;645\u2013674.</ref>\n\nHausdorff's general products and powers of cardinalities had led him to the concept of partially ordered set. The question of whether any ordered subset of a partially ordered set is contained in a maximal ordered subset was answered in the positive by Hausdorff using the well-ordering theorem. This is the [[Hausdorff maximal principle]]. It follows not only from the well-ordering theorem (or from the (equivalent to this) axiom of choice), but it is, as it turned out, even to the axiom of choice are equivalent.<ref>Siehe dazu und zu \u00e4hnlichen S\u00e4tzen von [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] und [[Max August Zorn|Zorn]] den Kommentar von U.&nbsp;Felgner in den gesammelten Werken, Band&nbsp;II, S.&nbsp;602\u2013604.</ref>\n\nAlready, in 1908, [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]] found in the second part of his report on set theory, that the newer theory of ordered sets (i.e., that which occurred after Cantor's extensions thereof) was almost exclusively due to Hausdorff.<ref>Schoenflies, A.: ''Die Entwickelung der Lehre von den Punktmannigfaltigkeiten.'' Teil&nbsp;II. Jahresbericht der DMV, 2.&nbsp;Erg\u00e4nzungsband, Teubner, Leipzig 1908., S.&nbsp;40.</ref>\n\n===The \"Magnum Opus\": \"Principles of set theory\"===\nAccording to former notions, set theory included not only the general set theory and the theory of sets of points, but also dimension and measure theory. Hausdorff's work was the first textbook which presented all of set theory in this broad sense, systematically and with full proofs. Hausdorff was aware of how easily the human mind can err while also seeking for rigor and truth. So he proposed in the preface of the work:\n\n{{quote|Of the human privilege of error to make as economical a use as possible.}}\n\nThis book went far beyond its masterful portrayal of the known. It also contained a series of important original contributions of the author that can only be hinted at in the following.\n\nThe first six chapters deal with the basic concepts of the general set theory. At the beginning Hausdorff sets forth a detailed set algebra with some pioneering new concepts (differences chains, set rings and set fields, <math>\\delta</math>- and <math>\\sigma</math>-systems). These introductory paragraphs on sets and their connections included, for example, the modern set-theoretic notion of functions. Next followed in Chapters 3 to 5 the classical theory of cardinal numbers, order types and ordinals. In the sixth chapter \"Relations between ordered and well-ordered sets\" Hausdorff presents, among other things, the most important results of his own research on ordered sets.\n\nIn the chapters on \"point sets\"\u2014the topological chapters\u2014Hausdorff developed for the first time, based on the known neighborhood axioms, a systematic theory of topological spaces, where in addition he added the separation axiom later named after him. This theory emerges from a comprehensive synthesis of earlier approaches of other mathematicians and Hausdorff's own reflections on the problem of space. The concepts and theorems of classical point set theory <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> are\u2014as far as possible\u2014transferred to the general case, and thus become part of the newly created general or set-theoretic topology. But Hausdorff not only performed this \"translation work\", but he developed also basic construction method of topology as nucleation (interior, dense-in-itself core) and shell formation (closure), and he works the fundamental importance of the concept of open set (called \"area\" by him) and of the compactness introduced by Fr\u00e9chet. He also founded and developed the theory of the connected set, particularly through the introduction of the terms \"component\" and \"quasi-component\".\n\nBy the first and eventually the second Hausdorff countability axioms the considered spaces were gradually further specialized. A large class of spaces satisfying the countable first axiom are [[metric spaces]]. They were introduced in 1906 by Fr\u00e9chet under the name \"classes (E)\". The term \"metric space\" comes from Hausdorff. In ''Principles'', he developed the theory of metric spaces and systematically enriched it through a series of new concepts: [[Hausdorff metric]], [[complete metric space|complete]], [[total boundedness]], <math>\\rho</math>-connectivity, reducible sets. Fr\u00e9chet's work had been little noticed; only through Hausdorff's ''Principles'' did metric spaces become the common property of the mathematician.\n\nThe chapter on illustrations and the final chapter of ''Principles'' on measure and integration theory are enriched by the generality of the material and the originality of presentation. Hausdorff's mention of the importance of measure theory for [[probability]] had great historical effect, despite its laconic brevity. One finds in this chapter the first correct proof of the [[strong law of large numbers]] of [[\u00c9mile Borel]]. Finally, the appendix contains the single most spectacular result of the whole book, namely Hausdorff's theorem that one cannot define a volume for all bounded subsets of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> for <math>n \\geq 3</math>. The proof is based on Hausdorff's paradoxical ball decomposition, whose production requires the axiom of choice.<ref>Zur Wirkungsgeschichte des Hausdorffschen Kugelparadoxons siehe ''Gesammelte Werke Band&nbsp;IV'', S.&nbsp;11\u201318; ferner den Aufsatz von P.&nbsp;Schreiber in Brieskorn 1996, S.&nbsp;135\u2013148, und die Monographie Wagon 1993.</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, it became the standard to build mathematical theories on axiomatic set theory. The creation of axiomatically founded generalized theories, such as the general topology, served among other things to single out the common structural core for various specific cases or regions and then set up an abstract theory, which contained all these parts as special cases. This brought a great success in the form of simplification and harmonization and ultimately brought on economy of thought with itself. Hausdorff himself highlighted this aspect in the ''Principles''. The topological chapter the basic concepts are methodologically a pioneering effort, and they showed the way for the development of modern mathematics.\n\n''Principles of set theory'' appeared in an already tense time on the eve of the First World War. In August 1914, the war, which also dramatically affected the scientific life in Europe. Under these circumstances, could hardly be effective Hausdorff's book in the first five to six years after its appearance. After the war, a new generation of young researchers set forth to expand on the suggestions that were included in this work in such abundance, and with no doubt, the topology was the focus of attention. The journal [[Fundamenta Mathematicae]] played a special role in the reception of Hausdorff ideas, founded in Poland in 1920. It was one of the first mathematical journals with special emphasis on set theory, topology, theory of real functions, measure and integration theory, functional analysis, logic and foundations of mathematics. In this spectrum, a special focus was the general topology. Hausdorff's ''Principles'' were present in Fundamenta Mathematicae from the first volume in a remarkable frequency. Of the 558 works (Hausdorff's own three works not calculated), which appeared in the first twenty volumes from 1920 to 1933, 88 cite ''Principles''. One even has to take into account that as Hausdorff's conceptions increasingly became commonplace, so they were also used in a number of works that did not mention them explicitly.\n\nThe Russian topological school, founded by [[Paul Alexandroff]] and [[Urysohn Paul]], was based heavily on Hausdorff's ''Principles''. This is shown by the surviving correspondence in Hausdorff's [[Nachlass]] with Urysohn, and especially Alexandroff and Urysohn's ''M\u00e9moire sur les multiplicit\u00e9s Cantoriennes'',<ref>Urysohn, P.: ''[http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm7/fm714.pdf M\u00e9moire sur les multiplicit\u00e9s Cantoriennes.] (PDF; 6,2&nbsp;MB)'' Fundamenta Mathematicae 7 (1925), S.&nbsp;30\u2013137; 8 (1926), S.&nbsp;225\u2013351.</ref> a work the size of a book, in which Urysohn developed dimension theory and ''Principles'' is cited no fewer than 60 times.\n\nLong after the Second World War there was a strong demand for Hausdorff's book, and there were three reprints at Chelsea from 1949, 1965 and 1978.\n\n===Descriptive set theory, measure theory and analysis===\nIn 1916, Alexandroff and Hausdorff independently solved<ref>P. Alexandroff: ''Sur la puissance des ensembles mesurables B.'' Comptes rendus Acad. Sci. Paris 162 (1916), S.&nbsp;323\u2013325.</ref> the continuum problem for Borel sets: Every Borel set in a complete separable metric space is either countable or has the cardinality of the continuum. This result generalizes the [[Cantor-Bendixson theorem]] that such a statement holds for the closed sets of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>. For linear <math>G_{\\delta}</math> sets [[William Henry Young]] had proved the result in 1903,<ref>W. H. Young: ''Zur Lehre der nicht abgeschlossenen Punktmengen''. Berichte \u00fcber die Verhandlungen der K\u00f6nigl. S\u00e4chs. Ges. der Wiss. zu Leipzig, Math.-Phys. Klasse&nbsp;55 (1903), S.&nbsp;287\u2013293.</ref> for <math>G_{\\delta\\sigma\\delta}</math> sets Hausdorff obtained a corresponding result in 1914 in the ''Principles''. The theorem of Alexandroff and Hausdorff was a strong impetus for further development of descriptive set theory.<ref>Alexandorff, Hopf 1935, S.&nbsp;20. For details see ''Gesammelte Werke Band&nbsp;II'', S.&nbsp;773\u2013787.</ref>\n\nAmong the publications of Hausdorff in his time at Greifswald time the work ''Dimension and outer measure'' from 1919 is particularly outstanding. It has remained highly topical and in later years has been probably the most cited mathematical original work from the decade from 1910 to 1920. In this work, the concepts were introduced which are now known as [[Hausdorff measure]] and the [[Hausdorff dimension]].\n\nHausdorff dimension term is a fine instrument for the characterization and comparison of \"highly rugged quantities\". The concepts of ''Dimension and outer measure'' have experienced applications and further developments in many areas such as in the theory of dynamical systems, geometric measure theory, the theory of self-similar sets and fractals, the theory of stochastic processes, harmonic analysis, potential theory and number theory.<ref>For the history of the reception of ''Dimension und \u00e4u\u00dferes Ma\u00df'', see the article by Bandt/Haase and Bothe/Schmeling in Brieskorn 1996, S.&nbsp;149\u2013183 and S.&nbsp;229\u2013252 and the commentary of S.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Chatterji in ''Gesammelten Werken, Band&nbsp;IV'', S.&nbsp;44\u201354 and the literature given there.</ref>\n\nSignificant analytical work of Hausdorff occurred in his second time at Bonn. In ''Summation methods and moment sequences I'' in 1921, he developed a whole class of summation methods for divergent series, which today are called [[Hausdorff method]]s. In [[Godfrey Harold Hardy|Hardy]]'s classic ''Divergent Series'', an entire chapter is devoted to the Hausdorff method. The classical methods of [[Otto H\u00f6lder|H\u00f6lder]] and [[Ernesto Ces\u00e0ro|Ces\u00e0ro]] proved to be special Hausdorff method. Every Hausdorff method is given by a moment sequence; in this context Hausdorff gave an elegant solution of the moment problem for a finite interval, bypassing the theory of continued fractions. In ''Moment problems for a finite interval'' of 1923 he treated more special moment problems, such as those with certain restrictions for generating density <math>\\varphi(x)</math>, for instance <math>\\varphi(x) \\in L^p[0,1]</math>. Criteria for solvability and determination of moment problems occupied Hausdorff for many years as hundreds of pages of studies in his [[Nachlass]] attest.<ref>''Gesammelte Werke Band&nbsp;IV'', S.&nbsp;105\u2013171, 191\u2013235, 255\u2013267 and 339\u2013373.</ref>\n\nA significant contribution to the emerging functional analysis in the twenties was Hausdorff's extension of the Riesz-Fischer theorem to<math>L^p</math> spaces in his 1923 work ''An extension of Parseval's theorem on Fourier series''. He proved the inequalities now named after him and [[W.H. Young]]. The Hausdorff-Young inequalities became the starting point of major new developments.<ref>See commentary by S.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Chatterji in ''Gesammelten Werken Band&nbsp;IV'', S.&nbsp;182\u2013190.</ref>\n\nHausdorff's book ''Set Theory'' appeared in 1927. This was declared as a second Edition of ''Principles'', but it was actually a completely new book. Since the scale was significantly reduced due to its appearance in Goschen's teaching library, large parts of the theory of ordered sets and measures and integration theory were removed. \"More than these deletions, the reader will perhaps regret\" (said Hausdorff in the preface), \"that I, to further save space in point set theory, have abandoned the topological point of view through which the first edition has apparently acquired many friends have limited myself to the easier theory of metric spaces\".\n\nIn fact, this was an explicit regret of some reviewers of the work. As a kind of compensation Hausdorff showed for the first time the then current state of descriptive set theory. This fact assured the book almost as intense a reception as ''Principles'', especially in Fundamenta Mathematicae. As a textbook it was very popular. In 1935 there was an expanded edition published, and this was reprinted by Dover in 1944. An English translation appeared in 1957 with reprints in 1962 and 1967.\n\nThere was also a Russian edition (1937), which although it was only partially a faithful translation, and partly a reworking by Alexandroff and [[Kolmogorov]]. In this translation the topological point of view again moved to the forefront. In 1928 a review of ''Set Theory'' appeared from the pen of Hans Hahn. Perhaps Hahn had the danger of German anti-Semitism in his mind as he closed this discussion with the following sentence:\n\n{{quote|An exemplary depiction in every respect of a difficult and thorny area, a work on par with those which have carried the fame of German science about the world and such that all German mathematicians may be proud with.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hahn | first1 = H. | year = 1928 | title = F. Hausdorff, Mengenlehre | url = | journal = [[Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik]] | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 56\u201358 }}</ref>}}\n\n===The last works===\nIn his last work '''''Erweiterung einer stetigen Abbildung''''', Hausdorff showed in 1938 that a [[continuous function]] from a closed subset  <math>F</math> of a metric space <math>E</math> can be extended to all of <math>E</math> (although the image may need to be extended). As a special case, every [[homeomorphism]] from <math>F</math> can be extended to a homeomorphism from <math>E</math>. This work set forth results from earlier years. In 1919, in '''''\u00dcber halbstetige Funktionen und deren Verallgemeinerung''''', Hausdorff had, among other things, given another proof of the [[Tietze extension theorem]]. In 1930, in ''Erweiterung einer Hom\u00f6omorphie'' (Extending a Homeomorphism), he showed the following: Let <math>E</math> be a metric space, <math>F \\subset E</math> a closed subset. If <math>F</math> is given a new metric without changing the topology, this metric can be extended to the entire space without changing the topology. The work ''Gestufte R\u00e4ume'' appeared in 1935. Here Hausdorff discussed spaces which fulfilled the Kuratowski closure axioms up to just the axiom of idempotence. He named them ''graded spaces'' (often also called closure spaces) and used them in the study of the relationships between the [[Maurice Ren\u00e9 Fr\u00e9chet|Fr\u00e9chet]] limit spaces and [[topological spaces]].\n\n==Hausdorff as name-giver==\nThe name Hausdorff is found throughout mathematics. Among others, these concepts were named after him:\n* [[Hausdorff space]]\n* [[Hausdorff measure]]\n* [[Hausdorff dimension]]\n* [[Hausdorff completion]]\n* [[Hausdorff convergence]]\n* [[Hausdorff metric]]\n* [[Hausdorff maximal principle]]\n* [[Hausdorff-Young inequality]]\n* [[Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula]]\n* [[Hausdorff paradox]]\n\nIn the universities of Bonn and Greifswald, these things were named in his honor:\n* the [[Hausdorff Center for Mathematics]] in Bonn,\n* the ''Hausdorff Research Institute for Mathematics'' in Bonn, and \n* the ''Felix Hausdorff Internationale Begegnungszentrum'' in Greifswald.\n\nBesides these, in Bonn there is the Hausdorffstra\u00dfe (Hausdorff Street), where he first lived. (Haus-Nr.&nbsp;61). In Greifswald there is a Felix-Hausdorff-Stra\u00dfe, where the Institutes for Biochemistry and Physics are located, among others.

It means \"great winter\".\n\n==Summary==\nFimbulwinter is the harsh winter that precedes the end of the world and puts an end to all life on Earth. Fimbulwinter is three successive winters, when snow comes in from all directions, without any intervening summer. Then, there will be innumerable wars.\n\nThe event is described primarily in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. In the poem ''[[Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l]]'', [[Odin]] poses the question to [[Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir]] as to who of mankind will survive the Fimbulwinter. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that [[L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir]]  will survive and that they will live in the forest of [[Hoddm\u00edmis holt]]. \n\nThe mythology might be related to the [[extreme weather events of 535\u2013536]], which resulted in a notable drop in temperature across northern Europe. There have also been several popular ideas about whether or not the particular piece of mythology has a connection to the [[climate change]] that occurred in the Nordic countries at the end of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] from about 650 BC. Before that climate change, the Nordic countries were considerably warmer.<ref>Str\u00f6m, Folke: ''Nordisk Hedendom'', [[Studentlitteratur]], Lund 2005, {{ISBN|91-44-00551-2}} (first published 1961) among others, refer to the climate change theory.</ref>\n\nIn [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and other [[Nordic countries]], the term ''fimbulvinter'' is still used to refer to an unusually cold and harsh winter.<ref name=\"saob\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nFimbulvetr comes from [[Old Norse]], meaning \"awful, great winter\". The prefix \"fimbul\" means \"the great/big\" so the correct interpretation of the word is \"the great winter\".<ref name=\"saob\">[[Svenska Akademiens Ordbok]], entry for ''Fimbulvinter'' [http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/show.phtml?filenr=1/68/17365.html]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eschatology]]\n*[[Fimbulwinter (band)]]\n*[[Nuclear winter]]\n*[[Volcanic winter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other sources==\n*Gunn, Joel (2000).

Like [[France]] and the region of [[Franconia]], the city is named after the [[Franks]]. Frankfurt was a [[city state]], the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], for nearly five centuries, and was one of the most important cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; it lost its [[sovereignty]] in 1866. The city is culturally and ethnically diverse, with around half of the population, and a majority of young people, having a [[Immigration to Germany|migration background]]. A quarter of the population are foreign nationals, including many [[expatriate]]s.\n\nFrankfurt is an [[Global city#GaWC study|alpha world city]] and a global hub for commerce, culture, education, tourism and transportation. It is the site of many global and European corporate headquarters. [[Frankfurt Airport]] is among the world's busiest. Frankfurt is the major [[financial centre]] of the European continent, with the headquarters of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Deutsche Bundesbank|German Federal Bank]], [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW]], [[Commerzbank]], several [[Cloud computing|cloud]] and [[Financial technology|fintech]] [[Startup company|startups]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Global Startup Ecosystem Survey \u2013 Startup Genome.

Automotive, technology and research, services, consulting, media and [[creative industries]] complement the economic base. Frankfurt's [[Deutscher Commercial Internet Exchange|DE-CIX]] is the world's largest [[internet exchange point]]. [[Messe Frankfurt]] is one of the world's largest [[trade fair]]s. Major fairs include the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]], the world's largest motor show, the [[Musikmesse Frankfurt|Music Fair]], and the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], the world's largest book fair.\n\nFrankfurt is home to influential [[Education in Germany|educational]] institutions, including the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]], the [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences|UAS]], the [[Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts|FUMPA]], and graduate schools like the [[Frankfurt School of Finance & Management]]. Its renowned [[Culture of Germany|cultural]] venues include the concert hall [[Alte Oper]], Europe's largest [[The English Theatre Frankfurt|English Theatre]] and many museums (e.g. the [[Museumsufer]] ensemble with [[St\u00e4del]] and [[Liebieghaus]], [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg|Senckenberg Natural Museum]], [[Goethe House]]), the [[Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt|Schirn]] art venue at the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|old town]]. [[List of tallest buildings in Frankfurt|Frankfurt's skyline]] is shaped by some of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. The city is also characterised by various green areas and parks, including the central [[Wallanlagen]], the [[Frankfurt City Forest|City Forest]] and two major [[botanical garden]]s, the [[Palmengarten]] and the [[Botanischer Garten der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt am Main|University's Botanical Garden]]. In [[electronic music]], Frankfurt has been a pioneering city since the 1980s, with renowned DJs including [[Sven V\u00e4th]], [[Marc Trauner]], [[Scot Project]], [[Kai Tracid]], and the clubs [[Dorian Gray (club)|Dorian Gray]], U60311, Omen and [[Cocoon (club)|Cocoon]].

It is one of the few cities in the European Union to have such a skyline and because of it Germans sometimes refer to Frankfurt as [[Mainhattan]], a [[portmanteau]] of the local [[Main (river)|Main River]] and [[Manhattan]]. The other well known and obvious nickname is [[Bankfurt]]. Before [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|World War II]] the city was globally noted for its unique [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|old town]] with timber-framed buildings, the largest timber-framed old town in Europe. The [[R\u00f6mer]] area was later rebuilt and is popular with visitors and for events such as [[Christmas market]]s. Other parts of the old town are to be reconstructed as part of the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project]] by 2016.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Die Frankenfurt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The legend of the ''Frankenfurt'' (ford of the Franks)]]\n''Frankonovurd'' (in [[Old High German]]) or ''Vadum Francorum'' (in [[Latin]]) were the first names mentioned in written records from 794. It transformed to ''Frankenfort'' during the [[Middle Ages]] and then to ''Franckfort'' and ''Franckfurth'' in the [[modern history|modern era]]. According to historian [[David Gans]], the city was named {{c.}} 146 AD by its builder, a Frankish king named Zuna, who ruled over the province then known as [[Sicambri]]. He hoped thereby to perpetuate the name of his lineage.<ref>Dovid Solomon Ganz, ''Tzemach David'' (part 2), Warsaw 1859, p. 13b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: ''Cemahc Dawid''; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''Fredegar and the History of France'', University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536\u2013538.</ref> The name is derived from the ''Franconofurd'' of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] of the [[Franks]]; ''Furt'' ([[cf.]] English '[[ford (river)|ford]]) where the river was shallow enough to be crossed on foot.\n\nBy the 19th century, the name ''Frankfurt'' had been established as the official spelling.  The older English spelling of ''[[Frankfort (disambiguation)|Frankfort]]'' is now rarely seen in reference to Frankfurt am Main, although more than a dozen other towns and cities, mainly in the United States, use this spelling (e.g., [[Frankfort, Kentucky]]; [[Frankfort (town), New York|Frankfort, New York]]; [[Frankfort, Illinois]]).\n\nThe suffix 'am Main' has been used regularly since the 14th century. In English, the city's full name of Frankfurt am Main means 'Frankfurt on the Main' (pronounced like English 'mine' or German ''mein''). Frankfurt is located on an ancient ford (German: ''{{Lang|de|Furt}}'') on the [[Main (river)|Main River]]. As a part of early [[Franconia]], the inhabitants were the early [[Franks]], thus the city's name reveals its legacy as \"the ford of the Franks on the Main\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&lpg=PA135&pg=PA135|title=Placenames of the world|last=Room|first=Adrian|publisher=McFarland|year=2006|page=135|accessdate=23 July 2009 | isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7}}</ref>\n\nAmong English speakers, the city is commonly known simply as Frankfurt, but Germans occasionally call it by its full name to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) German city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt an der Oder]] in the [[federated state]] of [[Brandenburg]] on the Polish border.\n\nThe city district [[Bonames]] has a name probably dating back to Roman times, thought to be derived from ''bona me(n)sa'' (good table).\n\nThe common abbreviations for the city, primarily used in railway services and on road signs, are ''Frankfurt (Main)'', ''Frankfurt (M)'', ''Frankfurt a. M.'', ''Frankfurt/Main'' or ''Frankfurt/M''. The common [[abbreviation]] for the name of the city is \"FFM\". Also in use is \"FRA\", the [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA code]] for Frankfurt Airport.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Frankfurt am Main|Timeline of Frankfurt}}\n\n===Early history and Holy Roman Empire===\n[[Germania|Roman settlements]] were established in the area of the ''R\u00f6mer'', probably in the first century. ''Nida'' ([[Heddernheim]]) was also a Roman civitas capital.\n\n[[Alemanni]] and Franks [[Francia|lived there]], and by 794, [[Charlemagne]] presided over an [[Council of Frankfurt|imperial assembly]] and church synod, at which ''Franconofurd'' (alternative spellings end with -furt and -vurd) was first mentioned.\n\nFrankfurt was one of the most important cities in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From 855, the [[List of German Kings and Emperors|German kings and emperors]] were elected and crowned in [[Aachen]]. From 1562, the kings and emperors were crowned in Frankfurt, initiated for [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]]. This tradition ended in 1792, when [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz II]] was elected. His coronation was deliberately held on [[Bastille Day]], 14 July, the anniversary of the [[storming of the Bastille]]. The elections and coronations took place in [[Frankfurt Cathedral|St. Bartholom\u00e4us Cathedral]], known as the ''Kaiserdom'' (Emperor's Cathedral), or its predecessors.\n\nThe ''[[Messe Frankfurt|Frankfurter Messe]]'' (Frankfurt Trade Fair) was first mentioned in 1150. In 1240, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Friedrich II]] granted an imperial privilege to its visitors, meaning they would be protected by the empire. The fair became particularly important when similar fairs in French Beaucaire lost attraction around 1380. Book trade fairs began in 1478.\n\nIn 1372, Frankfurt became a ''Reichsstadt'' ([[Imperial Free City]]), i.e., directly subordinate to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.\n\nIn 1585, Frankfurt traders established a system of [[exchange rate]]s for the various currencies that were circulating to prevent cheating and extortion. Therein lay the early roots for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nFrankfurt managed to remain neutral during the [[Thirty Years' War]], but suffered from the [[bubonic plague]] that refugees brought to the city. After the war, Frankfurt regained its wealth.\n\n{{triple image|center|Mk Frankfurt Merian Stadtansicht.jpg|270|Frankfurt Am Main-Peter Becker-BAAF-032-Aussicht vom Steinernen Haus in der Judengasse nach Westen-1872.jpg|365|Hertel Kaiserplatz von Osten um 1880.jpg|385|<center>Frankfurt in 1612</center>|<center>Frankfurt in 1872</center>|<center>Kaiserplatz, ''circa'' 1880</center>}}\n\n===Impact of French revolution and the Napoleonic Wars===\nFollowing the [[French Revolution]], Frankfurt was occupied or bombarded several times by French troops. It remained a [[Free imperial city|free city]] until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805/6. In 1806, it became part of the [[principality of Aschaffenburg]] under the ''F\u00fcrstprimas'' ([[Prince-Primate]]), [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]]. This meant that Frankfurt was incorporated into the [[confederation of the Rhine]]. In 1810, Dalberg adopted the title of a [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt|Grand Duke of Frankfurt]]. [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] intended to make his adopted son [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], already ''Prince de Venise'' (\"[[prince of Venice]]\", a newly established primogeniture in Italy), Grand Duke of Frankfurt after Dalberg's death (since the latter as a Catholic bishop had no legitimate heirs). The Grand Duchy remained a short episode lasting from 1810 to 1813, when the military tide turned in favour of the Anglo-Prussian lead allies that overturned the Napoleonic order. Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, which of course was only a symbolic action, as the latter effectively never ruled after the ruin of the French armies and Frankfurt's takeover by the allies.\n\n===Frankfurt as a fully sovereign state===\nAfter Napoleon's final defeat and abdication, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815) dissolved the grand-duchy and Frankfurt became a fully sovereign city state with a republican form of government. Frankfurt entered the newly founded [[German Confederation]] (till 1866) as a free city, becoming the seat of its ''Bundestag'', the confederal parliament where the nominally presiding [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Emperor of Austria]] was represented by an Austrian \"presidential envoy\".\n\nAfter the ill-fated [[The Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolution of 1848]], Frankfurt was the seat of the first democratically elected German parliament, the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the [[Frankfurter Paulskirche]] (St. Paul's Church) and was opened on 18 May 1848. The institution failed in 1849 when the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] king declared that he would not accept \"a crown from the gutter\". In the year of its existence, the assembly developed a common constitution for a unified Germany, with the Prussian king as its monarch.\n\n===Frankfurt after the loss of sovereignty===\n[[File:Courbet Frankfurt.jpg|thumb|''View of Frankfurt am Main'', including the [[Alte Br\u00fccke (Frankfurt)|Alte Br\u00fccke]] (Old Bridge), by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1858)]]\nFrankfurt lost its independence after the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866 when Prussia annexed several smaller states, among them the [[Free City of Frankfurt]]. Frankfurt had stayed neutral in the war,{{Citation needed|reason=Other enwp and dewp articles claim Frankfurt was an active belligerent|date=January 2018}} but its free press bothered the Prussians and they used the opportunity to occupy the city by force: Bismarck had been an ambassador to the German Confederation there and constantly quarrelled with the local press. The Prussian administration incorporated Frankfurt into its province of [[Hesse-Nassau]]. The Prussian occupation and annexation was perceived as a great injustice in Frankfurt, which retained its distinct western European, urban and cosmopolitan character. The formerly independent towns of [[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] and [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] were incorporated in 1890.\n\nIn 1914, the citizens founded the University of Frankfurt, later named [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This marked the only civic foundation of a university in Germany; today it is one of Germany's largest.\n\nFrom 6 April to 17 May 1920, following military intervention to put down the [[Ruhr uprising]], [[French occupation of Frankfurt|Frankfurt was occupied by French troops]].<ref>[http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html Chronology: Emergence of a Modern City 1866\u20131945] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085810/http://www.stadtgeschichte-ffm.de/service/chronik/chronik_5_2_e.html |date=19 July 2011 }}.

During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]], the synagogues of the city were destroyed.\n\nFrankfurt was severely [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|bombed in World War II]] (1939\u20131945). About 5,500 residents were killed during the raids, and the once-famous [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|medieval city centre]], by that time the largest in Germany, was almost completely destroyed. It became a ground battlefield on 26 March 1945, when the Allied advance into Germany was forced to take the city in contested urban combat that included a river assault. The [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] and the [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th Armored Division]] of the [[United States Army]] captured Frankfurt after several days of intense fighting, and it was declared largely secure on 29 March 1945.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939\u20131946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 57, 84.</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, Frankfurt became a part of the newly founded state of Hesse, consisting of the old [[People's State of Hesse|Hesse-(Darmstadt)]] and the [[Province of Kurhessen|Prussian Hesse]] provinces. The city was part of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone of Occupation]] of Germany. The Military Governor for the United States Zone (1945\u20131949) and the United States High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) (1949\u20131952) had their headquarters in the [[IG Farben Building]], intentionally left undamaged by the Allies' wartime bombardment.\n\nFrankfurt was the original choice for the provisional capital city of the newly founded state of [[West Germany]] in 1949. The city constructed a parliament building that was never used for its intended purpose (it housed the radio studios of [[Hessischer Rundfunk]]). In the end, [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first postwar [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]], preferred the town of [[Bonn]], for the most part because it was close to his hometown, but also because many other prominent politicians opposed the choice of Frankfurt out of concern that Frankfurt would be accepted as the permanent capital, thereby weakening the West German population's support for a [[German reunification|reunification]] with [[East Germany]] and the eventual return of the capital to [[Berlin]].\n\nPostwar reconstruction took place in a sometimes simple modern style, thus changing Frankfurt's architectural face. A few landmark buildings were reconstructed historically, albeit in a simplified manner (e.g., [[R\u00f6mer]], [[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt am Main|St. Paul's Church]], and [[Goethe House]]). The collection of historically significant [[Cairo Genizah]] documents of the Municipal Library was destroyed by the bombing. According to [[Arabist]] and Genizah scholar [[S.D. Goitein]], \"not even handlists indicating its contents have survived.\"<ref>Goitein, S.D.

In 1948, the allies founded the [[Bank deutscher L\u00e4nder]], the forerunner of [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]. Following this decision, more financial institutions were re-established, e.g. [[Deutsche Bank]] and [[Dresdner Bank]]. In the 1950s, Frankfurt Stock Exchange regained its position as the country's leading stock exchange.\n\nFrankfurt also re-emerged as Germany's transportation centre and [[Frankfurt Airport]] became Europe's second-busiest airport behind [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1961.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city created one of Europe's most efficient underground transportation systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Port of Frankfurt|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/DEU_Port_of_Frankfurt_2769.php|website=World Port Source|accessdate=29 March 2018}}</ref> That system includes a suburban rail system ([[Frankfurt S-Bahn|S-Bahn]]) linking outlying communities with the city centre, and a deep underground light rail system with smaller coaches ([[Frankfurt U-Bahn|U-Bahn]]) also capable of travelling above ground on rails.\n\nIn 1998, the [[European Central Bank]] was founded in Frankfurt, followed by the [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]] in 2011.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:On_top_of_the_Main_Tower.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Top of [[Main Tower]] looking East]]\nIt is the largest city in the [[federated state]] of Hesse in the south-western part of Germany.\n\n===Site===\n[[File:Frankfurt Skyline with Cranes.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Frankfurt's skyline from across the Main, showing construction cranes]]\nFrankfurt is located on both sides of the [[Main (river)|Main River]], south-east of the [[Taunus]] mountain range. The southern part of the city contains the [[Frankfurt City Forest]], Germany's largest city forest. The city area is {{convert|248.31|km\u00b2|2|abbr=on}} and extends over {{convert|23.4|km|2|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|23.3|km|2|abbr=on}} north to south. The city centre is north of the River Main in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district (the historical centre) and the surrounding [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district. The geographical centre is in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district near [[Frankfurt West station]].\n\nFrankfurt is the centre of the densely populated [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metropolitan Region]] with a population of 5.5&nbsp;million. Other important cities in the region are [[Wiesbaden]] (capital of [[Hessen]]), [[Mainz]] (capital of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Hanau]], [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]], [[Wetzlar]] and [[Marburg]].\n\n===Districts===\n[[File:Frankfurt Subdivisions boroughs.svg|thumb|The 46 ''Stadtteile'' (city districts) of central Frankfurt]]\n\nThe city is divided into 46 city districts (''Stadtteile''), which are in turn divided into 121 city boroughs (''Stadtbezirke'') and 448 electoral districts (''Wahlbezirke''). The 46 city districts combine into 16 area districts (''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirke]]''), which each have a district committee and chairperson.\n\nThe largest city district by population and area is [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], while the smallest is [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], Frankfurt's historical center. Three larger city districts (Sachsenhausen, [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] and [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]]) are divided for administrative purposes into a northern (''-Nord'') and a southern (''-S\u00fcd'') part, respectively a western (''-West'') and an eastern (''-Ost'') part, but are generally considered as one city district (which is why often only 43 city districts are mentioned, even on the City's official website).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2835 |title=Stadtteile |publisher=Frankfurt.de |date=}}</ref>\n\nSome larger housing areas are often falsely called city districts, even by locals, like Nordweststadt (part of [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]] and [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]]), Goldstein (part of [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]]), Riedberg (part of [[Kalbach-Riedberg (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach-Riedberg]]) and [[Europaviertel (Frankfurt)|Europaviertel]] (part of [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]]). The [[Bankenviertel]] (''banking district''), Frankfurt's financial district, is also not an administrative city district (it covers parts of the western [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district, the southern [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and the eastern [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]] district).\n\nMany city districts are incorporated suburbs (''[[Vororte]]''), or were previously independent cities, such as [[H\u00f6chst (Frankfurt am Main)|H\u00f6chst]]. Some like [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] and [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] arose during the rapid growth of the city in the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] following the [[Unification of Germany]], while others were formed from territory which previously belonged to other city district(s), such as [[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] and [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]].\n\n===History of incorporations===\nUntil the year 1877 the city's territory consisted of the present-day inner-city districts of [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], [[Bahnhofsviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Bahnhofsviertel]], [[Gutleutviertel (Frankfurt am Main)|Gutleutviertel]], [[Gallus (Frankfurt am Main)|Gallus]], [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]], [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]], [[Ostend (Frankfurt am Main)|Ostend]] and [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].\n\n[[Bornheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bornheim]] was part of an administrative district called ''Landkreis Frankfurt'', before becoming part of the city on 1 January 1877, followed by [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] on 1 April 1895. [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]], [[Niederrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederrad]] and [[Oberrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Oberrad]] followed on 1 July 1900. The ''Landkreis Frankfurt'' was finally dispersed on 1 April 1910, and therefore [[Berkersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Berkersheim]], [[Bonames (Frankfurt am Main)|Bonames]], [[Eckenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eckenheim]], [[Eschersheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Eschersheim]], [[Ginnheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Ginnheim]], [[Hausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Hausen]], [[Heddernheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Heddernheim]], [[Niederursel (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederursel]], [[Praunheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Praunheim]], [[Preungesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Preungesheim]] and [[R\u00f6delheim (Frankfurt am Main)|R\u00f6delheim]] joined the City. In the same year a new city district, [[Riederwald (Frankfurt am Main)|Riederwald]], was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Seckbach and Ostend.\n\nOn 1 April 1928 the City of [[H\u00f6chst (Frankfurt am Main)|H\u00f6chst]] became part of Frankfurt, as well as its city districts [[Sindlingen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sindlingen]], [[Unterliederbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Unterliederbach]] and [[Zeilsheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Zeilsheim]]. Simultaneously the ''Landkreis H\u00f6chst'' was dispersed with its member cities either joining Frankfurt ([[Fechenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Fechenheim]], [[Griesheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Griesheim]], [[Nied (Frankfurt am Main)|Nied]], [[Schwanheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Schwanheim]], [[Sossenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Sossenheim]]) or joining the newly established ''Landkreis'' of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]].\n\n[[Dornbusch (Frankfurt am Main)|Dornbusch]] became a city district in 1946. It was created on territory that had formerly belonged to Eckenheim and Ginnheim.\n\n[[File:Enkheimer Ried.jpg|thumb|[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Enkheimer]] Ried]]\nOn 1 August 1972 Hesse's smaller suburbs of [[Harheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Harheim]], [[Kalbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Kalbach]], [[Nieder-Erlenbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Erlenbach]], and [[Nieder-Eschbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Nieder-Eschbach]] became districts while other neighbouring suburbs chose to join the Main-Taunus-Kreis, the [[Landkreis Offenbach]], the [[Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]], the [[Hochtaunuskreis]], the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] or the [[Wetteraukreis]].\n\n[[Bergen-Enkheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bergen-Enkheim]] was the last suburb to become part of Frankfurt on 1 January 1977.\n\n[[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] became an official city district in 1979. It covers the area of Frankfurt Airport that had belonged to Sachsenhausen and the neighbouring city of [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]].\n\nFrankfurt's youngest city district is [[Frankfurter Berg]]. It was part of Bonames until 1996.\n\nKalbach was officially renamed [[Kalbach-Riedberg]] in 2006 because of the large residential housing development in the area known as Riedberg.\n\n===Neighbouring districts and cities===\n[[File:Locator map of Planungsverband Ballungsraum Frankfurt Rhein-Main in Hesse.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Frankfurt urban area within [[Hesse]]]]\n\nTo the west Frankfurt borders the [[Districts of Germany|administrative district]] (''[[List of rural districts of Germany|Landkreis]]'') of [[Main-Taunus-Kreis]] with towns such as [[Hattersheim am Main]], [[Kriftel]], [[Hofheim am Taunus]], [[Kelkheim (Taunus)|Kelkheim]], [[Liederbach am Taunus]], [[Sulzbach (Taunus)|Sulzbach]], [[Schwalbach am Taunus]] and [[Eschborn]]; to the northwest the [[Hochtaunuskreis]] with [[Steinbach (Taunus)|Steinbach]], [[Oberursel (Taunus)]] and [[Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he]]; to the north the [[Wetteraukreis]] with [[Karben]] and [[Bad Vilbel]]; to the northeast the [[Main-Kinzig-Kreis]] with [[Niederdorfelden]] and [[Maintal]]; to the southeast the city of [[Offenbach am Main]]; to the south the [[Offenbach (district)|Kreis Offenbach]] with [[Neu-Isenburg]] and to the southwest the [[Gro\u00df-Gerau (district)|Kreis Gro\u00df-Gerau]] with [[M\u00f6rfelden-Walldorf]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]] and [[Kelsterbach]].\n\nTogether with these towns (and some larger nearby towns, e.g., [[Hanau]], [[Rodgau]], [[Dreieich]], [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]) Frankfurt forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Stadtregion Frankfurt'' which is not an official administrative district. The urban area had an estimated population of 2.3&nbsp;million in 2010 and is therefore the [[Largest urban areas in the European Union|13th largest urban area in the European Union]].\n\n===Climate===\nFrankfurt has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]-[[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: Cfb). Its average annual temperature is {{convert|10.6|\u00b0C|1}}, with monthly mean temperatures ranging from {{convert|1.6|\u00b0C|1}} in January to {{convert|20.0|\u00b0C|1}} in July.\n\n{{Weather

With 414,576 residents in 1910, it was the ninth largest city in Germany and the number of inhabitants grew to 553,464 before [[World War II]]. After the war, at the end of the year 1945, the number had dropped to 358,000. In the following years, the population grew again and reached an all-time-high of 691,257 in 1963. It dropped again to 592,411 in 1986 but has increased since then. According to the demographic forecasts for central Frankfurt, the city will have a population up to 825,000 within its administrative boundaries in 2020 and more than 2.5&nbsp;million inhabitants in its urban area.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the state government of [[Hesse]] wanted to include the entire urban area into its administrative boundaries. This would have made Frankfurt officially the second largest city in Germany after Berlin with up to 3 million inhabitants.<ref>H.

However, during the 19th century an increasing number of [[Roman Catholicism in Germany|Catholics]] moved there. The Jewish community has a history dating back to Medieval times and has always ranked among the largest in Germany. Two synagogues operate there. Due to the growing immigration of people from Muslim countries beginning in the 1960s, Frankfurt has a large Muslim community.

The houses were acquired by the city council in 1405 from a wealthy merchant family. The middle house became the city hall and was later connected with its neighbours. The ''Kaisersaal'' (\"Emperor's Hall\") is located on the upper floor and is where the newly crowned emperors held their banquets. The R\u00f6mer was partially destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. The surrounding square, the R\u00f6merberg, is named after the city hall.\n\nThe former [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) quarter between the R\u00f6mer and the Frankfurt Cathedral was to be redeveloped as the [[Dom-R\u00f6mer Project|Dom-R\u00f6mer Quarter]] through 2016, including [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructions]] of historical buildings that were destroyed during World War II.\n\n'''Frankfurt Cathedral'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Cathedral]] (Frankfurter Dom) is not a cathedral, but the main Catholic church, dedicated to [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St. Bartholomew]]. The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] building was constructed in the 14th and 15th centuries on the foundation of an earlier church from the [[Merovingian]] time. From 1356 onwards, kings of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were elected in this church, and from 1562 to 1792, [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman-German]] emperors were crowned there.\n\nSince the 18th century, St. Bartholomew's has been called ''Dom'', although it was never a bishop's seat. In 1867 it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in its present style. It was again partially destroyed in [[World War II]] and rebuilt in the 1950s. Its height is 95 meters. The cathedral tower has a viewing platform open to the public at a height of 66 meters, accessed through a narrow spiral staircase with 386 steps.\n\n{{triple image|right|Frankfurt Am Main-St Bartholomaeus-Ansicht vom Nextower-20110812.jpg|300|Frankfurt Am Main-Samstagsberg von Suedwesten-20110705.jpg|300|Frankfurt Paulskirche au\u00dfen 2011a.jpg|200|<center>[[Frankfurt Cathedral]]</center>|<center>[[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]]</center>|<center>[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]]</center>}}\n\n'''St. Paul's Church'''\n\n[[St. Paul's Church, Frankfurt|St. Paul's Church]] (''Paulskirche'') is a national historic monument in Germany because it was the seat of the first democratically elected parliament in 1848. It was established in 1789 as a [[Protestant]] church, but was not completed until 1833. Its importance has its roots in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]], which met in the church during the revolutionary years of 1848/49 in order to write a constitution for a united Germany. The attempt failed because the monarchs of [[Prussia]] and Austria did not want to lose power. In 1849 Prussian troops ended the democratic experiment by force and the parliament dissolved. Afterwards, the building was used for church services again.\n\nSt. Paul's was partially destroyed in World War II, particularly its interior, which now has a modern appearance. It was quickly and symbolically rebuilt after the war; today it is used mainly for exhibitions and events.\n\n[[File:Frankfurt Hauptwache View.jpg|thumb|right|The view towards downtown Frankfurt from [[Zeil]] shopping street]]\n\n'''Arch\u00e4ologischer Garten Frankfurt'''\n\nThe Archaeological Garden contains small parts of the oldest recovered buildings: an ancient Roman settlement and the Frankfurt Royal Palace (''Kaiserpfalz Frankfurt'') from the 6th century. The garden is located between the R\u00f6merberg and the Cathedral. It was discovered after World War II when the area was heavily bombed and later partly rebuilt. The remains were preserved and are now open to the public. There are plans underway to construct a building on top of the garden but anyhow it is decided that the garden will stay open to the public.\n\n'''Haus Wertheim'''\n\nWertheim House is the only [[Timber framing|timbered house]] in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district that survived the heavy bombings of World War II undamaged. It is located on the R\u00f6merberg next to the Historical Museum.\n\n'''Saalhof'''\n\nThe [[Saalhof]] is the oldest conserved building in the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] district and dates to the 12th century. It was used as an exhibition hall by Dutch [[cloth merchant|clothiers]] when trade fairs were held during the 14th and 15th century. The Saalhof was partly destroyed in World War II and later rebuilt. Today it serves as a part of the [[Historical museum, Frankfurt|Historical Museum]].\n\n'''Eiserner Steg'''\n\nThe Eiserner Steg (Iron Bridge) is a pedestrian-only bridge across the Main that connects R\u00f6merberg and Sachsenhausen. It was built in 1868 and was the second bridge to cross the river. After World War II, when it was blown up by the [[Wehrmacht]], it was quickly rebuilt in 1946. Today some 10,000 people cross the bridge on a daily basis.\n\n[[File:Alte Oper Frankfurt Winter 2008.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Alte Oper]], now a concert hall, at Opernplatz]]\n\n'''Alte Oper'''\n\nThe [[Alte Oper]] is a former [[opera house]], hence the name \"Old Opera\". The opera house was built in 1880 by architect Richard Lucae. It was one of the major opera houses in Germany until it was heavily damaged in World War II. Until the late 1970s, it was a ruin, nicknamed \"Germany's most beautiful ruin\". Former Frankfurt [[Lord Mayor]] Rudi Arndt called for blowing it up in the 1960s, which earned him the nickname \"Dynamite-Rudi\". (Later on, Arndt said he never had meant his suggestion seriously.)\n\nPublic pressure led to its refurbishment and reopening in 1981. Today, it functions as a famous concert hall, while operas are performed at the \"new\" Frankfurt Opera. The inscription on the [[frieze]] of the Alte Oper says: \"''Dem Wahren, Sch\u00f6nen, Guten''\" (\"To the true, the beautiful, the good\").\n\n'''Eschenheimer Turm'''\n\nThe Eschenheim Tower (''[[Eschenheimer Turm]]'') was erected at the beginning of the 15th century and served as a city gate as part of late-medieval fortifications. It is the oldest and most unaltered building in the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district.\n\n'''[[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]'''\n\nSt. Catherine's Church (''Katharinenkirche'') is the largest [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Protestant]] church, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]], a [[martyr]]ed early Christian saint. It is located in the city centre at the entrance to the Zeil, the central pedestrian shopping street.\n\n'''Hauptwache'''\n\nAlthough today [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] is mostly associated with the inner-city underground train station [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|of the same name]], the name originates from a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] building on the square above the station. The Hauptwache building was constructed in 1730 and was used as a prison, therefore the name that translates as \"main guard-house\". Today the square surrounding the building is also called \"Hauptwache\" (formal: ''An der Hauptwache''). It is situated in the city centre opposite to St. Catherine's Church and houses a famous caf\u00e9.\n\n{{triple image|right|Frankfurt Main Hauptwache Katharinenkirche 20120707.jpg|300|Frankfurt Nextower.20130514.jpg|130|Frankfurt Main Hauptbahnhof 6229.jpg|300|<center>[[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] and [[St. Catherine's Church, Frankfurt|St. Catherine's Church]]</center>|<center>[[Eschenheimer Turm]]</center>|<center>[[Frankfurt Central Station]]</center>}}\n\n'''Central Station'''\n\n[[Frankfurt Central Station]] (''Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof''), which opened in 1888, was built as the central train station for Frankfurt to replace three smaller train stations in the city centre and to boost the needed capacity for travellers. It was constructed as a [[Terminal station|terminus station]] and was the largest train station in Europe by floor area until 1915 when [[Leipzig Hauptbahnhof|Leipzig Central Station]] was opened. Its three main halls were constructed in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neorenaissance]]-style, while the later enlargement with two outer halls in 1924 was constructed in [[neoclassicism|neoclassic]]-style.\n\n'''Frankfurter Hof'''\n\nThe Frankfurter Hof is a landmarked hotel in the city centre at Kaiserplatz, built from 1872 to 1876. It is part of [[Steigenberger Hotels]] group and is considered the city's most prestigious.\n\n'''St. Leonhard'''\n\n[[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]], on the Main close to the bridge Eiserner Steg, is a Catholic [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] [[hall church]], derived from a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] [[basilica]] beginning in 1425. It is the only one of nine churches in the Old Town that survived World War II almost undamaged. The parish serves the English-speaking community. The church has been under restoration since 2011.\n\n===20th-century architecture===\n* '''[[Frauenfriedenskirche]]''' and '''[[Holy Cross Church, Frankfurt-Bornheim|Holy Cross Church]]''' (with the [[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg]]), both consecrated 1929, are examples of early modernist church buildings during the time of the [[New Frankfurt]].\n* '''[[Gro\u00dfmarkthalle|Grossmarkthalle]]''', built 1926\u20131928 as a part of the [[New Frankfurt]]-project, the former wholesale market hall, was (following reconstruction) to become part of the future [[seat of the European Central Bank]].\n* '''[[Goethe House]]''', rebuilt 1947.

Farbenindustrie AG]]. It is located in the [[Westend (Frankfurt am Main)|Westend]] district and borders [[Gr\u00fcneburgpark]] in the west. Upon its completion, the complex was the [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest office building]] in Europe and remained so until the 1950s.

The first building to exceed the 95-metre-high cathedral was not an office building but a [[grain silo]], the 120-metre high [[Henninger Turm]], built from 1959 to 1961.\n\nThe first high-rise building boom came in the 1970s when [[Westend Gate]] (then called ''Plaza B\u00fcro Center'') and [[Silberturm]] were constructed and became the tallest buildings in Germany with a height of 159.3 metres and 166.3 metres, respectively. Around the same time, [[Frankfurter B\u00fcro Center]] and [[City-Haus]] (142.4 metres and 142.1 metres) were constructed at Mainzer Landstra\u00dfe and [[Eurotower (Frankfurt)|Eurotower]] (148.0 metres) and [[Garden Tower]] (127.0 metres; then called ''Helaba-Hochhaus'') were constructed in the financial district.\n\nNone of the buildings constructed during the 1980s surpassed Silberturm. The most famous buildings from this decade are the [[Deutsche Bank Twin Towers]] at Taunusanlage, both 155.0 metres tall.\n\nThe 1990s featured a second wave. [[Messeturm]], built on the trade fair site, reached a height of 256.5 metres and became the tallest building in Europe by 1991. It was overtaken by the 259-metre high [[Commerzbank Tower]] in 1997. Other tall buildings from this decade are [[Westendstrasse 1]] (208.0 metres), [[Main Tower]] (200.0 metres) and [[Trianon (Frankfurt am Main)|Trianon]] (186.0 metres).\n\nIn 21st-century Frankfurt, more high-rise buildings and skyscrapers (e.g., [[Skyper]], [[Opernturm]], [[Tower 185]], [[Seat of the European Central Bank]], [[Taunusturm]]) emerged, but none have surpassed Commerzbank Tower.\n\n===Other tall structures===\n[[File:Europaturm Abend.jpg|thumb|right|Top of the [[Europaturm]], a 337&nbsp;m communications tower]]\n* '''[[Europaturm]] \u2014''' The Europe Tower is a [[Radio masts and towers|telecommunications tower]], also known as the Frankfurt TV Tower, built from 1974 to 1979. With a height of 337.5 metres it is the tallest tower and the second tallest structure in Germany after the [[Fernsehturm Berlin]]. It was open to the public until 1999, with an entertainment establishment in the revolving top. It is normally referred to by locals as the \"Ginnheimer Spargel\" (''Ginnheim Asparagus''), but stands a few metres within [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Bockenheim]] district.\n* '''[[Henninger Turm]] \u2014''' The Henninger Tower was a 120-metre-high [[grain silo]] built from 1959 to 1961 and owned by [[Henninger Brewery]]. It was the highest structure until 1974. The Henninger Tower had two rotating restaurants at the height of 101 and 106 metres and an open-air observation deck at the height of 110 metres. The tower closed to the public in October 2002 and was demolished in 2013 to be replaced by a 140&nbsp;m (459&nbsp;ft) tall residential tower, which is externally inspired by the old Henninger Turm, and will contain 130 luxury apartments. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and was expected to be completed sometime in 2016. From 1962 to 2008 a famous yearly [[Road bicycle racing|cycling race]] was named after the tower, the \"Radrennen Rund um den Henninger Turm\" (''Cycling race around Henninger Tower''). The now-renamed race is still a yearly event.\n* '''[[Goethe Tower|Goetheturm \u2014]]''' The Goethe Tower was a 43-metre high tower on the northern edge of the [[Frankfurt City Forest]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]].

It is a pedestrian-only area and is bordered by two large public squares, [[Hauptwache (Frankfurt am Main)|Hauptwache]] in the west and [[Konstablerwache]] in the east. It is the second most expensive street for shops to rent in Germany after the [[Kaufingerstra\u00dfe]] in [[Munich]]. 85 percent of the shops are retail chains such as [[H&M]], [[Saturn (store)|Saturn]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]], [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]] or [[NewYorker]]. In 2009 a new shopping mall named [[MyZeil]] opened there with nearly 100 stores and chains like [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]]. Three more shopping malls occupy the Zeil: [[Zeilgalerie]], [[Metro AG|Galeria Kaufhof]] and [[Arcandor|Karstadt]], as well as large fashion retail clothing stores from [[Peek & Cloppenburg]] and [[C&A]]. During the month before Christmas, the extended pedestrian-only zone is host to [[Frankfurt Christmas Market]], one of the largest and oldest Christmas markets in Germany.\n* '''[[Goethestra\u00dfe]]''' \u2013 Frankfurt's most expensive shopping street with prestigious shops like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Prada]], [[Gucci]], [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany]], [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Versace]], [[Cartier SA|Cartier]], [[Burberry]], [[Vertu]] and [[Bulgari]].

The name translates as \"feeding alley\" because of its high concentration of gastronomy, but lately prestigious shops (e.g., [[Apple Store]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche Design]]) have moved here due to the lack of space in the neighbouring [[Goethestra\u00dfe]], displacing old, established restaurants, butchers and delicatessens.\n* '''Berger Stra\u00dfe ''' \u2013 Frankfurt's longest shopping street.

It runs parallel to M\u00fcnchener Stra\u00dfe from the central station to the financial district. Kaiserstra\u00dfe is still a synonym for Frankfurt's [[Red-light district]] although [[Sex industry|sex-oriented businesses]] moved to neighbouring streets such as Taunusstra\u00dfe in the 1990s. Today Kaiserstra\u00dfe houses many smaller shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s.\n* '''Kleinmarkthalle ''' \u2013 (literally: ''Small Market Hall'') is a market hall in the city centre close to Konstablerwache offering fresh food and flowers.

The southern riverbank, which continues further to [[Offenbach am Main]] and [[Hanau]], offers the best skyline views. The northern riverbank ends in the west at the former Westhafen (''West Harbour'', a residential housing area) and is growing to the east: A former industrial-used area between the future [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] and the Osthafen (''East Harbour'') was to become a park named Hafenpark (''Harbour Park'').\n* '''Wallanlagen ''' \u2013 The [[Wallanlagen]] (former ''[[Defensive wall|ramparts]]'') relate to the former ring-shaped [[Defensive wall|city wall fortifications]] around the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]] district (abolished 1804\u20131812), now a series of parks. Building is not allowed, with a few exceptions, the most famous being the [[Alte Oper]] (built 1880) at the Opernplatz. The part between the northern Main riverbank and the Opernplatz, referred to officially as Taunusanlage and Gallusanlage, is locally known as \"Central Park\" (a reference to the [[Central Park|famous park]] in [[Manhattan]]), because of the skyscrapers which stand on both sides.\n* '''Nizza Park ''' \u2013 At the juncture of the northern Main riverbank and the Wallanlagen is a famous small park called Nizza. The name of the park recalls [[Nice]] in southern France, because it is one of the warmest areas with a nearly [[mediterranean climate]]. Numerous [[Mediterranean flora]] grow there and can survive outside during the winter.\n* '''Garten des Himmlischen Friedens ''' \u2013 ''Garden of Heavenly Peace'', named after the [[Tiananmen Square|Tiananmen Gate]] in Beijing, is a Chinese-styled park in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district and part of the larger Bethmannpark.

It offers live music, dance shows, booths for crafts, jewellery, clothes and food stands from around the world. \n* '''Dippemess''' \u2013 Frankfurt's oldest folk festival is the ''Festival of Stoneware'', which takes place semi-annually around Easter and the end of September in the eastern area. \"Dippe\" is a regional [[Hessian dialects|Hessian dialect]] word meaning \"pot\" or \"jar\" which would not be understood in most other German regions. Mentioned for the first time in the 14th century as an annual marketplace it is now more of an amusement park. The name of the festival derives from its original purpose, when it was a fair where traditionally crafted jars, pots and other stoneware were on offer.\n* '''W\u00e4ldchestag''' \u2013 ''Day of the forest'' is known as a regional holiday because until the 1990s it was common that Frankfurt's shops were closed on this day. The festival takes place over four days after [[Pentecost]] with the formal W\u00e4ldchestag on Tuesday. Its unique location is in the [[Frankfurt City Forest]], south-west of the city centre in [[Niederrad]]. \"W\u00e4ldches\" is a regional dialect of the German word \"W\u00e4ldchen\", meaning \"small forest\".\n* '''Nacht der Museen''' \u2013 ''Night of the museums'' takes place every year in April or May. 50 museums in Frankfurt and in the neighbouring city of [[Offenbach am Main]] are open until 2:00&nbsp;am surrounded by special music events, dance performances, readings and guided tours.

It is traditionally served in a glass, typically decorated with lozenges, called \"Geripptes\", a full glass is then called \"Schoppen\". Apfelwein is also available in a stoneware jar locally known as \"Bembel\". A group normally orders a \"Bembel\" and shares the contents. Apfelwein can be ordered as \"sauergespritzer\", which is apfelwein blended with 30% mineral water or as \"s\u00fcssgespritzer\", which is Apfelwein blended with lemon soda, orange soda or fresh-pressed apple juice (lemon soda being the most common). Most of the pubs which serve Apfelwein are located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]], which is therefore known as \"Ebbelwoi district\".

The airport has four [[runway]]s and serves 265 non-stop destinations. Run by transport company [[Fraport]] it ranks among the [[world's busiest airports by passenger traffic]] and is the [[world's busiest airports by cargo traffic|busiest airport by cargo traffic]] in Europe. The airport also serves as a hub for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]] and as the main hub for German [[flag carrier]] [[Lufthansa]]. Depending upon whether total passengers or flights are used for calculations, it ranks third or second busiest in Europe alongside [[London Heathrow Airport]] and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport]]. Passenger traffic at Frankfurt Airport in 2012 was 57.5&nbsp;million. There are plans to expand the airport with a third passenger terminal to increase the capacity up to 88 million in 2020.\n\nThe airport can be reached by car or bus and has two railway stations, one for regional and one for long-distance traffic. The [[S-Bahn]] lines S8 and S9 (direction ''Offenbach Ost'' or ''Hanau Hbf'') departing at the [[Frankfurt Airport regional station|regional station]] take 10\u201315 minutes from the airport to [[Frankfurt Central Station]] and onwards to the city centre ([[Frankfurt Hauptwache station|Hauptwache station]]), the [[InterCity|IC]] and [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] trains departing at the [[Frankfurt Airport long-distance station|long-distance station]] take 10 minutes to Frankfurt Central Station.\n\n====Frankfurt Hahn Airport====\nDespite the name, [[Frankfurt\u2013Hahn Airport|Frankfurt Hahn Airport]] (''Flughafen Frankfurt-Hahn'') is situated approximately {{convert|120|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the city in [[Lautzenhausen]] ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]]).

The [[Frankfurter Kreuz]] is an Autobahn interchange close to the airport, where the [[Bundesautobahn 3]] (A3), [[Cologne]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]], and the [[Bundesautobahn 5]] (A5), [[Basel]] to [[Hannover]], meet. With approximately 320,000 cars passing through it every day it is Europe's most heavily used interchange. The [[Bundesautobahn 66]] (A66) connects Frankfurt with [[Wiesbaden]] in the west and [[Fulda]] in the east. The [[Bundesautobahn 661]] (A661) is mainly a commuter motorway which starts in the south (Egelsbach), runs through the eastern part and ends in the north ([[Oberursel]]). The [[Bundesautobahn 648]] (A648) is a very short motorway in the western part which primarily serves as a fast connection between the A 66 and the [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]]. The A5 in the west, the A3 in the south and the A661 in the north-east form a [[ring road]] around the inner city districts and define a [[Low-emission zone]] (''Umweltzone''; established in 2008), meaning that vehicles have to meet certain emission criteria to enter the zone.\n\nThe streets of central Frankfurt are usually congested with cars during [[rush hour]]. Some areas, especially around the shopping streets Zeil, Goethestra\u00dfe and Fre\u00dfgass, are pedestrian-only streets.

The long-distance station is located outside the actual airport ground but has a connecting bridge for pedestrians to Terminal 1, concourse B. [[Frankfurt Airport regional station]] (''Frankfurt Flughafen Regionalbahnhof'') is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S8, S9) and regional trains. The regional station is located within Terminal 1, concourse B.\n\n====Frankfurt South station====\nFrankfurt's third long-distance station is [[Frankfurt South station]] (''Frankfurt S\u00fcdbahnhof'', often abbreviated as ''Frankfurt (Main) S\u00fcd'' or ''F-S\u00fcd''), located in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]]. It is an important destination for local trains and trams (lines 14 to 16, 19) and the terminal stop for four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U8) and four S-Bahn lines (S3, S4, S5, S6).\n\n====Messe stations====\nThe [[Frankfurt Trade Fair]] offers two railway stations: [[Frankfurt Messe station|Messe station]] is for local [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] trains (lines S3-S6) and is located at the centre of the trade fair premises while Festhalle/Messe station is served by U-Bahn line U4 and is located at the north-east corner of the premises.\n\n====Konstablerwache station and Hauptwache station====\nTwo other major railway stations in the city centre are Konstablerwache and Hauptwache, located on each end of the Zeil.

Most routes have at least 15-minute service during the day, either by one line running every 15 minutes, or by two lines servicing one route at a 30-minute interval. All lines, except line S7, run through the Frankfurt city tunnel and serve the stations [[Frankfurt Ostendstra\u00dfe station|Ostendstra\u00dfe]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Konstablerwache station|Konstablerwache]], [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptwache station|Hauptwache]], [[Taunusanlage station|Taunusanlage]] and [[Frankfurt Central Station]]. When leaving the city the S-Bahn travels above ground. It provides access to the trade fair (S3, S4, S5, S6), the airport (S8, S9), the stadium (S7, S8, S9) and nearby cities such as [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[Darmstadt]], [[R\u00fcsselsheim]], [[Hanau]], [[Offenbach am Main]], [[Oberursel]], [[Bad Homburg]], [[Kronberg]], [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]] and smaller towns that are on the way.\nThe S8/S9 runs 24/7.\n\n====U-Bahn====\n{{main|Frankfurt U-Bahn}}\nThe [[U-Bahn]] has nine lines (U1 to U9) serving Frankfurt and the larger suburbs of Bad Homburg and Oberursel in the north. The trains that run on the U-Bahn are in fact [[light rail]] (''[[Stadtbahn]]'') as many lines travel along a track in the middle of the street instead of underground further from the city centre. The minimum service interval is 2.5 minutes, although the usual pattern is that each line runs at 7.5 to 10-minute intervals, which produce between 3 and 5-minute intervals on city centre tracks shared by more than one line.\n\n====Tram====\n{{main|Trams in Frankfurt am Main}}\nFrankfurt has ten [[tram]] lines (11, 12, 14 to 21), with trams arriving usually every 10 minutes.

Otherwise, his reign as king was largely uneventful.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Military career===\nAlbert's education, as usual with German princes, concentrated to a great extent on [[military]] matters, but he attended lectures at the [[University of Bonn]]. His first experience of warfare came in 1849, when he served as a captain in the [[First War of Schleswig]] against [[Denmark]].\n\nWhen the [[Austro-Prussian War]] broke out in 1866, Albert then [[Crown Prince]] (German: ''Kronprinz''), took up the command of the Saxon forces opposing the [[Prussian Army]] of [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828\u20131885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]]. No attempt was made to defend Saxony; the Saxons fell back into [[Bohemia]] and effected a junction with the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]]. They took a prominent part in the battles by which the Prussians forced the line of the [[Jizera River|Jizera]] and in the [[Battle of Ji\u010d\u00edn]]. The Crown Prince, however, succeeded in effecting the retreat in good order, and in the decisive [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] (3 July 1866) he held the extreme left of the Austrian position. The Saxons maintained their post with great tenacity, but were involved in the disastrous defeat of their allies.\n\nDuring these operations the Crown Prince won the reputation of a thorough soldier; after peace was made and Saxony had entered the [[North German Confederation]], he gained the command of the Saxon army, which had now become the XII army corps of the North German army, and in this position carried out the necessary re-organisation. He proved a firm adherent of the Prussian alliance. On the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870 he again commanded the Saxons, who were included in the 2nd army under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia, his old opponent. At the [[Battle of Gravelotte]], they formed the extreme left of the German army, and with the Prussian Guard carried out the attack on [[Saint-Privat-la-Montagne|St Privat]], the final and decisive action in the battle.\n\nIn the re-organisation of the army which accompanied the march towards Paris the Crown Prince gained a separate command over the 4th army (Army of the Meuse) consisting of the Saxons, the Prussian Guard corps, and the IV ([[Province of Saxony|Prussian Saxony]]) corps. He was succeeded in command of the XII corps by his brother [[George of Saxony|Prince George]], who had served under him in Bohemia.\n\nAlbert took a leading part in the operations which preceded the battle of [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], the 4th army being the pivot on which the whole army wheeled round in pursuit of [[Patrice de MacMahon, Duke of Magenta|Mac-Mahon]]; and the actions of Buzancy and [[Battle of Beaumont|Beaumont]] on 29 and 30 August 1870 were fought under his direction; in the [[Battle of Sedan]] itself (1 September 1870), with the troops under his orders, Albert carried out the envelopment of the French on the east and north.\n\nAlbert's conduct in these engagements won for him the complete confidence of the army, and during the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] his troops formed the north-east section of the investing force. After the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)]], he was left in command of the German army of occupation, a position which he held till the fall of the [[Paris Commune]]. On the conclusion of peace he was made an inspector-general of the army and a [[field marshal]].\n\n===King===\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Sibyllenort Schloss.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Castle Sibyllenort, were King Albert died.]] -->\n\nOn the death of his father King John on 29 October 1873, the Crown Prince succeeded to the throne as King Albert. His reign proved uneventful, and he took little public part in politics, devoting himself to military affairs, in which his advice and experience were of the greatest value, not only to the Saxon corps but to the German army in general.  During his reign, the Saxon monarchy became constitutional.\n\nIn the 1870s, Albert initiated the construction of a Dresden suburb, the [[Albertstadt]]. At that time it was the largest garrison in Germany. Near the former suburb other buildings and places still bear his name: the [[Albertbr\u00fccke]], the [[Alberthafen]], the [[Albertplatz]] and the [[Albertinum]].\n\nIn 1879, he initiated the re-construction of the [[S\u00e4chsisches Landesgymnasium Sankt Afra zu Mei\u00dfen|Saint Afra School]] in [[Meissen]]. In 1897, he was appointed arbitrator between the claimants for the [[Principality of Lippe]].\n\n===Marriage and succession===\nIn [[Dresden]] on 18 June 1853, Albert married Princess [[Carola of Vasa|Carola]], daughter of [[Gustav, Prince of Vasa]] and granddaughter of [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]], the second to last king of [[Sweden]] of the [[House of Holstein-Gottorp (Swedish line)|House of Holstein-Gottorp]]. The marriage was childless.\n\nAlbert died at [[Sibyllenort]] on 19 June 1902, and was succeeded by his brother, who became King [[George, King of Saxony|George]]. He was buried in Dresden on 23 June, among the mourners present were both the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] and the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - Funeral of the King of Saxony |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=24 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36802| }}</ref>\n\n==Decorations and awards==\n;Grand Master of the following Saxon Orders:\n* [[Order of the Rue Crown]]\n* [[Military Order of St. Henry]]\n* [[Royal Order of Albert of Saxony]]\n* [[Civil Order of Saxony]]\n\n;Foreign Honours\nHe was the 954th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in [[Austria]] in 1850, the 776th [[Knight]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1882 and the 95th [[Grand Cross]] of the [[Order of the Tower and Sword]].\n* {{flag|Belgium}}: Grand Cordon of the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] in 1853.<ref>Le livre d'or de l'ordre de L\u00e9opold et de la croix de fer, Volume 1 /Ferdinand Veldekens</ref>\n* Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (Austria)\n* Honorary Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] (United Kingdom)\n* Knight of the [[Order of the Most Holy Annunciation]] ([[Kingdom of Sardinia]], 1850)\n* Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]] (Kingdom of Sardinia, 1850)\n* [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] ([[Prussia]])\n* [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] (Prussia)\n* [[Iron Cross]], 1st and 2nd classes (Prussia)\n* Knight of the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]] ([[Austrian Empire]])\n* Knight Grand Cross of the [[Military Order of Max Joseph]] ([[Bavaria]])\n* Knight Grand Cross of the [[Military Merit Order (Bavaria)|Order of Military Merit]] with Swords (Bavaria)\n* Knight, 1st class of the [[Order of the Z\u00e4hringer Lion]] ([[Baden]])\n* Knight 2nd class, [[Imperial Order of St. George]] ([[Russian Empire]])\n\nThe [[King of Saxony bird-of-paradise]] was named in Albert's honour; the [[Queen Carola's parotia]] was named for his wife.\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

New York: Charles Scribner and Sons, 1970</ref> Aguilon was the first to use the term [[horopter]], which is the line drawn through the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] of both eyes and parallel to the line between the eyes. In other words, it describes how only objects on the horopter are seen in their true location. He then built an instrument to measure the spacing of double images in the horopter as he saw fit.\n\nD'Aguilon expanded on the horopter by saying in his book: {{Quote|If objects fall upon different rays it can happen that things at different distances can be seen at equal angles. If point C be directly opposite the eyes, A and B, with a circle drawn through the three points, A, B, and C.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> By theorem 21 of [[Euclid|Euclid's]] Third book, any other point D on its circumference which lies closer to the observer than C, will subend an angle ADB which will equal angle ACB. Therefore, objects at C and at D are judged equally far from the eye.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> But this is false, because point C is farther away than D. Therefore a judgment of distance is false when based on the angles between converged axes, quod erat probandum.}}\n\nAt first glance, it seems that Aguillon discovered the geometrical horopter more than 200 years before Prevost and Vieth and Muller.<ref name=\"faculty.fairfield.edu\"/> The horopter was then used by architect [[Girard Desargues]], who in 1639 published a remarkable treatise on the conic sections, emphasizing the idea of projection.\n\n=== Similarity to other theorists ===\nIn Aguilon's book there are elements of perspectivities as well as the stereographic projections of [[Ptolemy]] and [[Hipparchus]]. Unaware that [[Johannes Kepler]] had already published optical theories years before him, Aguilon decided to share his insights on geometric optics. At the age of 20, the Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens read Aguilon's and was enthralled by it. He later said that it was the best book he had ever read in geometrical optics, and he thought that Aguilon should be compared to [[Plato]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] and [[Archimedes]]. In fact the title of Constantijn Huygens' first publication imitated Aguilon's title (omitting letters p and c): Otiorum Libri Sex (1625).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Accompanying art ===\nIn Aguilon's book the beginning of each section had works of the Flemish Baroque painter, Peter Paul Rubens. The frontispiece at the beginning of the book shows an eagle, referring to Aguilon's name and a variety of optical and geometrical images. On either side of the title stands Mercury holding the head of Argus with a hundred eyes, and Minerva holding a shield reflecting the head of Medusa. Then, at the beginning of each of six sections are Rubens' drawings describing Aguilon's experiments, one of which is the first known picture of a photometer<ref name=\"faculty.fairfield.edu\"/> This is one of six experiments drawn by Rubens and shows how intensity of light varies with the square of distance from the source. The experiment was later taken up by Mersenne and another Jesuit, Claude de Chales, and eventually led to Bouguer's more famous photometer. It is evident, from the detail that he put into his drawings, how enthused Rubens was about the subject matter, perspective geometry and optical rules.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Catholic cleric-scientists]]\n*[[List of Jesuit scientists]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation\n  | last = Mor\u00e8re\n  | first = J.

The most fundamental change is support for [[darknet]] operation. Version 0.7 offered two modes of operation: a  mode in which it connects only to friends, and an opennet-mode in which it connects to any other Freenet user. Both modes can be run simultaneously. When a user switches to pure darknet operation, Freenet becomes very difficult to detect from the outside. The [[transport layer]] created for the darknet mode allows communication over restricted routes as commonly found in [[mesh networking|mesh networks]], as long as these connections follow a [[Small-world network|small-world]] structure.<ref>Singh, Munindar P.

This problem was solved by making Freenet compatible with [[OpenJDK]], a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform.\n\nOn 11 February 2015, Freenet received the SUMA-Award for \"protection against total surveillance.\"<ref name=suma_award>[http://suma-awards.de/en/index.html SUMA Award], 11 February 2015.</ref><ref name=suma_award_recording>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZpsBSPsHDI recording of the SUMA Award Ceremony 2015], published on 14 April 2015.</ref><ref name=suma_award_heise>[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/SUMA-Award-fuer-das-Freenet-Project-2548577.html SUMA Award f\u00fcr das Freenet Projekt] Jo Bager in Heise online, 2015</ref>\n\n==Features and user interface of Freenet==\nFreenet is different from most other peer-to-peer applications, both in how users interact with it and in the security it offers.{{dubious|date=October 2018}} It separates the underlying network structure and protocol from how users interact with the network; as a result, there are a variety of ways to access content on the Freenet network. The simplest is via FProxy, which is integrated with the node software and provides a web interface to content on the network. Using FProxy, a user can browse freesites (websites that use normal [[HTML]] and related tools, but whose content is stored within Freenet rather than on a traditional web server). The web interface is also used for most configuration and node management tasks. Through the use of separate applications or plugins loaded into the node software, users can interact with the network in other ways, such as forums similar to web forums or Usenet or interfaces more similar to traditional P2P \"filesharing\" interfaces.\n\nWhile Freenet provides an [[HTTP]] interface for browsing freesites, it is not a [[Proxy server|proxy]] for the [[World Wide Web]]; Freenet can be used to access only the content that has been previously inserted into the Freenet network. In this way, it is more similar to [[Tor (anonymity network)#Hidden services|Tor's hidden services]] than to anonymous proxy software like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor's proxy]].\n\nFreenet's focus lies on [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and anonymity. Because of that, Freenet acts differently at certain points that are (directly or indirectly) related to the anonymity part. Freenet attempts to protect the anonymity of both people inserting data into the network (uploading) and those retrieving data from the network (downloading). Unlike file sharing systems, there is no need for the uploader to remain on the network after uploading a file or group of files. Instead, during the upload process, the files are broken into chunks and stored on a variety of other computers on the network. When downloading, those chunks are found and reassembled. Every node on the Freenet network contributes storage space to hold files and bandwidth that it uses to route requests from its peers.\n\nAs a direct result of the anonymity requirements, the node requesting content does not normally connect directly to the node that has it; instead, the request is routed across several intermediaries, none of which know which node made the request or which one had it. As a result, the total bandwidth required by the network to transfer a file is higher than in other systems, which can result in slower transfers, especially for infrequently accessed content.\n\nSince version 0.7, Freenet offers two different levels of security: Opennet and Darknet. With Opennet, users connect to arbitrary other users. With Darknet, users connect only to \"friends\" with whom they previously exchanged [[Public-key cryptography|public keys]], named node-references. Both modes can be used together.\n\n==Content==\nFreenet's founders argue that true freedom of speech comes only with true anonymity and that the beneficial uses of Freenet outweigh its negative uses.<ref name=\"philosophy\">[https://freenetproject.org/philosophy.html The Philosophy behind Freenet]</ref> Their view is that free speech, in itself, is not in contradiction with any other consideration\u2014the information is not the crime. Freenet attempts to remove the possibility of any group imposing its beliefs or values on any data. Although many states censor communications to different extents, they all share one commonality in that a body must decide what information to censor and what information to allow. What may be acceptable to one group of people may be considered offensive or even dangerous to another. In essence, the purpose of Freenet is to ensure that no one is allowed to decide what is acceptable.\n\nReports of Freenet's use in authoritarian nations is difficult to track due to the very nature of Freenet's goals. One group, ''Freenet China'', used to introduce the Freenet software to [[China|Chinese]] users starting from 2001 and distribute it within China through e-mails and on disks after the group's website was blocked by the Chinese authorities on the mainland. It was reported that in 2002 ''Freenet China'' had several thousand dedicated users.<ref>Damm, Jens, and Simona Thomas. ''Chinese Cyberspaces Technological Changes and Political Effects''. London: Routledge, 2006.</ref>{{rp|70\u201371}} However, Freenet traffic is blocked in China around the 2010s.{{Citation needed|reason=This sounds plausible but would benefit from a source|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Technical design==\n{{See also|Cryptography}}\n\nThe Freenet [[file sharing]] network stores documents and allows them to be retrieved later by an associated key, as is now possible with protocols such as [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]. The network is designed to be highly survivable. The system has no central servers and is not subject to the control of any one individual or organization, including the designers of Freenet. Information stored on Freenet is distributed around the network and stored on several different nodes. Encryption of data and relaying of requests makes it difficult to determine who inserted content into Freenet, who requested that content, or where the content was stored.  This protects the anonymity of participants, and also makes it very difficult to censor specific content.  Content is stored encrypted, making it difficult for even the operator of a node to determine what is stored on that node.  This provides [[plausible deniability]], and in combination with the request relaying means that [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] laws that protect service providers may also protect Freenet node operators. When asked about the topic, Freenet developers defer to the EFF discussion which says that not being able to filter anything is a safe choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232303/https://emu.freenetproject.org/pipermail/chat/2009-February/001872.html|last=Toseland|first=Matthew |title=Does Freenet qualify for DMCA Safe Harbor? |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/wp/iaal-what-peer-peer-developers-need-know-about-copyright-law|title=\nIAAL*: What Peer-to-Peer Developers Need to Know about Copyright Law\n |accessdate=15 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Distributed storage and caching of data===\nUnlike other [[P2P network]]s, Freenet not only transmits data between nodes but actually stores them, working as a huge distributed cache. To achieve this, each node allocates some amount of disk space to store data; this is configurable by the node operator, but is typically several GB (or more).\n\nFiles on Freenet are typically split into multiple small blocks, with duplicate blocks created to provide [[Forward error correction|redundancy]].  Each block is handled independently, meaning that a single file may have parts stored on many different nodes.\n\nInformation flow in Freenet is different from networks like [[eMule]] or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]; in Freenet:\n\n# A user wishing to share a file or update a freesite \"inserts\" the file \"to the network\"\n# After \"insertion\" is finished, the publishing node is free to shut down, because the file is stored in the network. It will remain available for other users whether or not the original publishing node is online. No single node is responsible for the content; instead, it is replicated to many different nodes.\n\nTwo advantages of this design are high reliability and anonymity. Information remains available even if the publisher node goes offline, and is anonymously spread over many hosting nodes as encrypted blocks, not entire files.\n\nThe key disadvantage of the storage method is that no one node is responsible for any chunk of data. If a piece of data is not retrieved for some time and a node keeps getting new data, it will drop the old data sometime when its allocated disk space is fully used. In this way Freenet tends to 'forget' data which is not retrieved regularly (see also [[Freenet#Effect|Effect]]).\n\nWhile users can insert data into the network, there is no way to delete data. Due to Freenet's anonymous nature the original publishing node or owner of any piece of data is unknown. The only way data can be removed is if users don't request it.\n\n===Network===\nTypically, a host computer on the network runs the software that acts as a node, and it connects to other hosts running that same software to form a large distributed, variable-size network of peer nodes. Some nodes are end user nodes, from which documents are requested and presented to human users. Other nodes serve only to route data. All nodes communicate with each other identically \u2013 there are no dedicated \"clients\" or \"servers\". It is not possible for a node to rate another node except by its capacity to insert and fetch data associated with a key. This is unlike most other P2P networks where node administrators can employ a ratio system, where users have to share a certain amount of content before they can download.\n\nFreenet may also be considered a [[small world network]].\n\nThe Freenet protocol is intended to be used on a network of complex topology, such as the Internet ([[Internet Protocol]]). Each node knows only about some number of other nodes that it can reach directly (its conceptual \"neighbors\"), but any node can be a neighbor to any other; no hierarchy or other structure is intended. Each message is routed through the network by passing from neighbor to neighbor until it reaches its destination. As each node passes a message to a neighbor, it does not know whether the neighbor will forward the message to another node, or is the final destination or original source of the message. This is intended to protect the anonymity of users and publishers.\n\nEach node maintains a data store containing documents associated with keys, and a routing table associating nodes with records of their performance in retrieving different keys.\n\n===Protocol===\n[[File:Freenet Request Sequence ZP.svg|thumb|A typical request sequence. The request moves through the network from node to node, backing out of a dead-end (step 3) and a loop (step 7) before locating the desired file.]]\n\nThe Freenet protocol uses a [[key-based routing]] protocol, similar to [[distributed hash table]]s. The routing algorithm changed significantly in version 0.7. Prior to version 0.7, Freenet used a [[heuristic routing]] algorithm where each node had no fixed location, and routing was based on which node had served a key closest to the key being fetched (in version 0.3) or which is estimated to serve it faster (in version 0.5).  In either case, new connections were sometimes added to downstream nodes (i.e. the node that answered the request) when requests succeeded, and old nodes were discarded in least recently used order (or something close to it). Oskar Sandberg's research (during the development of version 0.7) shows that this \"path folding\" is critical, and that a very simple routing algorithm will suffice provided there is path folding.\n\nThe disadvantage of this is that it is very easy for an attacker to find Freenet nodes, and connect to them, because every node is continually attempting to find new connections. In version 0.7, Freenet supports both 'Opennet' (similar to the old algorithms, but simpler), and \"Darknet\" (all node connections are set up manually, so only your friends know your node's IP address). Darknet is less convenient, but much more secure against a distant attacker.\n\nThis change required major changes in the routing algorithm. Every node has a location, which is a number between 0 and 1. When a key is requested, first the node checks the local data store. If it's not found, the key's hash is turned into another number in the same range, and the request is routed to the node whose location is closest to the key. This goes on until some number of hops is exceeded, there are no more nodes to search, or the data is found. If the data is found, it is cached on each node along the path. So there is no one source node for a key, and attempting to find where it is currently stored will result in it being cached more widely. Essentially the same process is used to insert a document into the network: the data is routed according to the key until it runs out of hops, and if no existing document is found with the same key, it is stored on each node. If older data is found, the older data is propagated and returned to the originator, and the insert \"collides\".\n\nBut this works only if the locations are clustered in the right way. Freenet assumes that the Darknet (a subset of the global social network) is a small-world network, and nodes constantly attempt to swap locations (using the [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm]]) in order to minimize their distance to their neighbors. If the network actually is a small-world network, Freenet should find data reasonably quickly; ideally on the order of [[Big O notation|<math>O\\left(\\left[log\\left(n\\right)\\right]^2\\right)</math>]] hops. However, it does not guarantee that data will be found at all.<ref name=Clarke2010>{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Ian|title=Private Communication Through a Network of Trusted Connections: The Dark Freenet|date=2010|url=https://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-0.7.5-paper.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-15|ref=Clarke2010}}</ref>\n\nEventually, either the document is found or the hop limit is exceeded. The terminal node sends a reply that makes its way back to the originator along the route specified by the intermediate nodes' records of pending requests. The intermediate nodes may choose to cache the document along the way. Besides saving bandwidth, this also makes documents harder to censor as there is no one \"source node.\"\n\n===Effect===\n[[File:Freenet datastore specialisation.ani.gif|thumb|450px|right|The effect of the node specialising on the particular location.]]\nInitially, the locations in Darknet are distributed randomly. This means that routing of requests is essentially random. In Opennet connections are established by a join request which provides an optimized network structure if the existing network is already optimized.<ref name=Roos2014>{{cite book|last1=Roos|first1=Stefanie|title=Measuring Freenet in the Wild: Censorship-Resilience under Observation|date=2014|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-08505-0|pages=263\u2013282|url=https://freenetproject.org/papers/roos-pets2014.pdf|accessdate=2015-09-15|ref=Roos2014}}</ref> So the data in a newly started Freenet will be distributed somewhat randomly.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs location swapping (on Darknet) and path folding (on Opennet) progress, nodes which are close to one another will increasingly have close locations, and nodes which are far away will have distant locations. Data with similar keys will be stored on the same node.<ref name=Roos2014 />\n\nThe result is that the network will self-organize into a distributed, clustered structure where nodes tend to hold data items that are close together in key space. There will probably be multiple such clusters throughout the network, any given document being replicated numerous times, depending on how much it is used. This is a kind of \"[[spontaneous symmetry breaking]]\", in which an initially symmetric state (all nodes being the same, with random initial keys for each other) leads to a highly asymmetric situation, with nodes coming to specialize in data that has closely related keys.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThere are forces which tend to cause clustering (shared closeness data spreads throughout the network), and forces that tend to break up clusters (local caching of commonly used data). These forces will be different depending on how often data is used, so that seldom-used data will tend to be on just a few nodes which specialize in providing that data, and frequently used items will be spread widely throughout the network. This automatic mirroring counteracts the times when [[web traffic]] becomes overloaded, and due to a mature network's intelligent routing, a network of size ''n'' should require only log(''n'') time to retrieve a document on average.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n===Keys===\nKeys are [[hash function|hashes]]: there is no notion of [[semantic closeness]] when speaking of key closeness. Therefore, there will be no correlation between key closeness and similar popularity of data as there might be if keys did exhibit some semantic meaning, thus avoiding bottlenecks caused by popular subjects.\n\nThere are two main varieties of keys in use on Freenet, the Content Hash Key (CHK) and the Signed Subspace Key (SSK). A subtype of SSKs is the Updatable Subspace Key (USK) which adds versioning to allow secure updating of content.\n\nA CHK is a [[SHA-256]] hash of a document (after encryption, which itself depends on the hash of the plaintext) and thus a node can check that the document returned is correct by hashing it and checking the digest against the key. This key contains the meat of the data on Freenet. It carries all the binary data building blocks for the content to be delivered to the client for reassembly and decryption. The CHK is unique by nature and provides tamperproof content. A hostile node altering the data under a CHK will immediately be detected by the next node or the client. CHKs also reduce the redundancy of data since the same data will have the same CHK and when multiple sites reference the same large files, they can reference to the same CHK.<ref>{{cite web|title=freesitemgr, code for inserting files as CHK, fixed revision|url=https://github.com/freenet/lib-pyFreenet/blob/b78aea05222c4afe5145d8b529d2a54d4b93887a/fcp/sitemgr.py#L976|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\nSSKs are based on public-key cryptography. Currently Freenet uses the [[Digital Signature Algorithm|DSA]] algorithm. Documents inserted under SSKs are signed by the inserter, and this signature can be verified by every node to ensure that the data is not tampered with. SSKs can be used to establish a verifiable [[pseudonymity|pseudonymous]] identity on Freenet, and allow for multiple documents to be inserted securely by a single person. Files inserted with an SSK are effectively [[Immutable object|immutable]], since inserting a second file with the same name can cause collisions. USKs resolve this by adding a version number to the keys which is also used for providing update notification for keys registered as bookmarks in the web interface.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Babenhauserheide|first1=Arne|title=USK and Date-Hints: Finding the newest version of a site in Freenet's immutable datastore|url=http://draketo.de/light/english/freenet/usk-and-date-hints|website=http://draketo.de|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref> Another subtype of the SSK is the Keyword Signed Key, or KSK, in which the key pair is generated in a standard way from a simple human-readable string. Inserting a document using a KSK allows the document to be retrieved and decrypted if and only if the requester knows the human-readable string; this allows for more convenient (but less secure) [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]] for users to refer to.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Babenhauserheide|first1=Arne|title=Effortless password protected sharing of files via Freenet|url=http://draketo.de/light/english/freenet/effortless-password-protected-sharing-files|website=http://draketo.de|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Scalability==\nA [[Computer networking|network]] is said to be scalable if its performance does not deteriorate even if the network is very large. The scalability of Freenet is being evaluated, but similar architectures have been shown to scale logarithmically.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1145/335305.335325 |chapter=The Small-World Phenomenon: An Algorithmic Perspective |title=Proceedings of the thirty-second annual ACM symposium on Theory of computing |year=2000 |last1=Kleinberg |first1=Jon |isbn=978-1-58113-184-0 |pages=163\u201370 |chapterurl=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/swn.pdf}}</ref> This work indicates that Freenet can find data in <math>O(\\log^2 n)</math> hops on a small-world network (which includes both opennet and darknet style Freenet networks), when ignoring the caching which could improve the scalability for popular content. However, this scalability is difficult to test without a very large network. Furthermore, the security features inherent to Freenet make detailed performance analysis (including things as simple as determining the size of the network) difficult to do accurately. As of now, the scalability of Freenet has yet to be tested.\n\n==Darknet versus Opennet==\nAs of version 0.7, Freenet supports both \"darknet\" and \"opennet\" connections.  Opennet connections are made automatically by nodes with opennet enabled, while darknet connections are manually established between users that know and trust each other.  Freenet developers describe the trust needed as \u201cwill not crack their Freenet node\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d6.gnutella2.info/freenet/USK@sUm3oJISSEU4pl2Is9qa1eRoCLyz6r2LPkEqlXc3~oc,yBEbf-IJrcB8Pe~gAd53DEEHgbugUkFSHtzzLqnYlbs,AQACAAE/random_babcom/135/#Requiredtrustforformingadarknetconnection|title=Required trust for forming a darknet connection|last=|first=|date=2017-11-29|website=random_babcom|accessdate=2017-11-29}}</ref>  Opennet connections are easy to use, but darknet connections are more secure against attackers on the network, and can make it difficult for an attacker (such as an oppressive government) to even determine that a user is running Freenet in the first place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.golem.de/0805/59592.html|title=Darknet-F\u00e4higkeiten sollen Softwarenutzung verbergen|date=2008-05-09|work=|accessdate=2017-11-29|publisher=Golem}}</ref>\n\nThe core innovation in Freenet 0.7 is to allow a globally scalable darknet, capable (at least in theory) of supporting millions of users.  Previous darknets, such as [[WASTE]], have been limited to relatively small disconnected networks.  The scalability of Freenet is made possible by the fact that human relationships tend to form small-world networks, a property that can be exploited to find short paths between any two people. The work is based on a speech given at [[DEF CON (convention)|DEF CON 13]] by [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]] and Swedish mathematician [[Oskar Sandberg]].  Furthermore, the routing algorithm is capable of routing over a mixture of opennet and darknet connections, allowing people who have only a few friends using the network to get the performance from having sufficient connections while still receiving some of the security benefits of darknet connections.  This also means that small darknets where some users also have opennet connections are fully integrated into the whole Freenet network, allowing all users access to all content, whether they run opennet, darknet, or a hybrid of the two, except for darknet pockets connected only by a single hybrid node.<ref name=Roos2014 />\n\n== Tools and applications ==\n[[File:frost screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of Frost running on [[Microsoft Windows]]]]\n\nUnlike many other P2P applications Freenet does not provide comprehensive functionality itself.

Even though other preservation methods now exist, fortification continues to be used because the process can add distinct flavors to the finished product{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.\n\nAlthough grape brandy is most commonly added to produce fortified wines, the additional alcohol may also be [[Neutral grain spirit|neutral spirit]] that has been made from grapes, grain, [[sugar beet]]s or [[sugarcane]]. Regional [[appellation]] laws may dictate the types of spirit that are permitted for fortification. For example, in the U.S. only spirits from grapes may be used.\n\nThe source of the additional alcohol and the method of its distillation can affect the flavour of the fortified wine. If [[Neutral grain spirit|neutral spirit]] is used, it will usually have been produced with a [[continuous still]], rather than a [[pot still]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 279\"/>\n\nWhen added to wine before the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process is complete, the alcohol in the distilled beverage kills the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] and leaves [[residual sugar]] behind. The end result is a wine that is both sweeter and stronger, normally containing about 20% [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV).\n\nDuring the [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] process, yeast cells in the [[must]] continue to convert sugar into alcohol until the must reaches an alcohol level of 16%\u201318%. At this level, the alcohol becomes [[toxin|toxic]] to the yeast and kills it. If fermentation is allowed to run to completion, the resulting wine will (in most cases) be low in sugar and will be considered a dry wine. The earlier in the fermentation process that alcohol is added, the sweeter the resulting wine will be. For drier fortified wine styles, such as [[sherry]], the alcohol is added shortly before or after the end of the fermentation.\n\nIn the case of some fortified wine styles (such as [[late harvest wine|late harvest]] and [[Noble rot|botrytized wine]]s), a naturally high level of sugar will inhibit the yeast. This causes fermentation to stop before the wine can become dry.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 279\"/>{{clear left}}\n\n==Varieties==\n\n===Commandaria wine===\n[[File:Commandaria Cyprus.jpg|thumb|right|The commandaria wine tasting]]\n{{Main|Commandaria}}\n[[Commandaria]] is made in [[Cyprus]]' unique AOC region north of Limassol from high altitude vines of [[Mavro]] and [[Xynisteri]], sun dried and aged in oak barrels.

The word \"sherry\" itself is an [[anglicisation]] of Jerez. In earlier times, sherry was known as ''[[sack (wine)|sack]]'' (from the Spanish ''saca'', meaning \"a removal from the [[solera]]\"). In the European Union \"sherry\" is a [[protected designation of origin]]; therefore, all wine labelled as \"sherry\" must legally come from the Sherry Triangle, which is an area in the province of [[C\u00e1diz (province)|C\u00e1diz]] between [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] and [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda]].<ref>[http://www.nicks.com.au/index.aspx?link_id=76.1232 Spanish law]</ref>\n\nAfter [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] is complete, sherry is fortified with [[brandy]]. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, [[port wine]] (for example) is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.\n\nSherry is produced in a variety of styles, ranging from dry, light versions such as [[fino]]s to much darker and sometimes sweeter versions known as [[oloroso]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Cream sherry is always sweet.{{clear left}}\n\n===Vermouth===\n{{Main|Vermouth}}\n[[File:Martini Bianco.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Martini (vermouth)|Martini]] Bianco, an Italian vermouth]]\nVermouth is a fortified wine flavoured with aromatic [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s (\"aromatised\" in the trade) using closely guarded recipes ([[trade secret]]s).

However, wine flavoured with wormwood goes back to ancient Rome. The modern German word ''Wermut'' (''Wermuth'' in the spelling of Carpano's time) means both ''wormwood'' and ''vermouth''.

He was also put in charge of countermeasures against the radar guided guns found on the [[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|''Graf Spee'']].<ref>Simon Mitton, ''Fred Hoyle, a Life in Science'', Cambridge University Press (2011).</ref> Britain's radar project employed more personnel than the [[Manhattan project]], and was probably the inspiration for the large British project in ''[[The Black Cloud]]''. Two key colleagues in this war work were [[Hermann Bondi]] and [[Thomas Gold]], and the three had many and deep discussions on cosmology. The radar work paid for a couple of trips to North America, where he took the opportunity to visit astronomers. On one trip to the US he learned about supernovae at [[Caltech]] and Mount Palomar and, in Canada, the nuclear physics of plutonium implosion and explosion, noticed some similarity between the two and started thinking about [[supernova nucleosynthesis]]. He had an intuition at the time \"I will make a name for myself if this works out.\" Eventually (1954) his prescient and ground breaking paper came out. He also formed a group at Cambridge exploring [[Stellar nucleosynthesis]] in ordinary stars and was bothered by the paucity of stellar carbon production in existing models. He noticed that one of the existing processes would be made a billion times more productive if the [[carbon-12]] nucleus had a resonance at 7.7 MeV, but the nuclear physicists did not list such a one. On another trip he visited the nuclear physics group at Caltech, spending a few months of sabbatical there and persuaded them against their considerable scepticism to look for and find the [[Carbon-12#Hoyle state|Hoyle state]] in carbon-12, from which developed a full theory of stellar [[nucleosynthesis]], co-authored by Hoyle with some members of the Caltech group.<ref>Jane Gregory, ''Fred Hoyle's Universe'', World Scientific Pub, 2003</ref>\n\n[[File:Fred Hoyle BGS Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[blue plaque]] at Bingley Grammar School commemorating him]]\nAfter the war, in 1945, Hoyle returned to Cambridge University, starting as a lecturer at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. Hoyle's Cambridge years, 1945\u20131973, saw him rise to the top of world astrophysics theory, on the basis of a startling originality of ideas covering a very wide range of topics. In 1958, Hoyle was appointed to the illustrious [[Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy]] at Cambridge University. In 1967, he became the founding director of the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy (subsequently renamed the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge]], where Hoyle's innovative leadership quickly led to this institution becoming one of the premier groups in the world for theoretical astrophysics. In 1971 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]]. He chose the subject 'Astronomical Instruments and their Construction'. Hoyle was knighted in 1972. Hoyle resigned his Plumian professor position in 1972 and his directorship of the institute in 1973, with this move effectively cutting him off from most of his establishment power-base, connections and steady salary.\n\nAfter his leaving Cambridge, Hoyle wrote many popular science and science fiction books, as well as presenting lectures around the world.  Part of the motivation for this was simply to provide a means of support. Hoyle was still a member of the joint policy committee (since 1967), during the planning stage for the 150-inch [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] at [[Siding Spring Observatory]] in New South Wales. He became chairman of the Anglo-Australian Telescope board in 1973, and presided at its inauguration in 1974 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. After his resignation from Cambridge, Hoyle moved to the [[Lake District]] and occupied his time with a mix of treks across the moors, writing books, visiting research centres around the world, and working on science ideas that have been nearly-universally rejected. On 24 November 1997, while hiking across moorlands in west Yorkshire, near his childhood home in Gilstead, Hoyle fell down into a steep ravine called Shipley Glen. Roughly twelve hours later, Hoyle was found by a search dog. He was hospitalised for two months with pneumonia, kidney problems as a result of hypothermia, and a smashed shoulder, while he ever afterwards suffered from memory and mental agility problems. In 2001, he suffered a series of strokes and died in Bournemouth on 20 August.\n\n==Origin of nucleosynthesis==\nHoyle authored the first two research papers ever published on the synthesis of the chemical elements heavier than helium by nuclear reactions in stars. The first of these<ref>\"The synthesis of the elements from hydrogen\" MNRAS 106, 343 (1946)</ref> in 1946 showed that the cores of stars will evolve to temperatures of billions of degrees, much hotter than temperatures considered for thermonuclear origin of stellar power in main sequence stars. Hoyle showed that at such high temperatures the element iron can become much more abundant than other heavy elements owing to thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles, explaining the high natural abundance of iron. This idea would later be called the e Process.<ref>E. M. Burbidge, G. R. Burbidge, W. A. Fowler, and F. Hoyle (1957). \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\". Reviews of Modern Physics 29 (4): 547. {{Bibcode|1957RvMP...29..547B}}. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.29.547}}.</ref> Hoyle's second foundational nucleosynthesis publication<ref>\"On nuclear reactions occurring in very hot stars: the synthesis of the elements from carbon to nickel\" Astrophys. J. Suppl. 1, 121-146 (1954)</ref> showed that the elements between carbon and iron cannot be synthesized by such equilibrium processes. He attributed those elements to specific [[nuclear fusion reaction]]s between abundant constituents in concentric shells of evolved massive, pre-supernova stars. This startlingly modern picture is the accepted paradigm today for the [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] of these primary elements. In the mid 1950s, Hoyle became the leader of a group of very talented experimental and theoretical physicists who met in Cambridge: [[William Alfred Fowler]], [[Margaret Burbidge]], and [[Geoffrey Burbidge]]. This group systematized basic ideas of how all the chemical elements in our universe were created, with this now being a field called [[nucleosynthesis]]. Famously, in 1957, this group produced the [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] (known for the initials of the four authors) in which the field of nucleosynthesis was organized into complementary nuclear processes. They also added much new material on the synthesis of heavy elements by neutron-capture reactions, the so-called [[s process]] and the [[r process]]. So influential did the B<sup>2</sup>FH paper become that for the remainder of the twentieth century it became the default citation of almost all researchers wishing to cite an accepted origin for nucleosynthesis theory, and as a result the path breaking Hoyle 1954 paper fell into obscurity. Historical research in the 21st century <ref>Donald D. Clayton \"Hoyle's Equation\", Science 318, 1876 (2007)</ref><ref>Donald D. Clayton \"Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity\", New Astronomy Reviews 52, 360-363 (2008)</ref> has brought Hoyle's 1954 paper back to scientific prominence. Those historical arguments were first presented to a gathering of nucleosynthesis experts attending a 2007 conference at Caltech organized after the deaths of both Fowler and Hoyle to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of B<sup>2</sup>FH. Ironically the B<sup>2</sup>FH paper did not review Hoyle's 1954 supernova-shells attribution of the origin of elements between silicon and iron despite Hoyle's co authorship of B<sup>2</sup>FH. Based on his many personal discussions with Hoyle <ref>\"Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity[\" New Astronomy Reviews 52, 360-363 (2008), p. 363, footnote 1</ref> [[Donald D. Clayton]] has attributed this seemingly inexplicable oversight in B<sup>2</sup>FH to the lack of proofreading by Hoyle of the draft composed at Caltech in 1956 by G.R. Burbidge and E.M. Burbidge.<ref>\"Hoyle's Equation\" Science 318, 1876 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe second of Hoyle's nucleosynthesis papers also introduced an interesting use of the [[anthropic principle]], which was not then known by that name. In trying to work out the routes of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], Hoyle calculated that one particular nuclear reaction, the [[triple-alpha process]], which generates [[carbon]] from helium, would require the carbon nucleus to have a very specific resonance energy and spin for it to work. The large amount of carbon in the universe, which makes it possible for [[carbon-based life]]-forms of any kind to exist, demonstrated to Hoyle that this nuclear reaction must work. Based on this notion, Hoyle therefore predicted the values of the energy, the nuclear spin and the parity of the compound state in the carbon nucleus formed by three alpha particles (helium nuclei), which was later borne out by experiment.<ref>Cook, Fowler, Lauritsen and Lauritsen, Phys. Rev. 107, 508 (1957)</ref>\n\nThis energy level, while needed to produce carbon in large quantities, was statistically very unlikely to fall where it does in the scheme of carbon energy levels. Hoyle later wrote:\n\n{{quote|Would you not say to yourself, \"Some super-calculating intellect must have designed the properties of the carbon atom, otherwise the chance of my finding such an atom through the blind forces of nature would be utterly minuscule. A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.\"|Fred Hoyle<ref>Fred Hoyle, \"The Universe: Past and Present Reflections.\" ''Engineering and Science'', November, 1981. pp.&nbsp;8&ndash;12</ref>}}\n\nHis co-worker [[William Alfred Fowler]] eventually won the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1983 (with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]), but for some reason Hoyle's original contribution was overlooked by the electors, and many were surprised that such a notable astronomer missed out.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/03/fred-hoyle-nobel-prize|title=Fred Hoyle: the scientist whose rudeness cost him a Nobel prize|first=Robin|last=McKie|date=2 October 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Fowler himself in an autobiographical sketch affirmed Hoyle's pioneering efforts:\n\n{{quote|The concept of nucleosynthesis in stars was first established by Hoyle in 1946.  This provided a way to explain the existence of elements heavier than [[helium]] in the universe, basically by showing that critical elements such as carbon could be generated in stars and then incorporated in other stars and planets when that star \"[[stellar death|dies]]\". The new stars formed now start off with these heavier elements and even heavier elements are formed from them.

He found the idea that the universe had a beginning to be [[pseudoscience]], resembling arguments for a creator, \"for it's an irrational process, and can't be described in scientific terms\" (see [[Kalam cosmological argument]]).<ref>Quentin Smith, [http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/quentin_smith/bigbang.html A Big Bang Cosmological Argument For God's Nonexistence]. ''Faith and Philosophy''. April 1992 (Volume 9, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;217&ndash;237</ref> Instead, Hoyle, along with [[Thomas Gold]] and [[Hermann Bondi]] (with whom he had worked on [[radar]] in the [[Second World War]]), in 1948 began to argue for the universe as being in a \"steady state\" and formulated their [[Steady State theory]].  The theory tried to explain how the universe could be eternal and essentially unchanging while still having the galaxies we observe moving away from each other. The theory hinged on the creation of matter between galaxies over time, so that even though galaxies get further apart, new ones that develop between them fill the space they leave. The resulting universe is in a \"steady state\" in the same manner that a flowing river is\u2014the individual water molecules are moving away but the overall river remains the same.\n\nThe theory was one alternative to the [[Big Bang]] which, like the Big Bang, agreed with key observations of the day, namely Hubble's [[Hubble's law|red shift observations]], and Hoyle was a strong critic of the Big Bang. He coined the term \"Big Bang\" on [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio's ''Third Programme'' broadcast on 28 March 1949. It was popularly reported by [[George Gamov]] and his opponents that Hoyle intended to be pejorative, and the script from which he read aloud was interpreted by his opponents to be \"vain, one-sided, insulting, not worthy of the BBC\".<ref>Mitton, Simon, ''Fred Hoyle a life in science\", p.&nbsp;129, Cambridge University Press, 2011.</ref> Hoyle explicitly denied that he was being insulting and said it was just a striking image meant to emphasize the difference between the two theories for the radio audience.<ref>Croswell, Ken, ''The Alchemy of the Heavens'', chapter 9, Anchor Books, 1995.</ref> In another BBC interview he said \"The reason why scientists like the \"big bang\" is because they are overshadowed by the Book of Genesis. It is deep within the psyche of most scientists to believe in the first page of Genesis\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/a_mile_or_two_off_yarmouth|title = BBC, Adam Curtis, \"A MILE OR TWO OFF YARMOUTH\"|date = 24 February 2012|accessdate = 4 August 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nHoyle had a famously heated argument with [[Martin Ryle]] of the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group]] about Hoyle's steady state theory, which somewhat restricted collaboration between the Cavendish group and the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Cambridge Institute of Astronomy]] during the 1960s.<ref>Mitton, Simon, ''Fred Hoyle a life in science\", p.&nbsp;chapter 7, Cambridge University Press, 2011.</ref>\n\nHoyle, unlike Gold and Bondi, offered an explanation for the appearance of new matter by postulating the existence of what he dubbed the \"creation field\", or just the \"C-field\", which had negative pressure in order to be consistent with the [[conservation of energy]] and drive the expansion of the universe. These features of the C-field anticipated the later development of [[cosmic inflation]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} They jointly argued that continuous creation was no more inexplicable than the appearance of the entire universe from nothing, although it had to be done on a regular basis. In the end, mounting observational evidence convinced most cosmologists that the steady state model was incorrect and that the Big Bang was the theory that agreed best with observations, although Hoyle continued to support and develop his theory. In 1993, in an attempt to explain some of the evidence against the steady state theory, he presented a modified version called \"[[quasi-steady state cosmology]]\" (QSS), but the theory is not widely accepted.\n\nThe evidence that resulted in the Big Bang's victory over the steady state model included the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation in the 1960s, and the distribution of \"young galaxies\" and [[quasars]] throughout the [[Universe]] in the 1980s indicate a more consistent age estimate of the universe. Hoyle died in 2001 never accepting the Big Bang theory.<ref name=\"Telegraph obit\">{{cite news|title=Professor Sir Fred Hoyle|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1338125/Professor-Sir-Fred-Hoyle.html|work=[[The Telegraph (UK)]]|date=22 August 2001}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"How, in the big-bang cosmology, is the microwave background explained?

It made predictions that were roughly the same as Einstein's [[general relativity]], but it incorporated [[Mach's Principle]], which Einstein had tried but failed to incorporate in his theory. The Hoyle-Narlikar theory failed several tests, including consistency with the microwave background. It was motivated by their belief in the steady state model of the universe.\n\n==Rejection of Earth-based abiogenesis==<!-- This section is linked from [[Abiogenesis]] -->\nIn his later years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of theories of [[abiogenesis]] to explain the [[origin of life]] on Earth. With [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], Hoyle promoted the [[hypothesis]] that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via [[panspermia]], and that [[evolution]] on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of [[virus]]es arriving via [[comet]]s. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of [[organic compound]]s was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds  was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: \"In the highly polarized polemic between [[Darwinism]] and [[creationism]], our position is unique. Although we do not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective\u2014and our suggestion for a way out of the crisis has not yet been considered.\"<ref>[http://www.panspermia.org/thirdalt.htm ''Creationism versus Darwinism'']. Published in Darwinism, Design, and Public Education (2003)</ref>\n\nHoyle and Wickramasinghe advanced several instances where they say outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and certain outbreaks of [[polio]] and [[mad cow disease]]. For the 1918 flu pandemic, they hypothesized that [[comet]]ary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations\u2014a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. In 1982 Hoyle presented ''Evolution from Space'' for the Royal Institution's Omni Lecture. After considering what he thought of as a very remote possibility of Earth-based abiogenesis he concluded:\n\n{{quote|If one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of [[intelligent design]].

Since the number of [[atom]]s in the known universe is infinitesimally tiny by comparison (10<sup>80</sup>), he argued that Earth as life's place of origin could be ruled out.

The first came when the 1974 prize went, in part, to [[Antony Hewish]] for his leading role in the discovery of pulsars. Promptly Hoyle made an off-the-cuff remark to a reporter in Montreal that \"Yes, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell|Jocelyn Bell]] was the actual discoverer, not Hewish, who was her supervisor, so she should have been included.\" This remark received widespread international coverage. Worried about being misunderstood and by British libel laws, Hoyle carefully<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/75letterHC.html|title=Photo Archive in Nuclear Astrophysics|publisher=}}</ref> composed a letter of explanation to ''[[The Times]]''.<ref name=\"GuardianObit\" />\n\nThe second controversy came when the 1983 prize went in part to [[William Alfred Fowler]] \"for his theoretical and experimental studies of the nuclear reactions of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe.\" The controversy arose because Hoyle had been the inventor of the theory of [[nucleosynthesis]] in the stars with two research papers<ref>\"The synthesis of the elements from hydrogen\" MNRAS 106, 343 (1946); \"The synthesis of the elements from carbon to nickel\" Astrophys. J. Suppl. 1, 121-146 (1954)</ref> published shortly after WWII.

During that time, French cuisine was heavily influenced by [[Italian cuisine]]. In the 17th century, chefs [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne]] and [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. [[French cheese|Cheese]] and [[French wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and ''[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.\n\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern [[haute cuisine]]; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]] and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. Gastro-tourism and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people with the rich [[bourgeois]] and peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\n\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [[culinary art|culinary education]]. In November 2010, French [[gastronomy]] was added by the [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|\"intangible cultural heritage\"]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon app\u00e9tit: Your meal is certified by the UN] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ |title=Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== History (Histoire) ==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n    [[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John, Duke of Berry]] enjoying a grand meal. The Duke is sitting with a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] at the high table, under a luxurious [[baldachin|baldaquin]], in front of the fireplace, tended to by several servants, including a [[meat carving|carver]]. On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden [[salt cellar]], or ''nef'', in the shape of a ship; illustration from ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', circa 1410.]]\n\nIn French [[medieval cuisine]], banquets were common among the [[aristocracy]]. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called ''service en confusion'', or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that the [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] pie was developed. Meals often ended with an ''issue de table'', which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of ''[[drag\u00e9e]]s'' (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as [[hypocras]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\">{{Cite book  | last = Wheaton | first = Barbara Ketcham | title = Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789 | publisher=First Touchstone | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-81857-3}}</ref>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were [[brine]]d and dried.  Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during [[Lent]], the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|9\u201312}}\n\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called ''stews'') held [[carp]], [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[tench]], [[bream]], [[Eel (food)|eel]], and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and [[Squab (food)|squab]] being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included [[venison]], [[wild boar]], hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as [[tansy]], [[rue]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], and [[hyssop]], which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time \u2013 they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are [[cubeb]]s, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), [[grains of paradise]], and [[galangal|galengale]]. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and ''[[verjus]]'' combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of [[leek]]s. Yellow came from [[saffron]] or egg yolk, while red came from [[sunflower]], and purple came from ''[[Crozophora tinctoria]]'' or ''[[Heliotropium europaeum]]''. Gold and [[Metal leaf|silver leaf]] were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as ''tourte parmerienne'' which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with [[gold leaf]]. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast [[swan]] or [[peafowl|peacock]] sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being [[gilded]]. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was [[Guillaume Tirel]], also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], then the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who was son of [[John II of France|John II]]. The Dauphin became King [[Charles V of France]] in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, ''marmites'', on it.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|18\u201321}}\n\n===Ancien R\u00e9gime===\n\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as ''[[Les Halles]]'', ''la M\u00e9gisserie'', those found along ''[[Rue Mouffetard]]'', and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the [[guild]] system, which developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\nThere were two groups of guilds \u2013 first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, [[pastry chef|pastry cook]]s, sauce makers, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the ''[[charcuterie|charcutiers]]'' and ''r\u00f4tisseurs'' (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|72\u201373}}  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the [[guild]] hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the [[New World]]. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|81}}  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n[[Haute cuisine]] ({{IPA-fr|ot k\u0265izin|pron}}, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]]. As author of works such as ''Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois'', he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to [[roux]] using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for [[fasting]]. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled ''Le Parfait confitvrier'' (republished as ''Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois'') which similarly updated and codified the emerging haute cuisine standards for desserts and pastries.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|114\u2013120}}\n\nChef [[Fran\u00e7ois Massialot]] wrote ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' in 1691, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a [[marinade]] is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|149\u2013154}}\n\nThe successive updates of ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to [[stock (food)|fish stock]]. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled ''Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. [[Ragout]], a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|155}}\n\n===Late 18th century \u2013  early 19th century===\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|The wife of Louis XV of France, [[Queen consort|Queen]] [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], influenced French cuisine.]]\n[[File:M-A-Careme.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]]]\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like [[bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine]] gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on [[vol-au-vent]] created under the influence of Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], the wife of [[Louis XV]]. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like [[consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine]] and [[filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale]]. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing [[lentille]]s to the French diet.\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation\u2019s people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.<ref>Brace, Richard Munthe. \"The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux.\" The American Historical Review 51, no. 4 (July 1946): 649-67. Accessed April 03, 2018. doi:10.2307/1843902.</ref> According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup.  In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708-1789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.<ref>Brace, Richard Munthe. \"The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux.\" The American Historical Review 51, no. 4 (July 1946): 649-67.

He spent his younger years working at a ''[[Pastry|p\u00e2tisserie]]'' until he was discovered by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], who would later cook for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his ''[[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.<ref name=\"Mennell\">{{Cite book | last = Mennell | first = Stephen | title = All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present, 2nd ed. | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year = 1996 | location = Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06490-6}}</ref>{{rp|144\u2013145}}\n\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named [[mother sauce]]s. Often referred to as [[fond]]s, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, ''[[espagnole]]'', ''[[velout\u00e9]]'', and ''[[b\u00e9chamel]]'', are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais'' (1822), ''Le Cuisinier parisien'' (1828) and ''L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1833\u20135).<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|144\u2013148}}\n\n===Late 19th century \u2013 early 20th century===\n[[File:Auguste Escoffier 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]]]]\n[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of [[haute cuisine]] and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s \u2013 1890s. The [[Savoy Hotel]] managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the [[brigade system]], which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\n\nThese five stations included the \"[[garde manger]]\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"[[saucier]]\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the r\u00f4tisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his ''Livre des menus'' in 1912. This type of service embraced the [[service \u00e0 la russe]] (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n''Le Guide Culinaire'' deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter [[White stock|fumet]]s, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's ''Viander'', which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.\n\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as [[p\u00eache Melba]] and [[cr\u00eapes Suzette]].<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|160\u2013162}}  Escoffier updated ''Le Guide Culinaire'' four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Escoffier | first = Georges Auguste | title = Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | location = New York | pages = Foreword | isbn = 978-0-471-29016-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-20th century \u2013 late 20th century===\n[[File:Paul Bocuse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bocuse]]]]\nThe 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial Wars]] Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.\n\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the [[nouvelle cuisine]]. The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, [[Menon (cookbook author)|Menon]] first used the term, but the cooking of [[Vincent La Chapelle]] and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] revived it to describe the cooking of [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Jean Troisgros|Jean]] and [[Pierre Troisgros]], [[Michel Gu\u00e9rard]], Roger Verg\u00e9 and [[Raymond Oliver]].<ref>''Joyeuse encyclop\u00e9die anecdotique de la gastronomie'', [[Michel Ferracci-Porri]] and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Chistian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France {{ISBN|978-2-915685-55-8}}</ref> These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of [[Escoffier]]'s cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of [[Fernand Point]] at the ''[[La Pyramide|Pyramide]]'' in [[Vienne]], and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as [[espagnole]] and b\u00e9chamel thickened with flour based \"roux\", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of haute cuisine dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nSome have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Nicholas | title = The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture | publisher=The Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | location = Cambridge | pages = 109\u2013110 | isbn = 978-0-521-79465-7}}</ref> By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n==National cuisine==\n{{Main article|List of French dishes}}\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\n\nA meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'\u0153uvre'' or ''entr\u00e9e'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\n\n;Hors d'\u0153uvre\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|''Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]''\nFile:Lobster bisque.jpg|''[[Bisque (food)|Bisque]]'' is a smooth and creamy French ''[[potage]]''.\nFile:Foie gras en cocotte.jpg|''[[Foie gras]]'' with mustard seeds and green onions in duck ''[[Au jus|jus]]''\nFile:Croque monsieur.jpg|''[[Croque monsieur]]''\n</gallery>\n\n;Plat principal\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Pot-au-feu2.jpg|''[[Pot au feu]]'' is a ''[[cuisine classique]]'' dish.\nFile:Flickr - cyclonebill - B\u00f8f med pommes frites (1).jpg|''[[Steak frites]]'' is a simple and popular dish.\nFile:Baguette_mie.jpg|''[[Baguette]]'' often accompanies the meal.\nFile:200501 - 6 fromages.JPG|Some [[List of French cheeses|French cheeses]]\n</gallery>\n\n;P\u00e2tisserie\n\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Lille Meert2.JPG|Typical French ''[[p\u00e2tisserie]]''\nFile:Mille-feuille 20100916.jpg|''[[Mille-feuille]]''\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|''[[Macaron]]\nFile:Eclairs at Fauchon in Paris.jpg|''[[Eclair]]\n</gallery>\n\n;Dessert\n\n<gallery perrow=\"7\">\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|''[[Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]''\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|''[[Chocolate mousse|Mousse au chocolat]]''\nFile:Cr\u00eape Suzette au Citron.jpg|''[[Cr\u00eape]]\nFile:Caf\u00e9 Li\u00e9geois.jpg|''[[Caf\u00e9 li\u00e9geois]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France).svg|thumb|250px|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] include [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right).

Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the [[Bay of Biscay]], trapping in the [[Garonne]] and stream fishing in the [[Pyrenees]]. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the ''\"Agneau de Pauillac\"'', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the ''[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]]'', ''Boeuf de Chalosse'', ''Boeuf Gras de Bazas'', and ''Garonnaise''. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, [[capon]], goose and duck prevail in the region as well.  [[Gascony]] and [[P\u00e9rigord]] cuisines includes ''pat\u00e9s'', ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'', ''[[confit]]s'' and ''magrets''. This is one of the regions notable for its production of [[foie gras]] or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based.

White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of ''millas'', a cornmeal porridge.  [[Haricot bean]]s are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish [[cassoulet]]. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the ''saucisse de Toulouse'', which also finds its way into their version of ''cassoulet'' of [[Toulouse]]. The [[Cahors]] area produces a  specialty \"black wine\" as well as [[truffle]]s and mushrooms.\n\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized [[domestic sheep|ewe]]'s milk is used to produce the [[Roquefort]] in [[Aveyron]], while  in [[Laguiole]] is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The [[Salers]] cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|313}} Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy.

Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and [[S\u00e8te]]. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ''Bourride'', ''Tielles'' and ''Rouille de seiche''. In the [[Languedoc]]  ''jambon cru'', sometimes known as ''jambon de montagne'' is produced. High quality ''[[Roquefort]]'' comes from the ''brebis'' (sheep) on the [[Larzac]] plateau. The [[C\u00e9vennes|Les C\u00e9vennes]] area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, ''p\u00e2t\u00e9s'' and goat cheeses.  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a pur\u00e9e of dried [[Cod (food)|cod]] wrapped in [[Chard|mangold]] leaves.

Other important herbs in the cuisine include [[thyme]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[basil]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[fennel]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[oregano]], and [[bay leaf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|title=Nice Cooking|publisher=La Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise|accessdate=2015-12-29}}</ref> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in ''Poulet Proven\u00e7al'', which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and [[Pastis]] is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter.

Cheeses are also produced, with \"[[brocciu]]\" being the most popular. [[Chestnut]]s, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and [[polenta]]. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and [[boar]]s that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' (dried rib cut), ''lonzu'' (dried pork fillet), ''figatella'', ''salumu'' (a dried sausage) ''salcietta'', ''Panzetta'', bacon, ''figatellu'' (smoked and dried liverwurst) and ''prisuttu'' (farmer's ham).  [[Clementine]]s (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied [[citron]] is used in [[nougat]]s, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including [[Cap Corse]], [[Patrimonio]], ''C\u00e9dratine'', ''Bonapartine'', ''liqueur de myrte'', ''vins de fruit'', ''Rappu'', and ''[[eau-de-vie]] de ch\u00e2taigne''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|435,441,442}}\n\n===French Guiana===\n{{See also|Guianan cuisine|Awara broth}}\n\n[[File:Diz\u00e9 mil\u00e9 avec cr\u00e8me imp\u00e9riale et glace coco.JPG|thumb|[[Diz\u00e9 mil\u00e9]] with a coconut ice cream and an imperial cream]]\n'''French Guianan cuisine''' or '''Guianan cuisine''' is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in [[French Guiana]]. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Many indigenous animal species such as [[caiman]] and [[tapir]] are used in spiced stews.\n\n==Specialties by season==\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\n\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned ''[[hypermarch\u00e9]]'', these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [[Crayfish (food)|Crayfish]], for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.<ref>Imported crayfish are unrestricted, and many arrive from Pakistan.</ref> Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as ''pomme de terre'' (potato), ''bl\u00e9'' ([[wheat]]), ''[[Haricot bean|haricots verts]]'' (a type of French green bean), ''carotte'' (carrot), ''poireau'' ([[leek]]), ''navet'' ([[turnip]]), ''aubergine'' ([[eggplant]]), ''courgette'' ([[zucchini]]), and ''\u00e9chalotte'' ([[shallot]]).\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as ''truffe'' ([[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]), ''champignon de Paris'' ([[button mushroom]]), ''chanterelle ou girolle'' ([[chanterelle]]), ''pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)'' ([[oyster mushroom]]s), and ''c\u00e8pes'' ([[porcini]]).\n\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, [[tangerine]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[plum]]s, [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[redcurrant]]s, [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[blackcurrant]]s.\n\nVarieties of meat consumed include ''poulet'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]), ''pigeon'' ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), ''canard'' ([[Duck (food)|duck]]), ''oie'' ([[goose]], the source of [[foie gras]]), ''b\u0153uf'' ([[beef]]), ''veau'' ([[veal]]), ''porc'' ([[pork]]), ''agneau'' ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]]), ''mouton'' ([[mutton]]), ''caille'' ([[quails in cookery|quail]]), ''cheval'' ([[horse meat|horse]]), ''grenouille'' ([[frog legs|frog]]), and ''[[escargot]]'' (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[canned sardines]], [[sardine (food)|fresh sardines]], canned [[tuna]], fresh tuna, [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and [[calamari]].\n\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: [[omelette]]s, hard-boiled with [[mayonnaise]], [[Scrambled eggs|scrambled]] plain, scrambled ''[[haute cuisine]]'' preparation, \u0153uf \u00e0 la coque.\n\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include ''[[fleur de sel]]'', ''[[herbes de Provence]]'', [[tarragon]], [[rosemary]], [[marjoram]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], [[fennel]], and [[Common sage|sage]].\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Herbesdeprovence.jpg|''[[Herbes de provence]]''\nFile:Charetveau.jpg|''[[Charolais cattle]]''\nFile:Champignons Agaricus.jpg|''[[Champignon de Paris]]''\nFile:HaricotsVerts2.JPG|''[[Haricot bean|Haricots verts]]''\nFile:France-AOC Piment d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg|''[[Espelette pepper|Piments d'Espelette]]''\nFile:Fleur de sel2.jpg|''[[Fleur de sel]] de [[Gu\u00e9rande]]''\nFile:Wine grapes03.jpg|''[[Grape|Grappe de raisin]]''\nFile:Bresseh\u00fchner-1.jpg|''[[Poulet de Bresse]]''\nFile:Wheat close-up.JPG|''Bl\u00e9 ([[Wheat]])''\nFile:Truffe noire du P\u00e9rigord.jpg|''[[Black Truffle|Black P\u00e9rigord truffle]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure of meals==\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coffee|Caf\u00e9]] with a [[croissant]] for breakfast]]\n\n''Le petit d\u00e9jeuner'' (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of ''tartines'' (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes [[brioche]]), along with caf\u00e9 au lait (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-46491-0|page=780}}</ref> and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink [[hot chocolate]] in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. ''[[Croissants]]'', ''[[pain aux raisins]]'' or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' (also named ''chocolatine'' in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\n\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called ''mouillettes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/mouillette/52900|title=D\u00e9finitions : mouillette - Dictionnaire de fran\u00e7ais Larousse|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\n\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with p\u00e2t\u00e9 and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame.\n\nIn ''Germinal'' and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the ''briquet'': two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', Philippe Abrams ([[Kad Merad]]) and Antoine Bailleul ([[Dany Boon]]) share together countless breakfasts consisting of ''tartines de Maroilles'' (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\n\n===Lunch===\n''Le d\u00e9jeuner'' (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.<ref name=\"Steele\"/>  Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close on Monday during lunch hours.<ref name=\"Fodors\">{{Cite book | last = Fodor's | title = See It. France. 2nd ed. | publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nIn large [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants (1999 census)|cities]], a majority of working people and [[List of colleges and universities in France|students]] eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serve complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch food. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and ''[[traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteurs]]''; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three dishes of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s, eating sandwiches followed with a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets for budget prices.\n\n===Dinner===\n''Le d\u00eener'' (dinner) often consists of three [[full course dinner|courses]], ''[[hors d'\u0153uvre]]'' or ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'' (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, [[French wine|wine]] and [[mineral water]]. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Cite book | last = Steele | first = Ross | title = The French Way, 2nd ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year = 2001  | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|82}} Restaurants often open at 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.<ref name=\"Fodors\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==Beverages and drinks==\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s (literally: ''that opens the appetite''), and can be served with [[amuse-bouche]]s (literally: ''mouth amuser''). Those that end it are called [[digestif]]s.\n\n;Ap\u00e9ritifs\n\nThe ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: [[Pastis]] is popular in the south of France, [[Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace]] in the eastern region. [[Champagne]] can also be served. [[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]], also called ''Blanc-cassis'', is a common and popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with [[white wine]]. The phrase ''Kir Royal'' is used when white wine is replaced with a ''Champagne'' wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as [[Beaujolais nouveau]], can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by [[amuse-bouche]]s. Some ap\u00e9ritifs can be [[fortified wine]]s with added herbs, such as [[cinchona]], [[gentian]] and [[vermouth]]. Trade names that sell well include [[Suze (drink)|Suze]] (the classic gentiane), [[Byrrh]], [[Dubonnet]], and [[Noilly Prat]].\n\n;Digestifs\n\nDigestifs are traditionally stronger, and include [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]], [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]], [[Eau de vie]] and fruit alcohols.\n\n==Christmas==\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and ''foie gras''. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|title=10 traditions de No\u00ebl fran\u00e7aises - Cheznoscousins.com|date=30 December 2014|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134140/http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-at.org/Noel-le-Nouvel-An-et-la-Fete-des-Rois ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://referat.clopotel.ro/Les_fetes_de_Noel_en_France-14079.html|title=LES FETES DE NOEL EN FRANCE|website=referat.clopotel.ro|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl chocolat framboise maison.jpg|thumb|Yule log, a French Christmas tradition]]\n\n==Food establishments==\n[[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work]]\n\n===History===\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local [[guild]] member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.<ref name=\"Spang\">{{Cite book | last = Spang | first = Rebecca L. | title = The Invention of the Restaurant, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 2001 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-674-00685-0}}</ref>{{rp|8\u201310}} These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal [[table d'h\u00f4te]], which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered ''restorative'' [[bouillon]]s, or ''restaurants'' \u2013 these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|34\u201335}}\n\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, [[pastry chef]] to the future [[Louis XVIII]], opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time \u2013 the ''Grande Taverne de Londres'' \u2013 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]]. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing monarchy of France, in the period leading up to the French Revolution. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the [[French Directory]]'s ''[[nouveau riche]]'' helped keep these new restaurants in business.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|140\u2013144}}\n\n[[File:Train bleu 05.jpg|thumb|Restaurant ''Le Train Bleu'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|thumb|A [[bouchon]], ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 de Flore.jpg|thumb|''Caf\u00e9 de Flore'', in Paris]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Categories\n!English\n!French\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=2|[[Restaurant]]\n|More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus.

It records information about the basic shape, or holes, of the [[topological space]]. The fundamental group is the first and simplest [[homotopy group]]. The fundamental group is a [[topological property|topological invariant]]: [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] topological spaces have the same fundamental group.\n\nFundamental groups can be studied using the theory of [[covering space]]s, since a fundamental group coincides with the group of [[deck transformation]]s of the associated [[covering space#Universal covers|universal covering space]]. The [[abelianization]] of the fundamental group can be identified with the first [[homology group]] of the space. When the topological space is homeomorphic to a [[simplicial complex]], its fundamental group can be described explicitly in terms of [[Presentation of a group|generators and relations]].\n\n[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] defined the fundamental group in 1895 in his paper \"[[Analysis Situs (paper)|Analysis situs]]\".<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Poincar\u00e9 |first=Henri |authorlink=Henri Poincar\u00e9\n|year=1895\n|title=Analysis situs |journal=Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique |volume=1 |series=(2) |issue= |pages=1\u2013123 |ref=Poincar\u00e9 1895 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4337198/f7.image\n|language=French}} Translated in {{cite book\n|last=Poincar\u00e9 |first=Henri\n|chapter=Analysis situs\n|title=Papers on Topology: Analysis Situs and Its Five Supplements\n|year=2009\n|others=Translated by [[John Stillwell]]\n|pages=18\u201399\n|url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/poincare2009.pdf}}</ref> The concept emerged in the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s, in the work of [[Bernhard Riemann]], Poincar\u00e9, and [[Felix Klein]]. It describes the [[monodromy]] properties of [[complex-valued function]]s, as well as providing a complete topological [[classification of surfaces|classification of closed surfaces]].\n\n== Intuition ==\nStart with a space (e.g. a surface), and some point in it, and all the loops both starting and ending at this point \u2014 paths that start at this point, wander around and eventually return to the starting point. Two loops can be combined together in an obvious way: travel along the first loop, then along the second.\nTwo loops are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without breaking. The set of all such loops with this method of combining and this equivalence between them is the fundamental group for that particular space.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''X'' be a topological space, and let ''x''<sub>0</sub> be a point of&nbsp;''X''. We are interested in the following set of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] functions called '''[[Path (topology)|loops]]''' with '''base point''' ''x''<sub>0</sub>.\n\n:<math>\\{f:[0,1]\\to X : \\ f(0)=x_0=f(1)\\}</math>\n\nNow the '''fundamental group of X with base point x<sub>0</sub>''' is this set [[Equivalence relation#Quotient set|modulo]] [[homotopy]] ''h''\n\n:<math>\\{f:[0,1]\\to X : \\ f(0)=x_0=f(1)\\} / h</math>\n\nequipped with the group multiplication defined by\n\n:<math> (f * g) (t) = \\begin{cases} f(2t) & 0 \\leq t \\leq \\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\ g(2t-1) & \\tfrac{1}{2} \\leq t \\leq 1 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThus the loop ''f''&nbsp;\u2217&nbsp;''g'' first follows the loop ''f'' with \"twice the speed\" and then follows ''g'' with \"twice the speed.\" The product of two homotopy classes of loops [''f''] and [''g''] is then defined as [''f''&nbsp;\u2217&nbsp;''g''], and it can be shown that this product does not depend on the choice of representatives.\n\nWith the above product, the set of all homotopy classes of loops with base point ''x''<sub>0</sub> forms the '''fundamental group''' of ''X'' at the point ''x''<sub>0</sub> and is denoted\n\n:<math>\\pi_1(X,x_0),</math>\n\nor simply \u03c0(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>). The identity element is the constant map at the basepoint, and the inverse of a loop ''f'' is the loop ''g'' defined by ''g''(t) = ''f''(1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t''). That is, ''g'' follows ''f'' backwards.\n\nAlthough the fundamental group in general depends on the choice of base point, it turns out that, [[up to]] [[isomorphism]] (actually, even up to ''inner'' isomorphism), this choice makes no difference as long as the space ''X'' is [[Path connected|path-connected]]. For path-connected spaces, therefore, we can write \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'') instead of \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>) without ambiguity whenever we care about the [[isomorphism class]] only.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n===Trivial fundamental group===\n{{Details|Simply connected space|Contractible space}}\n\nIn [[Euclidean space]] ('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) or any [[convex set|convex subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, there is only one homotopy class of loops, and the fundamental group is therefore the trivial group with one element.  More generally, any contractible space has a trivial fundamental group.  A path-connected space whose fundamental group is trivial is called [[simply connected space|simply connected]].\n\n===Infinite cyclic fundamental group===\nThe [[circle]]. Each homotopy class consists of all loops which wind around the circle a given number of times (which can be positive or negative, depending on the direction of winding). The product of a loop which winds around ''m'' times and another that winds around ''n'' times is a loop which winds around ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'' times. So the fundamental group of the circle is [[isomorphic]] to ('''Z''', +), the additive group of [[integer]]s. This fact can be used to give proofs of the [[Brouwer fixed point theorem]] and the [[Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem]] in dimension 2.\n\nSince the fundamental group is a homotopy invariant, the theory of the [[winding number]] for the complex plane minus one point is the same as for the circle.\n\nIn contrast to the circle, which is the 1-sphere, for every <math>n\\geq 2</math> the [[n-sphere]] is simply-connected, so it has a trivial fundamental group.\n\n===Free groups of higher rank===\nUnlike the [[homology group]]s and higher homotopy groups associated to a topological space, the fundamental group need not be [[abelian group|abelian]]. For example, the fundamental group of the [[Rose (topology)|figure eight]] is the [[free group]] on two letters. More generally, the fundamental group of any [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a [[free group]]. If the graph ''G'' is connected, then the rank of the free group is equal to the number of edges not in a [[spanning tree]].\n\nThe fundamental group of the plane punctured at ''n'' points is also the free group with ''n'' generators. The ''i''-th generator is the class of the loop that goes around the ''i''-th puncture without going around any other punctures.\n\n===Knot theory===\n{{main|Knot group}}\nA somewhat more sophisticated example of a space with a non-abelian fundamental group is the complement of a [[trefoil knot]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, as known, whose fundamental group is the [[braid group]] <math>B_3</math>.\n\n===Lie groups===\nThe fundamental group of a connected [[Lie group]] is always commutative.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Exercise 13.7</ref> \n\nThe fundamental group of a compact Lie group can be computed by either of two different methods. The first method (applicable to the compact classical groups) is inductive and relies on the [[Homotopy group#Long exact sequence of a fibration|long exact sequence of homotopy groups]] for [[fiber bundle]]s. Consider, for example, the case of the special unitary group <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math>, with <math>n\\geq 2</math>. This group acts transitively on the unit sphere <math>S^{2n-1}</math> inside <math>\\mathbb C^n=\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. The stabilizer of a point in the sphere is isomorphic to <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n-1)</math>. It then can be shown<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.8</ref> that SU(n) is a fiber bundle with base <math>S^{2n-1}</math> and fiber <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n-1)</math>. Since <math>n\\geq 2</math>, the sphere <math>S^{2n-1}</math> has dimension at least 3. Thus, the first and second homotopy groups of the base are trivial. The long exact sequence then shows that the fundamental groups of the fiber and the total space are isomorphic: That is:\n:<math>\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(n))\\cong\\pi_1(\\mathrm{SU}(n-1))</math>. \nSince <math>\\mathrm{SU}(1)</math> is the trivial group (a single point, which is simply connected), we then conclude inductively that <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math> is simply connected for all <math>n</math>. A similar argument shows that <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math> has the same fundamental group for all <math>n\\geq 3</math>, namely <math>\\mathbb Z/2</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 13.10</ref>\n\nThe inductive method gives the following results:\n*The special unitary groups <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math> is simply connected for all <math>n</math>;\n*The special orthogonal group <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math> has fundamental group <math>\\mathbb Z/2</math> for <math>n\\geq 3</math> and fundamental group <math>\\mathbb Z</math> for <math>n=2</math>;\n*The compact symplectic group <math>\\mathrm{Sp}(n)</math> is simply connected for all <math>n</math>;\n*The unitary group <math>\\mathrm U(n)</math> has fundamental group <math>\\mathbb Z</math> for all <math>n</math>.\n\nThe second method of computing fundamental groups applies to all connected compact Lie groups and uses the machinery of the [[maximal torus]] and the associated [[root system]]. Specifically, let <math>T</math> be a maximal torus in a connected compact Lie group <math>K</math>, and let <math>\\mathfrak t</math> be the Lie algebra of <math>T</math>. Let <math>\\Gamma\\subset\\mathfrak t</math> denote the kernel of the exponential mapping, and let <math>I</math> denote the set of integer linear combination of coroots. Then the fundamental group of <math>K</math> is isomorphic to the quotient <math>\\Gamma/I</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 13.18</ref> This method shows, for example, that any connected compact Lie group for which the associated root system is of [[G2 (mathematics)|type <math>G_2</math>]] is simply connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 13.45</ref> Thus, there is (up to isomorphism) only one connected compact Lie group having Lie algebra of type <math>G_2</math>; this group is simply connected and has trivial center.\n\nThe fundamental group of noncompact Lie groups can be reduced to the compact case.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 13.3</ref> Thus, for example, the group <math>\\mathrm{SL}(n;\\mathbb C)</math> is simply connected because its maximal compact subgroup <math>\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math> is simply connected.\n\n== Functoriality ==\nIf ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' is a continuous map, ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' and ''y''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''Y'' with ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>, then every loop in ''X'' with base point ''x''<sub>0</sub> can be composed with ''f'' to yield a loop in ''Y'' with base point ''y''<sub>0</sub>. This operation is compatible with the homotopy equivalence relation and with composition of loops. The resulting [[group homomorphism]], called the [[Induced homomorphism (fundamental group)|induced homomorphism]], is written as \u03c0(''f'') or, more commonly,\n\n:<math>f_* : \\pi_1(X, x_0) \\to \\pi_1(Y,y_0).</math>\n\nThis mapping from continuous maps to group homomorphisms is compatible with composition of maps and identity morphisms. In other words, we have a [[functor]] from the [[category of pointed spaces|category of topological spaces with base point]] to the [[category of groups]].\n\nIt turns out that this functor cannot distinguish maps which are [[homotopic]] relative to the base point: if ''f'', ''g'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' are continuous maps with ''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) = ''g''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) = ''y''<sub>0</sub>, and ''f'' and ''g'' are homotopic relative to {''x''<sub>0</sub>}, then ''f''<sub>\u2217</sub> = ''g''<sub>\u2217</sub>. As a consequence, two homotopy equivalent path-connected spaces have isomorphic fundamental groups:\n\n:<math>X \\simeq Y \\Rightarrow \\pi_1(X,x_0) \\cong \\pi_1(Y,y_0).</math>\n\nAs an important special case, if ''X'' is [[path-connected]] then any two basepoints give isomorphic fundamental groups, with isomorphism given by a choice of path between the given basepoints.\n\nThe fundamental group functor takes [[product (category theory)|products]] to [[direct product of groups|products]] and [[coproduct]]s to coproducts. That is, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are path connected, then\n\n:<math>\\pi_1 (X\\times Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) \\times \\pi_1(Y)</math>\n\nand if they are also [[locally contractible]], then\n\n:<math>\\pi_1 (X\\vee Y) \\cong \\pi_1(X) * \\pi_1(Y).</math>\n\n(In the latter formula, <math>\\vee</math> denotes the [[wedge sum]] of topological spaces, and * the [[free product]] of groups.) Both formulas generalize to arbitrary products. Furthermore, the latter formula is a special case of the [[Seifert\u2013van Kampen theorem]] which states that the fundamental group functor takes [[Pushout (category theory)|pushout]]s along inclusions to pushouts.\n\n==Fibrations==\n{{Main|Fibration}}\nA generalization of a product of spaces is given by a [[fibration]],\n\n:<math>F \\to E \\to B. </math>\n\nHere the [[fibration|total space]] ''E'' is a sort of \"[[Twist (mathematics)|twisted]] product\" of the [[fibration|base space]] ''B'' and the [[fibration|fiber]] ''F''. In general the fundamental groups of ''B'', ''E'' and ''F'' are terms in a [[Homotopy group#Long exact sequence of a fibration|long exact sequence]] involving [[homotopy group|higher homotopy groups]]. When all the spaces are connected, this has the following consequences for the fundamental groups:\n\n* \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''B'') and \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''E'') are isomorphic if ''F'' is simply connected\n* \u03c0<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''B'') and \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'') are isomorphic if ''E'' is contractible.\n\n== Relationship to first homology group ==\nThe fundamental groups of a topological space ''X'' are related to its first singular [[homology group]], because a loop is also a singular 1-cycle. Mapping the homotopy class of each loop at a base point ''x''<sub>0</sub> to the homology class of the loop gives a homomorphism from the fundamental group \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>) to the homology group ''H''<sub>1</sub>(''X''). If ''X'' is path-connected, then this homomorphism is [[surjective]] and its [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[commutator subgroup]] of \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>), and ''H''<sub>1</sub>(''X'') is therefore isomorphic to the abelianization of \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>). This is a special case of the [[Hurewicz theorem]] of algebraic topology.\n\n==Universal covering space==\n{{Main|Covering space}}\nIf ''X'' is a topological space that is path connected, locally [[Connected space#Path connectedness|path connected]] and locally simply connected, then it has a simply connected [[covering space|universal covering space]] on which the fundamental group \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',''x''<sub>0</sub>) [[group action|acts]] freely by [[deck transformations]] with [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] ''X''.  This space can be constructed analogously to the fundamental group by taking pairs (''x'',&nbsp;\u03b3), where ''x'' is a point in ''X'' and \u03b3 is a homotopy class of paths from ''x''<sub>0</sub> to ''x'' and the action of \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',&nbsp;''x''<sub>0</sub>) is by concatenation of paths.  It is uniquely determined as a covering space.\n\n===Examples===\n\n====Circle====\nThe universal cover of a circle '''S'''<sup>1</sup> is the line '''R''', we have '''S'''<sup>1</sup> = '''R'''/'''Z'''. Thus \u03c0<sub>1</sub>('''S'''<sup>1</sup>,''x'') = '''Z''' for any base point ''x''.\n\n====Torus====\nBy taking the Cartesian product of two instances of the previous example, we see that the universal cover of a 2-dimensional torus '''T'''<sup>2</sup> = '''S'''<sup>1</sup> \u00d7 '''S'''<sup>1</sup> is the plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> and we have '''T'''<sup>2</sup> = '''R'''<sup>2</sup>/'''Z'''<sup>2</sup>.  Thus \u03c0<sub>1</sub>('''T'''<sup>2</sup>,''x'') = '''Z'''<sup>2</sup> for any base point ''x''.\n\nSimilarly, the fundamental group of the ''n''-dimensional torus '''T'''<sup>n</sup> equals '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\n====Real projective spaces====\nFor ''n'' \u2265 1 the real ''n''-dimensional real projective space '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>('''R''') is obtained by factorizing the ''n''-dimensional sphere '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup> by the central symmetry: '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>('''R''') = '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup>/'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>. Since the ''n''-sphere '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup> is simply connected for ''n'' \u2265 2, we conclude that it is the universal cover of the real projective space.  Thus the fundamental group of '''P'''<sup>''n''</sup>('''R''') is equal to '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> for any ''n'' \u2265 2.\n\n====Lie groups====\nLet ''G'' be a connected, simply connected [[compact Lie group]], for example the [[special unitary group]] SU(''n''), and let \u0393 be a finite subgroup of ''G''. Then the [[homogeneous space]] ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''G''/\u0393 has fundamental group \u0393, which acts by right multiplication on the universal covering space ''G''. Among the many variants of this construction, one of the most important is given by [[locally symmetric space]]s ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u0393\\''G''/''K'', where\n\n*''G'' is a non-compact simply connected, connected [[Lie group]] (often [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]]),\n*''K'' is a maximal compact subgroup of ''G''\n*  \u0393 is a discrete countable [[torsion-free group|torsion-free]] subgroup of ''G''.\n\nIn this case the fundamental group is \u0393 and the universal covering space ''G''/''K'' is actually [[contractible]] (by the [[Cartan decomposition]] for [[Lie group]]s).\n\nAs an example take ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;SL(2, '''R'''), ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;SO(2) and \u0393 any torsion-free [[congruence subgroup]] of the [[modular group]] SL(2, '''Z''').\n\nFrom the explicit realization, it also follows that the universal covering space of a path connected [[topological group]] ''H'' is again a path connected topological group ''G''.  Moreover, the covering map is a continuous open homomorphism of ''G'' onto ''H'' with [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] \u0393, a closed discrete normal subgroup of ''G'':\n\n:<math> 1 \\to \\Gamma \\to G \\to H \\to 1.</math>\n\nSince ''G'' is a connected group with a continuous action by conjugation on a discrete group \u0393, it must act trivially, so that \u0393 has to be a subgroup of the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''.  In particular \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''H'') =  \u0393 is an [[abelian group]]; this can also easily be seen directly without using covering spaces.  The group ''G'' is called the ''[[universal covering group]]'' of&nbsp;''H''.\n\nAs the universal covering group suggests, there is an analogy between the fundamental group of a topological group and the center of a group; this is elaborated at [[Covering group#Lattice of covering groups|Lattice of covering groups]].\n\n==Edge-path group of a simplicial complex==\nIf ''X'' is a [[connected space|connected]] [[simplicial complex]], an ''edge-path'' in ''X'' is defined to be a chain of vertices connected by edges in ''X''.  Two edge-paths are said to be ''edge-equivalent'' if one can be obtained from the other by successively switching between an edge and the two opposite edges of a triangle in ''X''.  If ''v'' is a fixed vertex in ''X'', an ''edge-loop'' at ''v'' is an edge-path starting and ending at ''v''.  The '''edge-path group''' ''E''(''X'',&nbsp;''v'') is defined to be the set of edge-equivalence classes of edge-loops at ''v'', with product and inverse defined by concatenation and reversal of edge-loops.\n\nThe edge-path group is naturally isomorphic to \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(|''X''|,&nbsp;''v''), the fundamental group of the [[Simplicial set|geometric realisation]] |''X''| of ''X''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Isadore|authorlink1=Isadore Singer|last2=Thorpe|first2=John A.|title=Lecture notes on elementary topology and geometry|date=1967|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-90202-3|page=98}}</ref>  Since it depends only on the [[n-skeleton|2-skeleton]] ''X''<sup>2</sup> of ''X'' (i.e., the vertices, edges, and triangles of ''X''), the groups \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(|''X''|,''v'') and \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(|''X''<sup>2</sup>|,&nbsp;''v'') are isomorphic.\n\nThe edge-path group can be described explicitly in terms of [[Presentation of a group|generators and relations]].  If ''T'' is a [[spanning tree|maximal spanning tree]] in the [[n-skeleton|1-skeleton]] of ''X'', then ''E''(''X'',&nbsp;''v'') is canonically isomorphic to the group with generators (the oriented edge-paths of ''X'' not occurring in ''T'') and relations (the edge-equivalences corresponding to triangles in ''X'').  A similar result holds if ''T'' is replaced by any [[simply connected]]&mdash;in particular [[contractible]]&mdash;subcomplex of ''X''.  This often gives a practical way of computing fundamental groups and can be used to show that every [[finitely presented group]] arises as the fundamental group of a finite simplicial complex.  It is also one of the classical methods used for [[topological space|topological]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s, which are classified by their fundamental groups.\n\nThe ''universal covering space'' of a finite connected simplicial complex ''X'' can also be described directly as a simplicial complex using edge-paths.  Its vertices are pairs (''w'',\u03b3) where ''w'' is a vertex of ''X'' and \u03b3 is an edge-equivalence class of paths from ''v'' to ''w''.  The ''k''-simplices containing (''w'',\u03b3) correspond naturally to the ''k''-simplices containing ''w''.  Each new vertex ''u'' of the ''k''-simplex gives an edge ''wu'' and hence, by concatenation, a new path \u03b3<sub>''u''</sub> from ''v'' to ''u''.  The points (''w'',\u03b3) and (''u'', \u03b3<sub>''u''</sub>) are the vertices of the \"transported\" simplex in the universal covering space.  The edge-path group acts naturally by concatenation, preserving the simplicial structure, and the quotient space is just ''X''.\n\nIt is well known that this method can also be used to compute the fundamental group of an arbitrary topological space.  This was doubtless known to [[Eduard \u010cech]] and [[Jean Leray]] and explicitly appeared as a remark in a paper by [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]];<ref>[[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], ''On discrete subgroups of Lie groups'', [[Annals of Mathematics]] '''72''' (1960), 369-384.</ref> various other authors such as Lorenzo Calabi, [[Wu Wenjun|Wu Wen-ts\u00fcn]], and Nodar  Berikashvili have also published proofs.  In the simplest case of a compact space ''X'' with a finite open covering in which all non-empty finite intersections of open sets in the covering are contractible, the fundamental group can be identified with the edge-path group of the simplicial complex corresponding to the [[Nerve of an open covering|nerve of the covering]].\n\n== Realizability ==\n*Every group can be realized as the fundamental group of a [[connected space|connected]] [[CW-complex]] of dimension 2 (or higher).  As noted above, though, only free groups can occur as fundamental groups of 1-dimensional CW-complexes (that is, graphs).\n*Every [[finitely presented group]] can be realized as the fundamental group of a [[Compact space|compact]], connected, [[smooth manifold]] of dimension 4 (or higher).  But there are severe restrictions on which groups occur as fundamental groups of low-dimensional manifolds.  For example, no [[free abelian group]] of rank 4 or higher can be realized as the fundamental group of a manifold of dimension 3 or less. It can be proved that every group can be realized as the fundamental group of a compact Hausdorff space if and only if there is no [[measurable cardinal]].<ref>Adam Przezdziecki, Measurable cardinals and fundamental groups of compact spaces, Fundamenta Mathematicae 192 (2006), 87-92 [https://www.impan.pl/en/publishing-house/journals-and-series/fundamenta-mathematicae/all/192/1/89233/measurable-cardinals-and-fundamental-groups-of-compact-spaces]</ref>\n\n== Related concepts ==\nThe fundamental group measures the 1-dimensional hole structure of a space.  For studying \"higher-dimensional holes\", the [[homotopy group]]s are used. The elements of the ''n''-th homotopy group of ''X'' are homotopy classes of (basepoint-preserving) maps from '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup> to ''X''.\n\nThe set of loops at a particular base point can be studied without regarding homotopic loops as equivalent.  This larger object is the [[loop space]].\n\nFor [[topological groups]], a different group multiplication may be assigned to the set of loops in the space, with pointwise multiplication rather than concatenation.  The resulting group is the [[loop group]].\n\n===Fundamental groupoid===\nIt is convenient to consider a path in a space <math>X</math> as given by a map <math> f : [0,r] \\to X</math> where <math> r \\geqslant 0</math>; then <math> f(0), f(r)</math> are called the initial and final points of the path and <math> r </math> is also called the length of <math>f</math>. If also <math> g:[0,s] \\to X</math> is a path such that <math> f(r)=g(0)</math> then we can define a path <math> f\\circ g: [0,r+s] \\to X</math> to be <math> f</math> on <math>[0,r] </math> and <math>t \\mapsto  g(t-r)</math> on <math> [r,r+s]</math>. This composition makes these [[Moore path|path]]s in <math>X</math> into a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. (In texts, this definition may be found in the books by Crowell and Fox, and by R. Brown, listed below.)\n\nThere are at least two ways of taking homotopy classes of such paths relative to the end points. Crowell and Fox use a continuous change of the ''length'', while in ''Topology and Groupoids'' paths <math>f: [0,r] \\to X, \\ g:[0,s] \\to X</math> with the same endpoints are ''equivalent'' if there exist real numbers <math>u,v \\geqslant 0</math> such that <math>r+u=s+v</math> and <math> f_u, g_v : [0,r+u] \\to X</math> are homotopic relative to their end points, where <math> f_u (t) = \\begin{cases} f(t), & t \\in [0,r] \\\\ f(r), & t \\in [r,r+u] \\end{cases} </math>.\n\nThis construction yields not a group but a [[groupoid]], the ''fundamental groupoid'' of the space.\n\nMore generally, one can consider the fundamental groupoid on a set ''A'' of base points, chosen according to the geometry of the situation; for example, in the case of the circle, which can be represented as the union of two connected open sets whose intersection has two components, one can choose one base point in each component.  The exposition of this theory was given in the 1968, 1988 editions of the book now available as ''Topology and groupoids'', which also includes related accounts of [[covering space]]s and [[orbit space]]s.\n\n{{Quote\n |quote  = [...] people still obstinately persist, when calculating with fundamental groups, in fixing a single base point, instead of cleverly choosing a whole packet of points which is invariant under the symmetries of the situation, which thus get lost on the way.

''Saturnalia'', Vol. I.</ref> February 24\u2014known in the [[Roman calendar]] as \"the sixth day before the [[Kalends]] of [[Martius (month)|March]]\"\u2014was replaced by the first day of this month since it followed [[Terminalia]], the festival of the Roman god of boundaries. After the end of Mercedonius, the rest of the days of February were observed and the new year began with the first day of March. The overlaid religious festivals of February were so complicated that [[Julius Caesar]] opted not to change it at all during his [[Julian calendar|46{{nbsp}}{{sc|BC}} calendar reform]]. The [[leap day|extra day]] of his system's [[leap year]]s were located in the same place as the old intercalary month but he opted to ignore it as a date. Instead, the sixth day before the Kalends of March was simply said to last for 48 hours and all the other days continued to bear their original names. (The Roman practice of inclusive counting initially caused the priests in charge of the calendar to add the extra hours every three years instead of every four and [[Augustus]] was obliged to omit them for a span of decades until the system was back to where it should have been.) When the extra hours finally began to be reckoned as two separate days instead of a doubled sixth (\"bissextile\") one, the [[leap day]] was still taken to be the one following hard on the February 23 Terminalia.<ref name=sundial/> Although February 29 has been popularly understood as the leap day of leap years since the beginning of sequential reckoning of the days of months in the late Middle Ages,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and most other countries, no formal replacement of February 24 as the [[leap day]] of the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar]]s has occurred. The exceptions include [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], who enacted legislation to move the day to February 29.<ref name=sundial>{{citation |publisher=The British Sundial Society |contribution-url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/news/ante-diem-bis-sextum-kalend/ |contribution=Ante Diem Bis Sextum Kalendras Martii |date=24 February 2016 |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/news/ |title=News }}.</ref> This custom still has some effect around the world, for example with respect to [[name days in Hungary]].\n\n==Events==\n* [[303]] &ndash; [[Galerius]] publishes his edict that begins the [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution of Christians]] in his portion of the [[Roman Empire]].\n* [[484]] &ndash; King [[Huneric]] removes the Christian [[bishops]] from their offices and banished some to [[Corsica]].

Moore|Charles \"Chuck\" Moore]]. Language features include [[structured programming]], [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] (the ability to modify the program structure during program execution), [[Concatenative programming language|concatenative programming]] (functions are composed with juxtaposition) and [[Extensible programming|extensibility]] (the programmer can create new commands). Although not an [[acronym]], the language's name is sometimes spelled with all capital letters as FORTH, following the customary usage during its earlier years.\n\nA [[procedural programming]] language without [[Type system|type checking]], Forth features both interactive execution of commands (making it suitable as a [[operating system shell|shell]] for systems that lack a more formal [[operating system]]) and the ability to [[Compiler|compile]] sequences of commands for later execution. For much of Forth's existence, the standard technique was to compile to [[threaded code]], but there are modern implementations that generate [[Compiler optimization|optimized]] [[machine code]] like other language compilers.\n\nForth is used in the [[Open Firmware]] [[boot loader]], in [[outer space|space]] applications<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101024223709/http://forth.gsfc.nasa.gov/ NASA applications of Forth] (original NASA server no longer running, copy from archive.org)</ref> such as the [[Philae (spacecraft)|Philae spacecraft]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Intersil\u2019s RTX processors and Forth software controlled the successful Philae landing|url=http://www.mpeforth.com/press/MPE_PR_From_Telescope_to_Comet_2014_11_13.pdf|website=MicroProcessor Engineering Limited|date=October 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Here comes Philae!

Words can be tested, redefined, and debugged as the source is entered without recompiling or restarting the whole program. All syntactic elements, including variables and basic operators, are defined as words. Forth environments vary in how the resulting program is stored, but ideally running the program has the same effect as manually re-entering the source.\n\n=== Stacks ===\nMost programming environments with recursive [[subroutine]]s use a [[stack (data structure)|stack]] for [[control flow]]. This structure typically also stores [[local variable]]s, including subroutine [[parameter (computer science)|parameter]]s (in [[call by value]] system such as C). Forth often does not have local variables, however, nor is it call-by-value. Instead, intermediate values are kept in another [[stack (data structure)|stack]], different from the one it uses for return addresses, loop counters, etc. Words operate directly on the topmost values in the first of these two stacks. It may therefore be called the \"parameter\" or \"data\" stack, but most often simply \"the\" stack. The second, function-call stack is then called the \"linkage\" or \"return\" stack, abbreviated ''rstack''. Special rstack manipulation functions provided by the kernel allow it to be used for temporary storage within a word, and it is often used by counted loops, but otherwise it cannot be used to pass parameters or manipulate data.\n\nMost words are specified in terms of their effect on the stack. Typically, parameters are placed on the top of the stack before the word executes. After execution, the parameters have been erased and replaced with any return values. For arithmetic operators, this follows the rule of [[reverse Polish notation]]. See below for examples illustrating stack usage.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nForth is a simple yet extensible language; its modularity and extensibility permit the writing of high-level programs such as [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems. Forth has been used successfully in large, complex projects, while applications developed by competent, disciplined professionals have proven to be easily maintained on evolving hardware platforms over decades of use.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = \n| first = \n| authorlink = \n| url = http://www.forth.org/successes.html\n| title = Forth Success Stories\n| work = \n| pages = \n| publisher = \n| accessdate = 2006-06-09}}</ref>\nForth has a niche both in astronomical and space applications.<ref>{{cite web\n |last= \n |first= \n |authorlink= \n |url=http://forth.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \n |title=Space Related Applications of Forth \n |work= \n |pages= \n |publisher= \n |accessdate=2007-09-04 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024223709/http://forth.gsfc.nasa.gov/ \n |archivedate=2010-10-24 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nForth is still used today in many [[embedded system]]s (small computerized devices) because of its [[porting|portability]], efficient memory use, short development time, and fast execution speed.

A Forth system has often been used to bring up new hardware. For example, Forth was the first [[Resident Software| resident software]] on the new [[Intel 8086]] chip in 1978 and MacFORTH was the first [[Resident Software | resident development system]] for the first Apple [[Macintosh]] in 1984.<ref name=\"evolution\"/>\n\nFORTH, Inc.'s microFORTH was developed for the [[Intel 8080]], [[Motorola 6800]], and [[Zilog Z80]] microprocessors starting in 1976. MicroFORTH was later used by hobbyists to generate Forth systems for other architectures, such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] in 1978. Wide dissemination finally led to standardization of the language. Common practice was codified in the de facto standards FORTH-79<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lnmaurer/web/forth/Forth-79.pdf | format=PDF | title=The Forth-79 Standard | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713012838/https://mywebspace.wisc.edu/lnmaurer/web/forth/Forth-79.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-13 | df= }}</ref> and FORTH-83<ref>{{cite web | url=http://forth.sourceforge.net/standard/fst83/ | title=The Forth-83 Standard}}</ref> in the years 1979 and 1983, respectively.

In RPN, the operator is placed after its operands, as opposed to the more common [[infix notation]] where the operator is placed between its operands. Postfix notation makes the language easier to parse and extend; Forth's flexibility makes a static [[Backus-Naur form|BNF]] grammar inappropriate, and it does not have a monolithic compiler. Extending the compiler only requires writing a new word, instead of modifying a grammar and changing the underlying implementation.\n\nUsing RPN, one could get the result of the mathematical expression <code>(25 * 10 + 50)</code> this way:\n<!-- http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#pygments.lexers.forth.ForthLexer -->\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n 25 10 * 50 + CR .\n 300 ok\n</source>\n[[File:Stack1.svg|150px|left]]\nThis command line first puts the numbers 25 and 10 on the implied stack.{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Forthstack1 5.svg|150px|left]]\n<br>The word <code>*</code> multiplies the two numbers on the top of the stack and replaces them with their product.{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Forthstack2.svg|150px|left]]\nThen the number 50 is placed on the stack.{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Forthstack3.svg|150px|left]]\n<br>The word <code>+</code> adds it to the previous product. The CR moves the output to a new line (it is only for formatting purposes and could be omitted but\u2014in most implementations\u2014without it the output would occur on the same line as the input and would be less readable in the example). Finally, the <code>.</code> command prints the result to the user's terminal. As everything has completed successfully at that point, the text interpreter then outputs the prompt \"ok\" and moves to a new line to get more input without needing anything explicit to do that.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brodie | first = Leo | title = Starting Forth | edition = Second | year = 1987 | publisher = Prentice-Hall | isbn = 0-13-843079-9 | pages = 20}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\nEven Forth's structural features are stack-based. For example:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : FLOOR5 ( n -- n' )   DUP 6 < IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ;\n</source>\nThis code defines a new word (again, ''word'' is the term used for a subroutine) called <code>FLOOR5</code> using the following commands: <code>DUP</code> duplicates the number on the stack; <code>6</code> places a 6 on top of the stack; <code>&lt;</code> compares the top two numbers on the stack (6 and the <code>DUP</code>ed input), and replaces them with a true-or-false value; <code>IF</code> takes a true-or-false value and chooses to execute commands immediately after it or to skip to the <code>ELSE</code>; <code>DROP</code> discards the value on the stack; and <code>THEN</code> ends the conditional. The text in parentheses is a comment, advising that this word expects a number on the stack and will return a possibly changed number. The <code>FLOOR5</code> word is equivalent to this function written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] using the [[?:|ternary operator]]:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nint floor5(int v) {\n  return (v < 6) ? 5 : (v - 1);\n}\n</source>\nThis function is written more succinctly as:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : FLOOR5 ( n -- n' ) 1- 5 MAX ;\n</source>\nYou could run this word as follows:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n 1 FLOOR5 CR . \n 5 ok\n 8 FLOOR5 CR .\n 7 ok\n</source>\nFirst the interpreter pushes a number (1 or 8) onto the stack, then it calls FLOOR5, which pops off this number again and pushes the result. The CR moves the output to a new line (again, this is only here for readability). Finally, a call to \".\" pops the result and prints it to the user's terminal.\n\n==Facilities==\nForth has no explicit [[Formal grammar|grammar]]. The interpreter reads a line of input from the user input device, which is then parsed for a word using spaces as a [[delimiter]]; some systems recognise additional [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] characters. When the interpreter finds a word, it looks the word up in the ''dictionary''. If the word is found, the interpreter executes the code associated with the word, and then returns to parse the rest of the input stream. If the word isn't found, the word is assumed to be a number and an attempt is made to convert it into a number and push it on the stack; if successful, the interpreter continues parsing the input stream. Otherwise, if both the lookup and the number conversion fail, the interpreter prints the word followed by an error message indicating the word is not recognised, flushes the input stream, and waits for new user input.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brodie | first = Leo | title = Starting Forth | edition = Second | year = 1987 | publisher = Prentice-Hall  | isbn = 0-13-843079-9 | pages = 14 }}</ref>\n\nThe definition of a new word is started with the word <code>:</code> (colon) and ends with the word <code>;</code> (semi-colon). For example,\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : X DUP 1+ . . ;\n</source>\nwill compile the word <code>X</code>, and makes the name findable in the dictionary.

Mostly the assembler is tucked away in a separate [[namespace]] (''wordlist'') as relatively few users want to use it. Forth assemblers may use a reverse-polish syntax in which the parameters of an instruction precede the instruction, but designs vary widely and are specific to the Forth implementation. A typical reverse-polish assembler prepares the operands on the stack and have the mnemonic copy the whole instruction into memory as the last step. A Forth assembler is by nature a macro assembler, so that it is easy to define an alias for registers according to their role in the Forth system: e.g. \"datastackpointer\" for the register used as a stack pointer.<ref>{{cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Brad | url = http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/6809asm.txt | title = B.Y.O.ASSEMBLER | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623185833/http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/6809asm.txt | archivedate = 2006-06-23 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n=== Operating system, files, and multitasking ===\nMost Forth systems run under a host operating system such as [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] or a version of [[Unix]] and use the host operating system's file system for source and data files; the ANSI Forth Standard describes the words used for I/O. All modern Forth systems use normal text files for source, even if they are embedded. An embedded system with a resident compiler gets its source via a serial line.\n\nClassic Forth systems traditionally use neither [[operating system]] nor [[file system]]. Instead of storing code in files, source code is stored in disk blocks written to physical disk addresses. The word <code>BLOCK</code> is employed to translate the number of a 1K-sized block of disk space into the address of a buffer containing the data, which is managed automatically by the Forth system. Block use has become rare since the mid-1990s. In a hosted system those blocks too are allocated in a normal file in any case.\n\n[[Computer multitasking|Multitasking]], most commonly [[Computer multitasking#Cooperative multitasking/time-sharing|cooperative]] [[round-robin scheduling]], is normally available (although multitasking words and support are not covered by the ANSI Forth Standard). The word <code>PAUSE</code> is used to save the current task's execution context, to locate the next task, and restore its execution context. Each task has its own stacks, private copies of some control variables and a scratch area. Swapping tasks is simple and efficient; as a result, Forth multitaskers are available even on very simple [[microcontroller]]s, such as the [[Intel MCS-51|Intel 8051]], [[Atmel AVR]], and [[TI MSP430]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Brad | url = http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/8051task.pdf | title = MULTITASKING 8051 CAMELFORTH | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060622063041/http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/8051task.pdf | archivedate = 2006-06-22 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard facilities include a mechanism for issuing [[system call|call]]s to the host OS or [[windowing system]]s, and many provide extensions that employ the scheduling provided by the operating system. Typically they have a larger and different set of words from the stand-alone Forth's <code>PAUSE</code> word for task creation, suspension, destruction and modification of priority.\n\n=== Self-compilation and cross compilation ===\nA full-featured Forth system with all source code will compile itself, a technique commonly called meta-compilation or [[self-hosting]], by Forth programmers (although the term doesn't exactly match [[Meta-Compilation|meta-compilation]] as it is normally defined). The usual method is to redefine the handful of words that place compiled bits into memory. The compiler's words use specially named versions of fetch and store that can be redirected to a buffer area in memory. The buffer area simulates or accesses a memory area beginning at a different address than the code buffer. Such compilers define words to access both the target computer's memory, and the host (compiling) computer's memory.<ref>{{cite web | last = Rodriguez | first = Brad | date = July 1995 | url = http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/moving8.htm | title = MOVING FORTH | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623190109/http://www.zetetics.com/bj/papers/moving8.htm | archivedate = 2006-06-23 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nAfter the fetch and store operations are redefined for the code space, the compiler, assembler, etc. are recompiled using the new definitions of fetch and store. This effectively reuses all the code of the compiler and interpreter. Then, the Forth system's code is compiled, but this version is stored in the buffer. The buffer in memory is written to disk, and ways are provided to load it temporarily into memory for testing. When the new version appears to work, it is written over the previous version.\n\nNumerous variations of such compilers exist for different environments. For [[embedded system]]s, the code may instead be written to another computer, a technique known as [[Cross-compilation|cross compilation]], over a serial port or even a single [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] bit, while keeping the word names and other non-executing parts of the dictionary in the original compiling computer. The minimum definitions for such a Forth compiler are the words that fetch and store a byte, and the word that commands a Forth word to be executed. Often the most time-consuming part of writing a remote port is constructing the initial program to implement fetch, store and execute, but many modern microprocessors have integrated debugging features (such as the [[Motorola CPU32]]) that eliminate this task.<ref>{{cite web | last = Shoebridge | first = Peter | date = 1998-12-21 | url = http://www.zeecube.com/archive/bdm/index.htm | title = Motorola Background Debugging Mode Driver for Windows NT | accessdate = 2006-06-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070606083244/http://www.zeecube.com/archive/bdm/index.htm | archivedate = 2007-06-06 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n== Structure of the language ==\nThe basic data structure of Forth is the \"dictionary\" which maps \"words\" to executable code or named data structures.  The dictionary is laid out in memory as a tree of [[linked list]]s with the links proceeding from the latest (most recently) defined word to the oldest, until a [[sentinel value]], usually a NULL pointer, is found. A context switch causes a list search to start at a different leaf.  A linked list search continues as the branch merges into the main trunk leading eventually back to the sentinel, the root.\nThere can be several dictionaries.  In rare cases such as meta-compilation a dictionary might be isolated and stand-alone.\nThe effect resembles that of nesting namespaces and can overload keywords depending on the context.\n\nA defined word generally consists of ''head'' and ''body'' with the head consisting of the ''name field'' (NF) and the ''link field'' (LF) and body consisting of the ''code field'' (CF) and the ''parameter field'' (PF).\n\nHead and body of a dictionary entry are treated separately because they may not be contiguous.  For example, when a Forth program is recompiled for a new platform, the head may remain on the compiling computer, while the body goes to the new platform.  In some environments (such as [[embedded system]]s) the heads occupy memory unnecessarily.  However, some cross-compilers may put heads in the target if the target itself is expected to support an interactive Forth.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Martin\n| first = Harold M.\n|date= March 1991\n| url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=122089.122091\n| title = Developing a tethered Forth model\n| publisher = ACM Press\n| accessdate = 2006-06-19\n}}</ref>\n\n===Dictionary entry===\nThe exact format of a dictionary entry is not prescribed, and implementations vary.  However, certain components are almost always present, though the exact size and order may vary.  Described as a structure, a dictionary entry might look this way:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brodie\n | first = Leo\n | title = Starting Forth\n | url = http://www.forth.com/starting-forth/\n | edition = Second\n | year = 1987\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall\n | isbn = 0-13-843079-9\n | pages = 200\u2013202\n }}</ref>\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n structure\n   byte:       flag           \\ 3bit flags + length of word's name\n   char-array: name           \\ name's runtime length isn't known at compile time\n   address:    previous       \\ link field, backward ptr to previous word\n   address:    codeword       \\ ptr to the code to execute this word\n   any-array:  parameterfield \\ unknown length of data, words, or opcodes\n end-structure forthword\n</source>\nThe name field starts with a prefix giving the length of the word's name (typically up to 32 bytes), and several bits for flags.  The character representation of the word's name then follows the prefix.  Depending on the particular implementation of Forth, there may be one or more NUL ('\\0') bytes for alignment.\n\nThe link field contains a pointer to the previously defined word.  The pointer may be a relative displacement or an absolute address that points to the next oldest sibling.\n\nThe code field pointer will be either the address of the word which will execute the code or data in the parameter field or the beginning of machine code that the processor will execute directly.  For colon defined words, the code field pointer points to the word that will save the current Forth instruction pointer (IP) on the return stack, and load the IP with the new address from which to continue execution of words.  This is the same as what a processor's call/return instructions do.\n\n===Structure of the compiler===\nThe compiler itself is not a monolithic program. It consists of Forth words visible to the system, and usable by a programmer. This allows a programmer to change the compiler's words for special purposes.\n\nThe \"compile time\" flag in the name field is set for words with \"compile time\" behavior. Most simple words execute the same code whether they are typed on a command line, or embedded in code. When compiling these, the compiler simply places code or a threaded pointer to the word.<ref name=\"compiler\"/>\n\nThe classic examples of compile-time words are the [[control structure]]s such as <code>IF</code> and <code>WHILE</code>. Almost all of Forth's control structures and almost all of its compiler are implemented as compile-time words. Apart from some rarely used [[control flow]] words only found in a few implementations, such as a conditional return, all of Forth's [[control flow]] words are executed during compilation to compile various combinations of primitive words along with their branch addresses. For instance, <code>IF</code> and <code>WHILE</code>, and the words that match with those, set up <code>BRANCH</code> (unconditional branch) and <code>?BRANCH</code> (pop a value off the stack, and branch if it is false). Counted loop [[control flow]] words work similarly but set up combinations of primitive words that work with a counter, and so on. During compilation, the data stack is used to support control structure balancing, nesting, and back-patching of branch addresses. The snippet:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n ... DUP 6 < IF DROP 5 ELSE 1 - THEN ...\n</source>\nwould be compiled to the following sequence inside a definition:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n ... DUP LIT 6 < ?BRANCH 5  DROP LIT 5  BRANCH 3  LIT 1 - ...\n</source>\nThe numbers after <code>BRANCH</code> represent relative jump addresses. <code>LIT</code> is the primitive word for pushing a \"literal\" number onto the data stack.\n\n==== Compilation state and interpretation state ====\nThe word <code>:</code> (colon) parses a name as a parameter, creates a dictionary entry (a ''colon definition'') and enters compilation state. The interpreter continues to read space-delimited words from the user input device. If a word is found, the interpreter executes the ''compilation semantics'' associated with the word, instead of the ''interpretation semantics''. The default compilation semantics of a word are to append its interpretation semantics to the current definition.<ref name=\"compiler\"/>\n\nThe word <code>;</code> (semi-colon) finishes the current definition and returns to interpretation state. It is an example of a word whose compilation semantics differ from the default. The interpretation semantics of <code>;</code> (semi-colon), most control flow words, and several other words are undefined in ANS Forth, meaning that they must only be used inside of definitions and not on the interactive command line.<ref name=\"compiler\"/>\n\nThe interpreter state can be changed manually with the words <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code> (left-bracket) and <code><nowiki>]</nowiki></code> (right-bracket) which enter interpretation state or compilation state, respectively. These words can be used with the word <code>LITERAL</code> to calculate a value during a compilation and to insert the calculated value into the current colon definition. <code>LITERAL</code> has the compilation semantics to take an object from the data stack and to append semantics to the current colon definition to place that object on the data stack.\n\nIn ANS <!-- not a misspelling --> Forth, the current state of the interpreter can be read from the [[flag (computing)|flag]] <code>STATE</code> which contains the value true when in compilation state and false otherwise. This allows the implementation of so-called ''state-smart words'' with behavior that changes according to the current state of the interpreter.\n\n==== Immediate words ====\nThe word <code>IMMEDIATE</code> marks the most recent colon definition as an ''immediate word'', effectively replacing its compilation semantics with its interpretation semantics.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brodie\n | first = Leo\n | title = Starting Forth\n | url = \n | edition = Second\n | year = 1987\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall\n | isbn = 0-13-843079-9\n | pages = 273\n }}</ref> Immediate words are normally executed during compilation, not compiled but this can be overridden by the programmer, in either state. <code>;</code> is an example of an immediate word. In ANS Forth, the word <code>POSTPONE</code> takes a name as a parameter and appends the compilation semantics of the named word to the current definition even if the word was marked immediate. Forth-83 defined separate words <code>COMPILE</code> and <code>[COMPILE]</code> to force the compilation of non-immediate and immediate words, respectively.\n\n==== Unnamed words and execution tokens ====\nIn ANS Forth, unnamed words can be defined with the word <code>:NONAME</code> which compiles the following words up to the next <code>;</code> (semi-colon) and leaves an ''execution token'' on the data stack. The execution token provides an opaque handle for the compiled semantics, similar to the [[function pointer]]s of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].\n\nExecution tokens can be stored in variables. The word <code>EXECUTE</code> takes an execution token from the data stack and performs the associated semantics. The word <code>COMPILE,</code>  (compile-comma) takes an execution token from the data stack and appends the associated semantics to the current definition.\n\nThe word <code><nowiki>'</nowiki></code> (tick) takes the name of a word as a parameter and returns the execution token associated with that word on the data stack. In interpretation state, <code>' RANDOM-WORD EXECUTE</code> is equivalent to <code>RANDOM-WORD</code>.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brodie\n | first = Leo\n | title = Starting Forth\n | url = \n | edition = Second\n | year = 1987\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall\n | isbn = 0-13-843079-9\n | pages = 199\n }}</ref>\n\n==== Parsing words and comments ====\nThe words <code>:</code> (colon), <code>POSTPONE</code>, <code><nowiki>'</nowiki></code> (tick) are examples of ''parsing words'' that take their arguments from the user input device instead of the data stack. Another example is the word <code>(</code> (paren) which reads and ignores the following words up to and including the next right parenthesis and is used to place comments in a colon definition. Similarly, the word <code>\\</code> (backslash) is used for comments that continue to the end of the current line. To be parsed correctly, <code>(</code> (paren) and <code>\\</code> (backslash) must be separated by whitespace from the following comment text.\n<!-- TO DO: Explain PARSE and FIND. -->\n\n===Structure of code===\nIn most Forth systems, the body of a code definition consists of either [[machine language]], or some form of [[threaded code]].  The original Forth which follows the informal FIG standard (Forth Interest Group), is a TIL (Threaded Interpretive Language). This is also called indirect-threaded code, but direct-threaded and subroutine threaded Forths have also become popular in modern times.  The fastest modern Forths use subroutine threading, insert simple words as macros, and perform [[peephole optimization]] or other optimizing strategies to make the code smaller and faster.<ref>{{cite web\n |last        = Ertl\n |first       = M.

A defining word has a characteristic \"defining behavior\" (creating a dictionary entry plus possibly allocating and initializing data space) and also specifies the behavior of an instance of the class of words constructed by this defining word.  Examples include:\n\n;<code>VARIABLE</code>\n:Names an uninitialized, one-cell memory location.  Instance behavior of a <code>VARIABLE</code> returns its address on the stack.\n;<code>CONSTANT</code>\n:Names a value (specified as an argument to <code>CONSTANT</code>).  Instance behavior returns the value.\n;<code>CREATE</code>\n:Names a location; space may be allocated at this location, or it can be set to contain a string or other initialized value.  Instance behavior returns the address of the beginning of this space.\n\nForth also provides a facility by which a programmer can define new application-specific defining words, specifying both a custom defining behavior and instance behavior.  Some examples include circular buffers, named bits on an I/O port, and automatically indexed arrays.\n\nData objects defined by these and similar words are global in scope.  The function provided by local variables in other languages is provided by the data stack in Forth (although Forth also has real local variables).  Forth programming style uses very few named data objects compared with other languages; typically such data objects are used to contain data which is used by a number of words or tasks (in a multitasked implementation).<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brodie\n | first = Leo\n | title = Starting Forth\n | url = \n | edition = 2nd\n | year = 1987\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall\n | isbn = 0-13-843079-9\n | pages = 241\n | chapter = Under The Hood\n | quote = To summarize, there are three kinds of variables:  System variables contain values used by the entire Forth system.  User variables contain values that are unique for each task, even though the definitions can be used by all tasks in the system.  Regular variables can be accessible either system-wide or within a single task only, depending upon whether they are defined within <code>OPERATOR</code> or within a private task.\n}}</ref>\n\nForth does not enforce consistency of data type usage; it is the programmer's responsibility to use appropriate operators to fetch and store values or perform other operations on data.\n\n==Programming==\nWords written in Forth are compiled into an executable form.  The classical \"indirect threaded\" implementations compile lists of addresses of words to be executed in turn; many modern systems generate actual machine code (including calls to some external words and code for others expanded in place).  Some systems have optimizing compilers. Generally speaking, a Forth program is saved as the memory image of the compiled program with a single command (e.g., RUN) that is executed when the compiled version is loaded.\n\nDuring development, the programmer uses the interpreter in [[REPL]] mode to execute and test each little piece as it is developed.  Most Forth programmers therefore advocate a loose top-down design, and bottom-up development with continuous testing and integration.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brodie\n | first = Leo\n | authorlink = \n | editor = \n | others = \n | title = Thinking Forth\n | url = \n | edition = \n | year = 1984\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-13-917568-7\n | doi =\n | pages = \n | chapter = \n | chapterurl = \n }}</ref>\n\nThe top-down design is usually separation of the program into \"vocabularies\" that are then used as high-level sets of tools to write the final program.  A well-designed Forth program reads like natural language, and implements not just a single solution, but also sets of tools to attack related problems.<ref>The classic [http://www.forth.com/embedded/swiftx-embedded-systems-7.html washing machine example] describes the process of creating a vocabulary to naturally represent the problem domain in a readable way.</ref>\n\n==Code examples==\n\n===Hello world===\n{{For|an explanation of the tradition of programming \"Hello, World!\"|\"Hello, World!\" program}}\n\nOne possible implementation:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : HELLO  ( -- )  CR .\" Hello, world!\" ; \n</source> \n HELLO &lt;cr&gt;\n Hello, world!\n\nThe word <code>CR</code> (Carriage Return) causes the following output to be displayed on a new line. The parsing word <code>.\"</code> (dot-quote) reads a double-quote delimited string and appends code to the current definition so that the parsed string will be displayed on execution. The space character separating the word <code>.\"</code> from the string <code>Hello, world!</code> is not included as part of the string. It is needed so that the parser recognizes <code>.\"</code> as a Forth word.\n\nA standard Forth system is also an interpreter, and the same output can be obtained by typing the following code fragment into the Forth console:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n CR .( Hello, world!)\n</source>\n<code>.(</code> (dot-paren) is an immediate word that parses a parenthesis-delimited string and displays it. As with the word <code>.\"</code> the space character separating <code>.(</code> from <code>Hello, world!</code> is not part of the string.\n\nThe word <code>CR</code> comes before the text to print. By convention, the Forth interpreter does not start output on a new line. Also by convention, the interpreter waits for input at the end of the previous line, after an <code>ok</code> prompt. There is no implied \"flush-buffer\" action in Forth's <code>CR</code>, as sometimes is in other programming languages.\n\n=== Mixing states of compiling and interpreting ===\nHere is the definition of a word <code>EMIT-Q</code> which when executed emits the single character <code>Q</code>:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : EMIT-Q   81 ( the ASCII value for the character 'Q' ) EMIT ;\n</source>\nThis definition was written to use the [[ASCII]] value of the <code>Q</code> character (81) directly. The text between the parentheses is a comment and is ignored by the compiler. The word <code>EMIT</code> takes a value from the data stack and displays the corresponding character.\n\nThe following redefinition of <code>EMIT-Q</code> uses the words <code><nowiki>[</nowiki></code> (left-bracket), <code><nowiki>]</nowiki></code> (right-bracket), <code>CHAR</code> and <code>LITERAL</code> to temporarily switch to interpreter state, calculate the ASCII value of the <code>Q</code> character, return to compilation state and append the calculated value to the current colon definition:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : EMIT-Q   [ CHAR Q ]  LITERAL  EMIT ;\n</source>\nThe parsing word <code>CHAR</code> takes a space-delimited word as parameter and places the value of its first character on the data stack. The word <code><nowiki>[CHAR]</nowiki></code> is an immediate version of <code>CHAR</code>. Using <code><nowiki>[CHAR]</nowiki></code>, the example definition for <code>EMIT-Q</code> could be rewritten like this:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : EMIT-Q   [CHAR] Q  EMIT ; \\ Emit the single character 'Q'\n</source>\nThis definition used <code>\\</code> (backslash) for the describing comment.\n\nBoth <code>CHAR</code> and <code><nowiki>[CHAR]</nowiki></code> are predefined in ANS Forth. Using <code>IMMEDIATE</code> and <code>POSTPONE</code>, <code><nowiki>[CHAR]</nowiki></code> could have been defined like this:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n : [CHAR]   CHAR  POSTPONE LITERAL ; IMMEDIATE\n</source>\n=== A complete RC4 cipher program ===\n\nIn 1987, [[Ron Rivest]] developed the [[RC4]] cipher-system for RSA Data Security, Inc. The code is extremely simple and can be written by most programmers from the description:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe have an array of 256 bytes, all different. Every time the array is used it changes by swapping two bytes. The swaps are controlled by counters ''i'' and ''j'', each initially 0. To get a new ''i'', add 1. To get a new ''j'', add the array byte at the new ''i''. Exchange the array bytes at ''i'' and ''j''. The code is the array byte at the sum of the array bytes at ''i'' and ''j''. This is XORed with a byte of the plaintext to encrypt, or the ciphertext to decrypt. The array is initialized by first setting it to 0 through 255. Then step through it using ''i'' and ''j'', getting the new ''j'' by adding to it the array byte at ''i'' and a key byte, and swapping the array bytes at ''i'' and ''j''.  Finally, ''i'' and ''j'' are set to 0. All additions are modulo 256.</blockquote>\n\nThe following Standard Forth version uses Core and Core Extension words only.\n\n<source lang=\"forth\">\n0 value ii        0 value jj\n0 value KeyAddr   0 value KeyLen\ncreate SArray   256 allot   \\ state array of 256 bytes\n: KeyArray      KeyLen mod   KeyAddr ;\n\n: get_byte      + c@ ;\n: set_byte      + c! ;\n: as_byte       255 and ;\n: reset_ij      0 TO ii   0 TO jj ;\n: i_update      1 +   as_byte TO ii ;\n: j_update      ii SArray get_byte +   as_byte TO jj ;\n: swap_s_ij\n    jj SArray get_byte\n       ii SArray get_byte  jj SArray set_byte\n    ii SArray set_byte\n;\n\n: rc4_init ( KeyAddr KeyLen -- )\n    256 min TO KeyLen   TO KeyAddr\n    256 0 DO   i i SArray set_byte   LOOP\n    reset_ij\n    BEGIN\n        ii KeyArray get_byte   jj +  j_update\n        swap_s_ij\n        ii 255 < WHILE\n        ii i_update\n    REPEAT\n    reset_ij\n;\n: rc4_byte\n    ii i_update   jj j_update\n    swap_s_ij\n    ii SArray get_byte   jj SArray get_byte +   as_byte SArray get_byte  xor\n;\n</source>\n\nThis is one of many ways to test the code:\n<source lang=\"forth\">\nhex\ncreate AKey   61 c, 8A c, 63 c, D2 c, FB c,\n: test   cr   0 DO  rc4_byte .

In addition to supporting the standard varieties of desktop computer systems ([[POSIX]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]]), many of these Forth systems also target a variety of [[embedded systems]].

His father and uncle were art collectors. Unlike his older brother Bonomo he did not step into the company, but decided to become an author. Francesco studied [[natural sciences]] and mathematics in [[Bologna]] under [[Francesco Maria Zanotti]] and in 1728 he experimented with [[optics]]. (Zanotti became a lifelong friend.) First he travelled in the North of Italy, but moved to Florence, and Rome. At the age of twenty, he went to [[Cirey]] and Paris, where he became friendly with Voltaire and [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]].<ref>In 1740 Voltaire called him the Venetian [[Socrates]], may be his \"cher cygne de Padoue\" (\"dear swan of Padua\").</ref> Two years later he was in London, where he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. He became embroiled in a lively bisexual love-triangle with the politician [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey|John Hervey]], and [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]].<ref>Rictor Norton, \"John, Lord Hervey: The Third Sex\", The Great Queens of History. Updated 8 August 2009 [http://rictornorton.co.uk/hervey.htm]</ref> Algarotti left for Italy and finished his ''Neutonianismo per le dame'' (\"Newtonism for Ladies\") (1737 \u2013 dedicated to [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]]) \u2013 a work consisting of information on astronomy, physics, mathematics, women and science and education.\n\nIn the meantime Algarotti had made acquaintance with [[Antiochus Kantemir]], a Moldavian diplomat, poet and composer.<ref>[https://books.google.nl/books?id=6sFHnfb89A8C&lpg=PA335&ots=2qIYE2tWJg&dq=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&pg=PA335#v=onepage&q=Algarotti%20Sint%20Petersburg%201739%20wedding&f=false  'By the Banks of the Neva': Chapters from the Lives and Careers of the ...

(1999) Frederick the Great, p. 142-145.</ref> In 1741 Algarotti went to [[Turin]] as his diplomat. Frederick had offered him a salary, but Algarotti refused. First, he went to [[Dresden]] and Venice, where he bought 21 paintings, a few by [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Liotard]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] for the court of [[Augustus III of Poland]].<ref>[http://legionofhonor.famsf.org/blog/framework-empire-flora-giovanni-battista-tiepolo The Empire of Flora by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo] at Legion of Honor</ref><ref>[http://www.hermitage.nl/en/tentoonstellingen/venetie/schoonste_schijn.htm Eighteenth-century Venetian Art] at Hermitage Amsterdam</ref> Algarotti did not succeed to have the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] attack Austria in the back.<ref>MacDonogh, G.

For contemporary commissions, he wrote up a list for paintings he recommended commissioning, including to ask of history paintings from [[Giambattista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]], [[Giambattista Pittoni|Pittoni]], and [[Piazzetta]]; scenes with animals from [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]], and [[veduta]] with ruins from [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini|Pannini]].

(1999) Frederick the Great, p. 192.</ref> In 1749 he moved to Berlin. Algarotti was <!--involved in the production of operas and--> involved in finishing the architectural designs of [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] who had fallen ill. In February 1753, after several years residing in Prussia, he returned to Italy, living most of the time in Bologna. In 1759 Algarotti was involved in a new opera-style in the city of [[Parma]]. He influencing [[Guillaume du Tillot]] and the [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]].\n\n[[File:Adolph-von-Menzel-Tafelrunde2.jpg|200px|rechts|thumb|Gathering on [[Sanssouci]] in the Marble Hall, with Fredrik II.

The painting was lost in 1945]]\n\nAlgarotti's ''Essay on the Opera'' (1755) was a major influence on the librettist [[Carlo Innocenzo Frugoni]] and the composer [[Tommaso Traetta]], and in the development of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] reformist ideology.<ref>Orrey, p. 81</ref> Algarotti proposed a heavily simplified model of ''opera seria'', with the drama pre-eminent, instead of the music, ballet or staging. The drama itself should \"delight the eyes and ears, to rouse up and to affect the hearts of an audience, without the risk of sinning against reason or common sense\". Algarotti's ideas influenced both Gluck and his librettist [[Calzabigi]], writing their [[Orfeo ed Euridice]].<ref name=\"Orrey83\">Orrey, p. 83</ref>\n\nIn 1762 Algarotti moved to [[Pisa]], where he died of tuberculosis. Frederick the Great, who several times needed Algarotti writing texts in Latin, sent in a text for a monument to his memory on the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]].\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Algarotti, Francesco - Saggi, 1963 - BEIC 1729548.djvu|thumb|''Saggi'', 1963 (Italian, full text)]]\n\n*[http://www.algarotti.uni-trier.de/ Bibliography and Inventory of all known letters] at Algarotti Briefdatenbank der Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Trier {{fr icon}}\n*[http://friedrich.uni-trier.de/oeuvres/18/ Correspondence with Frederick the Great] at Digitale Ausgabe der Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek Trier {{fr icon}}\n*[http://137.204.24.205/cis13b/bsco3/Default.asp Il newtonianismo per le dame], 1737.

Father \u00c1lvares remained six years in Ethiopia, returning to [[Lisbon]] in either 1526 or 1527.\n\nIn 1533 he was allowed to accompany Dom [[Martinho de Portugal]] to [[Rome]] on an embassy to [[Pope Clement VII]], to whom Father \u00c1lvares delivered the letter Lebna Dengel had written to the Pope. The precise date of Francisco \u00c1lvares death, like that of his birth, is unknown, but the writer of the [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] article concludes it was later than 1540, in which year an account of his travels were published at Lisbon. In the introduction of their translation of \u00c1lvares work, [[C.F. Beckingham]] and [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] furnish evidence that points to \u00c1lvares death in [[Rome]], and admit that he may have died before his work was published.\n\n==\u00c1lvares' writings==\nIn 1540, [[Lu\u00eds Rodrigues]] published a version of \u00c1lvares account in a one volume folio, entitled ''Verdadeira Informa\u00e7\u00e3o das Terras do Preste Jo\u00e3o das Indias'' (\"A True Relation of the Lands of [[Prester John]] of the Indies\"). C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford cite evidence, based in part on the earlier work of Professor [[Roberto Almagia]], showing that Rodrigues's publication is only a part of \u00c1lvares's entire account. Another version of what \u00c1lvares wrote was included in an anthology of travel narratives, ''Navigationi et Viaggi'' assembled and published by [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]], and published in 1550.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ReA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=RA2-PT169&dq=alvarez+inauthor:%22Giovanni+Baptista+Ramusio%22&hl=it&sa=X&ei=-HG7T4MLhNi0Bruk0Y0I&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false] \"Navigationi et viaggi\"</ref> Almagia also identified three manuscripts in the [[Vatican Library]] which contain versions of excerpts from the original manuscript.\n\nFrancisco \u00c1lvares' work has been translated into English at least twice. The first time was the work of the [[Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley]] for the [[Hakluyt Society]] in 1881. This translation was revised and augmented with notes by C. F. Beckingham and G. W. B. Huntingford, ''The Prester John of the Indies'' (Cambridge: Hakluyt Society, 1961).\n\nThe author of the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article was critical of the information it contained, believing it should \"be received with caution, as the author is prone to exaggerate, and does not confine himself to what came within his own observation.\" Beckingham and Huntingford, however, have a higher opinion of \u00c1lvares testimony, stating that not only is it \"incomparably more detailed than any earlier account of Ethiopia that has survived; it is also a very important source for Ethiopian history, for it was written just before the country was devastated by the [[Ahmed Gragn|Muslim Somali]] and pagan [[Oromo people|Galla]] invasions of the second quarter of the sixteenth century.\" He provides the first recorded and detailed descriptions of [[Axum]] and [[Lalibela]]. They continue...\n\n:\"He is sometimes wrong, but very rarely silly or incredible. He made a few mistakes; he may well have made others that we cannot detect because he is our sole authority; when he tried to describe buildings his command of language was usually inadequate; he is often confused and obscure, though this may be as much his printer's fault as his own; his prose is frequently difficult to read and painful to translate; but he seems to us to be free from the dishonesty of the traveller who tries to exaggerate his own knowledge, importance, or courage\".<ref>C.

They also referred to the year 1666 and its relationship to the biblical [[Number of the Beast]] indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings. They were one of a number of [[nonconformists|nonconformist]] [[English Dissenters|dissenting groups]] that emerged around this time.\n\n==Historical context==\n{{unreferenced section|date = January 2013}}\nThe Fifth Monarchists were one of many groups of Christian believers during and after the [[English Civil War]] whose theological beliefs challenged the more mainstream ideas of the day. Specifically, they believed in a geopolitical theory which maintained that [[Four monarchies|four world rulers]] had already come and gone according to the prophecies of [[Daniel 2]] in the [[Old Testament]]. This text recounts a prophetic dream by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]. The previous empires of which he dreamed were interpreted to have been [[Babylonian Empire|Babylonian]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Grecian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]]; the last empire, the Monarchists concluded, would be established by the returning Jesus as King of Kings and Lord of Lords to reign with his saints on earth for a thousand years. The Fifth Monarchists saw themselves as those saints of that soon to be dawning [[Millennialism|millennium]]. Among prominent Fifth Monarchists were [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], [[Christopher Feake]], [[Vavasor Powell]], [[John Carew (regicide)|John Carew]], [[John Rogers (Fifth Monarchist)|John Rogers]] and [[Robert Blackborne]], Secretary of the [[Admiralty]] and later of the British [[East India Company]].\n\nFifth Monarchists believed that the timing of the events of the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] were significant because the calendar year 1666 loomed large on the near horizon. The number [[Number of the Beast (numerology)|666]] had been identified in the [[Book of Revelation]] with the ultimate human [[Despotism|despot]] to rule the world, who would be replaced by the [[Second Coming]] of the [[Messiah]]; this only added to the belief that the Fifth Monarchy was about to begin.\n\n==English Commonwealth and Protectorate==\nA number of Fifth Monarchists took a leading part in the events of the time. Thomas Harrison and John Carew were [[List of regicides of Charles I#Commissioners|Commissioners]] (judges) at the trial of Charles I and signed the death warrant. Following Charles' death, Oliver Cromwell set up the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] as a more pure form of government to replace the existing monarchy. Cromwell had not intended it but, not long after establishing the Commonwealth, he dismissed the Parliament and became, in effect, a [[military dictator]]. The Fifth Monarchists were also a significant opponent of the [[Rump Parliament]]; leading Fifth Monarchists such as Vavasor Powell were unhappy with the Rump's failure to renew certain pieces of legislation, such as the Act for the Propagation of the Gospel in Wales, because they believed that the Rump was not fulfilling what the Fifth Monarchists perceived to be its aim, that is to turn England into a more 'godly' nation. Leading Fifth Monarchists also had an influence on Oliver Cromwell, as it was Thomas Harrison's idea to introduce the [[Nominated Assembly]] ([[Barebone's Parliament]]) as a body of religious men. However this was not completely the case as a large proportion of the assembly were conservative-minded gentry such as Sir [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]]. This influence on Cromwell did not last, however, as just six months after he had created the Nominated Assembly, Cromwell dissolved it in favour of [[John Lambert (General)|Major-General John Lambert]]'s more conservative [[Instrument of Government]].\n\nThe Republican governments of England were introduced after the English Civil War during the Interregnum (1649\u201360). The Commonwealth (1649\u201353) was founded on the execution of Charles I in 1649, and was followed by the two Protectorates of Oliver Cromwell (1653\u201358), and his son Richard Cromwell the first (1658\u201359). The Commonwealth was briefly revived (1659\u201360), before the [[English Restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] in the person of Charles II in May 1660.\n\n==Nominated Assembly and Protectorate==\nAfter the forcible dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]] by Oliver Cromwell, the Grandees of the Army [[Council of Officers]] were reluctant to authorise free elections because they were aware that the traditional constituency would return Presbyterians and Royalists as well as their own sympathisers. They were not at all sure that the majority would be any more compliant than the Rump. Major-General Thomas Harrison, who had commanded the troop that aided Oliver Cromwell in dissolving the Rump,  suggested that there be a ruling body based upon the Old Testament ''Sanhedrin'' of 70 selected \"Saints\", which was based on his beliefs, as a Fifth Monarchist, that the rule of the Saints would usher in the reign of Christ on Earth. A modified version of this proposal was accepted by Cromwell and the Council of Officers, and less than a month after the dissolution of the Rump, during May 1653, letters in the name of the Lord-General and the Army Council were sent to Congregational churches in every county in England to nominate those they considered fit to take part in the new government. The total number of nominees was one hundred and forty, one hundred and twenty-nine from England, five from Scotland and six from Ireland.\n\nThe arrest of Feake and Powell was sufficient for a time to dampen their ardour, but many of the delegates to [[Barebone's Parliament]] were from congregations with Fifth Monarchist sympathies. This assembly, which met from July until December 1653, was the high-water mark of Fifth Monarchist influence on national politics. Fearing their ultra-radical ideas, which crystallised in an attack on [[tithe]]s, the conservative faction led by Major-General John Lambert, supported by the use of troops to deny access to the radical factions, engineered a vote for the dissolution of the assembly, which was passed on 12 December 1653. The collapse of the radical consensus that had spawned the Nominated Assembly led to the Grandees passing the Instrument of Government in the [[English Council of State|Council of State]], which paved the way for Cromwell's [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]]. The Fifth Monarchists were horrified at the establishment of Cromwell's Protectorate and plotted to overthrow the regime.  Two plots were uncovered and broken up in 1657 and 1659.\n\n==Restoration==\n[[File:Who Shall Rouse Him Up.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Ian Bone]] speaking at the installation of the [[Thomas Rainsborough]] memorial plaque (12 May 2013), championing Thomas Venner and the Fifth Monarchy Men. The banner is a replica of that used by the insurgents at the time.]]\nAfter the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] on 14 October 1660 Major-General [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]] was the first person to be found guilty of the [[regicide]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He had been [[List of regicides of Charles I#Commissioners|the seventeenth of fifty-nine commissioners]] (judges) to sign the death warrant of the king in 1649. He was the first regicide to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] because he was considered by the new government to represent a continued real threat to the re-established order. This threat was realised when, on 6 January 1661, fifty Fifth Monarchists, headed by a wine-cooper named [[Thomas Venner]], from their alleged hideout in [[Liberty of Norton Folgate|Norton Folgate]]<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50148#n6|F. H. W. Sheppard, English Heritage, 'The Manor and Liberty of Norton Folgate', Survey of London: volume 27: Spitalfields and Mile End New Town (1957), pp. 15-20, citing Cal. S.P. Dom., 1661\u20132, p. 71.]</ref> made an effort to attain possession of London in the name of \"King Jesus.\"  Most of the fifty were either killed or taken prisoner, and on 19 and 21 January Venner and ten others were hanged, drawn and quartered for [[high treason]].\n\nThe failure of Venner's Rising led to repressive legislation to suppress non-conformist sects.  Although some physical events such as the [[Great Plague of London]] and the [[Great Fire of London]] continued to encourage belief in \"the end of the world\" ruled by carnal human beings, the doctrine of the sect either died out or became merged in a milder form of [[Millenarianism]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Fifth Monarchy Men}}\n{{Commons category|Fifth Monarchy Men}}\n*[[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[17th century denominations in England]]\n*[[Fifth Empire]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Burrage, Champlin.

He was an author, a composer, and one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in July 1776, as a delegate from [[New Jersey]]. He served in various roles in the early United States government including as a member of the [[Second Continental Congress]] and chairman of the Navy Board.  He also later served as a federal district judge in [[Pennsylvania]] after the ratification of the Federal [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].\n\n==Early and Family Life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Francis Hopkinson.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of Francis Hopkinson]]\nFrancis Hopkinson was born at [[Philadelphia]] in 1737, the son of [[Thomas Hopkinson]] and Mary Johnson. He became a member of the first class at the [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) in 1751 and graduated in 1757, receiving his master's degree in 1760, and a doctor in law (honorary) in 1790. He was secretary to a [[Provincial Council of Pennsylvania]] Indian commission in 1761 that made a treaty with the [[Lenape|Delaware]] and several [[Iroquois]] tribes. In 1763, he was appointed customs collector for [[Salem, New Jersey]].\nHopkinson spent from May 1766 to August 1767 in [[England]] in hopes of becoming commissioner of customs for North America. Although unsuccessful, he spent time with the future Prime Minister [[Lord North]], Hopkinson's cousin [[James Johnson (Bishop of Worcester)]], and the painter [[Benjamin West]].<ref name=Hastings>{{cite book|last1=Hastings|first1=George|title=The Life and Works of Francis Hopkinson|date=1926|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>{{rp|133}}\n\nAfter his return, Hopkinson operated a dry goods business in Philadelphia and married Ann Borden on September 1, 1768. They would have five children.\n\n==Legal career==\nHopkinson obtained a public appointment as a customs collector for [[New Castle, Delaware]] on May 1, 1772. He moved to [[Bordentown, New Jersey]] in 1774, became a member of the [[New Jersey Provincial Council]], and was admitted to the New Jersey bar on May 8, 1775. He resigned his crown-appointed positions in 1776 and, on June 22, went on to represent New Jersey in the Second Continental Congress where he signed the Declaration of Independence. He was appointed to Congress' Marine Committee in that year. He departed the Congress on November 30, 1776 to serve on the Navy Board at Philadelphia. The Board reported to the Marine Committee. Hopkinson later became the Navy Board's chairman. As part of the  nation's government, he was treasurer of the Continental Loan Office in 1778; appointed judge of the Admiralty Court of Pennsylvania in 1779 and reappointed in 1780 and 1787; and helped ratify the Constitution during the constitutional convention in 1787.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|chapter VI}}\n<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|325}}\n\nOn September 24, 1789, President [[George Washington]] nominated Hopkinson to the newly created position of judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]], and received his commission, on September 26, 1789.\n\nOnly a few years into his service as a federal judge, Hopkinson died in Philadelphia at the age of 53 from a sudden apoplectic seizure.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|449}} He was buried in [[Christ Church Burial Ground]] in Philadelphia.<ref>{{FAG|2774}}</ref> He was the father of [[Joseph Hopkinson]], who was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] and also became a federal judge. Hopkinson was the designer of the American flag.  He did not get his due in life.  At one point, he asked for a quarter cask of wine for his efforts,\n<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|241}} which he never received.\n\n==Cultural contributions==\nHopkinson wrote popular airs and political satires (''jeux d'esprit'') in the form of poems and pamphlets. Some were widely circulated, and powerfully assisted in arousing and fostering the spirit of political independence that issued in the [[American Revolution]]. His principal writings are ''A Pretty Story . . .'' (1774), a satire about King George, ''The Prophecy'' (1776), and ''The Political Catechism'' (1777).<ref name=\"Moulton\">{{cite book|title=The Library of Literary Criticism of English and American Authors: 1785\u20131824|editor=[[Charles Wells Moulton]]|publisher=The Moulton Publishing Company|location=Buffalo, NY|year=1902|pages=131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBAFAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA131}}</ref>\n\nOther notable essays are \"Typographical Method of conducting a Quarrel\", \"Essay on White Washing\", and \"Modern Learning\". Many of his writings can be found in ''Miscellaneous Essays and Occasional Writings'', published at Philadelphia in three volumes in 1792 (see Bibliography).\n\nHopkinson began to play the [[harpsichord]] at age seventeen and, during the 1750s, hand-copied arias, songs, and instrumental pieces by many European composers. He is credited as being the first American born composer to commit a composition to paper with his 1759 composition \"My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free.\" By the 1760s he was good enough on the harpsichord to play with professional musicians in concerts. Some of his more notable songs include \"The Treaty\", \"[[The Battle of the Kegs]]\", and \"The New Roof, a song for Federal Mechanics\". He also played organ at Philadelphia's [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] and composed or edited a number of hymns and psalms including: \"A Collection of Psalm Tunes with a few Anthems and Hymns Some of them Entirely New, for the Use of the United Churches of Christ Church and St. Peter's Church in Philadelphia\" (1763), \"A psalm of thanksgiving, Adapted to the Solemnity of Easter: To be performed on Sunday, the 30th of March, 1766, at Christ Church, Philadelphia\" (1766), and \"The Psalms of David, with the Ten Commandments, Creed, Lord's Prayer, &c. in Metre\" (1767). In the 1780s, Hopkinson modified a [[glass harmonica]] to be played with a keyboard and invented the '''Bellarmonic''', an instrument that utilized the tones of metal balls.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200035713/default.html Francis Hopkinson biography at the Library of Congress Performing Arts Digital Library]; accessed 30 September 2015.</ref>\n\nAt his alma mater, [[University of Pennsylvania]], one of the buildings in the Fisher-Hassenfeld College House is named after him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fh.house.upenn.edu/hopkinson|title=Hopkinson {{!}} Fisher College House|website=fh.house.upenn.edu|access-date=2016-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n====Books====\n* ''The Miscellaneous Essays and Occasional Writings of Francis Hopkinson, Esq'' Printed by T.

The resolution creating the flag came from the Continental Marine Committee. Hopkinson became a member of the committee in 1776. At the time of the flag's adoption, he was the Chairman of the Navy Board, which was under the Marine Committee. Today, that office and responsibility/power would be residing in the [[United States Secretary of the Navy]].<ref name=Zall>{{cite book|last1=Zall|first1=Paul M.|title=Comical Spirit of Seventy-Six: The Humor of Francis Hopkinson|date=1976|publisher=Huntington Library|location=San Marino, California|page=10}}</ref>\n\nHopkinson is recognized as the designer of the [[Flag of the United States]], and the journals of the [[Continental Congress]] support this.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=William Rea|last2=McCandless|first2=Byron|title=So Proudly We Hail|date=1981|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|page=101}}</ref>   His first letter in May 25, 1780, requesting compensation from Congress was almost comical. He asked for a quarter cask of wine in payment for designing the U.S. flag, the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and various other contributions. After Congress received a second letter from Hopkinson asking for cash in the amount of \u00a32,700, the Auditor General, James Milligan, commissioned an evaluation of the request for payment. In this second letter, Hopkinson did not mention designing the flag of the United States.

Congress used the usual bureaucratic tactics of asking for an itemized bill for payment in cash. After that, there was further bureaucratic back and forth including a request for an itemized bill and a committee to investigate Hopkinson's charges that his payment was being delayed for arbitrary reasons. Congress eventually refused to pay Hopkinson for the reason that Hopkinson was already paid as a public servant as a member of Congress.

One was his Board of Admiralty seal, which contained a shield of seven red and six white stripes on a blue field.

On today's seal, the 13 stars (constellation) representing the 13 original states have five points.  They are arranged in a larger star that has six points. The constellation comprising 13 smaller stars symbolizes the national motto, \"E pluribus unum.\" Originally, the design had individual stars with six points, but this was changed in 1841 when a new die was cast.  This seal is now impressed upon the reverse of the [[United States one-dollar bill]]. The reverse of the seal, designed by [[William Barton (heraldist)|William Barton]], contains an unfinished pyramid below a radiant eye.  The unfinished pyramid was an image used by Hopkinson when he designed the Continental $50 currency bill.<ref>[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Continental_$50_note_1778.jpg wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Continental_$50_note_1778]</ref><ref>[http://www.coins.nd.edu/ColCurrency/CurrencyText/CC-09-26-78.html Univ. of Notre Dame, Coin and Currency Collections]</ref><ref>Patterson and Dougall, p. 68</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* [[Francis Hopkinson House]], [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Burlington County, New Jersey|listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Burlington County, New Jersey]]\n* George E.

He was the younger son of emperor [[Theodosius I]] and his first wife [[Aelia Flaccilla]], and brother of [[Arcadius]], who was the Eastern Emperor from 395 until his death in 408. During his reign, [[Sack of Rome (410)|Rome was sacked]] for the first time in almost 800 years.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Honorius: The Fight for the Roman West AD 395-423|last=Doyle|first=Chris|publisher=Routledge Roman Imperial Biographies series|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><!--799 years from 390 BC to 410 AD (there is no year 0).-->\n\nEven by the standards of the rapidly declining Western Empire, Honorius's reign was precarious and chaotic. His reign was supported by his principal general, [[Stilicho]], who was successively Honorius's guardian (during his childhood) and his father-in-law (after the emperor became an adult). Stilicho's generalship helped preserve some level of stability, but with his execution in 408, the Western Roman Empire moved closer to collapse.\n\n==Emperor==\n\n===Early reign===\n[[Image:Jean-Paul Laurens - The Byzantine Emperor Honorius - 1880.jpg|thumb|''The Western Roman Emperor Honorius'', [[Jean-Paul Laurens]] (1880). Honorius became ''[[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augustus]]'' on 23 January 393, at the age of eight.]]\n\nAfter holding the [[Roman consul|consulate]] at the age of two, Honorius was declared ''[[Augustus (honorific)#In the divided Roman Empire|Augustus]]'' by his father Theodosius I, and thus co-ruler, on 23 January 393 after the death of [[Valentinian II]] and the usurpation of [[Eugenius]].<ref>Williams, Stephen and Gerard Friell, Theodosius: The Empire at Bay, Yale University Press, 1994, pg. 129</ref> When Theodosius died, in January 395, Honorius and Arcadius divided the Empire, so that Honorius became Western Roman Emperor at the age of ten.<ref>Victor, 48:19</ref>\n\nDuring the first part of his reign Honorius depended on the military leadership of the general [[Stilicho]], who had been appointed by Theodosius<ref>Zosimus, 4:59:1</ref> and was of mixed [[Vandal]] and Roman ancestry.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} To strengthen his bonds with the young emperor, Stilicho married his daughter [[Maria, daughter of Stilicho|Maria]] to him.<ref>Zosimus, 5:3:1</ref>  The [[epithalamion]] written for the occasion by Stilicho's court poet [[Claudian]] survives.<ref>Bury, pg. 77</ref> Honorius was also greatly influenced by the [[Pope]]s of [[Rome]], who sought to extend their influence through his youth and weak character. So it was that [[Pope Innocent I]] contrived to have Honorius write to his brother, condemning the deposition of [[John Chrysostom]] in 407.<ref>Bury, pg. 105</ref>\n\nAt first Honorius based his capital in [[Mediolanum|Milan]], but when the [[Visigoths]] under King [[Alaric I]] entered Italy in 401 he moved his capital to the coastal city of [[Ravenna]], which was protected by a ring of marshes and strong fortifications.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 110\">Bury, pg. 110</ref> While the new capital was easier to defend, it was poorly situated to allow Roman forces to protect [[Central Italy]] from the increasingly regular threat of barbarian incursions. It was significant that the Emperor's residence remained in Ravenna until the overthrow of the last western Roman Emperor in 476. That was probably the reason why Ravenna was chosen not only as the capital of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy, but also for the seat of the  [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Byzantine exarchs]] as well.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 110\"/>\n\n===Stilicho and the defence of Italy===\n[[File:DN Honorio Florentissimo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inscription honouring Honorius, as ''florentissimo invictissimoque'', the most excellent and invincible, 417\u2013418, [[Forum Romanum]]]]\nHonorius' reign was plagued by almost constant barbarian incursions into Gaul, Italy and Hispania. At the same time, a host of usurpers rose up due to the apparent inability of the Emperor to see to the Empire's defences.\n\nThe first crisis faced by Honorius was a [[Gildonic revolt|revolt led by Gildo]], the ''[[Comes]] [[Africa Province|Africae]]'' and ''Magister utriusque militiae per Africam'', in Northern Africa, which lasted for two years (397\u2013398).<ref>Bury, pg. 76</ref> It was eventually subdued by Stilicho, under the local command of Mascezel, the brother of Gildo.<ref>Zosimus, Book 5</ref>\n\nThe next crisis was the Visigoth invasion of Italy in 402 under the formidable command of their king, Alaric. Stilicho was absent in [[Raetia]] in the latter months of 401, when Alaric, who was also the Eastern Empire's [[magister militum]] in [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], suddenly marched with a large army to the Julian Alps and entered Italy.<ref>Bury, pg. 108</ref>\n\nStilicho hurried back to protect Honorius and the legions of Gaul and Britain were summoned to defend Italy. Honorius, slumbering at Milan, was caught unaware and quickly fled to [[Asti]], only to be pursued by Alaric, who marched into [[Liguria]]. Stilicho defeated Alaric at [[Pollentia]], on the river Tanarus on Easter Day (6 April 402). Alaric retreated to [[Verona]], where Stilicho attacked him again. The Visigoths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum.<ref>Bury, pg. 109</ref> In 405 Stilicho met an invasion of Italy led across the Danube by [[Radagaisus]]. They brought devastation to the heart of the Empire, until Stilicho defeated them in 406 and recruited most of them into his forces.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 110\"/> Then, in 405/6, an enormous barbarian horde, composed of [[Ostrogoths]], [[Alans]], [[Vandals]] and [[Quadi]], [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the frozen Rhine]] and invaded [[Gaul]].\n\nThe situation in [[Britannia|Britain]] was even more difficult. The British provinces were isolated, lacking support from the Empire, and the soldiers supported the revolts of [[Marcus (usurper)|Marcus]] (406\u2013407), [[Gratian (usurper)|Gratian]] (407), and [[Constantine III (usurper)|Constantine III]]. Constantine invaded Gaul in 407, occupying [[Arles]], and while Constantine was in Gaul, his son [[Constans II (usurper)|Constans]] ruled over Britain.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 111\">Bury, pg. 111</ref>  By 410, Britain was effectively told to look after its own affairs and expect no aid from Rome.<ref>Zosimus, 10:2</ref>\n\nThere was good reason for this as the western empire was effectively overstretched due to the massive invasion of [[Alans]], [[Suebi]] and [[Vandal]]s who, although they had been repulsed from Italy in 406, moved into Gaul on 31 December 406,<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 111\"/> and arrived in [[Hispania]] in 409.  In early 408, Stilicho attempted to strengthen his position at court by marrying his second daughter, [[Thermantia]], to Honorius after the death of the Empress Maria in 407<ref name=\"Jones, pg. 442\">Jones, pg. 442</ref> making Honorius the last Western Roman Emperor to have multiple wives. Another invasion by Alaric was prevented in 408 by Stilicho when he forced the Roman Senate to pay 4,000 pounds of gold to persuade the Goths to leave Italy.<ref name=\"Nor1\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 131</ref>\n\nHonorius, in the meantime, was at [[Bologna|Bononia]], on his way from Ravenna to [[Ticinum]], when the news reached him of his brother's death in May 408. He at first was planning to go to Constantinople to help set up the court in the wake of the accession of [[Theodosius II]].<ref>Bury, pg. 112</ref>  Summoned from Ravenna for advice, Stilicho advised Honorius not to go, and proceeded to go himself. In Stilicho\u2019s absence, a minister named [[Olympius]] gained the confidence of Honorius. He convinced the emperor that his [[Arianism|Arian]] father-in-law was conspiring with the barbarians to overthrow him.<ref>Bury, pg. 113</ref>\n\nOn his return to Ravenna, Honorius ordered the arrest and execution of Stilicho. With Stilicho\u2019s fall, Honorius moved against all of his former father-in-law\u2019s allies, killing and torturing key individuals and ordering the confiscation of the property of anyone who had borne any office while Stilicho was in command. Honorius's wife [[Thermantia]], daughter of Stilicho, was taken from the imperial throne and given over to her mother; Eucherius, the son of Stilicho, was put to death.<ref>Zosimus, 5:44</ref> The purge also massacred the families of Stilicho's federate troops, and the troops defected en masse to Alaric.\n\nIn 409, Alaric returned to Italy to claim more gold and land to settle in, as feudatory vassals of the Empire, which Stilicho had promised him. Honorius refused to fulfill his former general's promises and Alaric marched on Rome,<ref>[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', (The Modern Library, 1932), ch. XXXI., p. 1,088, 1,089</ref> which bought him off after a short siege in which the city was brought to the verge of famine. A palace revolution in Honorius' court led meanwhile to a change of ministers, and those hostile to the Goths were replaced by officers favorable to Alaric, who began peace negotiations. While the embassy was absent, a new change occurred at Ravenna, and Honorius disclaimed the peace which was on the verge of being concluded.<ref>Gibbon, pp. 1,112-14</ref> The exasperated Alaric returned to Rome and forced the Senate to elect [[Priscus Attalus]] emperor, who ratified Alaric's former treaty with Stilicho.<ref>Gibbon, pp. 1,114-16</ref> In 410, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] sent six [[Roman legion|Legions]] (6,000 men; due to changes in tactics, legions of this period were about 1000 soldiers, down from the 6000-soldier legions of the Republic and early Empire periods)<ref name=\"Nor2\">J. Norwich, ''Byzantium: The Early Centuries'', 136</ref> from Ravenna to aid Honorius, but Alaric ambushed on the way, and only a handful of them reached Rome.<ref>[[Adrian Goldsworthy]], ''The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower,'' paperback edition published in 2010 by Phoenix, an imprint of Orion Books Ltd, London, p.310</ref> To counter Attalus, Honorius tried to negotiate with Alaric in addition to restricting grain shipments to Rome from North Africa. Attalus dispatched an army to conquer Africa and restore the grain supply, but the governor, Heraclian, who was loyal to Honorius, wiped out this force as soon as it landed on the coast.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1,118</ref> As Rome was dependent on North African grain for sustenance, the populace was faced with the prospect of famine, and they blamed Attalus for the impending calamity. Growing desperate, Attalus searched for means of pacifying the people, but found himself, in consequence of conciliatory expenditures, incapable of satisfying his debt to Alaric, and thus alienated both Romans and Goths. Confronted with the increasing unpopularity and truculence of Attalus, Alaric dethroned him in 410 and proposed to renew negotiations with Honorius.<ref>Gibbon, Ibid.</ref> Honorius, overconfident at Attalus' fall and the victory of his general Heraclian over Attalus' African expeditionary force, refused negotiation, and declared Alaric the eternal enemy of the Republic.<ref>Gibbon, p. 1,119</ref> The infuriated Alaric turned on the defenseless Rome [[Sack of Rome (410)|and sacked the city]].\n\n===Constantius and the erosion of the Western Empire===\n[[Image:ChristianPendantMaria398-407.JPG|thumb|180px|Christian pendant of Empress [[Maria (empress)|Maria]], daughter of [[Stilicho]], and wife of Honorius.\n[[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]].

In 409, [[Gerontius (general)|Gerontius]], Constantine III's general in Hispania, rebelled against him, proclaimed [[Maximus of Hispania|Maximus]] Emperor, and besieged Constantine at Arles.<ref>Bury, pg. 142</ref>  Honorius now found himself an able commander, [[Constantius III|Constantius]], who defeated Maximus and Gerontius, and then Constantine, in 411.\n\nGaul was again a source of troubles for Honorius: just after Constantius's troops had returned to Italy, [[Jovinus]] revolted in northern Gaul, with the support of Alans, Burgundians, and the Gallic nobility.<ref>Bury, pg. 145</ref> Jovinus tried to negotiate with the invading [[Goths]] of [[Ataulf]] (412), but his proclamation of his brother [[Sebastianus]] as [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] made Ataulf seek alliance with Honorius. Honorius had Ataulf defeat and execute Jovinus in 413.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 146\">Bury, pg. 146</ref> At the same time, [[Heraclianus]] raised the standard of revolt in North Africa, but failed during an invasion of Italy. Defeated, he fled back to [[Carthage]] and was killed.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 146\"/>\n\nIn 414, Constantius attacked Ataulf, who proclaimed Priscus Attalus emperor again. Constantius drove Ataulf into Hispania, and Attalus, having again lost Visigoth support, was captured and deposed. In the eleventh consulship of Honorius and the second of Constantius, the Emperor entered Rome in triumph, with Attalus at the wheels of his chariot. Honorius punished Attalus by cutting off his right finger and thumb, inflicting the same fate with which Attalus had threatened Honorius. Remembering how Attalus had suggested that Honorius should retire to some small island, he returned the favor by banishing Attalus to the island of [[Lipara]].<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 150\">Bury, pg. 150</ref>\n\nNortheastern Gaul became subject to even greater [[Franks|Frankish]] influence, while a treaty signed in 418 granted to the [[Visigoths]] southwestern Gaul, the former [[Gallia Aquitania]]. Under the influence of Constantius, Honorius issued the Edict of 418, which was designed to enable the Empire to retain a hold on the lands which were to be surrendered to the Goths.<ref>Bury, pg. 153</ref> This edict relaxed the administrative bonds that connected all the [[Septem Provinciae|Seven Provinces]] (The Maritime Alps, [[Narbonensis Prima]], [[Narbonensis Secunda]], [[Novempopulania]], [[Aquitania Prima]], [[Aquitania Secunda]] and [[Viennensis]]) with the central government. It removed the imperial governors and allowed the inhabitants, as a dependent federation, to conduct their own affairs, for which purpose representatives of all the towns were to meet every year in [[Arles]].<ref>Bury, pg. 154</ref>\n\nIn 417, Constantius married Honorius's sister, [[Galla Placidia]], much against her will.<ref name=\"Bury, pg. 150\"/> In 421, Honorius recognized him as co-emperor Constantius III;<ref>Bury, pg. 151</ref> however, when the announcement of his elevation was sent to Constantinople, Theodosius refused to recognise him. Constantius, enraged, began preparations for a military conflict with the eastern empire but before he could commence it, he died early in 422.<ref>Bury, pg. 155</ref>\n\nIn 420\u2013422, another Maximus (or perhaps the same) gained and lost power in Hispania. By the time of Honorius\u2019s death in 423, Britain, Spain and large parts of Gaul had effectively passed into barbarian control.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In his final years, Honorius reportedly developed a physical attraction to his half-sister, and in order to escape his unwelcome attentions, Galla Placidia and her children, the future emperor [[Valentinian III]] and his sister, [[Honoria]], fled to Constantinople.<ref>Bury, pg. 156</ref>\n\n===Death===\nHonorius died of [[oedema]] on 15 August 423, leaving no heir.<ref name=\"Jones, pg. 442\"/>  In the subsequent interregnum [[Joannes]] was nominated Emperor. The following year, however, the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] Emperor [[Theodosius II]] elected his cousin [[Valentinian III]], son of [[Galla Placidia]] and [[Constantius III]], as Emperor.\n\nThe mausoleum of Honorius was located on the [[Vatican Hill]]. In the 8th century it was transformed into a church, the [[Saint Petronilla#The Chapel of St. Petronilla|Chapel of St Petronilla]], which held the relics of [[Saint Petronilla|the saint]] and was accessed from the transept of the [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The mausoleum was demolished when the [[St. Peter's Basilica|New St Peter's]] was erected.<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521513715&ss=toc</ref><ref name=Pearce>{{cite web |title=Old St Peters, the Circus of Caligula and the Phrygianum |author=Roger Pearse |work=Roger Pearse's blog |publisher= |date=16 May 2014  |url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2014/05/16/old-st-peters-the-circus-of-caligula-and-the-phrygianum |accessdate=1 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Sack of Rome==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\n{{Main|Sack of Rome (410)}}\n[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Favorites of the Emperor Honorius - 1883.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Favorites of the Emperor Honorius'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], 1883]]\n\nThe most notable event of his reign was the assault and [[Sack of Rome (410)|Sack of Rome]] on 24 August 410 by the Visigoths under [[Alaric I|Alaric]].\n\nThe city had been under Visigothic siege since shortly after Stilicho's deposition and execution in the summer of 408. Lacking a strong general to control the by-now mostly barbarian Roman Army, Honorius could do little to attack Alaric's forces directly, and apparently adopted the only strategy he could in the situation: wait passively for the Visigoths to grow weary and spend the time marshalling what forces he could. Unfortunately, this course of action appeared to be the product of Honorius' indecisive character and he suffered much criticism for it both from contemporaries and later historians.\n\nWhether this plan could have worked is perhaps debatable. In any case, it was overtaken by events. Stricken by starvation, somebody opened Rome's defenses to Alaric and the Goths poured in. The city had not been under the control of a foreign force since an invasion of Gauls some eight centuries before. The sack itself was notably mild as sacks go; churches and religious statuary went unharmed for example. The psychological blow to the Romans was considerably more painful. The shock of this event reverberated from Britain to Jerusalem, and inspired [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] to write his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.\n\nThe year 410 also saw Honorius reply to a [[Romano-British|British]] plea for assistance against local barbarian incursions, called the ''Rescript of Honorius''. Preoccupied with the [[Visigoths]], Honorius lacked any military capability to assist the distant province. According to the sixth century [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Zosimus]], \"Honorius wrote letters to the cities in Britain, bidding them to guard themselves.\"<ref>Zosimus, vi.10.2</ref>  This sentence is located randomly in the middle of a discussion of southern [[Italy]]; no further mention of Britain is made, which has led some, though not all, modern academics to suggest that the rescript does not apply to Britain, but to [[Bruttium]] in Italy.<ref>Birley, Anthony Richard ''The Roman Government of Britain'' OUP Oxford (29 September 2005) {{ISBN|978-0-19-925237-4}} pp.461\u2013463{https://books.google.com/books?id=izIMUEgzjm0C&pg=PA461&dq=bruttium+honorius&num=100&as_brr=3&cd=2#v=onepage&q=bruttium%20honorius&f=false}</ref><ref>Halsall, Guy ''Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568''  Cambridge University Press; illustrated edition (20 December 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-521-43491-1}} pp.217\u2013218</ref><ref>Discussion in [[Martin Millett]], ''The Romanization of Britain'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990) and in Philip Bartholomew 'Fifth-Century Facts' ''Britannia'' vol. 13, 1982 p. 260</ref>\n\n==Judgments on Honorius==\n[[File:Solidus Honorius 402 76001657.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of emperor Honorius minted at [[Ravenna]]]]\nIn his ''History of the Wars'', [[Procopius]] mentions a story (which [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] disbelieved) where, on hearing the news that Rome had \"perished\", Honorius was initially shocked; thinking the news was in reference to a favorite [[chicken]] he had named \"Roma\".\n\n<blockquote>\"At that time they say that the Emperor Honorius in Ravenna received the message from one of the eunuchs, evidently a keeper of the poultry, that Rome had perished. And he cried out and said, 'And yet it has just eaten from my hands!' For he had a very large cock, Rome by name; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Rome which had perished at the hands of Alaric, and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly: 'But I thought that my fowl Rome had perished.' So great, they say, was the folly with which this emperor was possessed.\"\n\n'''Procopius, The Vandalic War (III.2.25\u201326)'''</blockquote>\n\nSummarising his account of Honorius's reign, the historian [[J.B. Bury]] wrote, \"His name would be forgotten among the obscurest occupants of the Imperial throne were it not that his reign coincided with the fatal period in which it was decided that western Europe was to pass from the Roman to the Teuton.\" After listing the disasters of those 28 years, Bury concludes that Honorius \"himself did nothing of note against the enemies who infested his realm, but personally he was extraordinarily fortunate in occupying the throne till he died a natural death and witnessing the destruction of the multitude of tyrants who rose up against him.\"<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/6*.html#5 John Bagnall Bury, ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', 1923] (New York: Dover, 1958), p. 213</ref>\n\nHonorius issued a decree during his reign, prohibiting men from wearing trousers in Rome.<ref>Codex Theodosianus 14.10.2\u20133, tr.

(1938) Science & Music, reprinted by Dover, 1968.</ref> is a [[harmonic]] of a note that is augmented by a resonance. Speech researcher [[Gunnar Fant]]<ref>Fant, G. (1960). Acoustic Theory of Speech Production. Mouton & Co, [[The Hague]], Netherlands.</ref> defined formants as \"the spectral peaks of the sound spectrum |P(f)|\". In acoustics generally, a very similar definition is widely used: the Acoustical Society of America defines a '''formant''' as: \"a range of frequencies [of a complex sound] in which there is an absolute or relative maximum in the sound spectrum\".<ref>Standards Secretariat, Acoustical Society of America, (1994). ANSI S1.1-1994 (R2004) American National Standard Acoustical Terminology, (12.41) Acoustical Society of America, Melville, NY.</ref><ref>Titze, I.R., Baken, R.J. Bozeman, K.W., Granqvist, S.

Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.</ref> of the human vocal tract. Thus, in [[phonetics]], formant can mean either a resonance or the spectral maximum that the resonance produces. Formants are often measured as amplitude peaks in the [[frequency spectrum]] of the sound, using a spectrogram (in the figure) or a spectrum analyzer and, in the case of the voice, this gives an estimate of the vocal tract resonances. In vowels spoken with a high [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|fundamental frequency]], as in a female or child voice, however, the frequency of the resonance may lie between the widely spaced harmonics and hence no corresponding peak is visible.\n\nA room can be said to have formants characteristic of that particular room, due to the way sound reflects from its walls and objects. Room formants of this nature reinforce themselves by emphasizing specific frequencies and absorbing others, as exploited, for example, by [[Alvin Lucier]] in his piece ''[[I Am Sitting in a Room]]''.\n\n==History==\nFrom an acoustic point of view, phonetics had a serious problem with the idea that length of vocal tract changed vowels. It was unclear how they could depend on frequencies when everyone from [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] to [[soprano]] can make the same vowels. There had to be some way to normalize the frequencies. [[Ludimar Hermann|Hermann]] suggested a solution to this problem in 1894, coining the term \u201cformant\u201d. A vowel, according to him, is a special acoustic phenomenon, depending on the intermittent production of a special partial, or \u201cformant\u201d, or \u201ccharacteristique\u201d. The pitch of the \u201cformant\u201d may vary a little without altering the character of the vowel. For ''a'', for example, the \u201cformant\u201d may vary from F<sub>4</sub> to A<sub>4</sub> even in the same person.<ref name=\"McKendrick\">McKendrick, J. G. (1903). Experimental phonetics.

The information that humans require to distinguish between speech sounds can be represented purely quantitatively by specifying peaks in the amplitude/frequency spectrum.\nMost of these formants are produced by tube and chamber [[resonance]], but a few whistle tones derive from periodic collapse of [[Venturi effect]] low-pressure zones{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. The formant with the lowest frequency is called ''F''<sub>1</sub>, the second ''F''<sub>2</sub>, and the third ''F''<sub>3</sub>. Most often the two first formants, ''F''<sub>1</sub> and ''F''<sub>2</sub>, are enough to disambiguate the vowel. The relationship between the perceived vowel quality and the first two formant frequencies can be appreciated by listening to \"artificial vowels\" that are generated by passing a click train (to simulate the glottal pulse train) through a pair of bandpass filters (to simulate vocal tract resonances). An interactive demonstration of this can be found [http://auditoryneuroscience.com/vocalizations-speech/two-formants here].\n\nNasal consonants usually have an additional formant around 2500&nbsp;Hz. The liquid {{IPA|[l]}} usually has an extra formant at 1500&nbsp;Hz, whereas the [[English language|English]] \"r\" sound ({{IPA|[\u0279]}}) is distinguished by a very low third formant (well below 2000&nbsp;Hz).\n\n[[Plosives]] (and, to some degree, [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]) modify the placement of formants in the surrounding vowels. [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]] sounds (such as {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/p/}} in \"ball\" or \"sap\") cause a lowering of the formants; [[Velar consonant|velar]] sounds ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} in English) almost always show ''F''<sub>2</sub> and ''F''<sub>3</sub> coming together in a 'velar pinch' before the [[Velar consonant|velar]] and separating from the same 'pinch' as the velar is released; [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] sounds (English {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}) cause fewer systematic changes in neighbouring vowel formants, depending partially on exactly which vowel is present. The time course of these changes in vowel formant frequencies are referred to as 'formant transitions'.\n\nIf the fundamental frequency of the underlying vibration is higher than a resonance frequency of the system, then the formant usually imparted by that resonance will be mostly lost. This is most apparent in the example of [[soprano]] [[opera]] singers, who sing high enough that their vowels become very hard to distinguish.\n\nControl of resonances is an essential component of the vocal technique known as [[overtone singing]], in which the performer sings a low fundamental tone, and creates sharp resonances to select upper [[harmonics]], giving the impression of several tones being sung at once.\n\n[[Spectrogram]]s are used to visualise formants. In spectrograms, it can be hard to distinguish formants from naturally occurring harmonics when one sings. However, one can hear the natural formants in a vowel shape through atonal techniques such as [[vocal fry]].\n\n==Formant plots==\nThe first two formants are important in determining the quality of vowels, and are frequently said to correspond to the open/close and front/back dimensions (which have traditionally, though not entirely accurately, been associated with the shape and position of the [[tongue]]). Thus the first formant ''F''<sub>1</sub> has a higher frequency for an open vowel (such as {{IPA|[a]}}) and a lower frequency for a close vowel (such as {{IPA|[i]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}); and the second formant ''F''<sub>2</sub> has a higher frequency for a front vowel (such as {{IPA|[i]}}) and a lower frequency for a back vowel (such as {{IPA|[u]}}).<ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2006) ''A Course in Phonetics (Fifth Edition)'', Boston, MA: Thomson Wadsworth, p. 188. {{ISBN|1-4130-2079-8}}</ref><ref>Ladefoged, Peter (2001) ''Vowels and Consonants: An Introduction to the Sounds of Language'', Maldern, MA: Blackwell, p. 40. {{ISBN|0-631-21412-7}}</ref> as can be seen in Fig. 1. [[File:FormantPlotSchematic.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of formant plot]] Vowels will almost always have four or more distinguishable formants; sometimes there are more than six. However, the first two formants are most important in determining vowel quality, and this is often displayed in terms of a plot of the first formant against the second formant,<ref>Deterding, David (1997) 'The Formants of Monophthong Vowels in Standard Southern British English Pronunciation', ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', 27, pp. 47-55.</ref> though this is not sufficient to capture some aspects of vowel quality, such as rounding.<ref>Hayward, Katrina (2000) ''Experimental Phonetics'', Harlow, UK: Pearson, p. 149. {{ISBN|0-582-29137-2}}</ref> An example of how the vowels of a language or dialect may be plotted on a traditional auditory vowel chart and also on a formant plot may be seen in the case of [[Norwegian phonology#Vowels|Norwegian]].\n\n[[File:Vowel triange, cardinal vowels.png|thumb|While [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones's]] attempts at capturing vowel articulation resulted in the International Phonetic Association plotting vowels in a trapezoid, actual formant space may be more triangular. Shown is an idealized plot of the formants of Jones and [[John C. Wells|John Wells]] pronouncing the cardinal vowels of the IPA.<ref>[[Geoff Lindsey]], 2013. ''The Vowel Space''.[http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/the-vowel-space/]</ref>]]\nMany writers have addressed the problem of finding an optimal alignment of the positions of vowels on formant plots with those on the conventional vowel quadrilateral. The pioneering work of Ladefoged<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladefoged|first1=P.|title=Three Areas of Experimental Phonetics|date=1967|publisher=Oxford|page=87}}</ref> used the [[Mel scale]] because this scale was claimed to correspond more closely to the auditory scale of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] than to the acoustic measure of [[fundamental frequency]] expressed in Hertz as in Fig. 1. Two alternatives to the Mel scale are the [[Bark scale]] and the [[Equivalent rectangular bandwidth|ERB-rate scale]]. A comparison of these three scales is shown by Hayward, p.&nbsp;141, and formant plots based on the Hertz scale and on the Bark scale are compared on p.&nbsp;153.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hayward|first1=K.|title=Experimental Phonetics|date=2000|publisher=Longman|isbn=0-582-29137-2}}</ref> Another strategy for improving formant plots that has been widely adopted is to plot on the horizontal axis not the value of F2 but the difference between F1 and F2 for a given vowel.\n\n==Singer's formant==\nStudies of the frequency spectrum of trained [[singing|singers]], especially male singers, indicate a clear formant around 3000&nbsp;Hz (between 2800 and 3400&nbsp;Hz) that is absent in speech or in the spectra of untrained singers.

It is a strip or sheet of transparent [[plastic]] [[film base]] coated on one side with a [[gelatin]] [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]] containing microscopically small light-sensitive [[silver halide]] crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and [[Image resolution|resolution]] of the film.<ref name=Ullmann>Karlheinz Keller et al. \"Photography\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a20_001}}</ref> The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to the image formed by a [[camera]] lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible [[latent image]] in the emulsion, which can be chemically [[photographic processing|developed]] into a visible [[photograph]]. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to [[X-ray]]s and [[particle physics|high-energy particles]]. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the [[infrared]] (IR) region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]].\n\nIn [[Black-and-white#Media|black-and-white photographic film]] there is usually one layer of silver salts. When the exposed grains are developed, the silver salts are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film [[Negative (photography)|negative]]. Color film has at least three sensitive layers. Dyes, which [[adsorption|adsorb]] to the surface of the silver salts, make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by the green and red layers. During development, the exposed silver salts are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to silver salts in the ''bleach step''. It is removed from the film in the ''fix step''. Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like [[Kodacolor (still photography)|Kodacolor II]], have as many as 12 emulsion layers,{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer.\n\n==History==\n\n===1888\u20131899: Before standardization===\nEarly motion picture experiments in the 1880s were performed using a fragile [[paper]] roll film, with which it was difficult to view a single, continuously moving image without a complex apparatus. The first transparent and flexible [[film base]] material was [[celluloid]], which was discovered and refined for photographic use by [[John Carbutt]], [[Hannibal Goodwin]], and [[George Eastman]].<ref name=\"kodak.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/Our_Company/History_of_Kodak/Milestones_-_chronology/1878-1929.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823030506/http://www.kodak.com/ek/US/en/Our_Company/History_of_Kodak/Milestones_-_chronology/1878-1929.htm |archivedate=2015-08-23 |df= }}</ref> [[Eastman Kodak]] made celluloid film commercially available in 1889; [[Thomas Henry Blair]], in 1891, was his first competitor. The stock had a frosted base to facilitate easier viewing by transmitted light. Emulsions were [[orthochromatic]]. By November 1891 [[William Dickson (film pioneer)|William Dickson]], at [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]'s laboratory, was using Blair's stock for [[Kinetoscope]] experiments.<ref name=\"kodak.com\"/> Blair's company supplied film to Edison for five years. Between 1892 and 1893, Eastman experienced problems with production. Because of patent lawsuits in 1893, Blair left his American company and established another in Britain. Eastman became Edison's supplier of film. \n\nBlair's new company supplied European filmmaking pioneers, including [[Birt Acres]], [[Robert W. Paul|Robert Paul]], [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], [[Charles Urban]], and the [[Lumiere Brothers]]. By 1896 the new [[movie projector]] required a fully transparent film base that Blair's American operation could not supply. Eastman shortly thereafter bought the company out and became the leading supplier of film stock. [[Louis Lumiere]] worked with [[Victor Planchon]] to adapt the Lumiere \"Blue Label\" (Etiquette Bleue) photographic plate emulsion for use on celluloid roll film, which began in early 1896. \n\nEastman's first motion picture film stock was offered in 1889.<ref name=\"aipcinema.com\">http://www.aipcinema.com/ficheiros/Conteudos/KODAK_FILM_HISTORY.pdf</ref> At first the film was the same as photographic film. By 1916, separate \"Cine Type\" films were offered.<ref name=\"aipcinema.com\"/> From 1895, Eastman supplied their motion picture roll film in rolls of 65 feet, while Blair's rolls were 75 feet. If longer lengths were needed, the unexposed negative rolls could be cemented in a [[darkroom]], but this was largely undesirable by most narrative filmmakers. The makers of [[Actuality film]]s were much more eager to undertake this method, however, in order to depict longer actions. They created cemented rolls as long as 1000 feet. [[American Mutoscope and Biograph]] was the first known company to use such film for the [[James J. Jeffries|Jeffries]]-[[Tom Sharkey|Sharkey]] fight on November 3, 1899.\n\n===1900\u20131919: Toward the standard picture film===\nAs the quantity of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, [[list of film formats|film formats]] gradually became [[standardized]] and film stocks improved. A number of [[film gauge]]s were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to [[Path\u00e9]] in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. [[35mm film]] began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumi\u00e8re's [[cameras]]. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began to be made by [[Bell and Howell]]. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the [[Edison Trust|Motion Picture Patents Trust]] agreed to what would become the standard: 35&nbsp;mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]].<ref>The gauge and perforations are almost identical to modern film stock; the full silent ratio is also used as the [[film gate]] in movie cameras, although portions of the image are later cropped out in post-production and projection.</ref>\n[[Image:16mmBWrevDP.png|thumb|A silent home movie on [[16 mm film|16mm]] [[black-and-white]] reversal double perforation film stock]]\n[[Agfa]] began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a [[nitrocellulose|nitrate]] [[film base]], which is highly flammable. [[Nitrate film]] fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely. Amateur [[filmmaking]] ([[home movies]]) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. \n\nIn 1909, tests showed [[cellulose diacetate]] to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22&nbsp;mm widths for Edison's work on the [[Home Kinetoscope]], which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-inflammable 35&nbsp;mm film stock in 1909. The [[plasticizer]]s used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock.<ref>Eileen Bowser, ''The Transformation of Cinema 1907\u20131915'', Charles Scribner's Sons, 1990, p. 74\u201375. {{ISBN|0-684-18414-1}}.</ref> More amateur formats began to use acetate-based film, and several, including Kodak's own [[16 mm]] format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offeringst, he improvements were in granularity and sharpness.\n\n===1920s: Diversification of film sensitivity===\nFilm stock manufacturers began to diversify their products. Each manufacturer had previously offered one negative stock (usually orthochromatic) and one print stock. In 1920, a variant of Type F film known as X-back was introduced to counteract the effects of static electricity on the film, which can cause [[Electric spark|sparking]] and create odd [[exposure patterns]] on the film. A resin backing was used on the film, which rendered the film too opaque to allow focusing through the back of the film, a common technique for many cameras of that era. The X-back stock was popular on the east coast of the US. Other manufacturers were established in the 1920s, including American [[E.I. Dupont de Nemours]] in 1926 and Belgian [[Agfa-Gevaert|Gevaert]] in 1925. [[Panchromatic]] film stock became more common. Created in 1913 for use in color film processes such as [[Kinemacolor]], panchromatic was first used in a black-and-white film for exterior sequences in ''[[Queen of the Sea (film)|Queen of the Sea]]'' (1918) and originally available as a special order product.<ref>Koszarski (1994). p. 140.</ref> The stock's increased sensitivity to red light made it an attractive option for [[day for night]] shooting. Kodak financed a feature in 1922, shot entirely with panchromatic stock, ''[[The Headless Horseman (1922 film)|The Headless Horseman]]'', to promote the film when Kodak introduced it as a standard option. Panchromatic film stock was expensive and no motion pictures were produced in entirety on it for several years. The cross-cutting between panchromatic and orthochromatic stocks caused continuity problems with costume tones and [[panchromatic film]] was often avoided.\n\nOrthochromatic film remained dominant until the mid-1920s due to Kodak's lack of competition in the panchromatic market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock's market share within a few years.<ref>Salt (1992). p. 179. \"There was apparently some question as to differences in relative contrast between the two stocks. As Barry Salt notes, \"this claim is almost impossible to substantiate now, given the extreme difficulty there is in seeing a reasonable number of original prints of films shot on both stocks.\"</ref> Similar panchromatic film stocks were manufactured by Agfa and Path\u00e9, the shift to panchromatic stocks had largely been completed by 1928, and Kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in 1930.<ref>[http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/index.htm Kodak: Chronology of Motion Picture Films, 1889 to 1939].</ref>\n\n===Colour films===\n{{further|Colour motion picture film}}\nExperiments with colour films were made as early as the late 19th century, but practical colour film was not commercially viable until 1908, and for amateur use when Kodak introduced [[Kodachrome]] for 16&nbsp;mm in 1935 and [[8 mm film|8&nbsp;mm]] in 1936. Before 1941, commercially successful colour processes used special cameras loaded with black-and-white separation stocks rather than colour negative. [[Kinemacolor]] (1908\u20131914), [[Technicolor]] processes 1 through 4 (1917\u20131954), and [[Cinecolor]] used one, two or three strips of monochrome film stock sensitized to certain primary colours or exposed behind colour filters in special cameras. Technicolor introduced a colour [[reversal film|reversal]] stock, called Monopack, for location shooting in 1941; it was ultimately a 35&nbsp;mm version of Kodachrome that could be used in standard motion picture cameras. \n\nEastman Kodak introduced their first [[35 mm film|35mm]] colour negative stock, Eastman Colour Negative film 5247, in 1950.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} A higher quality version in 1952, Eastman Colour Negative film 5248, was quickly adopted by Hollywood for colour motion picture production, replacing both the expensive three-strip Technicolor process and Monopack.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n<!-- 5247 was not invented in 1950 and 5248 was definitely not invented in 1952.<ref>eastman kodak</ref> -->\n\n==Classification and properties==\n[[File:35mm-undevel.jpg|thumb|A short strip of undeveloped 35 mm color negative film.]]\n\nThere are several variables in classifying stocks; in practice, one orders raw stock by a code number, based on desired sensitivity to light.\n\n===Base===\n{{further|Film base}}\nA piece of film consists of a light-sensitive [[emulsion]] applied to a tough, transparent [[film base|base]], sometimes attached to [[anti-halation backing]] or \"rem-jet\" layer (now only on camera films). Originally the highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] was used. In the 1930s, film manufacturers introduced \"[[safety film]]\" with a cellulose triacetate plastic base. All amateur film stocks were safety film, but the use of nitrate persisted for professional releases. [[Kodak]] discontinued the manufacture of nitrate base in 1951, and the industry transitioned entirely to safety film in 1951 in the [[United States]] and by 1955 internationally. Since the late 1990s, almost all release prints have used [[polyester]] film stock.\n\n===Emulsion===\nThe emulsion consists of [[silver halide]] grains suspended in a [[gelatin]] colloid; in the case of color film, there are three layers of silver halide, which are mixed with [[color couplers]] and interlayers that filter specific light spectra. These end up creating yellow, [[cyan]], and [[magenta]] layers in the negative after development.\n\n===Chemistry===\nDevelopment chemicals applied to an appropriate film can produce either a positive  (showing the same densities and colors as the subject) or [[negative film|negative image]] (with dark highlights, light shadows, and, in principle, complementary colors). The first films were darkened by light: negative films. Later films that produce a positive image became known as [[reversal film]]s; processed transparent film of this type can be [[Movie projector|projected]] onto a screen. Negative images need to be transferred onto photographic paper or other substrate which reverses the image again, producing a final positive image. Creating a positive image from a negative film can also be done by [[Image scanner|scanning]] the negative to create a computer file which can then be reversed by [[software]].\n\n===Image record===\nDifferent emulsions and development processes exist for a variety of image recording possibilities: the two most common of which are black and white, and color. However, there are also variant types, such as [[infrared film]] (in black and white or [[false color]]); specialist technical films, such as those used for [[X-rays]]; and obsolete processes, such as [[orthochromatic]] film. Generally, however, the vast majority of stock used today is \"normal\" (visible spectrum) color, although \"normal\" black and white also commands a significant minority percentage.\n\n===Physical characteristics===\nFilm is also classified according to its [[film gauge|gauge]] and the arrangement of its [[film perforations|perforations]]\u2014 gauges range from [[8 mm film|8 mm]] to [[70 mm film|70 mm]] or more, while perforations may vary in shape, pitch, and positioning. The film is also distinguished by how it is wound with regard to perforations and base or emulsion side, as well as whether it is packaged around a core, a daylight spool, or within a cartridge. Depending on the manufacturing processes and camera equipment, lengths can vary anywhere from 25 to 2000 feet. Common lengths include 25 feet for 8&nbsp;mm, 50 feet for [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]], 100 and 400 feet for 16&nbsp;mm, 400 and 1000 feet for 35&nbsp;mm, and 1000 for 65/70&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Responsivity===\nA critical property of a stock is its [[film speed]], determined by [[American Standards Association|ASA]] or its sensitivity to light listed by a measurement on the [[raw stock]] which must be chosen with care. Speed determines the range of lighting conditions under which the film can be shot, and is related to [[film grain|granularity]] and contrast, which influence the look of the image. The stock manufacturer will usually give an exposure index (EI) number equal to the ASA which they recommend exposing for. However, factors such as forced or non-standard development (such as [[bleach bypass]] or [[cross processing]]), compensation for filters or [[shutter angle]], as well as intended under- and over-exposure may cause the cinematographer to actually \"rate\" the stock differently from the EI. This new rating is not a change to the stock itself&nbsp;\u2014 it is merely a way of calculating exposure without figuring out the compensation after each light reading.\n\n===Colour temperature===\nAnother important quality of colour film stock in particular is its [[colour balance]], which is defined by the [[colour temperature]] at which it accurately records white. [[Tungsten lighting]] is defined at 3200 K, which is considered \"warmer\" in tone and shifted towards orange; [[daylight]] is defined at 5600 K, which is considered \"colder\" and shifted towards blue. This means that unfiltered tungsten stock will look normal shot under tungsten lights, but blue if shot during daylight. Conversely, daylight stock shot in daylight will look normal, but orange if shot under tungsten lights. Colour temperature issues such as these can be compensated for by other factors such as lens filters and colour gels placed in front of the lights. The colour temperature of a film stock is generally indicated next to the film speed number&nbsp;\u2014 e.g. 500T stock is colour film stock with an ASA of 500 and balanced for tungsten light; 250D would have an ASA of 250 and be balanced for daylight. While black-and-white film has no colour temperature itself, the silver halide grains themselves tend to be slightly more responsive to blue light, and therefore will have daylight and tungsten speeds&nbsp;\u2014 e.g. Kodak's Double-X stock is rated 250D/200T, since the tungsten light will give slightly less exposure than an equivalent amount of daylight.\n\n==Deterioration==\nAll plastic is [[polymer degradation|subject to deterioration]] through physical or chemical means, and thus, motion picture film is subject to the same deterioration. Films deteriorate over time, which can damage individual frames or even lead to the entire film being destroyed. Cellulose nitrate, cellulose diacetate and triacetate are known to be unstable mediums: improperly preserved film can deteriorate in a period of time much faster than many photographs or other visual presentations. Cellulose nitrate, because of its unstable chemistry, eventually breaks down, releasing nitric acid, further catalyzing the decomposition. In the final stages of celluloid decomposition, the film turns into a rust-like powder. Likewise, tri-acetate stock is also vulnerable to deterioration.  Because of the small gauge of the film, owners of home-made films often find that their film can become shrunken and brittle to the point where the film is unwatchable in the space of a few years. In general, decaying acetate film breaks down into [[acetic acid]], and similar to celluloid decomposition, leads to an auto-catylictic breakdown of the base that cannot be reversed.  The result of the acetic acid released is a strong odor of [[vinegar]], which is why the decay process in the archival community is known as \"[[vinegar syndrome]]\". Modern polyester-based stocks are far more stable by comparison and are rated to last hundreds of years if stored properly.\n\n==Intermediate and print stocks==\n[[File:Anamorphic-digital sound.jpg|right|thumb|250px|35&nbsp;mm film print frames. At far left and far right, outside the perforations, is the [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] soundtrack as an image of a digital signal. Between the perforations is the [[Dolby Digital]] soundtrack (note the tiny Dolby \"Double D\" logo in the center of each area between the perforations). Just inside the perforations, on the left side of the image, is the analog optical soundtrack, with two channels encoded using [[Dolby Analog SR|Dolby SR]] noise reduction that can be dematrixed into four channels using [[Dolby Pro Logic]]. The optical timecode used to synchronize a [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] soundtrack, which sits between the optical soundtrack and the image, is not pictured. Finally, the image here is an anamorphic image used to create a 2.39:1 aspect ratio when projected through an [[anamorphic]] lens. Note the thin [[frame line]]s of anamorphic prints.]]\nThe distinction between camera stocks and print stocks involves a difference in the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a [[negative cutter]] using the edited work print or EDL ([[edit decision list]]) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the Answer Print stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed Answer Print, and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The [[release prints]] are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of [[digital intermediate]] (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the answer print is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.\n\nDue to the specialized nature of the exposure and the higher degree of control afforded by the film lab equipment, these intermediate and release stocks are specially designed solely for these applications and are generally not feasible for camera shooting. Because intermediates only function to maintain the image information accurately across duplication, each manufacturer tends to only produce one or two different intermediate stocks. Similarly, release print stocks usually are available only in two varieties: a \"normal\" print or a deluxe print (on more-costly print film like Kodak Vision Premiere) with slightly greater saturation and contrast.\n\n==Decline==\n\nUse of film remained the dominant form of cinematography until the early 21st century when digital formats, such as the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|RED Camera series]], supplanted the use of film in many applications. This has also led to the replacement of film projectors with [[Digital cinema|digital projection]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2013/film/news/digital-cinema-conversion-nears-end-game-1200500975/ Digital Cinema Conversion Nears End Game]</ref>\n\nYet, digital videos are sometimes deliberately altered to achieve a [[film look]], such as adding [[film grain]] or other noise for artistic effect.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Film stocks}}\n*[[Direct film]]\n*[[Film format]]\n*[[Film preservation]]\n*[[Fujifilm]]\n*[[List of film formats]]\n*[[List of motion picture film stocks]]\n*[[Color motion picture film]]\n*[[Photographic film]] with emphasis on film for still photography.\n*[[ORWO]]\n*[[Tasma]]\n*[[Video]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*Koszarski, Richard (1994).

In those circumstances, the returns are due on the next business day.  An automatic extension until October 15 to file Form 1040 can be obtained by filing Form 4868.\n\nForm 1040 consists of two full pages (79 lines in total) not counting attachments.<ref name=\"f1040_2014\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf |title=Form 1040 (2014) |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref> The first page collects information about the taxpayer(s), dependents, income items, and adjustments to income. In particular, the taxpayer specifies his/her [[filing status]] and [[personal exemption (United States)|personal exemption]]s on this page. The second page calculates the allowable deductions and credits, tax due given the income figure, and applies funds already withheld from wages or estimated payments made towards the tax liability. At the top of the first page is the [[presidential election campaign fund checkoff]], which allows individuals to designate that the federal government give $3 of the tax it receives to the Presidential election campaign fund.<ref name=\"CNNMoney3USD\">{{cite web|last1=Ellis|first1=Blake|title=The real story behind the $3 tax checkoff box|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/11/pf/taxes/checkoff-box/|website=CNN Money|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> The instructions booklet for Form 1040 is 104 pages as of 2014.<ref name=\"f1040_2014ins\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf |title=1040 Instructions 2014 |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>\n\nAltogether, over 147 million returns were filed for Form 1040 and its variants in the year 2014,<ref name=\"glance\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/15taxstatscard.pdf | title=2015 Tax Statistics |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref> 80% of which were filed electronically.<ref name=\"f1040_2014ins\"/>{{rp|4}}\n\n==Filing requirements==\n\n=== Who must file? ===\n\nForm 1040 (or a variant thereof) is the main tax form filed by individuals who are deemed residents of the United States for tax purposes. The corresponding main form filed by businesses is [[Form 1120]], also called the U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.<ref name=f1120>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf|title = Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return|accessdate = January 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn individual is considered a resident of the United States for tax purposes if he or she is a citizen of the United States or a resident alien of the United States for tax purposes.<ref name=\"f1040_2014ins\" />{{rp|6}} An individual is a resident alien of the United States if he or she passes either the [[Substantial Presence Test]] or the [[Green Card Test]], although there are also some other cases; individuals who have taxable income in the United States but fail the criteria for being resident aliens must file as nonresident aliens for tax purposes.<ref name=\"alien_tax\">{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p519.pdf |title=U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens For use in preparing 2014 Returns |publisher=Internal Revenue Service}}</ref>{{rp|3}} While residents of the United States for tax purposes file Forms 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ, nonresident aliens must file Form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Aliens---Which-Form-to-File |title=Aliens - Which Form to File |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref> There is also a \"dual status alien\" for aliens whose status changed during the year.\n\nResident aliens of the United States for tax purposes must generally file if their income crosses a threshold where their taxable income is likely to be positive, but there are many other cases where it may be legally desirable to file. For instance, even if not required, individuals can file a return in order to receive a refund on withheld income or to receive certain credits (e.g. [[earned income tax credit]]).<ref name=\"f1040_2014ins\" />{{rp|6}}\n\n=== Filing modalities ===\n\nThe form may be filed either by paper or online.\n\n==== Paper filing ====\n\nPaper filing is the universally accepted filing method. Form 1040, along with its variants, schedules, and instructions, can be downloaded as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]s from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-1040|publisher=IRS}}</ref> Finalized versions of the forms for the tax year (which in the US is the same as the calendar year) are released near the end of January of the following year.\n\nPaper forms can be filled and saved electronically using a compatible PDF reader, and then printed. This way, it is easy to keep electronic copies of one's filled forms despite filing by paper. Alternatively, they can be printed out and filled by hand. A combination of the approaches may also be used, with some content filled in electronically and additional content written in by hand. As a general rule, where possible, it makes sense to fill electronically, but in some cases filling by hand may be necessary (for instance, if additional notes of explanation need to be added, or the font used for electronic filling is too large to fit the information in the space provided.\n\nThe only parts of the form that cannot be filled electronically are the signature lines.\n\nThe paper Form 1040, along with all relevant schedules and additional forms, must be sent in a single packet by mail or courier to an IRS address determined by the US state the taxpayer is filing from and whether or not a payment is enclosed; the addresses for the three forms (1040, 1040A, 1040EZ) are identical.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/uac/Where-to-File-Addresses-for-Tax-Professionals|title = Where to File Addresses for Taxpayers and Tax Professionals|publisher = [[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate = January 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe IRS accepts returns that are stapled or paperclipped together. However, any check or payment voucher, as well as accompanying Form 1040-V, must ''not'' be stapled or paperclipped with the rest of the return, since payments are processed separately.<ref name=f1040-v/>\n\n==== Electronic filing ====\n\nThe IRS allows US residents for tax purposes to file electronically in three ways:<ref name=efile>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/Filing/E-File-Options|title = E-File Options for Individuals|publisher = [[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate = January 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n* Those with incomes of $66,000 or less may file electronically using IRS Free File, a free e-filing tool (there are some other conditions necessary to be eligible for free filing; in particular, some kinds of income and deductions cannot be handled by free filing).<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free|title = Free File: Do Your Federal Taxes for Free|publisher = [[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate = January 10, 2017}}</ref>\n* It is possible to prepare one's tax return using a [[tax compliance software]] approved by the IRS and have the software file the return electronically. \n* One can use a tax professional who has been accepted by the IRS for electronic filing.\n\nMany paid tax preparers are required to file individual tax returns electronically, and most [[tax compliance software]] file electronically on the taxpayer's behalf. Even tax preparers who are not so required, must file Form 8948 if they choose paper filing, providing an explanation for why they are not filing electronically.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-8948,-Preparer-Explanation-for-Not-Filing-Electronically|title = Form 8948, Preparer Explanation for Not Filing Electronically|accessdate = January 7, 2015|publisher = [[Internal Revenue Service]]}}</ref>\n\n==== Comparison ====\n\nIf one is not eligible for IRS Free File, it might cost hundreds of dollars to file electronically, whereas paper filing has no costs beyond those of printing and mailing. Furthermore, the available existing electronic filing options may not offer sufficient flexibility with respect to arranging one's tax return, adding attachments, or putting written notes of explanation that can help preempt IRS questions. In addition, electronic filing makes one's tax return more likely to be audited because it is already in a format accessible to the IRS, whereas of paper returns, only 40% are transcribed, so that the remaining are not even in the running for being audited. For these reasons, law resource [[NOLO]] as well as ''[[Forbes]]'' argue that the more complicated one's tax return, the better it is to file on paper.<ref name=nolo>{{cite web|url = http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/should-you-file-your-taxes-electronically.html|title = Should You File Your Taxes Electronically?

Form 1040EZ uses completely different line numbering. Line numbering is important to keep in mind since many state income tax returns reference line numbers on the 1040.  Forms 1040A and EZ may only be used if a filer wants to take only the standard deduction: if a filer wants to itemize deductions then the 1040 must be used.\n\nForms 1040NR is used by taxpayers who are considered \"non-resident aliens\" for tax purposes. Form 1040X is used to amend any of the 1040 series forms.\n\n===1040A===\n\n[[File:Form 1040a, 2015.pdf|thumb|Form 1040A, 2015 tax year]]\n\nThe '''1040A''' (nicknamed the \"short form\") is a shorter version of the standard Form 1040. It is limited to taxpayers with taxable income below $100,000 who take the [[standard deduction]] instead of [[itemized deduction|itemizing deductions]].

Tax protesters contend that Form 1040 does not contain an \"OMB Control Number\" which is issued by the U.S. [[United States Office of Management and Budget|Office of Management and Budget]] under the [[Paperwork Reduction Act]].\n\nThe relevant clauses of the Paperwork Reduction Act state that:\n::\u00a7 1320.6 Public protection.\n\n::(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that is subject to the requirements of this part if:\n\n::::(1) The collection of information does not display, in accordance with \u00a71320.3(f) and \u00a71320.5(b)(1), a currently valid OMB control number assigned by the Director in accordance with the Act&hellip;\n\n::(e) The protection provided by paragraph (a) of this section does not preclude the imposition of a penalty on a person for failing to comply with a collection of information that is imposed on the person by statute\u2014e.g., 26 U.S.C. \u00a76011(a) (statutory requirement for person to file a tax return)&hellip;<ref>5 C.F.R. sec. 1320.6.</ref>\n\nThe Courts have responded to the OMB Control Number arguments with the following arguments. 1) Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return has contained the OMB Control number since 1981.<ref>The OMB control number is in the upper right corner of page 1 of the form. The short forms, Form 1040A and Form 1040EZ, also bear OMB control numbers.</ref> 2) As ruled in a number of cases, the absence of an OMB Control number does not eliminate the legal obligation to file or pay taxes.\n\nCases involving the OMB Control Number Argument include:\n*''United States v. Wunder''\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit argues that the provisions on the Paperwork Reduction Act are not relevant as the act applies only to information requests made after December 31, 1981 and tax returns starting from 1981 contained an OMB Control Number.<ref>919 F.2d 34, 90-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,575 (6th Cir. 1990).</ref>\n*''United States v. Patridge''\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the convicted taxpayer's OMB control number argument by stating \"Finally, we have no doubt that the IRS has complied with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Form 1040 bears a control number from OMB, as do the other forms the IRS commonly distributes to taxpayers. That this number has been constant since 1981 does not imply that OMB has shirked its duty.\" <ref name=\"Patridge\">''United States v. Patridge'', 507 F.3d 1092, 2007-2 U.S. Tax Cas.

Lawrence''\nIn this Case, IRS agents who had calculated Mr. Lawrence's tax liability had made an error and it was discovered that Mr. Lawrence owed less taxes than originally determined. Lawrence asked the trial court to order the government to reimburse him for his legal fees, to which the trial court ruled against him. He appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, contending that the government's conduct against him had been \"vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith.\" and also raising the OMB Control Number Argument.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected the OMB argument stating that\n \n<blockquote>According to Lawrence, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) required the Internal Revenue Service to display valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) numbers on its Form 1040\u2026. Lawrence argues that the PRA by its terms prohibits the government from imposing a criminal penalty upon a citizen for the failure to complete a form where the information request at issue does not comply with the PRA... Yet Lawrence conceded at oral argument that no case from this circuit establishes such a proposition, and in fact Lawrence cites no caselaw from any jurisdiction that so holds. In contrast, the government referenced numerous cases supporting its position that the PRA does not present a defense to a criminal action for failure to file income taxes.\" <ref>Judgment, page 2, docket entry 39, March 26, 2007, ''United States v.

He described his experiences as a slave in his 1845 autobiography, ''[[Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave]]'', which became a bestseller, and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition, as was his second book, ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]'' (1855). After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Douglass remained an active campaigner against slavery and wrote his last autobiography, ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]''. First published in 1881 and revised in 1892, three years before his death, it covered events during and after the Civil War. Douglass also actively supported [[women's suffrage]], and held several public offices.

He was also a believer in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides, and in the liberal values of the U.S. Constitution.

He later often said, \"knowledge is the pathway from slavery to freedom.\"<ref>Jacobs, H. and Appiah, K. (2004). ''Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave & Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl.'' pp. xiii, 4.</ref> As Douglass began to read newspapers, pamphlets, political materials, and books of every description, this new realm of thought led him to question and condemn the institution of slavery. In later years, Douglass credited ''[[The Columbian Orator]]'', an anthology that he discovered at about age twelve, with clarifying and defining his views on freedom and human rights. The book, first published in 1797, is a classroom reader, containing essays, speeches and dialogues, to assist students in learning reading and grammar.\n\nWhen Douglass was hired out to William Freeland, he taught other slaves on the plantation to read the [[New Testament]] at a weekly [[Sunday school]]. As word spread, the interest among slaves in learning to read was so great that in any week, more than 40 slaves would attend lessons. For about six months, their study went relatively unnoticed. While Freeland remained complacent about their activities, other plantation owners became incensed about their slaves being educated. One Sunday they burst in on the gathering, armed with clubs and stones, to disperse the congregation permanently.\n\nIn 1833, Thomas Auld took Douglass back from Hugh (\"[a]s a means of punishing Hugh,\" Douglass later wrote). Thomas Auld sent Douglass to work for [[Edward Covey]], a poor farmer who had a reputation as a \"slave-breaker\". He whipped Douglass regularly, and nearly broke him psychologically. The sixteen-year-old Douglass finally rebelled against the beatings, however, and fought back. After Douglass won a physical confrontation, Covey never tried to beat him again.<ref>Bowers, Jerome.

In 1836, he tried to escape from his new master Covey, but failed again. In 1837, Douglass met and fell in love with [[Anna Murray-Douglass|Anna Murray]], a [[Free people of color|free black]] woman in Baltimore about five years older than he. Her free status strengthened his belief in the possibility of gaining his own freedom. Murray encouraged him and supported his efforts by aid and money.<ref name=\"ThompsonConyers2010PA124\" />\n[[File:Anna Murray-Douglass (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Anna Murray-Douglass]], Douglass's wife for 44 years, portrait ca. 1860.]]\nOn September 3, 1838, Douglass successfully escaped by boarding a train from the newly merged [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]] (P.W.& B.) railroad line to the great Northern cities.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The area where he boarded was a short distance east of the previous temporary P.W.& B. train depot in a recently developed neighborhood between the modern neighborhoods of [[Harbor East]] and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]].

Although this placed him some 20 miles from the free state of Pennsylvania, it was easier to travel through Delaware, another slave state.

In 1841, Douglass first heard Garrison speak at a meeting of the Bristol Anti-Slavery Society. At another meeting, Douglass was unexpectedly invited to speak. After telling his story, Douglass was encouraged to become an anti-slavery lecturer. A few days later Douglass spoke at the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society's annual convention in [[Nantucket]].

At the time, some skeptics questioned whether a black man could have produced such an eloquent piece of literature. The book received generally positive reviews and became an immediate bestseller. Within three years, it had been reprinted nine times, with 11,000 copies circulating in the United States. It was also translated into French and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and published in Europe.\n\nDouglass published three versions of his autobiography during his lifetime (and revised the third of these), each time expanding on the previous one. The 1845 ''Narrative'' was his biggest seller, and probably allowed him to raise the funds to gain his legal freedom the following year, as discussed below. In 1855, Douglass published ''[[My Bondage and My Freedom]]''. In 1881, after the Civil War, Douglass published ''[[Life and Times of Frederick Douglass]]'', which he revised in 1892.\n\n===Travels to Ireland and Great Britain===\n[[File:Unidentified Artist - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project-restore.png|215px|thumb|Douglass in 1847, around 29 years of age]]\nDouglass' friends and mentors feared that the publicity would draw the attention of his ex-owner, Hugh Auld, who might try to get his \"property\" back.

He traveled in Ireland as the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] was beginning.\n\nThe feeling of freedom from American racial discrimination amazed Douglass:\n\n<blockquote>Eleven days and a half gone and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep.

This and Douglass's later abolitionist newspapers were mainly funded by English supporters, who gave Douglass five hundred pounds to use as he chose.<ref name=\"Ruuth\"/> Douglass also soon split with Garrison, perhaps because the ''North Star'' competed with Garrison's ''[[National Anti-Slavery Standard]]'' and Marius Robinson's ''Anti-Slavery Bugle''.\n\nDouglass also came to consider Garrison too radical. Earlier Douglass had agreed with Garrison's position that the Constitution was pro-slavery, because of its compromises related to apportionment of Congressional seats, based on partial counting of slave populations with state totals; and protection of the international slave trade through 1807. Garrison had burned copies of the Constitution to express his opinion. But, [[Lysander Spooner]] published ''[[The Unconstitutionality of Slavery]]'' (1846), which explored the [[United States Constitution]] as an anti-slavery document. Douglass's change of opinion about the Constitution and his splitting from Garrison around 1847 became one of the abolitionist movement's most notable divisions. Douglass angered Garrison by saying that the Constitution could and should be used as an instrument in the fight against slavery.<ref>Robert Fanuzzi, \"Frederick Douglass' 'Colored Newspaper': Identity Politics in Black and White,\" in ''The Black Press: New Literary and Historical Essays'', edited by Todd Vogel (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2001), pp. 65\u201369.</ref>\n\nIn September 1848, Douglass published an open letter addressed to his former master, Thomas Auld, berating him for his conduct, and enquiring after members of his family still held by Auld.<ref name=\"Finkelman2006-105\" /><ref name=\"Douglass1848\"/> In a graphic passage, Douglass asked Auld how he would feel if Douglass had come to take away his daughter Amanda as a slave, treating her the way he and members of his family had been treated by Auld.<ref name=\"Finkelman2006-105\">{{cite book|author=Paul Finkelman|title=Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619\u20131895: from the colonial period to the age of Frederick Douglass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-y0OAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=February 2, 2011|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=104\u201305|isbn=978-0-19-516777-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Douglass1848\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/02/i-am-your-fellow-man-but-not-your-slave.html|title=I am your fellow man, but not your slave |accessdate=March 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Women's rights===\nIn 1848, Douglass was the only African American to attend the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, in upstate New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/seneca_falls |title=Seneca Falls Convention |publisher=Virginia Memory |date=August 18, 1920 |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>Stanton, 1997, p. 85.</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] asked the assembly to pass a resolution asking for [[women's suffrage]].<ref>USConstitution.net.

Retrieved April 24, 2009.</ref>\n\nAlso in the wake of the Seneca Falls Convention, Douglass used an editorial spot in his paper, the North Star, to press the case for women's rights in this public venue. The article was two-fold: it recalled the \"marked ability and dignity\" of the proceedings and briefly conveyed several arguments of the convention and feminist thought at the time.\n\nOn the first count, Douglass acknowledged the \"decorum\" of the participants in the face of disagreement. The latter half discussed the primary document that emerged from the conference, a Declaration of Sentiments, and his own discussion of the \"infant\" feminist cause. Strikingly, he expressed the belief that \"[a] discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency ... than would be a discussion of the rights of women,\" and Douglass noted the link between abolitionism and feminism, the overlap between the communities.\n\nHis opinion as the prominent editor of the paper likely carried weight, and he stated the position of the North Star explicitly: \"[w]e hold woman to be justly entitled to all we claim for man.\" This letter, written a week after the convention, reaffirmed the first part of the paper's slogan, \"right is of no sex.\"\n\nLater, after the Civil War when the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]] to give freedmen and free blacks the right to vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass supported the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for [[universal suffrage]], and opposed any bill that split the issues.<ref name=\"DouglassO'Meally2003\"/> Douglass and Stanton both knew that there was not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.<ref name=\"Foner, p.600\">Foner, p.  600.</ref>\n\nDouglass thought such a strategy was too risky, that there was barely enough support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, would have the same degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote.<ref name=\"Foner, p.600\"/> Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTV8OsmDQPcC&pg=PA138 |page=138 |title=The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia |last=Watkins |first=Valetha |chapter=National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) |editor=Julius E.

This speech eventually became known as \"[[What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?]]\"; one biographer called it \"perhaps the greatest antislavery oration ever given.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=William S.

Chicago Review Press, 2000. pp. 260\u201371.</ref>\n\nLike many abolitionists, Douglass believed that education would be crucial for African Americans to improve their lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for school desegregation. In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.\n\n[[File:Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry - NARA - 559102.jpg|thumb|''Douglass argued against John Brown's plan to attack the arsenal at Harpers Ferry'', painting by [[Jacob Lawrence]]]]\n\nOn March 12, 1859, Douglass met with radical abolitionists [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[George DeBaptiste]], and others at William Webb's house in Detroit to discuss emancipation.<ref>Underground Railroad, US Department of Interior, National Park Service, Denver Service Center.

However, Douglass disapproved of Brown's plan to start an armed [[slave rebellion]] in [[Southern United States|the South]]. Douglass believed that attacking federal property would enrage the American public. After the raid, Douglass fled for a time to Canada, fearing guilt by association as well as arrest as a co-conspirator. Years later, Douglass shared a stage in Harpers Ferry with [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]], the prosecutor who secured Brown's conviction and execution.\n\nIn March 1860, while Douglass was once again traveling in England, his youngest daughter Annie died in [[Rochester, New York]]. Douglass sailed back from England the following month, traveling through Canada to avoid detection.\n\n====Photography====\nDouglass considered photography very important in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even in the hands of a racist white, as photographs were an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in [[blackface]] [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].

In time, he became interested in literacy; he began reading and copying bible verses, and he eventually converted to Christianity.<ref>Thomson, Conyers & Dawson (2009). ''The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO. pp. 34\u201335.</ref><ref>Finkelman, Paul. 2006. ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1619\u20131895: From the Colonial Period to the Age of Frederick Douglass Three-volume Set''. Oxford University Press. p. 129.</ref> He described this approach in his last biography, ''Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'':\n\n<blockquote>I was not more than thirteen years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners in the sight of God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.<br />I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to \"cast all my care upon God.\" This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.<ref>Douglass, Frederick (1882); ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass: From 1817\u20131882''. 3rd edition by John Lobb. Christian Age Office. p. 63.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDouglass was mentored by Rev. Charles Lawson, and, early in his activism, he often included biblical allusions and religious metaphors in his speeches. Although a believer, he strongly criticized religious hypocrisy<ref name=\"lib.rochester.edu\">[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=2945], University of Rochester Frederick Douglass Project. Retrieved on November 26, 2010.</ref> and accused slaveholders of ''[[wickedness]]'', lack of morality, and failure to follow the [[Golden Rule]]. In this sense, Douglass distinguished between the \"Christianity of Christ\" and the \"Christianity of America\" and considered religious slaveholders and clergymen who defended slavery as the most brutal, sinful, and cynical of all who represented \"wolves in sheep's clothing\".<ref>Finkelman, 2006. p. 129.</ref><ref>See his lecture: ''Love of God, Love of Man, Love of Country''. Delivered at Market Hall, New York City October 22, 1847.</ref>\n\nNotably, in a famous oration given in the Corinthian Hall of Rochester, he sharply criticized the attitude of religious people who kept silent about slavery, and held that religious ministers committed a ''[[blasphemy]]'' when they taught it as sanctioned by religion. He considered that a law passed to support slavery was \"one of the grossest infringements of Christian Liberty\" and said that pro-slavery clergymen within the American Church \"stripped the love of God of its beauty, and leave the throne of religion a huge, horrible, repulsive form\", and \"an abomination in the sight of God\". Of ministers like John Chase Lord, Leonard Elijah Lathrop, [[Ichabod Spencer]], and [[Orville Dewey]], he said that they taught, against the Scriptures, that \"we ought to obey man's law before the law of God\". He further asserted, \"in speaking of the American church, however, let it be distinctly understood that I mean the great mass of the religious organizations of our land. There are exceptions, and I thank God that there are. Noble men may be found, scattered all over these Northern States ... [[Henry Ward Beecher]] of Brooklyn, [[Samuel J. May]] of Syracuse, and my esteemed friend [Robert R. Raymonde]\". He maintained that \"upon these men lies the duty to inspire our ranks with high religious faith and zeal, and to cheer us on in the great mission of the slave's redemption from his chains\". In addition, he called religious people to embrace abolitionism, stating, \"let the religious press, the pulpit, the Sunday school, the conference meeting, the great ecclesiastical, missionary, Bible and tract associations of the land array their immense powers against slavery and slave-holding; and the whole system of crime and blood would be scattered to the winds.\"<ref name=\"lib.rochester.edu\"/>\n\nDuring his visits to the United Kingdom, between 1846 and 1848, Douglass asked British Christians never to support American Churches that permitted slavery,<ref>Thomson, Conyers & Dawson (2009). The Frederick Douglass Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. p. 2.</ref> and he expressed his happiness to know that a group of ministers in Belfast had refused to admit slaveholders as members of the Church.\n\nOn his return to the United States, Douglass founded the ''North Star'', a weekly publication with the motto \"Right is of no sex, Truth is of no color, God is the Father of us all, and we are all Brethren.\" Douglass later wrote a letter to his former slaveholder, in which he denounced him for leaving Douglass's family illiterate:\n\n{{quote|Your wickedness and cruelty committed in this respect on your fellow creatures, are greater than all the stripes you have laid upon my back or theirs.

In that speech, Douglass spoke frankly about Lincoln, noting what he perceived as both positive and negative attributes of the late President. Calling Lincoln \"the white man's president\", Douglass criticized Lincoln's tardiness in joining the cause of emancipation, noting that Lincoln initially opposed the expansion of slavery but did not support its elimination. But Douglass also asked, \"Can any colored man, or any white man friendly to the freedom of all men, ever forget the night which followed [[Emancipation Proclamation|the first day of January 1863]], when the world was to see if Abraham Lincoln would prove to be as good as his word?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=39 |title=Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln by Frederick Douglass|publisher=Teaching American History |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2008}}</ref> Douglass also said: \"Though Mr. Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow-countrymen against the Negro, it is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts he loathed and hated slavery ...\"\n\nThe crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a standing ovation. Lincoln's widow [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]] supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite [[walking-stick]] to Douglass in appreciation. That walking-stick still rests in Douglass's final residence, \"Cedar Hill\", now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].\n\n==Reconstruction era==\n[[File:George Kendall Warren - Frederick Douglass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|Frederick Douglass in 1876, around 58 years of age]]\n\nAfter the Civil War, Douglass continued to work for equality for African-Americans and women. Due to his prominence and activism during the war, Douglass received several political appointments. He served as president of the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Freedman's Savings Bank]].<ref>McFeely 1991, p. 283.</ref> Douglass also became charg\u00e9 d'affaires for the Dominican Republic, but resigned that position after two years because of disagreements with U.S. government policy.<ref>Atkins, G.

Armed insurgency took different forms. Powerful paramilitary groups included the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], both active during the 1870s in the Deep South. They operated as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\", turning out Republican officeholders and disrupting elections.<ref>George C.

They enforced this by a combination of violence, late 19th-century laws imposing [[racial segregation|segregation]] and a concerted effort to [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disfranchise]] African Americans. New labor and criminal laws also limited their freedom.<ref>Richard H.

Grant]] in [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868]]. In 1870, Douglass started his last newspaper, the ''New National Era'', attempting to hold his country to its commitment to equality.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> President Grant sent a Congressionally sponsored commission, accompanied by Douglass, on a mission to the West Indies to investigate if the annexation of Santo Domingo would be good for the United States. Grant believed annexation would help relieve the violent situation in the South allowing [[African Americans]] their own state. Douglass and the commission favored annexation, however, Congress remained opposed to annexation. Douglass criticized Senator [[Charles Sumner]], who opposed annexation, stating if Sumner continued to oppose annexation he would \"regard him as the worst foe the colored race has on this continent.\"<ref name=\"Brands 2012a\">Brands (2012), ''The Man Who Saved the Union Ulysses S Grant In War and Peace'', p. 462.</ref>\n\n[[File:2000-2008 17th Street, NW.JPG|thumb|left|Douglass' former residence in the [[U Street Corridor]] of Washington, D.C.

Grant used their provisions vigorously, suspending ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in South Carolina and sending troops there and into other states. Under his leadership over 5,000 arrests were made. Grant's vigor in disrupting the Klan made him unpopular among many whites, but earned Douglass's praise. An associate of Douglass wrote of Grant that African Americans \"will ever cherish a grateful remembrance of his name, fame and great services.\"\n\nIn 1872, Douglass became the first African American nominated for Vice President of the United States, as [[Victoria Woodhull]]'s running mate on the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] ticket.

Douglass had met Auld's daughter, Amanda Auld Sears, some years prior; she had requested the meeting and had subsequently attended and cheered one of Douglass' speeches. Her father complimented her for reaching out to Douglass. The visit also appears to have brought closure to Douglass, although some criticized his effort.<ref name=\"Finkelman2006-105\" />\n\nThat same year, Douglass bought the house that was to be the family's final home in Washington D.C., on a hill above the [[Anacostia River]]. He and Anna named it ''Cedar Hill'' (also spelled ''CedarHill''). They expanded the house from 14 to 21 rooms, and included a china closet. One year later, Douglass purchased adjoining lots and expanded the property to 15&nbsp;acres (61,000&nbsp;m\u00b2). The home is now preserved as the [[Frederick Douglass National Historic Site]].\n\nIn 1881, Douglass published the final edition of his autobiography, ''The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass''. That year he was appointed as [[Recorder of Deeds]] for the District of Columbia. His wife Anna Murray-Douglass died in 1882, leaving the widower devastated. After a period of mourning, Douglass found new meaning from working with activist [[Ida B. Wells]]. He remarried in 1884, as mentioned above.\n\nDouglass also continued his speaking engagements and travel, both in the United States and abroad. With his new wife, Helen, Douglass traveled to England, Ireland, France, Italy, Egypt and Greece from 1886 to 1887.

He spoke and wrote on behalf of a variety of reform causes: women's rights, temperance, peace, land reform, free public education, and the abolition of capital punishment. But he devoted the bulk of his time, immense talent, and boundless energy to ending slavery and gaining equal rights for African Americans. These were the central concerns of his long reform career. Douglass understood that the struggle for emancipation and equality demanded forceful, persistent, and unyielding agitation. And he recognized that African Americans must play a conspicuous role in that struggle. Less than a month before his death, when a young black man solicited his advice to an African American just starting out in the world, Douglass replied without hesitation: \"Agitate! Agitate! Agitate!<ref>Roy E. Finkenbine. [http://www.anb.org/articles/15/15-00186.html \"Douglass, Frederick\"], ''American National Biography Online'', 2000.

It has several subdisciplines, including [[aerodynamics]] (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moment]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[weather forecasting|predicting weather pattern]]s, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and [[Nuclear weapon design|modelling fission weapon detonation]],\n\nFluid dynamics offers a systematic structure\u2014which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]\u2014that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as functions of space and time.\n\nBefore the twentieth century, ''hydrodynamics'' was synonymous with fluid dynamics.  This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamic stability]], both of which can also be applied to gases.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics: A Discipline Between Science and Technology | first=Michael | last=Eckert | publisher=Wiley | year=2006 | isbn=3-527-40513-5 | page=ix }}</ref>\n\n==Equations of fluid dynamics==\nThe foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, specifically, [[conservation of mass]],  [[conservation of momentum|conservation of linear momentum]] (also known as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]), and [[conservation of energy]] (also known as [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]). These are based on [[classical mechanics]] and are modified in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]].  They are expressed using the [[Reynolds transport theorem]].\n\nIn addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the '''{{vanchor|continuum assumption}}'''. Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at [[infinitesimal]]ly small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.\n\nFor fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for [[Newtonian fluid]]s are the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\u2014which is a [[non-linear]] set of [[differential equations]] that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general [[Solution in closed form|closed-form solution]], so they are primarily of use in [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]].  The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve.  Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}\n\nIn addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the [[Ideal gas law|perfect gas equation of state]]:\n\n:<math>p= \\frac{\\rho R_u T}{M}</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is pressure, \u03c1 is density, ''T'' the absolute temperature, while ''R<sub>u</sub>'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''M'' is [[molar mass]] for a particular gas.\n\n\n===Conservation laws===\nThree conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in [[integral]] or [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a ''control volume''.  A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow.  The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume.  Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply [[Stokes' theorem]] to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow.\n\n*[[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Mass continuity]] (conservation of mass): The rate of change of fluid mass inside a control volume must be equal to the net rate of fluid flow into the volume.  Physically, this statement requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume,<ref name=\"J.D. Anderson 2007\">{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=J.

The third term on the right is the net acceleration of the mass within the volume due to any [[body force]]s (here represented by ''f''<sub>body</sub>). [[Surface force]]s, such as viscous forces, are represented by '''<math>\\mathbf{F}_\\text{surf}</math>''', the net force due to [[Stress (mechanics)|shear forces]] acting on the  volume surface. The momentum balance can also be written for a ''moving'' control volume.<ref>\n{{Cite journal \n|last1=Nangia\n|first1=Nishant \n|last2=Johansen \n|first2=Hans\n|last3=Patankar \n|first3=Neelesh A. \n|last4=Bhalla \n|first4=Amneet Pal S.\n|title=A moving control volume approach to computing hydrodynamic forces and torques on immersed bodies\n|journal=Journal of Computational Physics\n|volume=347\n|pages=437-462\n|year=2017\n|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2017.06.047|arxiv=1704.00239|bibcode=2017JCoPh.347..437N}}\n</ref>\n\n:The following is the differential form of the momentum conservation equation.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] requires that the dissipation term is always positive: viscosity cannot create energy within the control volume.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=F. M. |title=Viscous Fluid Flow |location=New York |publisher=McGraw\u2013Hill |year=1974 |isbn=0-07-069710-8 }}</ref> The expression on the left side is a [[material derivative]].\n\n===Compressible vs incompressible flow===\nAll fluids are [[compressibility|compressible]] to some extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an [[incompressible flow]]. Otherwise the more general [[compressible flow]] equations must be used.\n\nMathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density \u03c1 of a [[fluid parcel]] does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e.,\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\rho}{\\mathrm{D}t} = 0 \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''D''/''Dt'' is the [[material derivative]], which is the sum of [[time derivative|local]] and [[convective derivative]]s. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.\n\nFor flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the [[Mach number]] of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3.  For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes).  [[acoustics|Acoustic]] problems always require allowing compressibility, since [[sound waves]] are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.\n\n===Newtonian vs non-Newtonian fluids===\n[[File:Flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Flow around an [[airfoil]]]]\n\nAll fluids are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a [[strain (materials science)|strain rate]]; it has dimensions <math>T^{-1}</math>. [[Isaac Newton]] showed that for many familiar fluids such as [[water]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], the [[stress (physics)|stress]] due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluids]]. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.\n\n[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of [[rheology]] describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include [[emulsion]]s and [[slurries]], some [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] materials such as [[blood]] and some [[polymer]]s, and ''sticky liquids'' such as [[latex]], [[honey]] and [[lubricants]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Inviscid vs viscous vs Stokes flow===\n\nThe dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of [[Newton's second law]]. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.\n\nThe [[Reynolds number]] is a [[dimensionless quantity]] which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (''Re''<<1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called [[Stokes flow|Stokes or creeping flow]].\n\nIn contrast, high Reynolds numbers (''Re''>>1) indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an [[inviscid flow]], an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] to be simplified into the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields [[Bernoulli's equation]]. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is [[Lamellar field|irrotational]] everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called [[potential flow]]s, because the velocity field may be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a potential energy expression.\n\nThis idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the [[no-slip condition]] generates a thin region of large strain rate, the [[boundary layer]], in which [[viscosity]] effects dominate and which thus generates [[vorticity]]. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict [[Drag (physics)|drag forces]], a limitation known as the [[d'Alembert's paradox]].\n\nA commonly used{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} model, especially in [[computational fluid dynamics]], is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and [[boundary layer]] equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]].\n\n==={{Anchor|Steady vs unsteady flow}} Steady vs unsteady flow===<!-- [[Steady flow]] redirects here -->\n\n[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|thumb|320px|Hydrodynamics simulation of the [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability]] <ref>Shengtai Li, Hui Li \"Parallel AMR Code for Compressible MHD or HD Equations\" (Los Alamos National Laboratory) [http://math.lanl.gov/Research/Highlights/amrmhd.shtml]</ref> ]]\nA flow that is not a function of time is called '''steady flow'''. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient<ref>[http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/main/118306-transient-state-unsteady-state.html Transient state or unsteady state?]</ref>). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a [[sphere]] is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.\n\n[[Turbulence|Turbulent]] flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be [[stationary process|statistically stationary]].  According to Pope:<ref>See Pope (2000), page 75.</ref>\n{{quote|\nThe random field ''U''(''x'',''t'') is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time.\n}}\nThis roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean [[Field (physics)|field]] is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.\n\nSteady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.\n\n===Laminar vs turbulent flow===\nTurbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], and apparent [[random]]ness.  Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called [[laminar flow|laminar]]. The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow\u2014these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well.  Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a [[Reynolds decomposition]], in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an [[average]] component and a perturbation component.\n\nIt is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. [[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.<ref>See, for example, Schlatter et al, Phys. Fluids 21, 051702 (2009); {{doi|10.1063/1.3139294}}</ref>\n\nMost flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option,<ref>See Pope (2000), page 344.</ref> given the state of computational power for the next few decades.  Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human (L > 3 m), moving faster than  20&nbsp;m/s (72&nbsp;km/h) is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation (Re = 4 million).  Transport aircraft wings (such as on an [[Airbus A300]] or [[Boeing 747]]) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord dimension).  Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. [[Reynolds-averaged Navier\u2013Stokes equations]] (RANS) combined with [[turbulence modelling]] provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the [[Reynolds stresses]], although the turbulence also enhances the [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]]. Another promising methodology is [[large eddy simulation]] (LES), especially in the guise of [[detached eddy simulation]] (DES)\u2014which is a combination of RANS turbulence modelling and large eddy simulation.\n\n===Subsonic vs transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows===\nWhile many flows (e.g. flow of water through a pipe) occur at low [[Mach number]]s, many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in [[Turbomachinery|turbomachines]] occur at high fractions of M=1 ([[Transonic|transonic flows]]) or in excess of it ([[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or even [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic flows]]). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.\n\n===Reactive vs non-reactive flows===\nReactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas such as [[combustion]]([[Internal Combustion Engine|IC engine]]), [[propulsion]] devices ([[Rockets]], [[jet engines]] etc.), [[detonations]], fire and safety hazards, astrophysics etc. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of [[methane]] in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of [[chemical kinetics]].\n\n===Magnetohydrodynamics===\n{{main|Magnetohydrodynamics}}\n[[Magnetohydrodynamics]] is the multi-disciplinary study of the flow of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] fluids in [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields. Examples of such fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, liquid metals, and [[Saline water|salt water]]. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism.\n\n===Relativistic fluid dynamics===\nRelativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the [[velocity of light]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Landau |first=Lev Davidovich |first2=Evgenii Mikhailovich |last2=Lifshitz |title=Fluid Mechanics |location=London |publisher=Pergamon |year=1987 |isbn=0-08-033933-6 }}</ref> This branch of fluid dynamics accounts the relativistic effects both from the [[special theory of relativity]] and the [[general theory of relativity]]. The governing equations are derived in [[Riemannian geometry]] for [[Minkowski spacetime]].\n\n===Other approximations===\nThere are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.\n* The ''[[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]'' neglects variations in density except to calculate [[buoyancy]] forces. It is often used in free [[convection]] problems where density changes are small.\n* ''[[Lubrication theory]]'' and ''[[Hele\u2013Shaw flow]]'' exploits the large [[aspect ratio]] of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.\n* ''[[Slender-body theory]]'' is a methodology used in [[Stokes flow]] problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.\n* The ''[[shallow-water equations]]'' can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a [[free surface]], in which surface [[slope|gradients]] are small.\n* ''[[Darcy's law]]'' is used for flow in [[porous medium|porous media]], and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.\n* In rotating systems, the ''[[quasi-geostrophic equations]]'' assume an almost [[Balanced flow#Geostrophic flow|perfect balance]] between [[pressure gradient]]s and the [[Coriolis force]]. It is useful in the study of [[atmospheric dynamics]].\n\n== Terminology in fluid dynamics ==\nThe concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics.  A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not.  Pressure can be [[Pressure measurement|measured]] using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.\n\nSome of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study.  In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in [[fluid statics]].\n\n=== Terminology in incompressible fluid dynamics ===\nThe concepts of total pressure and [[dynamic pressure]] arise from [[Bernoulli's equation]] and are significant in the study of all fluid flows.  (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense\u2014they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.)  To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term [[static pressure]] to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure.  [[Static pressure]] is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.\n\nA point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (i.e. speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance.  It is of such importance that it is given a special name\u2014a [[stagnation point]].  The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name\u2014[[stagnation pressure]].  In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.\n\n=== Terminology in compressible fluid dynamics ===\nIn a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (e.g. total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound).  These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.\n\nTo avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix \"static\" is commonly used (e.g. static temperature, static enthalpy).  Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (i.e. \"density\" and \"static density\" mean the same thing).  The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.\n\nBecause the total flow conditions are defined by [[isentropic]]ally bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition.  As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply \"entropy\".\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Fields of study ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Acoustic theory]]\n*[[Aerodynamics]]\n*[[Aeroelasticity]]\n*[[Aeronautics]]\n*[[Computational fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Flow measurement]]\n*[[Geophysical fluid dynamics]]\n*[[haemodynamics|Hemodynamics]]\n*[[Hydraulics]]\n*[[Hydrology]]\n*[[Hydrostatics]]\n*[[Electrohydrodynamics]]\n*[[Magnetohydrodynamics]]\n*[[Metafluid dynamics]]\n*[[Quantum hydrodynamics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Mathematical equations and concepts===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Airy wave theory]]\n*[[Benjamin\u2013Bona\u2013Mahony equation]]\n*[[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)]]\n*[[Different types of boundary conditions in fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Helmholtz's theorems]]\n*[[Kirchhoff equations]]\n*[[Knudsen equation]]\n*[[Manning equation]]\n*[[Mild-slope equation]]\n*[[Morison equation]]\n*[[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]\n*[[Oseen flow]]\n*[[Poiseuille's law]]\n*[[Pressure head]]\n*[[Relativistic Euler equations]]\n*[[Stokes stream function]]\n*[[Stream function]]\n*[[Streamlines, streaklines and pathlines]]\n*[[Torricelli's Law]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Types of fluid flow ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Aerodynamic force]]\n*[[Cavitation]]\n*[[Compressible flow]]\n*[[Couette flow]]\n*[[Free molecular flow]]\n*[[Incompressible flow]]\n*[[Inviscid flow]]\n*[[Isothermal flow]]\n*[[Open channel flow]]\n*[[Pipe flow]]\n*[[Secondary flow]]\n*[[Stream thrust averaging]]\n*[[Superfluidity]]\n*[[Transient flow]]\n*[[Two-phase flow]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Fluid properties ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[List of hydrodynamic instabilities]]\n*[[Newtonian fluid]]\n*[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]\n*[[Surface tension]]\n*[[Vapour pressure]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Fluid phenomena===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Boundary layer]]\n*[[Coanda effect]]\n*[[Convection cell]]\n*[[squeeze mapping#Corner flow|Convergence/Bifurcation]]\n*[[Darwin drift]]\n*[[Drag (force)]]\n*[[Hydrodynamic stability]]\n*[[Kaye effect]]\n*[[Lift (force)]]\n*[[Magnus effect]]\n*[[Ocean surface waves]]\n*[[Rossby wave]]\n*[[Shock wave]]\n*[[Soliton]]\n*[[Stokes drift]]\n*[[Fluid thread breakup|Thread breakup]]\n*[[Turbulent jet breakup]]\n*[[Upstream contamination]]\n*[[Venturi effect]]\n*[[Vortex]]\n*[[Water hammer]]\n*[[Wave drag]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Applications===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Acoustics]]\n*[[Aerodynamics]]\n*[[Cryosphere science]]\n*[[Fluid power]]\n*[[Geodynamics]]\n*[[Hydraulic machinery]]\n*[[Meteorology]]\n*[[Naval architecture]]\n*[[Oceanography]]\n*[[Plasma physics]]\n*[[Pneumatics]]\n*[[3D computer graphics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Fluid dynamics journals ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* ''[[Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics]]''\n* ''[[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]]''\n* ''[[Physics of Fluids]]''\n* ''[[Experiments in Fluids]]''\n* ''European Journal of Mechanics B:  Fluids''\n* ''Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics''\n* ''Computers and Fluids''\n* ''[[International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids]]''\n* ''[[Flow, Turbulence and Combustion]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[List of publications in physics#Fluid dynamics|Important publications in fluid dynamics]]\n*[[Isosurface]]\n*[[Keulegan\u2013Carpenter number]]\n*[[Rotating tank]]\n*[[Sound barrier]]\n*[[Beta plane]]\n*[[Immersed boundary method]]\n*[[Bridge scour]]\n*[[Finite volume method for unsteady flow]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== See also ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aileron]]\n* [[Airplane]]\n* [[Angle of attack]]\n* [[Banked turn]]\n* [[Bernoulli's principle]]\n* [[Bilgeboard]]\n* [[Boomerang]]\n* [[Centerboard]]\n* [[Chord (aircraft)]]\n* [[Circulation control wing]]\n* [[Diving plane]]\n* [[Downforce]]\n* [[Drag coefficient]]\n* [[Fin]]\n* [[Flipper (anatomy)]]\n* [[Flow separation]]\n* [[Foil (fluid mechanics)]]\n* [[Fluid coupling]]\n* [[Gas kinetics]]\n* [[Hydrofoil]]\n* [[Keel]] (hydrodynamic)\n* [[K\u00fcssner effect]]\n* [[Kutta condition]]\n* [[Kutta\u2013Joukowski theorem]]\n* [[Lift coefficient]]\n* [[Lift-induced drag]]\n* [[Lift-to-drag ratio]]\n* [[Lifting-line theory]]\n* [[NACA airfoil]]\n* [[Newton's third law]]\n* [[Propeller]]\n* [[Pump]]\n* [[Rudder]]\n* [[Sail]] (aerodynamics)\n* [[Skeg]]\n* [[Spoiler (automotive)]]\n* [[Stall (flight)]]\n* [[Surfboard fin]]\n* [[Surface science]]\n* [[Torque converter]]\n* [[Trim tab]]\n* [[Wing]]\n* [[Wingtip vortices]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Acheson|first=D.

Cavitation is more likely to occur near the surface of the ocean, where the ambient water pressure is relatively low.

Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.<ref name=hurts/>\n\n[[Scombrid]] fishes (tuna, mackerel and bonito) are particularly high-performance swimmers. Along the margin at the rear of their bodies is a line of small rayless, non-retractable fins, known as [[finlet]]s. There has been much speculation about the function  of these finlets. Research done in 2000 and 2001 by Nauen and Lauder indicated that \"the finlets have a hydrodynamic effect on local flow during steady swimming\" and that \"the most posterior finlet is oriented to redirect flow into the developing tail vortex, which may increase thrust produced by the tail of swimming mackerel\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2001a | title = Locomotion in scombrid fishes: visualization of flow around the caudal peduncle and finlets of the Chub mackerel ''Scomber japonicus'' | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/13/2251.long | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 204 | issue = 13| pages = 2251\u201363 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2001b | title = Three-dimensional analysis of finlet kinematics in the Chub mackerel ''(Scomber japonicus)'' | url = http://www.biolbull.org/content/200/1/9.full | journal = The Biological Bulletin | volume = 200 | issue = 1| pages = 9\u201319 | doi=10.2307/1543081| pmid = 11249216 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nauen | first1 = JC | last2 = Lauder | first2 = GV | year = 2000 | title = Locomotion in scombrid fishes: morphology and kinematics of the finlets of the Chub mackerel ''Scomber japonicus'' | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/15/2247.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 203 | issue = 15| pages = 2247\u201359 }}</ref>\n\nFish use multiple fins, so it is possible that a given fin can have a hydrodynamic interaction with another fin. In particular, the fins immediately upstream of the caudal (tail) fin may be proximate fins that can directly affect the flow dynamics at the caudal fin.

Fin-like structure which occur in other contexts are can be referred to by other terms, such as flipper, foil, wing, flap, keel sail or blade.\n\nThe term ''wing'' refers to the large fin-like structure that produce lift, particularly in air, such as the main wings of an airplane or bird.\n\nThe term ''wing'' often refers to larger fin-like structure that produce lift, particularly in air, such as the main wings of an airplane or bird. Smaller foil-like appendages not used primarily for lift, are still referred to as''fins'', such as ''tail fins''.

Robotic fish also allow researchers to vary a single parameter, such as flexibility or  a specific motion control. Researchers can directly measure forces, which is not easy to do in live fish. \"Robotic devices also facilitate three-dimensional kinematic studies and correlated hydrodynamic analyses, as the location of the locomotor surface can be known accurately.

He was, like his father, fortunate in friends and in good seasons. Frey built a great temple at Upsal, made it his chief seat, and gave it all his taxes, his land, and goods.  Then began the [[Uppsala \u00f6d|Upsal domains]], which have remained ever since. Then began in his days the [[Frode]]-peace; and then there were good seasons, in all the land, which the Swedes ascribed to Frey, so that he was more worshipped than the other gods, as the people became much richer in his days by reason of the peace and good seasons. His wife was called Gerd, daughter of [[Gymir|Gymis]], and their son was called [[Fj\u00f6lnir|Fjolne]]. Frey was called by another name, [[Yngvi|Yngve]]; and this name Yngve was considered long after in his race as a name of honour, so that his descendants have since been called [[Yngling]]er. Frey fell into a sickness; and as his illness took the upper hand, his men took the plan of letting few approach him. In the meantime they raised a great [[tumulus|mound]], in which they placed a door with three holes in it. Now when Frey died they bore him secretly into the mound, but told the Swedes he was alive; and they kept watch over him for three years. They brought all the taxes into the mound, and through the one hole they put in the gold, through the other the silver, and through the third the copper money that was paid. Peace and good seasons continued.

Freyr's role as a fertility god needed a female counterpart in a divine couple (McKinnell's translation 1987<ref>[http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/3search.pdf Heinrichs, Anne: ''The Search for Identity: A Problem after the Conversion'', in ''alv\u00edssm\u00e1l 3''. pp.54-55.]</ref>):\n\n{{quote|Great heathen sacrifices were held there at that time, and for a long while Frey had been the god who was worshipped most there \u2014 and so much power had been gained by Frey\u2019s statue that the devil used to speak to people out of the mouth of the idol, and a young and beautiful woman had been obtained to serve Frey. It was the faith of the local people that Frey was alive, as seemed to some extent to be the case, and they thought he would need to have a sexual relationship with his wife; along with Frey she was to have complete control over the temple settlement and all that belonged to it.}}\n\nIn this short story, a man named Gunnar was suspected of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar if he had not promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of [[Olaf Tryggvason]].\n\n==Other Icelandic sources==\nWorship of Freyr is alluded to in several [[Icelanders' sagas]].\n\nThe protagonist of ''[[Hrafnkels saga]]'' is a [[go\u00f0i|priest]] of Freyr. He dedicates a horse to the god and kills a man for riding it, setting in motion a chain of fateful events.\n\nIn ''[[G\u00edsla saga]]'' a chieftain named \u00deorgr\u00edmr Freysgo\u00f0i is an ardent worshipper of Freyr. When he dies he is buried in a [[Tumulus|howe]].\n\n{|\n|\n''Var\u00f0 og s\u00e1 hlutur einn er n\u00fdn\u00e6mum \u00fe\u00f3tti gegna a\u00f0 aldrei festi sn\u00e6 utan og sunnan \u00e1 haugi \u00deorgr\u00edms og eigi fraus; og g\u00e1tu menn \u00feess til a\u00f0 hann myndi Frey svo \u00e1var\u00f0ur fyrir bl\u00f3tin a\u00f0 hann myndi eigi vilja a\u00f0 freri \u00e1 milli \u00feeirra.''<ref>[http://snerpa.is/net/isl/gisl.htm G\u00edsla saga S\u00farssonar<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref>\n|\nAnd now, too, a thing happened which seemed strange and new.

''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'' includes a heathen oath to be sworn at an assembly where Freyr, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and \"[[alm\u00e1ttki \u00e1ss|the almighty ''\u00e1ss'']]\" are invoked. ''[[Hervarar saga]]'' mentions a [[Yule]]tide sacrifice of a boar to Freyr.\n\n==''Gesta Danorum''==\nThe 12th Century Danish ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' describes Freyr, under the name '''Fr\u00f8''', as the \"viceroy of the gods\".\n\n{|\n| style=\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\" |\nFr\u00f8 quoque deorum satrapa sedem haud procul Upsala cepit, ubi veterem litationis morem tot gentibus ac saeculis usurpatum tristi infandoque piaculo mutavit.

He delivered abominable offerings to the powers above by instituting the slaughter of human victims. ''Gesta Danorum'' 3, Fisher's translation\n|\n|}\n\nThat Freyr had a [[Cult (religion)|cult]] at Uppsala is well confirmed from other sources. The reference to the change in sacrificial ritual may also reflect some historical memory. There is archaeological evidence for an increase in [[human sacrifice]]s in the late [[Viking Age]]<ref>Davidson 1999, Vol. II, p. 55.</ref> though among the Norse gods human sacrifice is most often linked to Odin. Another reference to Fr\u00f8 and sacrifices is found earlier in the work, where the beginning of an annual ''[[bl\u00f3t]]'' to him is related. King [[Hadingus]] is cursed after killing a divine being and atones for his crime with a sacrifice.\n\n{|\n|\nSiquidem propitiandorum numinum gratia Fr\u00f8 deo rem divinam furvis hostiis fecit. Quem litationis morem annuo feriarum circuitu repetitum posteris imitandum reliquit. Fr\u00f8blot Sueones vocant. ''Gesta Danorum'' 1, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/1/8/index.htm Olrik's edition]\n|\n[I]n order to mollify the divinities he did indeed make a holy sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to the god Fr\u00f8. He repeated this mode of propitiation at an annual festival and left it to be imitated by his descendants. The Swedes call it Fr\u00f8blot. ''Gesta Danorum'' 1, Fisher's translation\n|\n|}\n\nThe sacrifice of dark-coloured victims to Freyr has a parallel in [[Ancient Greek religion]] where the [[chthonic]] fertility deities preferred dark-coloured victims to white ones.\n\nIn book 9, Saxo identifies Fr\u00f8 as the \"king of Sweden\" (''rex Suetiae''):\n\n{|\n|\nQuo tempore rex Suetiae Fr\u00f8, interfecto Norvagiensium rege Sywardo, coniuges necessariorum eius prostibulo relegatas publice constuprandas exhibuit. ''Gesta Danorum'' 9, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/9/4/index.htm Olrik's edition]\n|\nAbout this time the Swedish ruler Fr\u00f8, after killing Sivard, king of the Norwegians, removed the wives of Sivard's relatives to a brothel and exposed them to public prostitution. ''Gesta Danorum'' 9, Fisher's translation\n|\n|}\n\nThe reference to public prostitution may be a memory of fertility cult practices. Such a memory may also be the source of a description in book 6 of the stay of [[Starcatherus]], a follower of Odin, in Sweden.\n\n{|\n|\nMortuo autem Bemono, Starcatherus ab athletis Biarmensibus ob virtutem accitus, cum plurima apud eos memoratu digna edidisset facinora, Sueonum fines ingreditur. Ubi cum filiis Fr\u00f8 septennio feriatus ab his tandem ad Haconem Daniae tyrannum se contulit, quod apud Upsalam sacrificiorum tempore constitutus effeminatos corporum motus scaenicosque mimorum plausus ac mollia nolarum crepitacula fastidiret. Unde patet, quam remotum a lascivia animum habuerit, qui ne eius quidem spectator esse sustinuit. Adeo virtus luxui resistit. ''Gesta Danorum'' 6, [http://www.kb.dk/elib/lit/dan/saxo/lat/or.dsr/6/5/index.htm Olrik's edition]\n|\nAfter Bemoni's death Starkather, because of his valour, was summoned by the Biarmian champions and there performed many feats worthy of the tellings. Then he entered Swedish territory where he spent seven years in a leisurely stay with the sons of Fr\u00f8, after which he departed to join Haki, the lord of Denmark, for, living at Uppsala in the period of sacrifices, he had become disgusted with the womanish body movements, the clatter of actors on the stage and the soft tinkling of bells. It is obvious how far his heart was removed from frivolity if he could not even bear to watch these occasions. A manly individual is resistant to wantonness. ''Gesta Danorum'' 6, Fisher's translation\n|\n|}\n\n==Yngvi==\n{{main|Yngvi}}\nA strophe of the Anglo-Saxon [[rune poem]] (c. 1100) records that:\n\n:''Ing was first among the [[East Dane]]s seen by men''\n\nThis may refer to the origins of the worship of '''[[Ingui]]''' in the tribal areas that [[Tacitus]] mentions in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' as being populated by the Inguieonnic tribes. A later Danish chronicler lists Ingui was one of three brothers that the Danish tribes descended from. The strophe also states that \"then he (Ingui) went back over the waves, his wagon behind him\" which could connect Ingui to earlier conceptions of the wagon processions of [[Nerthus]] and the later Scandinavian conceptions of Freyr's wagon journeys.\n\nIngui is mentioned also in some later Anglo-Saxon literature under varying forms of his name, such as \"For what doth Ingeld have to do with Christ\" and the variants used in [[Beowulf]] to designate the kings as 'leader of the friends of Ing'. The compound Ingui-Frea (OE) and Yngvi-Freyr (ON) likely refer to the connection between the god and the [[Germanic king]]s' role as priests during the sacrifices in the pagan period, as ''Frea'' and ''Freyr'' are titles meaning 'Lord'.\n\nThe Swedish royal dynasty was known as the [[Yngling]]s from their descent from Yngvi-Freyr. This is supported by Tacitus, who wrote about the Germans: \"In their ancient songs, their only way of remembering or recording the past they celebrate an earth-born god [[Tuisco]], and his son [[Mannus]], as the origin of their race, as their founders. To Mannus they assign three sons, from whose names, they say, the coast tribes are called [[Ingaevones]]; those of the interior, [[Herminones]]; all the rest, [[Istaevones]]\".\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===R\u00e4llinge statuette===\nIn 1904, a [[Viking Age]] statuette identified as a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm R\u00e4llinge in [[Lunda, S\u00f6dermanland]] parish in the province of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. He is wearing a pointed cap and stroking his triangular beard. The statue is 9 centimeters tall and is displayed at the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]].<ref name=\"NATANTSTAT\">Swedish Museum of National Antiquities inventory number 14232.

(1999). ''From Pagan to Christian: The Story in the 12th-Century Tapestry of the Skog Church''. Published online: http://faculty.washington.edu/leiren/vikings2.html</ref> but also as the three Scandinavian holy kings [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute]], [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf]]. The figures coincide with 11th century descriptions of statue arrangements recorded by Adam of Bremen at the Temple at Uppsala and written accounts of the gods during the late Viking Age. The tapestry is originally from [[H\u00e4lsingland]], Sweden but is now housed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.\n\n===Gullgubber===\n{{main|Gullgubber}}\nSmall pieces of gold foil featuring engravings dating from the [[Migration Period]] into the early [[Viking Age]] (known as ''[[gullgubber]]'') have been discovered in various locations in [[Scandinavia]], at one site almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely on the sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] says that it has been suggested that the figures are taking part in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the [[Vanir]] group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''; the coming together of Ger\u00f0r and Freyr.<ref name=\"DAVIDSON121\">Davidson (1988:121).</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Guldgubbe.jpg|thumb|\nImage:Three kings or three gods.jpg|The Skog Church Tapestry portion possibly depicting Odin, Thor and Freyr\nFile:Goldgubb.jpg|An example of the small gold pieces of foil that may depict Ger\u00f0r and Freyr\n</gallery>\n\n==Toponyms==\n[[Norway]]\n* ''Freysakr'' (\"Freyr's field\") - name of two old farms in [[Gol, Norway|Gol]] and [[Torpa, Norway|Torpa]].\n* ''Freyshof'' (\"Freyr's temple\") - name of two old farms in [[Hole, Norway|Hole]] and [[Tr\u00f8gstad]].\n* ''Freysland'' (\"Freyr's land/field\") - name of six old farms in [[Feda]], [[Halse, Norway|Halse]], [[F\u00f8rde]], [[Sogndal]], [[S\u00f8gne]] and [[Torpa, Norway|Torpa]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n* ''Freysl\u00ed\u00f0'' (\"Freyr's hill\") - name of two old farms in [[Lunner]] and [[Torpa, Norway|Torpa]].\n* ''Freysnes'' (\"Freyr's headland\") - name of an old farm in [[Sandnes]].\n* ''Freyssetr'' (\"Freyr's farm\") - name of two old farms in [[Masfjorden]] and [[Soknedal (municipality)|Soknedal]].\n* ''Freyssteinn'' (\"Freyr's stone\") - name of an old farm in [[Lista]].\n* ''Freysteigr'' (\"Freyr's field\") - name of an old farm in [[Ramnes]].\n* ''[[Fresvik|Freysv\u00edk]]'' (\"Freyr's inlet/bay\") - name of two old farms in [[Fresvik]] and [[Ullensvang]].\n* ''Freysvin'' (\"Freyr's meadow\") - name of four old farms in [[Hole, Norway|Hole]], [[Lom, Norway|Lom]], [[Sunnylven]] and [[\u00d8stre Gausdal]].\n* ''Freysv\u01ebllr'' (\"Freyr's field\") - name of an old farm in [[S\u00f8r-Odal]].\n* ''Freys\u00feveit'' (\"Freyr's thwaite\") - name of an old farm in [[Hedrum]].\n[[Sweden]]\n* ''Fr\u00f6slunda'' (\"Freyr's grove\") - [[Uppland]]\n* ''Fr\u00f6s\u00e5ker'' (\"Freyr's field\") - [[Uppland]]\n* ''[[Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n]]'' (\"Freyr's island\") - [[J\u00e4mtland]]\n* ''Fr\u00f6seke'' (\"Freyr's oak forest\") - [[Sm\u00e5land]]\n* ''Fr\u00f6sve'' (\"Freyr's sanctuary\") - [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]]\n* ''[[Fr\u00f6sakull]]'' (\"Freyr's hill\") \u2013 [[Halland]] \n[[Denmark]]\n* ''[[Fr\u00f8s Herred]]'' (\"Freyr's Hundred\") - [[Southern Jutland]]\n[[Netherlands]]\n* ''Franeker'' (\"Freyr's field\") - [[Friesland]]\n[[Belgium]]\n* ''Castel de Fre\u00ffr'' (\"Castle of Fre\u00ffr\") - [[Dinant]]\n* '' Rochers de Fre\u00ffr'' - local well known rockclimbing area\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Freyr}}\n* [[List of Germanic deities]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}* [[Adam of Bremen]] (edited by G.

Freyja is the owner of the necklace [[Br\u00edsingamen]], rides a chariot pulled by two cats, is accompanied by the boar [[Hildisv\u00edni]], and possesses a cloak of [[falcon]] feathers. By her husband [[\u00d3\u00f0r]], she is the mother of two daughters, [[Hnoss]] and [[Gersemi]]. Along with her brother [[Freyr]], her father [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]], and her mother ([[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister]], unnamed in sources), she is a member of the [[Vanir]]. Stemming from Old Norse ''Freyja'', modern forms of the name include '''Freya''', '''Freyia''', and '''Freja'''.\n\nFreyja rules over her heavenly field [[F\u00f3lkvangr]] and there receives half of those that die in battle, whereas the other half go to the god [[Odin]]'s hall, [[Valhalla]]. Within F\u00f3lkvangr lies her hall, [[Sessr\u00famnir]]. Freyja assists other deities by allowing them to use her feathered cloak, is invoked in matters of fertility and love, and is frequently sought after by powerful [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]] who wish to make her their wife. Freyja's husband, the god \u00d3\u00f0r, is frequently absent. She cries tears of red gold for him, and searches for him under assumed names. Freyja has numerous names, including ''Gefn'', ''H\u00f6rn'', ''Mard\u00f6ll'', ''S\u00fdr'', ''Valfreyja'', and ''Vanad\u00eds''.\n\nFreyja is attested in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', composed by [[Snorri Sturluson]] in the 13th century; in several [[Sagas of Icelanders]]; in the short story \"''[[S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''{{-\"}}; in the poetry of [[skald]]s; and into the modern age in [[Scandinavian folklore]].\n\nScholars have debated whether Freyja and the goddess [[Frigg]] ultimately stem from a single goddess common among the [[Germanic peoples]]; connected her to the [[valkyrie]]s, female battlefield choosers of the slain; and analyzed her relation to other goddesses and figures in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]], including the thrice-burnt and thrice-reborn [[Gullveig|Gullveig/Hei\u00f0r]], the goddesses [[Gefjon]], [[Ska\u00f0i]], [[\u00deorger\u00f0r H\u00f6lgabr\u00fa\u00f0r and Irpa]], [[Mengl\u00f6\u00f0]], and the 1st century CE [[\"Isis\" of the Suebi]]. Freyja's name appears in numerous place names in Scandinavia, with a high concentration in southern [[Sweden]]. Various plants in Scandinavia once bore her name, but it was replaced with the name of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] during the process of [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianization]]. Rural Scandinavians continued to acknowledge Freyja as a supernatural figure into the 19th century, and Freyja has inspired various works of art.\n\n==Etymology and names==\nThe name ''Freyja'' transparently means (the) 'lady' and ultimately derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Fraujaz|fraw(j)\u014dn]]''. ''Freyja'' is [[cognate]] with, for example, [[Old Saxon]] ''fr\u016ba'' \"lady, mistress\" and [[Old High German]] ''frouwa'' (compare modern German ''Frau'' \"lady\").<ref name=\"OREL-2003-112\">Orel (2003:112).</ref> The [[theonym]] ''Freyja'' is thus considered to have been an [[epitheton|epithet]] in origin, replacing a personal name that is now unattested.<ref name=\"GRUNDY-1998-55\">Grundy (1998:55-56).</ref> As a result, either the original name became entirely [[word taboo|taboo]] or another process occurred in which the goddess is a duplicate or hypostasis of another known goddess (see \"Relation to Frigg and other goddesses and figures\" below).\n\nIn addition to ''Freyja'', Old Norse sources refer to the goddess by way of the following names:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; width: 100%\"\n!Name ([[Old Norse]])\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Name meaning\n!Attestations\n!Notes\n|-\n|Gefn\n|'the giver'<ref name=\"ORCHARD48\">Orchard (1997:48).</ref>\n|''[[Gylfaginning]]'', ''[[Nafna\u00feulur]]''\n|The name ''Gefn'' likely means \"she who gives (prosperity or happiness) and is generally considered connected to the goddess name ''[[Gefjon]]'', but the etymology of the name ''Gefjon'' has been a matter of dispute.

The stanza recounts that Freyja was once promised to an unnamed builder, later revealed to be a [[j\u00f6tunn]] and subsequently killed by [[Thor]] (recounted in detail in ''Gylfaginning'' chapter 42; see ''Prose Edda'' section below).{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=7}} In the poem ''[[Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l]]'', Odin (disguised as ''[[List of names of Odin|Gr\u00edmnir]]'') tells the young [[Agnarr Geirr\u00f6\u00f0sson|Agnar]] that every day Freyja allots seats to half of those that are slain in her hall [[F\u00f3lkvangr]], while Odin owns the other half.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=53}}\n\n[[File:Lokasenna by Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|Freyja and Loki [[Flyting|flyte]] in an illustration (1895) by Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]\nIn the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where Loki accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between [[Loki]] and Freyja. The introduction to the poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by [[\u00c6gir]]. In verse, after Loki has [[Flyting|flyted]] with the goddess [[Frigg]], Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the [[wyrd|fate of everyone]], though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that he knows all about her&mdash;that Freyja is not lacking in blame, for each of the gods and [[elf|elves]] in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r interjects&mdash;he says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84,90}}\n\nThe poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' features Loki borrowing Freyja's cloak of feathers and Thor dressing up as Freyja to fool the lusty [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[\u00derymr]]. In the poem, Thor wakes up to find that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor tells Loki of his missing hammer, and the two go to the beautiful court of Freyja. Thor asks Freyja if she will lend him her cloak of feathers, so that he may try to find his hammer. Freyja agrees:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>[[Benjamin Thorpe]] translation:</small>\n:\"That I would give thee, although of gold it were,\n:and trust it to thee, though it were of silver.\"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1866|p=62}}\n|\n:<small>[[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Henry Adams Bellows]] translation:</small>\n:\"Thine should it be though it of silver bright,\n:And I would give it though 'twere of gold.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1923|p=175}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|While Freyja's cats look on, the god [[Thor]] is unhappily dressed as Freyja in ''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nLoki flies away in the whirring feather cloak, arriving in the land of [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. He spies [[\u00derymr]] sitting on top of a [[tumulus|mound]]. \u00derymr reveals that he has hidden Thor's hammer deep within the earth and that no one will ever know where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of \u00derymr's conditions.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nThe two go to see the beautiful Freyja. The first thing that Thor says to Freyja is that she should dress herself and put on a bride's [[headgear|head-dress]], for they shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr. At that, Freyja is furious&mdash;the halls of the gods shake, she snorts in anger, and from the goddess the necklace [[Br\u00edsingamen]] falls. Indignant, Freyja responds:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Benjamin Thorpe translation:</small>\n:\"Know of me to be of women the lewdest,\n:if with thee I drive to J\u00f6tunheim.\"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1866|p=64}}\n|\n:<small>Henry Adams Bellows translation:</small>\n:\"Most lustful indeed should I look to all\n:If I journeyed with thee to the giants' home.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1923|p=177}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\nThe gods and goddesses assemble at a [[thing (assembly)|thing]] and debate how to solve the problem. The god [[Heimdallr]] proposes to dress Thor up as a bride, complete with bridal dress, head-dress, jingling keys, jewelry, and the famous Br\u00edsingamen. Thor objects but is hushed by Loki, reminding him that the new owners of the hammer will soon be settling in the land of the gods if the hammer isn't returned. Thor is dressed as planned and Loki is dressed as his maid. Thor and Loki go to J\u00f6tunheimr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=99{{ndash}}100}}\n\nIn the meantime, Thrym tells his servants to prepare for the arrival of the daughter of [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]]. When \"Freyja\" arrives in the morning, Thrym is taken aback by her behavior; her immense appetite for food and [[mead]] is far more than what he expected, and when Thrym goes in for a kiss beneath \"Freyja's\" veil, he finds \"her\" eyes to be terrifying, and he jumps down the hall. The disguised Loki makes excuses for the bride's odd behavior, claiming that she simply has not eaten or slept for eight days. In the end, the disguises successfully fool the j\u00f6tnar and, upon sight of it, Thor regains his hammer by force.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=100{{ndash}}101}}\n\nIn the poem ''[[Oddr\u00fanargr\u00e1tr]]'', [[Oddr\u00fan]] helps [[Borgny]] give birth to twins.

In doing so, Freyja turns \u00d3ttar into her boar, [[Hildisv\u00edni]], and, by means of flattery and threats of death by fire, Freyja successfully pries the information that \u00d3ttar needs from the j\u00f6tunn [[Hyndla]]. Freyja speaks throughout the poem, and at one point praises \u00d3ttar for constructing a [[h\u00f6rgr]] (an altar of stones) and frequently making [[bl\u00f3t]] (sacrifices) to her:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Benjamin Thorpe translation:</small>\n:An [[h\u00f6rgr|offer-stead]] to me he raised,\n:with stones constructed;\n:now is the stone\n:as glass become.\n:With the blood of oxen\n:he newly sprinkled it.\n:Ottar ever trusted the [[\u00c1ss|Asyniur]].{{sfnp|Thorpe|1866|p=108}}\n|\n:<small>Henry Adams Bellows translation:</small>\n:For me a [[h\u00f6rgr|shrine of stones]] he made,\n:And now to glass the rock has grown;\n:Oft with the blood of beasts was it red;\n:In the goddesses ever did Ottar trust.{{sfnp|Bellows|1923|p=221}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\nFreyja appears in the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' books ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]''. In chapter 24 of ''Gylfaginning'', the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] says that after the god [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] split with the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]], he had two beautiful and mighty children (no partner is mentioned); a son, [[Freyr]], and a daughter, Freyja. Freyr is \"the most glorious\" of the gods, and Freyja \"the most glorious\" of the goddesses. Freyja has a dwelling in the heavens, [[F\u00f3lkvangr]], and that whenever Freyja \"rides into battle she gets half the slain, and the other half to Odin [...].\" In support, High quotes the ''Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l'' stanza mentioned in the ''Poetic Edda'' section above.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=24}}\n\nHigh adds that Freyja has a large, beautiful hall called [[Sessr\u00famnir]], and that when Freyja travels she sits in a chariot and drives two cats, and that Freyja is \"the most approachable one for people to pray to, and from her name is derived the honorific title whereby noble ladies are called ''fruvor'' [noble ladies].\" High adds that Freyja has a particular fondness for love songs, and that \"it is good to pray to her concerning love affairs.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=24}}\n\nIn chapter 29, High recounts the names and features of various goddesses, including Freyja. Regarding Freyja, High says that, next to Frigg, Freyja is highest in rank among them and that she owns the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Freyja is married to [[\u00d3\u00f0r]], who goes on long travels, and the two have a very fair daughter by the name of [[Hnoss]]. While \u00d3\u00f0r is absent, Freyja stays behind and in her sorrow she weeps tears of red gold. High notes that Freyja has many names, and explains that this is because Freyja adopted them when looking for \u00d3\u00f0r and traveling \"among strange peoples.\" These names include ''Gefn'', ''H\u00f6rn'', ''Mard\u00f6ll'', ''S\u00fdr'', and ''Vanad\u00eds''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=29{{ndash}}30}}\n\nFreyja plays a part in the events leading to the birth of [[Sleipnir]], the eight-legged horse. In chapter 42, High recounts that, soon after the gods built the hall [[Valhalla]], a builder (unnamed) came to them and offered to build for them in three seasons a fortification so solid that no [[j\u00f6tunn]] would be able to come in over from [[Midgard]]. In exchange, the builder wants Freyja for his bride, and the [[S\u00f3l (Sun)|sun]] and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate the gods agree, but with added conditions. In time, just as he is about to complete his work, it is revealed that the builder is, in fact, himself a j\u00f6tunn, and he is killed by Thor. In the meantime, Loki, in the form of a mare, has been impregnated by the j\u00f6tunn's horse, [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and so gives birth to Sleipnir. In support, High quotes the ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1]]'' stanza that mentions Freyja.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=35{{ndash}}36}} In chapter 49, High recalls the funeral of [[Baldr]] and says that Freyja attended the funeral and there drove her cat-chariot, the final reference to the goddess in ''Gylfaginning''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=50}}\n[[File:Freya and Heimdall by Blommer.jpg|thumb|''Heimdallr returns the necklace Br\u00edsingamen to Freyja'' (1846) by [[Nils Blomm\u00e9r]]]]\nAt the beginning of the book ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'', Freyja is mentioned among eight goddesses attending a banquet held for [[\u00c6gir]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=59}} Chapter 56 details the abduction of the goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] by the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00dejazi]] in the form of an eagle.

In the account, Freyja is described as having been a concubine of Odin, who bartered sex to four dwarfs for a golden necklace. In the work, the [[\u00c6sir]] once lived in a city called [[Asgard]], located in a region called \"Asialand or Asiahome\". Odin was the king of the realm, and made [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] and [[Freyr]] temple priests. Freyja was the daughter of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and was Odin's concubine. Odin deeply loved Freyja, and she was \"the fairest of woman of that day.\" Freyja had a beautiful [[Boudoir|bower]], and when the door was shut no one could enter without Freyja's permission.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|p=127}}\n\nChapter 1 records that one day Freyja passed by an open stone where [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]] lived. Four dwarfs were smithying a golden necklace, and it was nearly done. Looking at the necklace, the dwarfs thought Freyja to be most fair, and she the necklace. Freyja offered to buy the collar from them with silver and gold and other items of value. The dwarfs said that they had no lack of money, and that for the necklace the only thing she could offer them would be a night with each of them. \"Whether she liked it better or worse\", Freyja agreed to the conditions, and so spent a night with each of the four dwarfs. The conditions were fulfilled and the necklace was hers. Freyja went home to her bower as if nothing happened.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|p=128}}\n\nAs related in chapter 2, Loki, under the service of Odin, found out about Freyja's actions and told Odin. Odin told Loki to get the necklace and bring it to him. Loki said that since no one could enter Freyja's bower against her will, this wouldn't be an easy task, yet Odin told him not to come back until he had found a way to get the necklace. Howling, Loki turned away and went to Freyja's bower but found it locked, and that he couldn't enter. So Loki transformed himself into a fly, and after having trouble finding even the tiniest of entrances, he managed to find a tiny hole at the gable-top, yet even here he had to squeeze through to enter.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|p=128}}\n\nHaving made his way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around to be sure that no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a [[flea]] and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and returned to Odin.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|pp=128{{ndash}}129}}\n\nThe next morning Freyja woke and saw that the doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, and that her precious necklace was gone. Freyja had an idea of who was responsible. She got dressed and went to Odin. She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, and that he should give her back her jewelry.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|p=129}}\n\nOdin said that, given how she obtained it, she would never get it back. That is, with one exception: she could have it back if she could make two kings, themselves ruling twenty kings each, battle one another, and cast a spell so that each time one of their numbers falls in battle, they will again spring up and fight again. And that this must go on eternally, unless a [[Christianity|Christian]] man of a particular stature goes into the battle and smites them, only then will they stay dead. Freyja agreed.{{sfnp|Morris|Morris|1911|p=129}}\n\n==Post-Christianization and Scandinavian folklore==\n[[File:Rye field.jpg|thumb|Ripe rye in Northern Europe]]\nAlthough the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] sought to [[demonization|demonize]] the native gods, belief and reverence in the gods, including Freyja, remained into the modern period and melded into [[Scandinavian folklore]]. {{Interlanguage link multi|Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|sv}} comments that Freyja became a particular target under Christianization:\n<blockquote>\n:Freyja's erotic qualities became an easy target for the new religion, in which an asexual virgin was the ideal woman [...] Freyja is called \"a whore\" and \"a harlot\" by the holy men and missionaries, whereas many of her functions in the everyday lives of men and women, such as protecting the vegetation and supplying assistance in childbirth were transferred to the Virgin Mary.{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1995|p=21}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Freyja did not disappear.

Writer Johan Alfred G\u00f6th recalled a Sunday in 1880 where men were walking in fields and looking at nearly ripened [[rye]], where M\u00e5ns in Karryd said: \"Now Freyja is out watching if the rye is ripe\". Along with this, G\u00f6th recalls another mention of Freyja in the countryside:\n<blockquote>\n:When as a boy I was visiting the old Proud-Katrina, I was afraid of lightning like all boys in those days. When the [[Lightning#Observational variations|sheet lightning]] flared at the night, Katrina said: \"Don't be afraid little child, it is only Freyja who is out making fire with steel and flintstone to see if the rye is ripe. She is kind to people and she is only doing it to be of service, she is not like Thor, he slays both people and livestock, when he is in the mood\" [...] I later heard several old folks talk of the same thing in the same way.{{sfnp|Sch\u00f6n|2004|pp=227{{ndash}}228}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn [[V\u00e4rend]], Sweden, Freyja could also arrive at Christmas night and she used to shake the apple trees for the sake of a good harvest and consequently people left some apples in the trees for her sake. However, it was dangerous to leave the [[plough]] outdoors, because if Freyja sat on it, it would no longer be of any use.{{sfnp|Sch\u00f6n|2004|pp=227{{ndash}}228}}\n\n==Eponyms==\n[[File:Polygala vulgaris 290504.jpg|right|thumb|[[Polygala vulgaris|Freyja's hair]]\u2014''Polygala vulgaris''\u2014a species of the genus ''Polygala''.]]\nSeveral plants were named after Freyja, such as ''Freyja's tears'' and ''Freyja's hair'' (''[[Polygala vulgaris]]''), but during the process of Christianization, the name of the goddess was replaced with that of the [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfnp|Sch\u00f6n|2004|p=228}} In the pre-Christian period, the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] [[constellation]] was called either Frigg's distaff or Freyja's [[distaff]] (Swedish ''Frejerock'').{{sfnp|Sch\u00f6n|2004|p=228}}\n\nPlace names in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] reflect devotion to the goddess, including the Norwegian place name [[Fr\u00f8ihov]] (originally *''Freyjuhof'', literally \"Freyja's [[Heathen hofs|hof]]\") and Swedish place names such as [[Fr\u00f6vi]] (from *''Freyjuv\u00e9'', literally \"Freyja's [[V\u00e9 (shrine)|v\u00e9]]\").<ref name=\"FREYJA-PLACE-NAMES\">{{harvp|Simek|2007|p=91}} and {{harvp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=178{{ndash}}179}}.</ref> In a survey of toponyms in Norway, M.

The connection with Frigg and question of possible earlier identification of Freyja with Frigg in the [[Common Germanic deities|Proto-Germanic]] period ([[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis]]) remains a matter of scholarly discourse.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}} Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that \"the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported.\"{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}\n\nLike the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]], the name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], as opposed to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Frijj\u014d]]''. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which ''Freyja'' descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to lack of evidence.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}}\n\nIn the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', a figure by the name of [[Gullveig]] is burnt three times yet is three times reborn. After her third rebirth, she is known as [[Hei\u00f0r]]. This event is generally accepted as precipitating the [[\u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War]]. Starting with scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]], scholars such as [[Rudolf Simek]], [[Andy Orchard]], and [[John Lindow]] have theorized that Gullveig/Hei\u00f0r is the same figure as Freyja, and that her involvement with the \u00c6sir somehow led to the events of the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War.<ref name=FREYJA-GULLVEIG>{{harvp|Simek|2007|pp=123{{ndash}}124}}, {{harvp|Lindow|2002|p=155}}, and {{harvp|Orchard|1997|p=67}}.</ref>\n\nOutside of theories connecting Freyja with the goddess Frigg, some scholars, such as [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|sv}}, have theorized that other goddesses in Norse mythology, such as [[Gefjon]], [[Ger\u00f0r]], and [[Ska\u00f0i]], may be forms of Freyja in different roles or ages.{{sfnp|Davidson|1998|pp=85{{ndash}}86}}\n\n===Receiver of the slain===\nFreyja and her afterlife field [[F\u00f3lkvangr]], where she receives half of the slain, have been theorized as connected to the valkyries. Scholar Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m points out the description in ''Gylfaginning'' where it is said of Freyja that \"whenever she rides into battle she takes half of the slain,\" and interprets ''F\u00f3lkvangr'' as \"the field of the Warriors\". N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m notes that, just like Odin, Freyja receives slain heroes who have died on the battlefield, and that her house is [[Sessrumnir]] (which she translates as \"filled with many seats\"), a dwelling that N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m posits likely fills the same function as Valhalla. N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m comments that \"still, we must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse view of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to \u00d3\u00f0inn and the other to Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.\"{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1999|p=61}}\n\nSiegfried Andres Dobat comments that \"in her mythological role as the chooser of half the fallen warriors for her death realm F\u00f3lkvangr, the goddess Freyja, however, emerges as the mythological role model for the Valkyrjar {{sic}} and the [[d\u00edsir]].\"{{sfnp|Dobat|2006|p=186}}\n\n===The Oriental hypothesis===\n[[Gustav Neckel]], writing in 1920, connects Freyja to the [[Phyrgia|Phrygian]] goddess [[Cybele]]. According to Neckel, both goddesses can be interpreted as \"fertility goddesses\" and other potential resemblances have been noted. Some scholars have suggested that the image of Cybele subsequently influenced the iconography of Freyja, the lions drawing the former's chariot becoming large cats. These observations became an extremely common observation in works regarding Old Norse religion until at least the early 1990s. In her book-length study of scholarship on the topic of Freyja, Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m (1995) is highly critical of this deduction; N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m says that \"these 'parallels' are due to sheer ignorance about the characteristics of Cybele; scholars have not troubled to look into the resemblances and differences between the two goddesses, if any, in support for their arguments for a common origin.\"{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1995|pp=23{{ndash}}24}}\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Ring5.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Freia\u2014a combination of Freyja and the goddess [[I\u00f0unn]]\u2014from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' as illustrated (1910) by [[Arthur Rackham]]]]\nInto the modern period, Freyja was treated as a Scandinavian counterpart to the Roman Venus in, for example, Swedish literature, where the goddess may be associated with romantic love or, conversely, simply as a synonym for \"lust and potency\".{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1995|pp=21{{ndash}}22}} In the 18th century, Swedish poet [[Carl Michael Bellman]] referred to [[Stockholm]] prostitutes in his ''[[Fredmans epistlar|Fredman's Epistles]]'' as \"the children of Fr\u00f6ja\".{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1995|p=21}} In the 19th century, Britt-Mari N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m observes, Swedish Romanticism focused less on Freyja's erotic qualities and more on the image of \"the pining goddess, weeping for her husband\".{{sfnp|N\u00e4sstr\u00f6m|1995|p=21}}\n\nFreyja is mentioned in the first stanza (\"it is called old Denmark and it is Freja's hall\") of the civil [[national anthem]] of Denmark, ''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'', written by 19th century Danish poet [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] in 1819.{{sfnp|Andersen|1899|p=157}} In addition, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger wrote a comedy entitled ''Freyjas alter'' (1818) and a poem ''Freais sal'' featuring the goddess.{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=91}}\n\nThe 19th century German composer [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' opera cycle features ''Freia'', the goddess Freyja combined with the apple-bearing goddess [[I\u00f0unn]].{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=90}}\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century Northern Europe, Freyja was the subject of numerous works of art, including ''Freyja'' by [[Hermann Ernst Freund|H.

A first-class match is of three or more days' scheduled duration between two sides of eleven players each and is officially adjudged to be worthy of the status by virtue of the standard of the competing teams. Matches must allow for the teams to play two [[innings]] each although, in practice, a team might play only one innings or none at all. \n\nFirst-class cricket (which for this purpose includes all \"important matches\" played before 1895), along with historical [[single wicket cricket|single-wicket]] and the modern [[limited overs cricket|limited-overs forms]] of [[List A cricket|List A]] and [[Twenty20]], is one of the highest-standard forms of cricket. The origin of the term \"first-class cricket\" is unknown but it was used loosely before it acquired an official status, effective in 1895, following a meeting of leading English clubs in May 1894. Subsequently, at a meeting of the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A significant omission of the ICC ruling was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively. This has left historians, and especially statisticians, with the problem of how to categorise earlier matches, especially those played before 1895 in Great Britain. The solution put forward by the [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] (ACS) is to classify all pre-1895 matches of a high standard as '''important matches'''.\n\n[[Test cricket]], the highest standard of cricket, is statistically a form of first-class cricket, though the term \"first-class\" is mainly used to refer to domestic competition. A player's first-class statistics include any performances in Test matches.\n\n{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}\n\n==MCC ruling, May 1894==\nBefore 1895, \"first-class cricket\" was a common term used loosely to suggest that a match had a high standard; adjectives like \"great\", \"important\" and \"major\" were also loosely applied to such matches. There was at the time no concept of what became [[Test cricket]] and so an international match would be called a first-class one, as would any match involving two senior county clubs. At the beginning of the 1860s, there were only four formally constituted county clubs: [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] is the oldest, formed in 1839, and it had been followed by [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]], [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] and [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]]. In the early 1860s, several more clubs were founded and questions began to be raised in the sporting press about which should be categorised as first-class, but there was considerable disagreement in the answers. In 1880, the [[Cricket Reporting Agency]] was founded. It acquired influence through the decade especially by association with ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' (''Wisden'') and the press came to generally rely on its information and opinions.<ref>ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe term acquired official status, though limited to matches in Great Britain, following a meeting at [[Lord's]] in May 1894 between the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) committee and the secretaries of the clubs involved in the official [[County Championship]], which had begun in 1890. As a result, those clubs became first-class from 1895 along with MCC, [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]], senior cricket touring teams (i.e., [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] at that time) and other teams designated as such by MCC (e.g. [[North v South]], [[Gentlemen v Players]] and occasional \"elevens\" which consisted of recognised first-class players).<ref>ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Officially, therefore, the inaugural first-class match was the opening game of the 1895 season between MCC and [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at Lord's on 1 and 2 May, MCC winning by 37 runs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4287.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Nottinghamshire 1895 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==ICC ruling, May 1947==\n\nThe term \"first-class cricket\" was formally defined by the then [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (ICC) on 19 May 1947. It was made clear that the definition \"will not have retrospective effect\".<ref name=WCA48/> The definition is as follows:<ref name=WCA48>''Wisden 1948'', p. 813.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A match of three or more days' duration between two sides of eleven players officially adjudged first-class, shall be regarded as a first-class fixture. Matches in which either team have more than eleven players or which are scheduled for less than three days shall not be regarded as first-class. The Governing body in each country shall decide the status of teams.</blockquote>\n\nFor example, MCC was authorised to determine the status of matches played in Great Britain. For all intents and purposes, the 1947 ICC definition confirmed the 1894 MCC definition and gave it international recognition and usage.\n\nHence, official judgment of status is the responsibility of the governing body in each country that is a ''full member'' of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). The governing body grants first-class status to international teams and to domestic teams that are representative of the country's highest playing standard. Later ICC rulings make it possible for international teams from ''associate members'' of the ICC to achieve first-class status but it is dependent on the status of their opponents in a given match.<ref name=\"icccoc\">{{cite journal|title=ICC Classification of Official Cricket|url=https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf|page=[https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf#page=3 3]|format=pdf|publisher=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=1 October 2017|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Application===\nAccording to the ICC definition, a match may be adjudged first-class if:<ref name=\"icccoc\"/>\n* it is of three or more days scheduled duration\n* each side playing the match has eleven players\n* each side may have two innings\n* the match is played on natural, and not artificial, turf\n* the match is played at a venue which meets certain standard criteria regarding venues\n* the match conforms to the [[Laws of Cricket]], except for only minor amendments \n* the sport\u2019s governing body in the appropriate nation, or the ICC itself, recognises the match as first-class.\n\nA Test match is a first-class match played between two ICC full member countries subject to their current status at the ICC and the application of ICC conditions when the match is played.<ref name=\"icccoc\"/>\n\n===Recognised matches===\nIn 2010, the ICC published its ''Classification of Official Cricket'' which includes the criteria with which a match must comply to achieve a desired categorisation. In the section on first-class cricket, there is a list of the types of match that ''should'' qualify. It is important to note, given the differences in opinion about what constitutes a first-class match, that the ICC clearly stipulates that its match type list \"is not exhaustive and is merely '''indicative of the matches which would''' fall into the first-class definition\". For example, the list includes matches of recognised first-class teams ''versus'' international touring teams; and the leading domestic championships (using their then-current names) such as the [[County Championship]], [[Sheffield Shield]], [[Ranji Trophy]], etc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=ICC Classification of Official Cricket|url=https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf|page=[https://pulse-static-files.s3.amazonaws.com/ICC/document/2017/09/24/4510678a-e031-4a9b-a402-397d4868adb6/ICC-Classification-of-Official-Cricket-Effective-1st-October-2017.pdf#page=5 5]|format=pdf|publisher=International Cricket Council|date=1 October 2017|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==No retrospective effect==\nThe absence of any ICC ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) is problematic for those cricket statisticians who wish to categorise earlier matches in the same way. They have responded by compiling their own match lists and allocating a strictly ''unofficial'' first-class status to the matches they consider to have been of a high standard. It is therefore a matter of opinion only with no official support. Inevitable differences have arisen and there are [[variations in published cricket statistics]]. \n\n===Issue for statisticians===\nA key issue for the statisticians is when first-class cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, [[Roy Webber]] argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which [[overarm bowling]] was legalised) \"cannot be regarded as first-class\" and their records are used \"for their historical associations\".<ref name=RW51>Webber, pp. 9\u201310.</ref> This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, \"first-class\" is essentially a statistical concept while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber's rationale was that cricket was \"generally weak before 1864\" (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] analyses, which hindered compilation of records.<ref name=RW51/> According to Webber's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]] and MCC at [[Fenner's]] on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4287.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Cambridge University v Marylebone Cricket Club 1864 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Important matches classification===\nWhen the [[Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians]] (ACS) published its ''Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles'' in 1982, it tentatively agreed with Webber's 1864 start date by saying that \"the line between first-class and other matches becomes more easily discernible about that date\".<ref>ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 3.</ref> A year earlier, the ACS had published its ''Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863'' in which it listed all the known matches during that period which it considered to have historical importance. '''Therefore, pre-1895 matches of a high standard are termed \"important matches\" and are the equivalent of first-class matches played since 1895.''' The ACS did stipulate that they had taken a more lenient view of importance regarding matches played in the 18th century than they did of matches played in the 19th century. As they explained, surviving details of 18th century matches are typically incomplete while there is a fairly comprehensive store of data about 19th century matches, certainly since 1825.<ref>ACS, ''Important Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref>\n\n===18th century startpoints===\nSubsequently, Webber's view has been challenged by those who suggest earlier dates for the commencement of \"first-class statistics\". [[Bill Frindall]] believed that 1815 should be the start to encompass the entire [[roundarm bowling]] phase of cricket's history. However, roundarm did not begin in earnest until 1827. In Frindall's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1815 season between MCC and [[Middlesex county cricket teams |Middlesex]] at Lord's on 31 May and 1 June, Middlesex winning by 16 runs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/356.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Middlesex 1815 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref> The most significant internet-based views are those of ''CricketArchive'' (CA) and ''[[ESPNcricinfo]]'' (CI), both of which hold that the earliest first-class match was [[Hampshire county cricket teams|Hampshire]] ''versus'' [[Non-international England cricket teams|All-England]] at [[Broadhalfpenny Down]] on 24 and 25 June 1772. CA has numbered this match \"f1\" (i.e., first-class match number one) and CI as \"First-Class # 1\".<ref name=\"caf1\">{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/0/4.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Hampshire v England 1772 |accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cif1\">{{cite web |url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1770S/1772/ENG_LOCAL/HANTS-XI_ENG_24-25JUN1772.html |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |title=Hampshire v England 1772 |accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> \n\n===Historical v. statistical===\nHowever commendable these views may be, they are not only unofficial but also entirely statistical. The 1772 match left a scorecard that is complete apart from the bowling analyses and so the data is sufficient for a statistical study, especially as the scorecard was itself the start of a trend and there are surviving scorecards from every season commencing 1772. The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, as is often the case with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press.

After this he studied for a year at the [[University of Berlin]] under the ''[[Privatdozent]]en'' [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]], with whom he studied Celtic, and [[Hermann Oldenberg]] with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit.<ref>Joseph (2012:253)</ref> He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation ''De l'emploi du g\u00e9nitif absolu en Sanscrit'', and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the [[University of Paris]], where he lectured on Sanskrit, [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old High German]] and occasionally other subjects.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure is one of the world\u2019s most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he himself hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics<ref>Ferdinand de Saussure, \u00ab Aaccentuation lituanienne \u00bb. In : Indogermanische Forschungen. Vol. 6, 157 \u2013 166</ref> is grosso modo taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=8mpbAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Kurschat&lr=&hl=de#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kunde der littauischen Sprache.

Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat. It is also questionable to what extent the Cours itself can be traced back to Saussure (alone). Studies have shown that at least the current version and its content are more likely to have the so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert S\u00e8chehaye as their source than Saussure himself<ref>J\u00fcrgen Trabant, \u00ab Saussure contre le Cours \u00bb.

Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the [[University of Geneva]] for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in [[Vufflens-le-Ch\u00e2teau]], [[Vaud]], Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist [[Ren\u00e9 de Saussure]], and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, [[L\u00e9opold de Saussure]]. In turn, his son was the psychoanalyst [[Raymond de Saussure]].\n\nSaussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous ''[[Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]'' in 1916. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in ''Writings in General Linguistics'', but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the ''Course'', in 1967 and 1974. (TUFA)\n\n==Work and influence==\nSaussure's theoretical reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] vocalic system and particularly his [[laryngeal theory|theory of laryngeals]], otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of [[Hittite language|Hittite]] in the work of later generations of linguists such as [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and [[Walter Couvreur]], who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 ''M\u00e9moire''.<ref>[[E. F. K. Koerner]], 'The Place of Saussure's Memoire in the development of historical linguistics,' in Jacek Fisiak (ed.) ''Papers from the Sixth International Conference on Historical Linguistics,''(Pozna\u0144, Poland, 1983) John Benjamins Publishing, 1985  pp.323-346, p.339.</ref> \n\nSaussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century. His two currents of thought emerged independently of each other, one in Europe, the other in America. The results of each incorporated the basic notions of Saussure's thought in forming the central tenets of [[structuralism|structural linguistics]]. According to him, linguistic entities are parts of a system and are defined by their relations to one another within said system.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Linguistics|last=Aronoff|first=Mark|last2=Rees-Miller|first2=Janie|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=9781405186766|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=108}}</ref> The thinker used the game of [[chess]] for his analogy, citing that the game is not defined by the physical attributes of the chess pieces but the relation of each piece to the other pieces.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nSaussure's status in contemporary theoretical linguistics, however, is much diminished, with many key positions now dated or subject to challenge, but post-structuralist 21st-century reception remains more open to Saussure's influence.<ref>Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp1-8, 2010.</ref> His main contribution to structuralism was his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the ''langue'', the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the ''parole'', refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Michel Foucault|last=Fendler|first=Lynn|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2010|isbn=9781472518811|location=London|pages=17}}</ref> This framework was later adopted by [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|Claude Levi-Strauss]], who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which form the structure that makes them myths.<ref name=\":1\" /> These established the structuralist framework to literary criticism.\n\nIn Europe, the most important work in that period of influence was done by the [[Prague school]]. Most notably, [[Nikolay Trubetzkoy]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of [[phonology|phonological theory]] in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a [[markedness]] hierarchy of [[distinctive features]], was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, [[Louis Hjelmslev]] and [[the Copenhagen school (linguistics)|the Copenhagen School]] proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.\n\nIn America, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of [[Leonard Bloomfield]]<ref>{{cite book| author = John Earl Joseph| title = From Whitney to Chomsky: Essays in the History OfAmerican Linguisitcs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RUvdfiILAngC&pg=PA139| year = 2002| publisher = John Benjamins Publishing| isbn = 978-90-272-4592-2| page = 139 }}</ref> and the post-Bloomfieldian structuralism of such scholars as [[Eugene Nida]], [[Bernard Bloch (linguist)|Bernard Bloch]], [[George L. Trager]], Rulon S. Wells III, [[Charles Hockett]] and, through [[Zellig Harris]], the young [[Noam Chomsky]]. In addition to Chomsky's theory of [[transformational grammar]], other contemporary developments of structuralism included [[Kenneth Pike]]'s theory of [[tagmemics]], [[Sidney Lamb]]'s theory of [[stratificational grammar]], and [[Michael Silverstein]]'s work. [[Systemic functional linguistics]] is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. [[Ruqaiya Hasan]] describes [[systemic functional linguistics]] as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> [[Michael Halliday]] argues:\n\n{{quote|Saussure took the sign as the organizing concept for linguistic structure, using it to express the conventional nature of language in the phrase \"l'arbitraire du signe\". This has the effect of highlighting what is, in fact, the one point of arbitrariness in the system, namely the phonological shape of words, and hence allows the non-arbitrariness of the rest to emerge with greater clarity. An example of something that is distinctly non-arbitrary is the way different kinds of meaning in language are expressed by different kinds of grammatical structure, as appears when linguistic structure is interpreted in functional terms <ref>Halliday, MAK. 1977. Ideas about Language. Reprinted in Volume 3 of MAK Halliday's Collected Works. Edited by J.J. Webster. London: Continuum. p113.</ref>}}\n\n===''Course in General Linguistics''===\n{{Main article|Course in General Linguistics}}\n\nSaussure's most influential work, ''Course in General Linguistics'' (''Cours de linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale''), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students [[Charles Bally]] and [[Albert Sechehaye]], on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva.<ref>Macey, D. (2009). The Penguin dictionary of critical theory. Crane Library at the University of British Columbia.</ref> The ''Course'' became one of the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.\n\nIts central notion is that language may be analyzed as a [[formal system]] of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the [[sign (linguistics)|linguistic sign]], which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.\n\nThroughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. \"synchronically\"): \"Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas\". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, he called it semiology.\n\n===Laryngeal theory===\nWhile a student, Saussure published an important work in [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] [[philology]] that proposed the existence of ghosts in Proto-Indo-European called ''sonant coefficients''. The Scandinavian scholar [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] suggested that they might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. It has been argued that the problem that Saussure encountered, trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data, stimulated his development of [[structuralism]]. His predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a success when [[Hittite texts]] were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later.\n\n===Later critics===\n{{POV|what=subsection|talk=POV in %22Later Critics%22 subsection|date=January 2018}}\nThe closing sentence of Saussure's ''Course in General Linguistics'' has been challenged in many{{weasel inline|date=September 2016}} academic disciplines and subdisciplines with its contention that \"linguistics has as its unique and true object the language envisioned in itself and for itself\".<ref>Boris Gasparov. ''Beyond Pure Reason'', pp59-60, 2010.</ref> By the latter half of the 20th century, many of Saussure's ideas were under heavy criticism.\n\nSaussure's linguistic ideas are still considered important for their time but have since suffered considerably under rhetorical developments aimed at showing how linguistics had changed or was changing with the times. As a consequence, Saussure's ideas are now often presented by professional linguists as outdated and as superseded by developments such as [[cognitive linguistics]] and [[generative grammar]] or have been so modified in their basic tenets as to make their use in their original formulations difficult without risking distortion, as in [[systemic linguistics]]. That development is occasionally overstated, however; [[Jan Koster]] states, \"Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language,\"<ref>Koster, Jan. 1996. \"Saussure meets the brain\", in R. Jonkers, E. Kaan, J. K. Wiegel, eds., Language and Cognition 5. Yearbook 1992 of the Research Group for Linguistic Theory and Knowledge Representation of the University of Groningen, Groningen, pp. 115\u2013120.[http://www.let.rug.nl/koster/old%20papers/saussure.pdf PDF]</ref> Over-reactions can also be seen in comments of the cognitive linguist Mark Turner<ref>Turner, Mark. 1987. Death is the Mother of Beauty: Mind, Metaphor, Criticism. University of Chicago Press, p. 6.</ref> who reports that many of Saussure's concepts were \"wrong on a grand scale\". It is necessary to be rather more finely nuanced in the positions attributed to Saussure and in their longterm influence on the development of linguistic theorizing in all schools; for a more recent rereading of Saussure with respect to such issues, see Paul Thibault.<ref>Thibault, Paul. 1996. Re-reading Saussure: The Dynamics of Signs in Social Life. London: Routledge.</ref> Just as many principles of structural linguistics are still pursued, modified and adapted in current practice and according to what has been learnt since about the embodied functioning of brain and the role of language within this, basic tenets begun with Saussure still can be found operating behind the scenes today.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Semiology===\nSaussure is one of the founding fathers of [[semiotics]]. His term for the field was \"semiology.\" Instead of focusing his theory on the origins of language and its historical aspects, Saussure concentrated on the patterns and functions of language itself. He believed that the relationship that exists between the signifier and the signified is purely [[Semiotic arbitrariness|arbitrary]] and analytical. His \"sign/signifier/signified/referent\" scheme forms the core of the field. Equally crucial but often overlooked or misapplied is the dimension of the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of linguistic description.\n\nSome linguists have pointed out to the fact that Saussure did not 'invent' semiotics but built upon [[Neoplatonist]]/[[Augustinianism|Augustinian]] knowledge from the [[Middle Ages]], particularly in regard to the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies\".<ref>Munteanu, E.

Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively). However, their analogous interpretations of Saussure's linguistic theories led to proclamations of the end of structuralism in the two disciplines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Works==\n* (1878) ''M\u00e9moire sur le syst\u00e8me primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes'' (''Memoir on the Primitive System of Vowels in Indo-European Languages''), Leipzig: Teubner.
