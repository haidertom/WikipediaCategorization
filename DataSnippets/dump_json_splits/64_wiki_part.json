They are often used to decompose chemical compounds, in a process called [[electrolysis]]\u2014the Greek word [[lysis]] means ''to break up''.\n\nImportant examples of electrolysis are the decomposition of [[water]] into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and [[bauxite]] into [[aluminium]] and other chemicals. Electroplating (e.g. of copper, silver, nickel or chromium) is done  using an electrolytic cell. Electrolysis is a technique that uses a direct electric current (DC).\n\nAn electrolytic cell has three component parts: an [[electrolyte]] and two electrodes (a [[cathode]] and an [[anode]]). The [[electrolyte]] is usually a [[solution]] of [[water]] or other [[solvent]]s in which ions are dissolved. Molten salts such as [[sodium chloride]] are also electrolytes. When driven by an external [[voltage]] applied to the electrodes, the ions in the electrolyte are attracted to an electrode with the opposite charge, where charge-transferring (also called faradaic or redox) reactions can take place. Only with an external [[electrical potential]] (i.e. voltage) of correct polarity and sufficient magnitude can an electrolytic cell decompose a normally stable, or [[Chemically inert|inert]] chemical compound in the solution. The electrical energy provided can produce a chemical reaction which would not occur spontaneously otherwise.\n\n== Galvanic cell ==\n[[File:Galvanic cell with no cation flow.png|right|thumb|Galvanic cell with no cation flow]]\n{{Main|Galvanic cell}}\nA galvanic cell, or voltaic cell, named after [[Luigi Galvani]], or [[Alessandro Volta]] respectively, is an electrochemical cell that derives electrical energy from spontaneous [[redox]] reactions taking place within the cell. It generally consists of two different metals connected by a [[salt bridge]], or individual half-cells separated by a porous membrane.\n\nVolta was the inventor of the [[voltaic pile]], the first [[Battery (electricity)|electrical battery]]. In common usage, the word \"battery\" has come to include a single galvanic cell, but a battery properly consists of multiple cells.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/battery \"battery\" (def. 4b)], ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary'' (2008). Retrieved 6 August 2008.</ref>\n\n== Primary cell ==\n{{main|primary cell}}\nA primary cell is a Galvanic [[battery (electricity)|battery]] that is designed to be used once and discarded, and not recharged with electricity and reused like a secondary cell ([[rechargeable battery]]).  In general, the [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]] occurring in the cell is not reversible, rendering the cell unrechargeable.  As a primary cell is used, [[chemical reaction]]s in the battery use up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity and is useless. In contrast, in a [[secondary cell]], the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell with a [[battery charger]] to recharge it, regenerating the chemical reactants.  Primary cells are made in a range of standard sizes to power small household appliances such as [[flashlight]]s and portable radios.  \n\nPrimary batteries make up about 90% of the $50 billion battery market, but secondary batteries have been gaining market share.  About 15 billion primary batteries are thrown away worldwide every year, virtually all ending up in landfills.  Due to the toxic [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s and strong acids or alkalis they contain, batteries are [[hazardous waste]].  Most municipalities classify them as such and require separate disposal.   The energy needed to manufacture a battery is about 50 times greater than the energy it contains.<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Hill\n | first1 = Marquita K. \n | title  = Understanding Environmental Pollution: A Primer\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | date   = 2004\n | location = \n | pages  = 274\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=1yrx2dFNV90C&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=battery+energy++%2250+times%22+environment+pollution\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0521527260\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Watts\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Watts\n | first1 = John \n | title  = Gcse Edexcel Science\n | publisher = Letts and Lonsdale \n | date   = 2006\n | location = \n | pages  = 63\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=KFTvvwOOi64C&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=battery+energy+%2250+times%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1905129637\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Wastebusters\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Wastebusters\n | title  = The Green Office Manual: A Guide to Responsible Practice\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date   = 2013\n | location = \n | pages  = 96\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=LcX9AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=battery+energy+%2250+times%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1134197985\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Danaher\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Danaher\n | first1 = Kevin\n | last2  = Biggs\n | first2 = Shannon\n | last3  = Mark\n | first3 = Jason\n | title  = Building the Green Economy: Success Stories from the Grassroots\n | publisher = Routledge\n | date   = 2016\n | location = \n | pages  = 199\n | language = \n | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=JQdZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA199&dq=battery+energy+%2250+times%22\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 1317262921\n }}</ref>   Due to their high pollutant content compared to their small energy content, the primary battery is considered a wasteful, environmentally unfriendly technology.  Due mainly to increasing sales of [[wireless device]]s and [[cordless|cordless tools]] which cannot be economically powered by primary batteries and come with integral rechargeable batteries, the secondary battery industry has high growth and has slowly been replacing the primary battery in high end products.  \n\n[[File:Batteries comparison 4,5 D C AA AAA AAAA A23 9V CR2032 LR44 matchstick-1.jpeg|thumb|upright=2|A variety of standard sizes of primary cells.

This is used as a convenient way to store electricity, when current flows one way the levels of one or more chemicals build up (charging), while it is discharging they reduce and the resulting electromotive force can do work.\n\n== Fuel cell ==\n[[File:Solid oxide fuel cell protonic.svg|thumb|Scheme of a proton-conducting fuel cell]]\n{{main|Fuel cell}}\nA ''fuel cell'' is an electrochemical cell that converts the [[chemical energy]] from a fuel into electricity through an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reaction of [[hydrogen fuel]] with oxygen or another [[oxidizing agent]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Khurmi |first=R. S. |title=Material Science |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/436308472.html}}</ref> Fuel cells are different from [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from chemicals already present in the battery. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.\n\nThe first fuel cells were invented in 1838. The first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in [[NASA]] space programmes to generate power for [[satellites]] and [[space capsule]]s. Since then, fuel cells have been used in many other applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, including forklifts, automobiles, buses, boats, motorcycles and submarines.\n\nThere are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an [[anode]], a [[cathode]], and an [[electrolyte]] that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing [[direct current]] electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). A related technology is [[Flow battery|flow batteries]], in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are \"stacked\", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements.<ref>Nice, Karim and Strickland, Jonathan. [http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/fuel-cell2.htm \"How Fuel Cells Work: Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells\"]. How Stuff Works, accessed 4 August 2011</ref> In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40\u201360%; however, if waste heat is captured in a [[cogeneration]] scheme, efficiencies up to 85% can be obtained.\n\nThe fuel cell market is growing, and in 2013 Pike Research estimated that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 GW by 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.renewindians.com/2013/01/stationary-fuel-cells-market-size-to-reach-350000-shipments-by-2022.html |title=Stationary Fuel Cells Market size to reach 350,000 Shipments by 2022 |work=Renew India Campaign |first=Rahul R. |last=Prabhu |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref>\n\n== Half-cells ==\n{{Main|Half-cell}}\n[[File:bunsen cell.jpg|thumb|The [[Bunsen cell]], invented by [[Robert Bunsen]].]]\nAn electrochemical cell consists of two half-cells.  Each ''half-cell'' consists of an [[electrode]] and an [[electrolyte]]. The two half-cells may use the same electrolyte, or they may use different electrolytes. The chemical reactions in the cell may involve the electrolyte, the electrodes, or an external substance (as in [[fuel cell]]s that may use hydrogen gas as a reactant). In a full electrochemical cell, species from one half-cell lose electrons ([[Redox|oxidation]]) to their [[electrode]] while species from the other half-cell gain electrons ([[Redox|reduction]]) from their electrode.\n\nA ''[[salt bridge]]'' (e.g., filter paper soaked in KNO<sub>3,</sub> NaCl, or some other electrolyte) is often employed to provide ionic contact between two half-cells with different electrolytes, yet prevent the solutions from mixing and causing unwanted side reactions. An alternative to a salt bridge is to allow direct contact (and mixing) between the two half-cells, for example in simple electrolysis of water.\n\nAs electrons flow from one half-cell to the other through an external circuit, a difference in charge is established. If no ionic contact were provided, this charge difference would quickly prevent the further flow of electrons. A salt bridge allows the flow of negative or positive ions to maintain a steady-state charge distribution between the oxidation and reduction vessels, while keeping the contents otherwise separate. Other devices for achieving separation of solutions are porous pots and gelled solutions. A porous pot is used in the [[Bunsen cell]] (right).\n\n=== Equilibrium reaction ===\n\nEach half-cell has a characteristic voltage. Various choices of substances for each half-cell give different potential differences. Each reaction is undergoing an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reaction between different [[oxidation states]] of the ions: When equilibrium is reached, the cell cannot provide further voltage. In the half-cell that is undergoing oxidation, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more positive oxidation state the more potential this reaction will provide. Likewise, in the reduction reaction, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more ''negative'' oxidation state the higher the potential.\n\n=== Cell potential ===\n\nThe cell potential can be predicted through the use of [[electrode potential]]s (the voltages of each half-cell). These half-cell potentials are defined relative to the assignment of 0 volts to the [[standard hydrogen electrode]] (SHE). (See [[table of standard electrode potentials]]). The difference in voltage between electrode potentials gives a prediction for the potential measured. When calculating the difference in voltage, one must first rewrite the half-cell reaction equations to obtain a balanced oxidation-reduction equation.\n\n# Reverse the reduction reaction with the smallest potential ( to create an oxidation reaction/ overall positive cell potential)\n# Half-reactions must be multiplied by integers to achieve electron balance.\n\nCell potentials have a possible range of roughly zero to 6 volts. Cells using water-based electrolytes are usually limited to cell potentials less than about 2.5 volts due to high reactivity of the powerful oxidizing and reducing agents with water that is  needed to produce a higher voltage. Higher cell potentials are possible with cells using other solvents instead of water. For instance, [[lithium battery|lithium cells]] with a voltage of 3 volts are commonly available.\n\nThe cell potential depends on the concentration of the reactants, as well as their type. As the cell is discharged, the concentration of the reactants decreases and the cell potential also decreases.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|energy}}\n\n* [[Activity (chemistry)]]\n* [[Cell notation]]\n* [[Electrochemical potential]]\n* [[Electrochemical engineering]]\n* [[Battery (electricity)]]\n* [[Rechargeable battery]]\n* [[Fuel cell]]\n* [[Flow battery]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Galvanic cells}}\n\n[[Category:Tools]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]\n[[Category:Electrochemical cells]]", "sha1": "rnlpoqqmkjrgpktq6xyaj6fhxv34r94"}}, {"title": "Ecdysis", "ns": "0", "id": "10340", "revision": {"id": "858197291", "parentid": "858177987", "timestamp": "2018-09-05T18:04:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Velella", "id": "136926"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/2600:1702:4C0:21E0:88B6:29E6:9942:C918|2600:1702:4C0:21E0:88B6:29E6:9942:C918]] ([[User talk:2600:1702:4C0:21E0:88B6:29E6:9942:C918|talk]]) to last version by Edit-pi", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n[[File:Cicada molting animated-2.gif|thumb|right|Process of ecdysis of a [[cicada]].]]\n\n'''Ecdysis''' is the [[moulting]] of the [[cuticle]] in many invertebrates of the clade [[Ecdysozoa]].

Parker}}</ref> During this short phase the animal expands, since growth is otherwise constrained by the rigidity of the exoskeleton. Growth of the limbs and other parts normally covered by hard exoskeleton is achieved by transfer of body fluids from soft parts before the new skin hardens. A spider with a small abdomen may be undernourished but more probably has recently undergone ecdysis. Some arthropods, especially large insects with tracheal respiration, expand their new exoskeleton by swallowing or otherwise taking in air. The maturation of the structure and [[animal coloration|colouration]] of the new exoskeleton might take days or weeks in a long-lived insect; this can make it difficult to identify an individual if it has recently undergone ecdysis.\n\nEcdysis allows damaged tissue and missing limbs to be [[regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] or substantially re-formed. Complete regeneration may require a series of moults, the stump becoming a little larger with each moult until it is a normal, or near normal, size.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Penny M.

For most organisms, the resting period is a stage of preparation during which the secretion of fluid from the moulting glands of the epidermal layer and the loosening of the underpart of the cuticle occur.\nOnce the old cuticle has separated from the epidermis, a digesting fluid is secreted into the space between them. However, this fluid remains inactive until the upper part of the new cuticle has been formed. Then, by crawling movements, the organism pushes forward in the old [[Integumentary system|integumentary shell]], which splits down the back allowing the animal to emerge. Often, this initial crack is caused by a combination of movement and increase in blood pressure within the body, forcing an expansion across its [[exoskeleton]], leading to an eventual crack that allows for certain organisms such as [[spider]]s to extricate themselves.\nWhile the old cuticle is being digested, the new layer is secreted. All cuticular structures are shed at ecdysis, including the inner parts of the exoskeleton, which includes terminal linings of the [[alimentary tract]] and of the [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]]e if they are present.\n{{Multiple image\n| header = Physiology of ecdysis\n| direction = horizontal\n| align = center\n| width = 240\n| image1 = The-arthropods-moulting-1.gif\n| alt1 = The process of moulting in insects begins with the separation of the cuticle from the underlying epidermal cells.\n| image2 = The-arthropods-moulting-2.gif\n| alt2 = After the separation, moulting fluid is secreted into the space between the old cuticle and the epidermis (the exuvial space); this contains inactive enzymes which are activated only after the new epicuticle is secreted.\n| image3 = The-arthropods-moulting-3.gif\n| alt3 = The lower regions of the old cuticle are then digested by the enzymes and subsequently absorbed. The process of moulting can start.\n}}\n\n==Insects==\n{{wide image|Aeshna cyanea freshly slipped L2.jpg|1200px|Moulting (ecdysis) in [[southern hawker]], ''Aeshna cyanea''}}\n\nEach stage of development between moults for insects in the taxon [[endopterygota]] is called an [[instar]], or stadium, and each stage between moults of insects in the [[Exopterygota]] is called a nymph: there may be up to 15 nymphal stages. [[Endopterygota]] tend to have only four or five instars. Endopterygotes have more alternatives to moulting, such as expansion of the cuticle and collapse of air sacs to allow growth of internal organs.\n\nThe process of moulting in insects begins with the separation of the cuticle from the underlying epidermal cells (apolysis) and ends with the shedding of the old cuticle (ecdysis). In many species it is initiated by an increase in the [[hormone]] [[ecdysone]]. This hormone causes:\n* apolysis \u2013 the separation of the cuticle from the [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]]\n* [[secretion]] of new cuticle materials beneath the old\n* degradation of the old cuticle\n\nAfter apolysis the insect is known as a [[pharate]]. Moulting fluid is then secreted into the exuvial space between the old cuticle and the epidermis, this contains inactive enzymes which are activated only after the new [[epicuticle]] is secreted. This prevents the new [[procuticle]] from getting digested as it is laid down. The lower regions of the old cuticle, the [[endocuticle]] and [[mesocuticle]], are then digested by the enzymes and subsequently absorbed. The [[exocuticle]] and epicuticle resist digestion and are hence shed at ecdysis.\n\n==Spiders==\n[[File:Crab spider female in ecdysis; Genus Synema, Family Thomisidae 5725s.jpg|left|thumb|Female [[crab spider]] ''[[Synema decens]]'', teneral after final ecdysis, still dangling from drop line, about to be mated, [[opisthosoma]] still shrunken]]\n\nSpiders generally change their skin for the first time while still inside the egg sac, and the spiderling that emerges broadly resembles the adult. The number of moults varies, both between species and genders, but generally will be between five times and nine times before the spider reaches maturity. Not surprisingly, since males are generally smaller than females, the males of many species mature faster and do not undergo ecdysis as many times as the females before maturing.\nMembers of the [[Mygalomorphae]] are very long-lived, sometimes 20 years or more; they moult annually even after they mature.\n\nSpiders stop feeding at some time before moulting, usually for several days. The physiological processes of releasing the old exoskeleton from the tissues beneath typically cause various colour changes, such as darkening. If the old exoskeleton is not too thick it may be possible to see new structures, such as [[seta]]e, from outside. However, contact between the nerves and the old exoskeleton is maintained until a very late stage in the process.\n\nThe new, teneral exoskeleton has to accommodate a larger frame than the previous [[instar]], while the spider has had to fit into the previous exoskeleton until it has been shed. This means the spider does not fill out the new exoskeleton completely, so it commonly appears somewhat wrinkled.\n\nMost species of spiders hang from silk during the entire process, either dangling from a drop line, or fastening their claws into webbed fibres attached to a suitable base. The discarded, dried exoskeleton typically remains hanging where it was abandoned once the spider has left.\n\nTo open the old exoskeleton, the spider generally contracts its abdomen ([[opisthosoma]]) to supply enough fluid to pump into the [[Cephalothorax|prosoma]] with sufficient pressure to crack it open along its lines of weakness. The [[carapace]] lifts off from the front, like a helmet, as its surrounding skin ruptures, but it remains attached at the back. Now the spider works its limbs free and typically winds up dangling by a new thread of silk attached to its own exuviae, which in turn hang from the original silk attachment.\n\nAt this point the spider is a callow; it is teneral and vulnerable.

Around Ebor and Guy Fawkes can be seen some of the most magnificent scenery in this State if not Australia. ...The two falls are scenes of beauty, and in winter time are sometimes frozen, making a beautiful spectacle as they hang in huge icicles. The water from the Ebor eventually finds an outlet in the Clarence River. ...The view, ...as regards expansiveness, ruggedness, and beauty, must compare more\nthan favourably with views of a similar nature in any part of the Commonwealth. It reminded me of the [[Valley of a Thousand Hills]], outside Durban, in South Africa.\"<ref>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16692533</ref>\n\nThe surrounding district is indeed rich in natural beauty<ref>http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/travel/destinations/2016/01/new-england-high-country-nsw</ref>, although many areas have been degraded by clearing for pastoralism and forestry<ref>https://books.google.com.au/books?id=330yDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT278&lpg=PT278&dq=new+england+%22dieback%22+charles+massy</ref>.

Stone Axe has also recently acquired \"Alfreda\" in the nearby locality of Wongwibinda. <ref>http://www.stoneaxepastoral.com.au/operations/</ref>\n\nThe main tourist attractions are [[Ebor Falls]], the cool temperate rain forest walks in [[New England National Park]] and recreational trout fishing. The Dutton Trout Hatchery on [[Point Lookout (New South Wales)|Point Lookout]] Road was established in 1950 and is one of the largest hatcheries in the state. Visitors can see the various stages of trout development prior to their release in the mountain streams.<ref>New England County Tourist Assoc., New England County, Summerland Printers, Ballina, n.d.</ref>  However, the release of trout into local streams is believed to have led to decline of the endangered [[Tusked frog]]. <ref> http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=10032</ref>\n\nThere are two easy walks close to the village. One takes walkers through the {{convert|40|ha}} recreation reserve. This walk follows the Guy Fawkes River upstream for about half of the walk. Some bird life can be seen with typical degraded open grazing land and river views. The second walk is accessed by crossing the Guy Fawkes River bridge<ref>https://www.clanmaclennan-worldwide.com/genealogy/clan_histories/Armidale-GraftonRoad/files/mobile/index.html#67</ref> and following the pedestrian path which winds downstream under the bridge. This path follows the Guy Fawkes River north and meets the national park's Upper and Lower Falls paths. Numerous wallabies, kangaroos and bird life can be seen. [[Platypus]] have also been sighted in the pool above the falls. The Upper and Lower Falls are at their most spectacular after heavy rain when the local topsoil can be seen washing away to the sea. They can also be very picturesque with moderate flows when the water at the top falls cascades in lacy sheets of brilliant white. Early morning and evening are the best times for photography. Both walks take less than 1 hour, with most of the distance being wheelchair accessible, albeit with assistance.\n\nThe [[Bicentennial National Trail]] passes through Ebor.\n\n[[Ebor Falls]] offers opportunities for [[rock climbing]] described as \"holding a rather special place in the History of New England climbing\".<ref>https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/australia/ebor-gorge</ref> It is also an excellent location for highlining [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slacklining#Highlining]].\n\n==Speeding and Traffic==\n\nEbor has a noted problem with speeding vehicles.

In 330 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] invaded the land after defeating [[Darius III]] of [[Greater Iran|Persia]] in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Much of Afghanistan became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] followed by the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. The area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] had been given by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] and became part of the [[Maurya Empire]]. The land was inhabited by various tribes and ruled by many different kingdoms for the next two millenniums. Before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|arrival of Islam]] in the 7th century, there were a number of religions practiced in ancient Afghanistan, including [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Surya]] worship, [[Paganism]], [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhism]].

Urban civilization, which includes modern-day Afghanistan, North India, and [[Pakistan]], may have begun as early as 3000 to 2000 BC.<ref name=\"Dupree\"/> Archaeological finds indicate the possible beginnings of the Bronze Age, which would ultimately spread throughout the ancient world from Afghanistan.

There are several smaller IVC colonies to be found in Afghanistan.\n\n==Aryans and the Medes rule (1500 BC&ndash;551 BC)==\n{{Main article|Aryan|Medes}}\n[[Image:Median empire map.png|thumb|300px|Territory control by the '''[[Median Empire]]'''.]]\nBetween 2000&ndash;1200 BC, a branch of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-speaking tribes known as the [[Aryan]]s began migrating into the region. This is part of a dispute in regards to the  [[Indo-Aryan migration|Aryan invasion theory]]. They appear to have split into [[Iranic]] peoples, [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] groups at an early stage, possibly between 1500 and 1000 BC in what is today Afghanistan or much earlier as eastern remnants of the [[Indo-Aryans]] drifted much further west as with the [[Mitanni]]. The Iranians dominated the modern day plateau, while the Indo-Aryans ultimately headed towards the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Avesta]] is believed to have been composed possibly as early as 1800 BC and written in ancient [[Ariana]] (Aryana), the earliest name of Afghanistan which indicates an early link with today's Iranian tribes to the west, or adjacent regions in Central Asia or northeastern Iran in the 6th century BC.<ref>[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/EJVS-7-3.pdf Autochthonous Aryans-corr.doc<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Due to the similarity between early Avestan and [[Sanskrit]] (and other related early Indo-European languages such as [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]]), it is believed that the split between the old Persians and Indo-Aryan tribes had taken place at least by 1000 BC. There are striking similarities between [[Avestan]] and [[Sanskrit]], which may support the notion that the split was contemporary with the Indo-Aryans living in Afghanistan at a very early stage. Also, the Avesta itself divides into Old and New sections and neither mention the [[Medes]] who are known to have ruled Afghanistan starting around 700 BC. This suggests an early time-frame for the Avesta that has yet to be exactly determined as most academics believe it was written over the course of centuries if not millennia. Much of the archaeological data comes from the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex]] (BMAC and [[Indus Valley Civilization]]) that probably played a key role in early Aryanic civilization in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Medes, a Western Persian people, arrived from what is today [[Kurdistan]] sometime around the 700s BC and came to dominate most of ancient Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They were an early tribe that forged the first empire on the present Iranian plateau and were rivals of the Persians whom they initially dominated in the province of [[Fars Province|Fars]] to the south. Median domination of parts of far off Afghanistan would last until the [[Persian people|Persians]] challenged and ultimately replaced them from rule.\n\n==Achaemenid invasion and Zoroastrianism (550 BC&ndash;331 BC)==\n{{Main article|Achaemenid Empire}}\n[[File:Afghanistan region during 500 BC.jpg|thumb|[[Arachosia]], [[Aria]] and [[Bactria]] were the ancient more eastern [[satrap]]s of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] that made up most of what is now Afghanistan during 500 B.C. The inhabitants of Arachosia were known as Pactyans, possibly today's [[Pashtun people|Pakhtuns]] or Pashtuns.]]\nThe city of [[Bactria]] (which later became [[Balkh]]), is believed to have been the home of [[Zoroaster|Zarathustra]], who founded the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion. The [[Avesta]] refers to eastern Bactria as being the home of the Zoroastrian faith, but this can be a reference to either a region in modern Afghanistan or Border line of Afghan-Pakistan. Regardless of the debate as to where Zoroaster was from, Zoroastrianism spread to become one of the world's most influential religions and became the main faith of the old Aryan people for centuries. It also remained the official religion of Persia until the defeat of the Sassanian ruler [[Yazdegerd III]]\u2014over a thousand years after its founding\u2014by Muslim [[Arabs]]. In what is today southern Iran, the Persians emerged to challenge Median supremacy on the Iranian plateau. By 550 BC, the Persians had replaced Median rule with their own dominion and even began to expand past previous Median imperial borders. Both [[Gandhara]] and [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] Mahajanapadas of the Buddhist texts soon fell a prey to the Achaemenian Dynasty during the reign of Achaemenid, [[Cyrus the Great]] (558&ndash;530 BC), or in the first year of [[Darius I]], marking the region or of the eastern-most provinces of the empire, located partly in nowadays Afghanistan. According to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s evidence, Cyrus the Great (Cyrus II) had destroyed Kapisa in Capiscene<ref>Naturalis Historia, VI, 25, 92</ref> which was a Kamboja city. The former region of Gandhara and Kamboja (upper Indus) had constituted seventh satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire and annually contributed 170 talents of gold dust as a tribute to the Achaemenids.\n\n[[Bactria]] had a special position in old Afghanistan, being the capital of a vice-kingdom. By the 4th century BC, Persian control of outlying areas and the internal cohesion of the empire had become somewhat tenuous. Although distant provinces like Bactriana had often been restless under Achaemenid rule, Bactrian troops nevertheless fought in the decisive [[Battle of Gaugamela]] in 330 BC against the advancing armies of [[Alexander the Great]]. The Achaemenids were decisively defeated by Alexander and retreated from his advancing army of Greco-Macedonians and their allies. [[Darius III]], the last Achaemenid ruler, tried to flee to Bactria but was assassinated by a subordinate lord, the Bactrian-born [[Bessus]], who proclaimed himself the new ruler of Persia as Artaxerxes (V). Bessus was unable to mount a successful resistance to the growing military might of Alexander's army so he fled to his native Bactria, where he attempted to rally local tribes to his side but was instead turned over to Alexander who proceeded to have him tortured and executed for having committed [[regicide]].\n\n==Alexander the Great to Greco-Bactrian rule (330 BC&ndash;ca. 150 BC)==\n{{Main article|Alexander the Great}}\n[[File:Map-alexander-empire.png|thumb|Empire of [[Alexander the Great]]]]\nMoving thousands of kilometers eastward from recently subdued Persia, the Macedonian leader [[Alexander the Great]], encountered fierce resistance from the local tribes of [[Aria|Aria (satrapy)]], Drangiana, [[Arachosia]] (South and Eastern Afghanistan, North-West Pakistan) and Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan).\n\nUpon Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire, which had never been politically consolidated, broke apart as his companions began to divide it amongst themselves. Alexander's cavalry commander, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], took nominal control of the eastern lands and founded the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] dynasty. Under the Seleucids, as under Alexander, Greek colonists and soldiers colonized Bactria, roughly corresponding to modern Afghanistan's borders. However, the majority of Macedonian soldiers of Alexander the Great wanted to leave the east and return home to Greece. Later, Seleucus sought to guard his eastern frontier and moved [[Ionia]]n Greeks (also known as [[Yavanas]] to many local groups) to Bactria in the 3rd century BC.\n\n===Maurya Empire===\n{{Main article|Maurya Empire}}\n[[File:Maurya Empire, c.250 BCE 2.png|thumb|upright|Maurya Empire at its maximum extent]] \n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|upright|Bilingual edict ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by Emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]], from [[Kandahar]] - [[Afghan National Museum]]. (Click image for translation).]]\nWhile the [[Diadochi]] were warring amongst themselves, the [[Mauryan dynasty|Mauryan Empire]] was developing in the northern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The founder of the empire, [[Chandragupta Maurya]], confronted a Macedonian invasion force led by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]] in 305 BC and following a brief conflict, an agreement was reached as Seleucus ceded [[Gandhara]] and [[Arachosia]] (centered around ancient [[Kandahar]]) and areas south of [[Bagram]] (corresponding to the extreme south-east of modern Afghanistan) to the Mauryans. During the 120 years of the Mauryans in southern Afghanistan, Buddhism was introduced and eventually become a major religion alongside Zoroastrianism and local pagan beliefs. The ancient Grand Trunk Road was built linking what is now Kabul to various cities in the Punjab and the Gangetic Plain. Commerce, art, and architecture (seen especially in the construction of [[stupa]]s) developed during this period. It reached its high point under Emperor Ashoka whose edicts, roads, and rest stops were found throughout the subcontinent. Although the vast majority of them throughout the subcontinent were written in Prakrit, Afghanistan is notable for the inclusion of 2 Greek and Aramaic ones alongside the court language of the Mauryans.\n\nInscriptions made by the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]], a fragment of [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict 13]] in Greek, as well as a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic has been discovered in [[Kandahar]]. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word [[Eusebeia]] (\"[[Piety]]\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \"[[Dharma]]\" of his other Edicts written in [[Prakrit]]:\n:\"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (Ashoka) made known (the doctrine of) Piety (''\u03b5\u1f50\u03c3\u03ad\u03b2\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1'', [[Eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world. And the king abstains from (killing) living beings, and other men and those who (are) huntsmen and fishermen of the king have desisted from hunting.

[[Graeco-Bactrian]] rule spread until it included a large territory which stretched from Turkmenistan in the west to the Punjab in India in the east by about 170 BC. [[Graeco-Bactrian]] rule was eventually defeated by a combination of internecine disputes that plagued Greek and Hellenized rulers to the west, continual conflict with Indian kingdoms, as well as the pressure of two groups of nomadic invaders from Central Asia\u2014the [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sakas]].\n\n==Kushan Empire (150 BC&ndash;300 AD)==\n{{Main article|Kushan Empire}}\n[[File:Coin of Heraios.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver tetradrachm of Kushan king [[Heraios]] (1&ndash;30&nbsp;AD) in [[Greco-Bactrian]] style, with horseman crowned by the Greek goddess of victory [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].<br>Greek legend: \u03a4V\u03a1\u0391\u039d\u039d\u039fV\u039f\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u0397\u039b\u039fV - \u03a3\u039b\u039d\u039b\u0392 - \u039a\u039f\u00de\u00de\u0391\u039d\u039f\u03a5 \"Of the [[Tyrant]] Heraios, Sanav, the Kushan\" (the meaning of \"Sanav\" is unknown).]]\nIn the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the [[Parthia|Parthians]], a nomadic [[Iranian peoples]], arrived in Western Asia. While they made large inroads into the modern-day territory of Afghanistan, about 100 years later another Indo-European group from the north\u2014the Kushans (a subgroup of the tribe called the [[Yuezhi]] by the [[China|Chinese]])\u2014entered the region of Afghanistan and established an empire lasting almost four centuries, which would dominate most of the Afghanistan region.\n\nThe [[Kushan Empire]] spread from the [[Kabul River]] valley to defeat other Central Asian tribes that had previously conquered parts of the northern central Iranian Plateau once ruled by the Parthians. By the middle of the 1st century BC, the Kushans' base of control became Afghanistan and their empire spanned from the north of the [[Pamirs|Pamir mountains]] to the [[Ganges|Ganges river valley]] in India. Early in the 2nd century under [[Kanishka]], the most powerful of the Kushan rulers, the empire reached its greatest geographic and cultural breadth to become a center of literature and art. Kanishka extended Kushan control to the mouth of the Indus River on the [[Arabian Sea]], into [[Kashmir]], and into what is today the Chinese-controlled area north of [[Tibet]]. Kanishka was a patron of religion and the arts. It was during his reign that Buddhism, which was promoted in northern [[India]] earlier by the [[Mauryan dynasty|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]] (c. 260 BC&ndash;232 BC), reached its zenith in Central Asia. Though the Kushanas supported local Buddhists and Hindus as well as the worship of various local deities.\n\n== Sasanian & Hephthalite invasions (300&ndash;650) ==\n{{Main article|Sassanid Empire|Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom}}\n[[File:HormizdI.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Hormizd I Kushanshah]], issued in Khorasan, and derived from [[Kushan]] designs]]\nIn the 3rd century, Kushan control fragmented into semi-independent kingdoms that became easy targets for conquest by the rising Iranian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sasanians]] (c. 224&ndash;561) which annexed Afghanistan by 300 AD. In these far off eastern-most territories, they established vassal kings as rulers, known as the [[Kushanshahs]]. Sasanian control was tenuous at times as numerous challenges from Central Asian tribes led to instability and constant warfare in the region.\n\nThe disunited Kushan and Sasanian kingdoms were in a poor position to meet the threat several waves of [[Xionite]]/[[Huna people|Huna]] invaders from the north from the 4th century onwards. In particular, the [[Hephthalite]]s (or ''Ebodalo''; [[Bactrian language|Bactrian script]] \u03b7\u03b2\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf) swept out of Central Asia during the 5th century into [[Bactria]] and Iran, overwhelming the last of the Kushan kingdoms.<!-- Relevance of the following?  Some have speculated that the name ''Afghanistan land of the Afghans'' derives from which could be an adjective such as brave, chivlarious, valour, which was to use for the people in today's Afghanistan. --> Historians believe that Hephthalite control continued for a century and was marked by constant warfare with the Sassanians to the west who exerted nominal control over the region.\nBy the middle of the 6th century the Hephthalites were defeated in the territories north of the [[Amu Darya]] (the Oxus River of antiquity) by another group of Central Asian nomads, the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]], and by the resurgent Sassanians in the lands south of the Amu Darya. It was the ruler of western G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, Sijin (a.k.a.

The Turkic Shahi regency was overthrown and replaced by a [[Mohyal]] Shahi dynasty of Brahmins who began the first phase of the [[Hindu Shahi Hindu Shahi dynasty]].\n\nThese [[Hindu Shahi|Hindu kings]] of Kabul and Gandhara may have had links to some ruling families in neighboring [[Kashmir]] and other areas to the east. The Shahis were rulers of predominantly [[Buddhist]], [[Zoroastrian]], [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] populations and were thus patrons of numerous faiths, and various artifacts and coins from their rule have been found that display their multicultural domain. In 964 AD, the last Mohyal Shahi was succeeded by the [[Janjua]] overlord, Jayapala, of the [[Pandavas|Panduvanshi]] dynasty. The last Shahi emperors [[Jayapala]], [[Anandapala]] and Tirlochanpala fought the Muslim [[Ghaznavids]] of [[Ghazni Province|Ghazna]] and were gradually defeated. Their remaining army were eventually exiled into northern India.\n\n==Archaeological remnants==\n[[File:BamyanBuddha Smaller 1.jpg|150px|thumb|One of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhism]] was widespread in the region before the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].]]\n\nMost of the Zoroastrian, Greek, Hellenistic, Buddhist, Hindu and other indigenous cultures were replaced by the coming of Islam and little influence remains in Afghanistan today.

The two massive sandstone [[Buddhas of Bamyan]], thirty-five and fifty-three meters high overlooked the ancient route through [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] to [[Balkh]] and dated from the 3rd and 5th centuries.

The effect is greatly exaggerated in this diagram.]]\nIn [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[General relativity| general theory of relativity]], the '''gravitational redshift'''\nis the phenomenon that clocks in a gravitational field tick slower when observed by a distant observer. More specifically the term refers to the shift of wavelength of a [[photon]] to longer wavelength (the red side in an [[optical spectrum]]) when observed from a point in a lower gravitational field. In the latter case the 'clock' is the frequency of the photon and a lower frequency is the same as a longer (\"redder\") wavelength. \n\nThe gravitational redshift is a simple consequence of\nEinstein's [[equivalence principle]] (\"all bodies fall with the same acceleration, \nindependent of their composition\") and was found by Einstein eight years before\nthe full theory of relativity.\n\nObserving the gravitational redshift in the solar system is one of the [[classical tests of general relativity]].\nGravitational redshifts are an important effect in satellite-based navigation systems such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. If the effects of general relativity were not taken into account, such systems would not work at all.\n\n==Prediction by the equivalence principle and general relativity==\nEinstein's theory of general relativity incorporates the [[equivalence principle]], which can be stated in various different ways. One such statement is that gravitational effects are locally undetectable for a free-falling observer. Therefore, in a laboratory experiment at the surface of the earth, all gravitational effects should be equivalent to the effects that would have been observed if the laboratory had been accelerating through outer space at ''g''. One consequence is a gravitational [[Doppler effect]]. If a light pulse is emitted at the floor of the laboratory, then a free-falling observer says that by the time it reaches the ceiling, the ceiling has accelerated away from it, and therefore when observed by a detector fixed to the ceiling, it will be observed to have been Doppler shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. This shift, which the free-falling observer considers to be a kinematical Doppler shift, is thought of by the laboratory observer as a gravitational redshift. Such an effect was verified in the 1959 [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]]. In a case such as this, where the gravitational field is uniform, the change in wavelength is given by\n\n<math>\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{\\lambda}\\approx \\frac{g\\Delta y}{c^2},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Delta y</Math> is the change in height. Since this prediction arises directly from the equivalence principle, it does not require any of the mathematical apparatus of general relativity, and its verification does not specifically support general relativity over any other theory that incorporates the equivalence principle.\n\nWhen the field is not uniform, the simplest and most useful case to consider is that of a spherically symmetric field. By [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], such a field is described in general relativity by the [[Schwarzschild metric]], <math>d\\tau^2=(1-r_s/R)dt^2+\\ldots</math>, where <math>d\\tau</math> is the clock time of an observer at distance ''R'' from the center, <math>dt</math> is the time measured by an observer at infinity, <math>r_s</math> is the Schwarzschild radius <math>2GM/c^2</math>, \"...\" represents terms that vanish if the observer is at rest, <math>G</math> is Newton's [[gravitational constant]], <math>M</math> the [[mass]] of the gravitating body, and <math>c</math> the [[speed of light]]. The result is that frequencies and wavelengths are shifted according to the ratio\n\n<math>\\frac{\\lambda_\\infty}{\\lambda_e}=(1-r_s/R_e)^{-1/2},</math>\n\nwhere \n<math>\\lambda_\\infty\\,</math> is the wavelength of the light as measured by the observer at infinity,\n<math>\\lambda_e\\,</math> is the wavelength measured at the source of emission, and <math>R_e</math> radius at which the photon is emitted. This can be related to the redshift parameter conventionally defined as <math>z=\\lambda_\\infty/\\lambda_e-1</math>.  In the case where neither the emitter nor the observer is at infinity, the [[Transitive relation|transitivity]] of Doppler shifts allows us to generalize the result to <math>\\lambda_1/\\lambda_2=[(1-r_s/R_1)/(1-r_s/R_2)]^{1/2}</math>. The redshift formula for the frequency <math>\\nu = c/\\lambda</math> is <math>\\nu_o/\\nu_e=\\lambda_e/\\lambda_o</math>. When <math>R_1-R_2</math> is small, these results are consistent with the equation given above based on the equivalence principle. \n\nFor an object compact enough to have an [[event horizon]], the redshift is not defined for photons emitted inside the Schwarzschild radius, both because signals cannot escape from inside the horizon and because an object such as the emitter cannot be stationary inside the horizon, as was assumed above. Therefore, this formula only applies when <math>R_e</math> is larger than <math>r_s</math>. When the photon is emitted at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius, the redshift will be ''infinitely'' large, and it will not escape to ''any'' finite distance from the Schwarzschild sphere. When the photon is emitted at an infinitely large distance, there is no redshift.\n\nIn the Newtonian limit, i.e. when <math>R_e</math> is sufficiently large compared to the Schwarzschild radius <math>r_s</math>, the redshift can be approximated as\n\n<math>z\\approx\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{r_s}{R_e} = \\frac{GM}{c^2R_e}</math>\n\n==Experimental verification==\n===Initial observations of gravitational redshift of white dwarf stars===\nA number of experimenters initially claimed to have identified the effect using astronomical measurements, and the effect was considered to have been finally identified in the spectral lines of the star [[Sirius B]] by [[Walter Sydney Adams|W.S.

The effect of gravity on light was then explored by [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] (1801), who calculated the amount of deflection of a light ray by the sun, arriving at the Newtonian answer which is half the value predicted by [[general relativity]]. All of this early work assumed that light could slow down and fall, which was inconsistent with the modern understanding of light waves.\n\nOnce it became accepted that light was an electromagnetic wave, it was clear that the frequency of light should not change from place to place, since waves from a source with a fixed frequency keep the same frequency everywhere. One way around this conclusion would be if time itself were altered\u2014if clocks at different points had different rates.\n\nThis was precisely [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] conclusion in 1911. He considered an accelerating box, and noted that according to the [[special theory of relativity]], the clock rate at the bottom of the box was slower than the clock rate at the top. Nowadays, this can be easily shown in [[Rindler space|accelerated coordinates]]. The metric tensor in [[natural units|units where the speed of light is one]] is:\n\n:<math>\nds^2 = - r^2 dt^2 + dr^2\n\\,</math>\n\nand for an observer at a constant value of r, the rate at which a clock ticks, R(r), is the square root of the time coefficient, R(r)=r. The acceleration at position r is equal to the curvature of the hyperbola at fixed r, and like the curvature of the nested circles in polar coordinates, it is equal to 1/r.\n\nSo at a fixed value of g, the fractional rate of change of the clock-rate, the percentage change in the ticking at the top of an accelerating box vs at the bottom, is:\n\n:<math>\n{R(r+dr) - R(r) \\over R} = {dr\\over r} = g dr\n\\,</math>\n\nThe rate is faster at larger values of R, away from the apparent direction of acceleration. The rate is zero at r=0, which is the location of the [[horizon|acceleration horizon]].\n\nUsing the equivalence principle, Einstein concluded that the same thing holds in any gravitational field, that the rate of clocks R at different heights was altered according to the gravitational field g. When g is slowly varying, it gives the fractional rate of change of the ticking rate. If the ticking rate is everywhere almost this same, the fractional rate of change is the same as the absolute rate of change, so that:\n:<math>\n{dR \\over dx} = g = - {dV\\over dx}\n\\,</math>\n\nSince the rate of clocks and the gravitational potential have the same derivative, they are the same up to a constant. The constant is chosen to make the clock rate at infinity equal to 1. Since the gravitational potential is zero at infinity:\n:<math>\nR(x)= 1 - {V(x) \\over c^2}\n\\,</math>\nwhere the speed of light has been restored to make the gravitational potential dimensionless.\n\nThe coefficient of the <math>dt^2</math> in the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] is the square of the clock rate, which for small values of the potential is given by keeping only the linear term:\n:<math>\nR^2 = 1 - 2V\n\\,</math>\n\nand the full metric tensor is:\n\n:<math>\nds^2 = - \\left( 1 - {2V(r)\\over c^2} \\right) c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2\n</math>\n\nwhere again the C's have been restored. This expression is correct in the full theory of general relativity, to lowest order in the gravitational field, and ignoring the variation of the space-space and space-time components of the metric tensor, which only affect fast moving objects.\n\nUsing this approximation, Einstein reproduced the incorrect Newtonian value for the deflection of light in 1909. But since a light beam is a fast moving object, the space-space components contribute too. After constructing the full theory of general relativity in 1916, Einstein solved for the space-space components in a [[post-Newtonian approximation]] and calculated the correct amount of light deflection \u2013 double the Newtonian value. Einstein's prediction was confirmed by many experiments, starting with [[Arthur Eddington]]'s 1919 solar eclipse expedition.\n\nThe changing rates of clocks allowed Einstein to conclude that light waves change frequency as they move, and the frequency/energy relationship for photons allowed him to see that this was best interpreted as the effect of the gravitational field on the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass\u2013energy]] of the photon. To calculate the changes in frequency in a nearly static gravitational field, only the time component of the metric tensor is important, and the lowest order approximation is accurate enough for ordinary stars and planets, which are much bigger than their [[Schwarzschild radius]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tests of general relativity]]\n* [[Equivalence principle]]\n* [[Gravitational time dilation]]\n* [[Redshift]]\n*[[Very Large Telescope]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Primary sources==\n* {{Cite journal\n|last=Michell, John\n|date=1784\n|title=On the means of discovering the distance, magnitude etc. of the fixed stars\n|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\n|pages = 35\u201357\n|doi=10.1098/rstl.1784.0008\n|volume=74\n}}\n\n* {{Cite book\n|last=Laplace, Pierre-Simon\n|date=1796\n|title=The system of the world (English translation 1809)\n|volume=2\n|pages = 366\u2013368\n|location=London\n|publisher=Richard Phillips\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=f7Kv2iFUNJoC}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n|last=Soldner, Johann Georg von\n|date=1804\n|title=[[s:On the Deflection of a Light Ray from its Rectilinear Motion|On the deflection of a light ray from its rectilinear motion, by the attraction of a celestial body at which it nearly passes by]]\n|journal=Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch\n|pages =161\u2013172}}\n\n* Albert Einstein, \"Relativity: the Special and General Theory.\" [[gutenberg:5001|(@Project Gutenberg)]].\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Pound | first1 = R.V. | last2 = Rebka | first2 = G.A. | last3 = Jr | first3 =  | year = 1959 | title = Gravitational Red-Shift in Nuclear Resonance | url = | journal = Phys.

The Rising was launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent [[Irish Republic]] while the United Kingdom was heavily engaged in the [[First World War]]. It was the most significant [[List of Irish uprisings|uprising in Ireland]] since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]], and the first armed action of the [[Irish revolutionary period]].\n\nOrganised by a seven-man Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]],<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RhCAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22military+council%22+irb&q=%22military+council%22+&pgis=1#search_anchor ''Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916'']\nFrancis X. Martin 1967 p105</ref> the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916, and lasted for six days. Members of the [[Irish Volunteers]]\u2014led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist [[Patrick Pearse]], joined by the smaller [[Irish Citizen Army]] of [[James Connolly]] and 200 women of [[Cumann na mBan]]\u2014seized key locations in [[Dublin]] and [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed an Irish Republic]]. The [[British Army]] brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was fierce street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels put up stiff resistance, slowing the British advance and inflicting heavy casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland, with attacks on the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks at [[Ashbourne, County Meath|Ashbourne]], [[County Meath]], [[County Cork]] and in [[County Galway]], and the seizure of the town of [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]]. [[German Empire|Germany]] had sent a shipment of arms to the rebels, but the British had intercepted it just before the Rising began. Volunteer leader [[Eoin MacNeill]] had then issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.\n\nWith much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued until Sunday, when word reached the other rebel positions. After the surrender the country remained under [[martial law]]. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British, many of whom had played no part in the Rising, and 1,800 of them were sent to [[internment]] camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicanism]] back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly 50 years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. It, and the British reaction to it, led to increased popular support for Irish independence. In December 1918, republicans, represented by the reconstituted [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, won 73 seats in a [[landslide victory]] in [[Irish general election, 1918|the general election]] to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. They [[abstentionism|did not take their seats]], but instead convened the [[First D\u00e1il]] and declared the independence of the Irish Republic. The [[Soloheadbeg ambush]] started the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]].\n\n485 people were killed in the Easter Rising. About 54% were civilians, 30% were British military and police, and 16% were Irish rebels. More than 2,600 were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed as a result of the British using artillery and heavy machine guns, or mistaking civilians for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire in a crowded city. The shelling and the fires it caused left parts of inner city Dublin in ruins.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Irish Citizen Army Group Liberty Hall Dublin 1914.jpg|thumb|Members of the Irish Citizen Army outside [[Liberty Hall]], under the slogan \"We serve neither [[George V|King]] nor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]], but Ireland\"]]\nThe [[Acts of Union 1800]] united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], abolishing the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and giving Ireland representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].

The [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893 was passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but rejected by the [[House of Lords]].\n\nAfter the fall of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism.

IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.<ref>Macardle, p. 119</ref>\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I, [[Roger Casement]] and [[Clan na Gael]] leader [[John Devoy]] met the German ambassador to the United States, [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], to discuss German backing for an uprising. Casement went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. He persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 25</ref> Casement also attempted to recruit an [[Irish Brigade (World War I)|Irish Brigade]], made up of Irish [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]], which would be armed and sent to Ireland to join the uprising.<ref>Townshend, p. 104</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 105</ref> However, only 56 men volunteered. Plunkett joined Casement in Germany the following year. Together, Plunkett and Casement presented a plan (the 'Ireland Report') in which a German [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] would land on the west coast of Ireland, while a rising in Dublin diverted the British forces so that the Germans, with the help of local Volunteers, could secure the line of the [[River Shannon]], before advancing on the capital.<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 30</ref> The German military rejected the plan, but agreed to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 25\u201328</ref>\n\n[[James Connolly]]\u2014head of the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. If they had done it alone, the IRB and the Volunteers would possibly have come to their aid;<ref>[[Eoin Neeson]], ''Myths from Easter 1916'', p. ?</ref> however, the IRB leaders met with Connolly in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. [[Thomas MacDonagh]] would later become the seventh and final member.\n\nThe death of the old [[Fenian]] leader [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]] in [[New York City|New York]] in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words \"[[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace]]\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\n==Build-up to Easter Week==\n[[File:Signatories of the Proclamation of the Republic.png|thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett]]\nIn early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of \"parades and manoeuvres\" beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers' Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.\n\nOn 9 April, the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]] dispatched a ship for [[County Kerry]]. Disguised as a Norwegian ship called the ''[[SS Libau|Aud]]'', it was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine ''[[SM U-19 (Germany)|U-19]]''. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p.56</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April, Alderman [[Thomas Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|Tom Kelly]], a Sinn F\u00e9in member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the Corporation a document supposedly leaked from Dublin Castle, revealing that the British authorities planned to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises.<ref>Townshend, pp. 131\u2013132</ref> Although the British authorities said the \"Castle Document\" was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 47</ref> Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been [[Forgery|forged]] by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription.<ref>McGarry, p. 117</ref> That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the rank-and-file, or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 52</ref> MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in [[County Kerry]]. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.<ref>Michael Tierney, ''Eoin MacNeill'', pp. 199, 214</ref>\n\nThe ''Aud'' and the ''U-19'' reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The [[Royal Navy]] had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the ''Aud'', prompting the captain to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at [[Banna Strand]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned from Vol. [[Patrick Whelan]] that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and [[The O'Rahilly]], he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded in putting the rising off for only a day, although it greatly reduced the number of Volunteers who turned out.\n\n[[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement's return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 138</ref> The information was passed to the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], on 17 April, but without revealing its source, and Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 79</ref> When news reached Dublin of the capture of the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]]. Nathan proposed to raid [[Liberty Hall]], headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at [[Kimmage]], but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime Nathan telegraphed the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], in London seeking his approval.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, pp. 81\u201387</ref> By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 88</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill's countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 66</ref> Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\">[http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/chronology-of-the-easter-rising Chronology of the Easter Rising].

However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\">McGarry, p. 129</ref>\n\nShortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels' plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand]] to the south and the [[Royal Canal|Royal]] to the north, with the [[River Liffey]] running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebel's positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks.<ref>Dorney, John. ''The Story of the Easter Rising, 1916''. Green Lamp, 2010. p. 33</ref> The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner.<ref>McGarry, p. 133</ref> Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.<ref>McGarry, p. 135</ref>\n\nA joint force of about 400 Volunteers and Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott]] and [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Plunkett]].<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 41</ref> They marched to the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) on [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags. Pearse stood outside and read the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 192, 195</ref> Copies of the Proclamation were also pasted on walls and handed out to bystanders by Volunteers and newsboys.<ref>McGarry, p. 134</ref> The GPO would be the rebels' headquarters for most of the Rising. Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking [[O'Connell Bridge]]. They took over a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]] station and sent out a [[Radio broadcasting|radio broadcast]] in [[Morse code]], announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.<ref>McGee, John.

The 1st battalion, under [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Edward 'Ned' Daly]], occupied the [[Four Courts]] and surrounding buildings, while a company under [[Se\u00e1n Heuston]] occupied the [[Mendicity Institution]], across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], occupied [[Jacob's]] biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], occupied [[Boland's Mill]] and surrounding buildings. The 4th battalion, under [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]], occupied the [[House of Industry (Dublin)|South Dublin Union]] and the distillery on [[Marrowbone Lane]]. From each of these 'garrisons', small units of rebels established [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] in the surrounding area.<ref>McNally and Dennis, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] and [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt Street]] railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]] and the line was damaged by bombs at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Amiens Street]], [[Dublin Broadstone railway station|Broadstone]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge]] and [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]].<ref>McKenna, Joseph.

McFarland, 2011. p. 19</ref>\n\nAround midday, a small team of Volunteers and [[Fianna \u00c9ireann]] members swiftly captured the [[Magazine Fort]] in the [[Phoenix Park]] and disarmed the guards. The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not big enough to be heard across the city.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 48\u201350</ref> The 23-year-old son of the fort's commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/children-of-the-revolution/ \"Children of the Revolution\"].

As they approached the gate a lone and unarmed police sentry, James O'Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, he was the first casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom, but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall.

Two troops of British cavalry were sent to investigate what was happening. They took fire and casualties from rebel forces at the GPO and at the Four Courts.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 54\u201355</ref><ref name=\"Coffey, Thomas M. pp. 38, 44\">Coffey, Thomas M.

On Mount Street, a group of [[Volunteer Training Corps (World War I)|Volunteer Training Corps]] men stumbled upon the rebel position and four were killed before they reached [[Beggars Bush Barracks]].<ref>O'Brien, ''Blood on the Streets, the Battle for Mount Street'', pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe only substantial combat of the first day of the Rising took place at the South Dublin Union where a piquet from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684\u20131922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] encountered an outpost of \u00c9amonn Ceannt's force at the northwestern corner of the South Dublin Union. The British troops, after taking some casualties, managed to regroup and launch several assaults on the position before they forced their way inside and the small rebel force in the tin huts at the eastern end of the Union surrendered.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 76\u201380</ref> However, the Union complex as a whole remained in rebel hands. A nurse in uniform, Margaret Keogh, was shot dead by British soldiers at the Union.

Partly as a result of the police withdrawal, a wave of looting broke out in the city centre, especially in the are of O'Connell Street (still officially called \"Sackville Street\" at the time).

The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April. City Hall was taken from the rebel unit that had attacked Dublin Castle on Tuesday morning.<ref>Coogan 2001, p. 107</ref><ref name=\"Townshend p191\">Townshend, p. 191</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, 120 British soldiers, with machine-guns, occupied two buildings overlooking St Stephen's Green: the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] and United Services Club.<ref>Caulfield, p. 122</ref> At dawn they opened fire on the Citizen Army occupying the green. The rebels returned fire, but were forced to retreat to the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons]] building. They remained there for the rest of the week, exchanging fire with British forces.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nFighting erupted along the northern edge of the city centre on Tuesday afternoon. In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at [[Annesley Bridge]]. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured.<ref name=caulfield145>Caulfield, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> At [[Phibsborough]], in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road.

After a fierce firefight, the rebels withdrew.<ref name=caulfield145/> They later made an unsuccessful attack on troops at Broadstone railway station.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nThat afternoon, Pearse, walked out into O'Connell Street with a small escort and stood in front of Nelson's Pillar. As a large crowd gathered, he read out a '[[Wikisource:Manifesto to the Citizens of Dublin, 25 April, 1916|manifesto to the citizens of Dublin]]', calling on them to support the Rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 180</ref>\n\nThe rebels had failed to take either of Dublin's two main railway stations or either of its ports, at Dublin Port and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire|Kingstown]]. As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at [[the Curragh]] and [[Belfast]]. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/><ref>McGarry, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the northside of the city at Phibsborough and at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], and by the patrol vessel ''[[L\u00c9 Muirch\u00fa|Helga]]'', which sailed up the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], having been summoned from the port at Kingstown. On Wednesday, 26 April, the guns at Trinity College and ''Helga'' shelled Liberty Hall, and the Trinity College guns then began firing at rebel positions, first at Boland's Mill and then in O'Connell Street.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/> Some rebel commanders, particularly James Connolly, did not believe that the British would shell the '[[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]]' of the British Empire.<ref>McGarry, p. 192</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 181</ref>\n\n[[File:Osteraufstand - Dublin - britisches Milit\u00e4r.jpg|thumb|left|200px|British soldiers in position behind a stack of barrels during the Rising in Dublin]]\n\nThe principal rebel positions at the GPO, the Four Courts, Jacob's Factory and Boland's Mill saw little action. The British surrounded and bombarded them rather than assault them directly. One Volunteer in the GPO recalled, \"we did practically no shooting as there was no target\".<ref>McGarry, p. 175</ref> However, where the insurgents dominated the routes by which the British tried to funnel reinforcements into the city, there was fierce fighting.\n\nAt 5:25PM volunteers [[Eamon Martin (Irish Republican)|Eamon Martin]], Garry Holohan, Robert Beggs, Sean Cody, Dinny O'Callaghan, Charles Shelley, Peadar Breslin and five others attempted to occupy Broadstone railway station on Church Street, the attack was unsuccessful and Martin was injured.<ref>Witness Statement by Eamon Martin to Bureau of Military History, 1951</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Sean Cody to Bureau of Military History, 1954</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Nicholas Kaftan to Bureau of Military History</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Charles Shelley to Bureau of Military History, 1953</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday morning, hundreds of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institute, which was occupied by 26 Volunteers under Se\u00e1n Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston's men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.<ref>O'Brien, Paul.

Heavy fighting occurred at the rebel-held positions around the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] as these troops advanced towards Dublin. More than 1,000 [[Sherwood Foresters]] were repeatedly caught in a cross-fire trying to cross the canal at Mount Street Bridge. Seventeen Volunteers were able to severely disrupt the British advance, killing or wounding 240 men.<ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, p. 122</ref> Despite there being alternative routes across the canal nearby, General Lowe ordered repeated frontal assaults on the Mount Street position.<ref>Caulfield, p. 196</ref> The British eventually took the position, which had not been reinforced by the nearby rebel garrison at Boland's Mills, on Thursday,<ref>O'Brien, p. 69</ref> but the fighting there inflicted up to two thirds of their casualties for the entire week for a cost of just four dead Volunteers.<ref>McGarry, p. 173</ref> It had taken nearly nine hours for the British to advance {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday [[Linenhall barracks]] on [[Constitution Hill, Dublin|Constitution Hill]] was burnt down under the orders of Commandant Edward Daly to prevent its reoccupation by the British army.<ref>http://www.easter1916.ie/index.php/places/a-z/linenhall-barracks/</ref>\n\n===Thursday to Saturday===\nThe rebel position at the South Dublin Union (site of the present day [[St. James's Hospital]]) and Marrowbone Lane, further west along the canal, also inflicted heavy losses on British troops. The South Dublin Union was a large complex of buildings and there was vicious fighting around and inside the buildings. [[Cathal Brugha]], a rebel officer, distinguished himself in this action and was badly wounded. By the end of the week, the British had taken some of the buildings in the Union, but others remained in rebel hands.<ref>Caulfield, pp. 225\u2013228</ref> British troops also took casualties in unsuccessful frontal assaults on the Marrowbone Lane Distillery.<ref>Ryan, pp. 128\u2013133</ref>\n\n[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"Birth of the Irish Republic\" by Walter Paget, depicting the GPO during the shelling]]\n\nThe third major scene of fighting during the week was in the area of North King Street, north of the Four Courts. The rebels had established strong outposts in the area, occupying numerous small buildings and barricading the streets. From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to take the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a [[Charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]] on one of the barricades, but was cut down by rebel fire.

In addition, because of the interception of the German arms aboard the ''Aud'', the provincial Volunteer units were very poorly armed.\n\nIn the south, around 1,200 Volunteers mustered in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], under [[Tom\u00e1s Mac Curtain]], on the Sunday, but they dispersed on Wednesday after receiving nine contradictory orders by dispatch from the Volunteer leadership in Dublin. At their Sheares Street headquarters, some of the Volunteers engaged in a standoff with British forces.

The other brothers were arrested. Most of those arrested were held at [[Richmond Barracks]], Dublin.\n\nA series of [[Court-martial|courts-martial]] began on 2 May, in which 187 people were tried, most of them at Richmond Barracks. The president of the courts-martial was [[Charles Blackader]]. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts-martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal.<ref name=foy294/> Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, a conflict of interest that the Military Manual prohibited.<ref name=foy294/> Only one of those tried by courts-martial was a woman, [[Constance Markievicz]], who was also the only woman to be kept in solitary confinement.<ref name=foy294/> Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]]) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and were [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] at [[Kilmainham Gaol]] between 3 and 12 May. Among them was the seriously wounded Connolly, who was shot while tied to a chair because of his shattered ankle. Maxwell stated that only the \"ringleaders\" and those proven to have committed \"coldblooded murder\" would be executed. However, the evidence presented was weak, and some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone: [[Willie Pearse]] described himself as \"a personal attach\u00e9 to my brother, Patrick Pearse\"; [[John MacBride]] had not even been aware of the Rising until it began, but had fought against the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] fifteen years before; [[Thomas Kent]] did not come out at all\u2014he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising.

Although they did not receive as much attention as the executions, they sparked outrage among the Irish public and were raised by Irish MPs in Parliament.\n\nOne incident was the 'Portobello killings'. On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and [[human shield]]. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Bryan|title=A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst|date=2015|publisher=Thena Press}}</ref> The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, Richard O'Carroll. When Major Sir [[Francis Vane]] learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed [[Herbert Kitchener]], who told General [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]].

On the night of 28\u201329 April, British soldiers of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed 15 male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, then secretly buried some of them in cellars or back yards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. General Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that \"the rebels wore no uniform\" and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents \"are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this\" and that \"Under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint\". A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers \"had orders not to take any prisoners\" but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner's inquest found that soldiers had killed \"unarmed and unoffending\" residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.<ref>McGarry, p. 187</ref><ref>Caulfield, pp. 338\u2013340</ref><ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, pp. 152\u2013155</ref><ref>Townshend, pp. 293\u2013294</ref><ref>Dorney, John.

It began hearings on 18 May under the chairmanship of [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Hardinge of Penshurst]]. The Commission heard evidence from Sir Matthew Nathan, Augustine Birrell, Lord Wimborne, Sir [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]] (Inspector-General of the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]]), General [[Lovick Friend]], Major Ivor Price of Military Intelligence and others.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, Leon, ''Dublin Castle & the 1916 Rising'' pp. 153\u2013159</ref> The report, published on 26 June, was critical of the Dublin administration, saying that \"Ireland for several years had been administered on the principle that it was safer and more expedient to leave the law in abeyance if collision with any faction of the Irish people could thereby be avoided.\"<ref>Townshend p. 297</ref> Birrell and Nathan had resigned immediately after the Rising.

Historian [[Keith Jeffery]] noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their Army allowances.<ref>Kennedy, p. 286</ref> Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209</ref> Supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.<ref>\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they\u2019ll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting\u2019s too good for them. Trying to stir up trouble for us all.'\" [[Ernie O\u2019Malley]], ''On Another Man's Wound'', p. 60.</ref> When occupying positions in the South Dublin Union and Jacob's factory, the rebels got involved in physical confrontations with civilians who tried to tear down the rebel barricades and prevent them taking over buildings.

After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as \"murderers\" and \"starvers of the people\".<ref>McGarry, p. 252</ref> Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being \"subjected to very ugly remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes\" as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the [[Kilmainham]] area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.<ref>Ryan, p. 135</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf|title = Witness statement of Robert Holland|website = Bureau of Military History|accessdate= 14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting on Westland Row (8505718647).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Crowds in Dublin waiting to welcome republican prisoners released in 1917]]\nHowever, some Dubliners expressed support for the rebels.<ref name=\"mcgarry252-256\">McGarry, pp. 252\u2013256</ref> Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, \"there was a vast amount of sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated\".<ref>Ellis, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking \"Shure, we cheer them.

Dublin businessman and [[Quaker]] [[James G. Douglas]], for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically during the course of the Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.<ref>{{cite book|editor=J.

He would also go on to write ''lament for [[Thomas MacDonagh]]'' for his fallen friend and fellow Irish Volunteer.\n\nA few months after the Easter Rising, [[W. B. Yeats]] commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem ''[[Easter, 1916]]''.\n\nSome of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]]; their graves in Dublin's former military prison of [[Arbour Hill Prison|Arbour Hill]] became a national monument and the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], sculpted by [[Oliver Sheppard]], at the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] as part of the Rising commemorations that year \u2013 it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of the 1916 rebels. Memorials to the heroes of the Rising are to be found in other Irish cities, such as [[1916 Memorial, Limerick|Limerick]].\n\nThe parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966.<ref>{{Cite journal| place=IE|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t06_other_a.html|publisher=RT\u00c9|year=1966|title=News Items Relating to the 1916 Easter Rising Commemorations| postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|coalition government]] of 1973\u201377, in particular the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry.\n\nO'Brien and others asserted that the Rising was doomed to military defeat from the outset, and that it failed to account for the determination of [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]] to remain in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O\u2019Brien|first=Conor Cruise|title=States of Ireland |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1972 |isbn=0-09-113100-6 |pages=88, 99{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n\nIrish republicans continue to venerate the Rising and its leaders with murals in republican areas of Belfast and other towns celebrating the actions of Pearse and his comrades, and annual parades in remembrance of the Rising.

Things got even worse in the 1930s when it was finally realised that the extinct Atlantic population was the same species as the extant Pacific population, and the new combination ''Eschrichtius gibbosus'' was proposed.<ref name=\"Barnes-McLeod\" />\n\nIn his morphological analysis, {{Harvnb|Bisconti|2008}} found that eschrichtiids and [[Cetotheriidae]] (''[[Cetotherium]]'', ''[[Mixocetus]]'' and ''[[Metopocetus]]'') form a monophyletic sister group of [[Balaenopteridae]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bisconti|2008|loc=Results, pp. 173\u2013174}}</ref>\n\nA specimen from the [[Late Pliocene]] of northern Italy, named ''\"[[Cetotherium]]\" gastaldii'' by {{Harvnb|Strobel|1875}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Strobel|1875|p=136}}</ref> and renamed ''\"Balaenoptera\" gastaldii'' by {{Harvnb|Portis|1885}}, was identified as a basal eschrichtiid by {{Harvnb|Bisconti|2008}} who recombined it to ''[[Eschrichtioides|Eschrichtioides gastaldii]]''.<ref name=\"PyeLin-fossils\">{{Harvnb|Pyenson|Lindberg|2011|loc=Fossil record of gray whales}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dem\u00e9r\u00e9|Berta|McGowen|2005|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n{{Harvnb|Steeman|Hebsgaard|Fordyce|Ho|2009}} found that the gray whale is phylogenetically distinct from rorquals and that previous morphological studies were correct in the conclusion that the evolution of gulp feeding was a single event in the rorqual lineage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steeman|Hebsgaard|Fordyce|Ho|2009|p=580}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\nFossils of Eschrichtiidae have been found in all major oceanic basins in the Northern Hemisphere, and the family is believed date back to the [[Late Miocene]].<ref name=\"PyeLin-fossils\" />  Today, gray whales are only present in the northern Pacific, but a population was also present in the northern Atlantic before being driven to extinction by European whalers three centuries ago.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bisconti|Varola|2006|p=450}}</ref>\n\nFossil eschrichtiids from before the Holocene are rare compared to other fossil mysticetes.

His father died when he was young, and was succeeded by his oldest son [[\u00c6thelstan]]. Edmund came to the throne upon the death of his half-brother in 939, apparently with little opposition. His reign was marked by almost constant warfare, including conquests or reconquests of [[the Midlands]], [[Northumbria]], and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] (the last of which was ceded to [[Malcolm I of Scotland]]). Edmund was assassinated after six-and-a-half years as king, while attending [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] in [[Pucklechurch]], [[Gloucestershire]]. He was initially succeeded by his brother [[Eadred]], but his two sons \u2013 [[Eadwig]] and [[Edgar the Peaceful]] \u2013 both later came to the throne.\n\n==Early life and military threats==\nEdmund came to the throne as the son of [[Edward the Elder]],<ref name=Brittanica>Edmund I (king of England), [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179333/ \"Edmund-I\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref> and therefore the grandson of [[Alfred the Great]], great-grandson of [[\u00c6thelwulf of Wessex]] and great-great grandson of [[Egbert of Wessex]], who was the first of the house of Wessex to start dominating the Anglo Saxon realms. However, being born when his father was already a middle aged man, Edmund lost his father when he was a toddler, in 924, which saw his 30 year old half brother [[Athelstan]] come to the throne. Edmund would grow up in the reign of Athelstan, even participating in the [[Battle of Brunanburh]] in his adolescence in 937.{{fact|date=October 2017}}\n\nAthelstan died in the year 939, which saw young Edmund come to the throne. Shortly after his proclamation as king, he had to face several military threats. King [[Olaf III Guthfrithson]] conquered [[Northumbria]] and invaded the [[The Midlands|Midlands]]; when Olaf died in 942, Edmund reconquered the Midlands.<ref name=Brittanica /> In 943, Edmund became the godfather of King [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n|Olaf of York]]. In 944, Edmund was successful in reconquering Northumbria.<ref name=Ford>David Nash Ford, ''Edmund the Magnificent, King of the English (AD 921-946)'', [http://www.earlybritishkingdoms.com/adversaries/bios/edmundmag.html Early British Kingdoms].</ref> In the same year, his ally Olaf of York lost his throne and left for [[Dublin]] in Ireland. Olaf became the king of Dublin as [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]] and continued to be allied to his godfather. In 945, Edmund conquered [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] but ceded the territory to King [[Malcolm I of Scotland]] in exchange for a treaty of mutual military support.<ref name=Ford /> Edmund thus established a policy of safe borders and peaceful relationships with [[Scotland]]. During his reign, the revival of [[monastery|monasteries]] in England began.\n\n==Louis IV of France==\n[[File:Silver penny of Edmund I (YORYM 2000 1493) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of Edmund I]]\nOne of Edmund's last political movements of which there is some knowledge is his role in the restoration of [[Louis IV of France]] to the throne. Louis, son of [[Charles the Simple]] and Edmund's half-sister [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]], had resided at the West-Saxon court for some time until 936, when he returned to be crowned King of France. In the summer of 945, he was captured by the Norsemen of Rouen and subsequently released to Duke [[Hugh the Great]], who held him in custody. The chronicler [[Richerus]] claims that Eadgifu wrote letters both to Edmund and to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in which she requested support for her son. Edmund responded to her plea by sending angry threats to Hugh.<ref>[[Richerus]], ''Historiae'', Book 2, chapters 49\u201350.

The term was coined by [[Marcellin Berthelot]] from the Greek roots ''endo-'', derived from the word \"endon\" (\u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd) meaning \"within\" and the root \"therm\" (\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc-) meaning \"hot\" or \"warm\" intended sense is that of a reaction that depends on absorbing heat if it is to proceed. The opposite of an endothermic process is an [[exothermic]] process, one that releases, \"gives out\" energy in the form of <!-- energy and heat are essentially the same thing, and are used interchangeably. Therefore, to say that it \"gives out energy in the form of (usually, but not always) heat\" doesn't make any sense.  --> heat. Thus in each term (endothermic & exothermic) the prefix refers to where heat goes as the reaction occurs, though in reality it only refers to where the energy goes, without necessarily being in the form of heat. All chemical reactions involve both the breaking of existing and the making of new chemical bonds.  A reaction to break a bond always requires the input of energy and so such a process is always endothermic.  When atoms come together to form new chemical bonds, the electrostatic forces bringing them together leave the bond with a large excess of energy (usually in the form of vibrations and rotations).  If that energy is not dissipated, the new bond would quickly break apart again.  Instead, the new bond can shed its excess energy - by radiation, by transfer to other motions in the molecule, or to other molecules through collisions - and then become a stable new bond.  Shedding this excess energy is the exothermicity that leaves the molecular system.  Whether a given overall reaction is exothermic or endothermic is determined by the relative contribution of these bond breaking endothermic steps and new bond stabilizing exothermic steps.\n\nThe concept is frequently applied in [[physical sciences]] to, for example, [[chemical reaction]]s, where [[thermal energy]] (heat) is converted to chemical [[bond energy]].\n\nEndothermic (and exothermic) analysis only accounts for the [[enthalpy]] change (\u2206H) of a reaction. The full energy analysis of a reaction is the [[Gibbs free energy]] (\u2206G), which includes an [[entropy]] (\u2206S) and temperature term in addition to the enthalpy. A reaction will be a [[spontaneous process]] at a certain temperature if the products have a lower Gibbs free energy (an [[exergonic reaction]]) even if the enthalpy of the products is higher. Entropy and enthalpy are different terms, so the change in entropic energy can overcome an opposite change in enthalpic energy and make an endothermic reaction favorable.\n\n==Examples==\n* [[Photosynthesis]]\n* [[Melting]] of ice\n* [[Evaporation|Evaporating]] liquid water\n* [[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] of [[carbon dioxide]] (dry ice)\n* [[Cracking (chemistry)|Cracking]] of [[alkane]]s\n* [[Thermal decomposition]] reactions\n* Electrolytic decomposition of [[sodium chloride]] into [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[hydrogen chloride]]\n* Dissolving [[ammonium chloride]] in water\n* [[Nucleosynthesis]] of elements heavier than [[nickel]] in stellar cores\n* High-energy neutrons can produce [[tritium]] from [[lithium-7]] in an endothermic reaction, consuming 2.466 MeV.

{{post-nominals|country=AUS|GCMG,|CH}} (8 August 1880{{spaced ndash}}20 December 1961) was an Australian politician who served as the 11th [[Prime Minister of Australia]], holding office for 19 days after the death of [[Joseph Lyons]] in 1939. He was the leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] from 1921 to 1939, and was the most influential figure in its early years.\n\nPage was born in [[Grafton, New South Wales]]. He entered the [[University of Sydney]] at the age of 15, and completed a degree in medicine at the age of 21. After completing his [[medical residency|residency]] at Sydney's [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]], he moved back to Grafton and opened a private hospital. He soon became involved in local politics, and in 1915 purchased a part-share in ''[[The Daily Examiner]]'', a local newspaper. He also briefly served as a military surgeon during World War I. Page gained prominence as an advocate of various development schemes for the [[Northern Rivers]] region, especially those involving hydroelectricity. He also helped found a movement for [[New England New State Movement|New England statehood]].\n\n[[Australian federal election, 1919|In 1919]], Page was elected to [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] representing the [[Division of Cowper]]. He joined the new Country Party the following year as its inaugural [[Whip (politics)|whip]], and then replaced [[William McWilliams]] as party leader in 1921. Page opposed the economic policies of Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]], and when the Country Party gained the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 election]], he demanded Hughes' resignation as the price for a coalition with the [[Nationalist Party (Australia)|Nationalist Party]]. He was subsequently made [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] under the new prime minister, [[Stanley Bruce]], serving in that role from 1923 to 1929. He had a significant degree of influence on domestic policy, with Bruce concentrating on international issues.\n\nPage returned to cabinet after the [[Australian federal election, 1934|1934 election]], when the Country Party entered a new coalition with [[Joseph Lyons]]' [[United Australia Party]]. He was appointed [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Commerce]], and concentrated on agricultural issues. When Lyons died in office in April 1939, Page was commissioned as his successor in a caretaker capacity while the UAP [[United Australia Party leadership election, 1939|elected]] a new leader, [[Robert Menzies]]. Page subsequently refused to serve in Menzies' cabinet, withdrawing the Country Party from the coalition, but this proved unpopular and he resigned the party leadership after a few months. The coalition was eventually reconstituted, and Page served again as Minister for Commerce under Menzies and [[Arthur Fadden]] until the government's defeat in October 1941.\n\nPage's last major role was as [[Minister for Health (Australia)|Minister for Health]] (1949\u20131956) in the post-war [[Menzies Government (1949\u201366)|Menzies Government]]. He retired from cabinet at the age of 76, and died a short time after losing his seat at the [[Australian federal election, 1961|1961 election]]. Page served in parliament for almost 42 years, and only Menzies lasted longer as the leader of a major Australian political party. He secured his party's independence by refusing overtures to join the Nationalists and the UAP, and the policies that he favoured \u2013 decentralisation, agrarianism, and government support of primary industry \u2013 have remained the basis of its platform up to the present day. The coalitions that he established and maintained with Bruce and Lyons have served as a model for [[Coalition (Australia)|all subsequent coalition governments]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth and family background===\nEarle Christmas Grafton Page was born in [[Grafton, New South Wales]], on 8 August 1880. His first middle name, which he disliked, was given to him to carry on the surname of a childless relative, while his second middle name was in honour of his birthplace. Page was the fifth of eleven children born to Charles Page and Mary Johanna Haddon (Annie) Cox.<ref name=before>[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/page/before-office.aspx#section1 Australia's PMs > Earle Page > Before office], National Archives of Australia.

His father, born in London, was a successful businessman and a member of the [[Clarence Valley Council|Grafton City Council]], serving a single term as mayor in 1908. The family business was a hardware manufacturing firm, which had its origins in a [[Coachbuilder|coachbuilding]] firm established in 1858 by Page's maternal grandfather, Edwin Cox.<ref name=book>{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Moorhouse|authorlink=Frank Moorhouse|title=Earle Page|publisher=Black Inc.|year=2001|page=19|isbn=1863952748}}</ref> His other grandfather, James Page, arrived in Grafton in 1855, serving as the town's first schoolmaster and first [[town clerk]].<ref>Moorhouse (2001), p. 17.</ref>\n\n===Education===\nPage began his schooling at Grafton Public School, where he excelled academically. His family could not afford to send him to boarding school, as a result of financial difficulties caused by the [[Australian banking crisis of 1893|banking crisis of 1893]]. Page consequently had to rely on scholarships to advance his education.<ref>Moorhouse (2001), p. 26.</ref> He won a bursary to attend [[Sydney Boys High School]] in 1895, where he passed the university entrance exams, and the following year \u2013 aged 15 \u2013 began studying a [[liberal arts]] course at the [[University of Sydney]].

He served as chief medical officer aboard the troopship {{Abbr|HMAT|His Majesty's Australian Transport}} ''Ballarat'', and was then stationed at an army hospital in [[Cairo]] for several months. He was transferred to a hospital in England in July 1916, and concluded his service as a surgical specialist at a [[casualty clearing station]] in France. Page returned to Australia in March 1917 and was discharged from the military in July 1917.<ref name=obit/> Although his active involvement in medicine declined as his political career progressed, he was frequently called upon to treat his fellow MPs or parliamentary staff. This was particularly true after the federal government moved to Canberra, as the new capital had only a handful of qualified surgeons. In 1928, for instance, he performed an emergency appendectomy on [[Parker Moloney]].<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/237788309 \"EARLE PAGE SAVES LIFE OF LABOR MEMBER\"], ''[[Labor Daily]]'', 18 September 1928.</ref>\n\n==Early political involvement==\n[[File:Earle Page 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Page in about 1920]]\nPage's medical career brought him considerable wealth, and he began investing in land. He bought several large farming properties in [[South-East Queensland]], including in [[Nerang, Queensland|Nerang]], [[Kandanga, Queensland|Kandanga]], and the [[Numinbah Valley]]; Pages Pinnacle in the Numinbah State Forest is named after him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pages Pinnacle|url=http://www.goldcoaststories.com.au/pages-pinnacle/|website=Gold Coast Stories|publisher=City of Gold Coast|accessdate=27 January 2018}}</ref> His entry into public life came about as a result of his passion for [[hydroelectricity]], which he first observed in New Zealand while attending a medical convention in 1910. He believed that it could be applied to the [[Northern Rivers]] region, which was still mostly unelectrified outside of the major towns. Page was elected to the [[South Grafton, New South Wales|South Grafton Municipal Council]] in 1913, believing his position as an [[alderman]] would be useful in his lobbying efforts. However, his overtures to the state government were rebuffed. In 1915, Page was one of the founders of the [[New England New State Movement|Northern New South Wales Separation League]], which advocated the creation of a new state in the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region. He toured a number of towns to raise awareness of the new movement, but interest waned as a result of the ongoing war. Later that year, he was part of a syndicate that bought ''[[The Daily Examiner]]'', the local newspaper in Grafton.<ref name=adb>{{cite AuDB |first=Carl|last= Bridge|author-link=Carl Bridge|title=Page, Sir Earle Christmas (1880\u20131961)\n|volume=11|year=1988|id2=page-sir-earle-christmas-7941}}</ref>\n\nPage visited a number of hydroelectric sites in North America in 1917, on his way back from military service in France. He was elected mayor of South Grafton in 1918, serving until 1920, and also became the inaugural president of the North Coast Development League. He developed more concrete plans for a hydroelectric project on the [[Clarence River (New South Wales)|Clarence River]], and put forward various other development schemes relating to roads, railways, and ports, all of which served to raise his profile in the local district. Page was elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1919|1919 federal election]], defeating the sitting [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] MP, [[John Thomson (Australian politician)|John Thomson]] in the [[Division of Cowper]]. He stood as an independent with the endorsement of the Farmers' and Settlers' Association, and after the election joined the new [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], along with 10 other MPs from rural seats. Page continued to advocate for hydroelectricity throughout his political career, and many such projects were built in New South Wales. However, the specific scheme he favoured for the Clarence River was never put in place, only the smaller [[Nymboida Power Station]]. Decentralisation also remained a pet project, with Page frequently arguing for New South Wales and Queensland to be divided into smaller states to aid regional development. The movement for New England statehood waned in the 1920s, but re-emerged in the 1950s; a legally binding referendum on the subject was finally held in 1967, after Page's death, but was narrowly defeated in controversial circumstances.<ref name=adb/>\n\n==Bruce\u2013Page Government==\nPage was elected leader of the Country Party in 1921, replacing [[William McWilliams]]. The fledgling Country Party found itself with the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the House after the [[Australian federal election, 1922|1922 election]].  The [[Nationalist Party of Australia|Nationalist]] government of [[Billy Hughes]] lost its majority, and could not govern without Country Party support. It soon became apparent that the price for that support would be a full coalition with the Nationalists. However, the Country Party had been formed partly due to discontent with Hughes' rural policy, and Page's animosity toward Hughes was such that he would not even consider supporting him. Indeed, he would not even begin talks with the Nationalists as long as Hughes remained leader.  Bowing to the inevitable, Hughes resigned.<ref name=naamc>{{cite web|title=Earle Page, Member for Cowper 1919|work=Australia's Prime Ministers|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/page/before-office.aspx#section3|accessdate=19 March 2010 }}</ref>\n[[File:EarlePage.jpg|thumb|left|Page as deputy prime minister]]\nPage then began negotiations with Hughes' successor as leader of the Nationalists, [[Stanley Bruce]]. His terms were stiff; he wanted his Country Party to have five seats in an 11-man cabinet, including the post of [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] and the second rank in the ministry for himself. These demands were unprecedented for a prospective junior coalition partner in a Westminster system, and especially so for such a new party. Nonetheless, Bruce agreed rather than force another election.<ref name=naamc/> For all intents and purposes, Page was the first [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] (a title that did not officially exist until 1968). Since then, the leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country/National Party]] has been the second-ranking member in nearly every [[Coalition (Australia)|non-Labor government]].\n\nOn 30 January 1924, as acting prime minister, Page chaired the first meeting of [[Cabinet of Australia|Federal Cabinet]] ever held in [[Canberra]], at [[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]].<ref>[http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/timeline/results.aspx?type=pm&pm=Stanley%20Melbourne%20Bruce National Archives of Australia, Australia's Prime Ministers: Timeline].

On 22 October 1924, he had to tell his best friend, Thomas Shorten Cole (1870\u20131957), the news that his wife Mary Ann Crane had just died on the operating table from complications of intestinal or stomach cancer, reputed by their daughter Dorothy May Cole to be \"the worst day of his life\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nHe was a strong believer in orthodox finance and conservative policies, except where the welfare of farmers was concerned: then he was happy to see government money spent freely.

In 1931, a group of dissident Labor MPs led by [[Joseph Lyons]] merged with the Nationalists to form the [[United Australia Party]] under Lyons' leadership. Lyons and The UAP\u2013Country Coalition won a comprehensive victory in the [[Australian federal election, 1931|1931 election]]. However, the UAP came up four seats short of a majority, and was able to secure a bare majority when the [[Emergency Committee (South Australia)|Emergency Committee of South Australia]] joined forces with the UAP. Although Lyons was keen to form a coalition with the Country Party, talks broke down, and Lyons opted to govern alone\u2014to date, the last time that the Country/National Party has not had any posts in a non-Labor government. In 1934, however, the UAP suffered an eight-seat swing, forcing Lyons to take the Country Party back into his government in a full-fledged Coalition.

Jacob of Nisibis is recorded as a signatory at the [[First Council of Nicea]] in 325. Ephrem was baptized as a youth and almost certainly became a [[Members of the Covenant|son of the covenant]], an unusual form of syriac proto-[[monasticism]]. Jacob appointed Ephrem as a teacher (Syriac ''malp\u0304\u0101n\u00e2'', a title that still carries great respect for Syriac Christians). He was ordained as a [[deacon]] either at his baptism or later.<ref>Parry (1999), pp. 180-181</ref> He began to compose hymns and write biblical commentaries as part of his educational office. In his hymns, he sometimes refers to himself as a \"herdsman\" ({{lang|syr|\u0725\u0720\u0722\u0710}}, ''\u2018all\u0101n\u00e2''), to his bishop as the \"shepherd\" ({{lang|syr|\u072a\u0725\u071d\u0710}}, ''r\u0101\u2018y\u00e2''), and to his community as a 'fold' ({{lang|syr|\u0715\u071d\u072a\u0710}}, ''dayr\u00e2''). Ephrem is popularly credited as the founder of the [[School of Nisibis]], which, in later centuries, was the centre of learning of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]].\n[[File:Mar Jacob Church, Nisibis.jpg|thumb|Newly excavated Church of [[Jacob of Nisibis|Saint Jacob]] in [[Nisibis]], where Ephrem taught and ministered]]\nIn 337, Emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], who had legalised and promoted the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire, died. Seizing on this opportunity, [[Shapur II]] of Persia began a series of attacks into Roman North [[Mesopotamia]]. Nisibis was besieged in 338, 346 and 350. During the first siege, Ephrem credits Bishop Jacob as defending the city with his prayers.  In the third siege, of 350, Shapur rerouted the River Mygdonius to undermine the walls of Nisibis. The Nisibenes quickly repaired the walls while the Persian elephant cavalry became bogged down in the wet ground. Ephrem celebrated what he saw as the miraculous salvation of the city in a hymn that portrayed Nisibis as being like [[Noah's Ark]], floating to safety on the flood.\n\nOne important physical link to Ephrem's lifetime is the [[baptistery]] of Nisibis. The inscription tells that it was constructed under Bishop Vologeses in 359. In that year, Shapur attacked again. The cities around Nisibis were destroyed one by one, and their citizens killed or deported. [[Constantius II]] was unable to respond; the campaign of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in 363 ended with his death in battle.  His army elected [[Jovian (Emperor)|Jovian]] as the new emperor, and to rescue his army, he was forced to surrender Nisibis to Persia<ref name=Labourt/> (also in 363) and to permit the expulsion of the entire Christian population.\n\nEphrem, with the others, went first to Amida ([[Diyarbak\u0131r]]), eventually settling in [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]]<ref name=Labourt/> (modern [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]]) in 363. Ephrem, in his late fifties, applied himself to ministry in his new church and seems to have continued his work as a teacher, perhaps in the [[School of Edessa]]. Edessa had always been at the heart of the Syriac-speaking world, and the city was full of rival philosophies and religions. Ephrem comments that orthodox Nicene Christians were simply called \"Palutians\" in Edessa, after a former bishop. [[Arianism|Arians]], [[Marcionism|Marcionites]], [[Manichaeism|Manichees]], [[Bardaisan]]ites and various [[Gnosticism|gnostic sects]] proclaimed themselves as the true church. In this confusion, Ephrem wrote a great number of hymns defending Nicene orthodoxy. A later Syriac writer, [[Jacob of Serugh]], wrote that Ephrem rehearsed all-female choirs to sing his hymns set to Syriac folk tunes in the forum of Edessa. After a ten-year residency in Edessa, in his sixties, Ephrem succumbed to the plague as he ministered to its victims. The most reliable date for his death is 9 June 373.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Ephrem miniature 16c.jpg|thumb|Ephrem the Syrian in a 16th-century Russian illustration]]\n[[File:Nisibis Church interior.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Church of [[Jacob of Nisibis|Saint Jacob]] in [[Nisibis]]]]\nOver four hundred [[hymn]]s composed by Ephrem still exist. Granted that some have been lost, Ephrem's productivity is not in doubt. The church historian [[Sozomen]] credits Ephrem with having written over three million lines. Ephrem combines in his writing a threefold heritage: he draws on the models and methods of early [[Rabbinic Judaism]], he engages skillfully with Greek science and philosophy, and he delights in the Mesopotamian/Persian tradition of mystery symbolism.\n\nThe most important of his works are his lyric, teaching hymns ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0715\u0716\u0308\u072b\u0710}}, ''madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea''). These hymns are full of rich, poetic imagery drawn from biblical sources, folk tradition, and other religions and philosophies. The madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea are written in stanzas of [[syllabic verse]] and employ over fifty different metrical schemes. Each madr\u0101\u0161\u00e2 had its ''q\u0101l\u00e2'' ({{lang|syr|\u0729\u0720\u0710}}), a traditional tune identified by its opening line. All of these q\u0101l\u00ea are now lost. It seems that [[Bardaisan]] and [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] composed madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea, and Ephrem felt that the medium was a suitable tool to use against their claims.<ref>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1409 Foley, Leonard. \"St. Ephrem\", ''Saint of the Day'', Franciscan Media]</ref>  The madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea are gathered into various hymn cycles. Each group has a title \u2014 ''Carmina Nisibena'', ''On Faith'', ''On Paradise'', ''On Virginity'', ''Against Heresies'' \u2014 but some of these titles do not do justice to the entirety of the collection (for instance, only the first half of the ''Carmina Nisibena'' is about Nisibis). Each madr\u0101\u0161\u00e2 usually had a refrain ({{lang|syr|\u0725\u0718\u0722\u071d\u072c\u0710}}, ''\u2018\u00fbn\u00ee\u1e6f\u00e2''), which was repeated after each stanza. Later writers have suggested that the madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea were sung by all-women choirs with an accompanying lyre.\n\nParticularly influential were his ''Hymns Against Heresies''.<ref>Mourachian, Mark. \"Hymns Against Heresies: Comments on St. Ephrem the Syrian\". ''Sophia'' 37:2, (Winter 2007), pp. 30-31.</ref> Ephrem used these to warn his flock of the heresies that threatened to divide the early church. He lamented that the faithful were \"tossed to and fro and carried around with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness and deceitful wiles.\"<ref>Eph 4:14, as quoted in Mourachian (2007)</ref> He devised hymns laden with doctrinal details to inoculate right-thinking Christians against heresies such as [[docetism]]. The ''Hymns Against Heresies'' employ colourful metaphors to describe the Incarnation of Christ as fully human and divine. Ephrem asserts that Christ's unity of humanity and divinity represents peace, perfection and salvation; in contrast, docetism and other heresies sought to divide or reduce Christ's nature and, in doing so, rend and devalue Christ's followers with their false teachings.\n\nEphrem also wrote verse homilies ({{lang|syr|\u0721\u0710\u0721\u0716\u0308\u0710}}, ''m\u00eamr\u00ea''). These sermons in poetry are far fewer in number than the madr\u0101\u0161\u00ea. The m\u00eamr\u00ea were written in a heptosyllabic [[couplet]]s (pairs of lines of seven syllables each).\n\nThe third category of Ephrem's writings is his prose work. He wrote a biblical commentary on the [[Diatessaron]] (the single gospel harmony of the early Syriac church), the Syriac original of which was found in 1957. His ''Commentary on Genesis and Exodus'' is an exegesis of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. Some fragments exist in Armenian of his commentaries on the [[Acts of the Apostles]] and [[Pauline Epistles]].\n\nHe also wrote refutations against [[Bardaisan]], Mani, [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]] and others.\n\nEphrem is attributed with writing [[hagiography|hagiographies]] such as ''[[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot]]'', though this credit is called into question.<ref>{{cite book|title=Holy Women of the Syrian Orient|last2=Harvey|first2=Susan Ashbrook|date=1987|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21366-1|location=Berkeley|last1=Brook|first1=Sebastian P.}}</ref>\n\nEphrem wrote exclusively in the [[Syriac language]], but translations of his writings exist in [[Classical Armenian language|Classical Armenian]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Old Georgian language|Old Georgian]], [[Koine Greek]] and other languages. Some of his works are only extant in translation (particularly in Armenian). Syriac churches still use many of Ephrem's hymns as part of the annual cycle of worship. However, most of these liturgical hymns are edited and conflated versions of the originals.\n\nThe most complete, critical text of authentic Ephrem was compiled between 1955 and 1979 by Dom Edmund Beck, OSB, as part of the ''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium''.\n\nAs Chronologist, St. Ephrem the Syrian has composed the history of the Patriarchs and Kings from the Creation to the Crucifixion of Christ, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20160810191441/http://www.filbluz.ca/resources/Book-of-the-cave-of-Treasure.pdf The Book of the Cave of Treasure]'', translated by W. Budge from the Syriac text of the British Museum Mss Add. 25875, published by The Religious Tract Society, 1927.\n\n===Symbols and metaphors===\nEphrem's writings contain a rich variety of symbols and metaphors. Christopher Buck gives a summary of analysis of a selection of six key scenarios (the way, robe of glory, [[sons and daughters of the Covenant]], wedding feast, [[harrowing of hell]], [[Noah\u2019s Ark]]/Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, medicine of life, mirror, pearl, [[Tree of life]], [[paradise]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Buck |first=Christopher |title=Paradise and Paradigm |year=1999 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |isbn=9780791497944 |url=http://bahai-library.com/buck_paradise_paradigm |pages= 77\u2013109}}</ref>\n\n==Greek Ephrem==\nEphrem's artful meditations on the symbols of Christian faith and his stand against heresy made him a popular source of inspiration throughout the church. This occurred to the extent that there is a huge corpus of Ephrem pseudepigraphy and legendary [[hagiography]]. Some of these compositions are in verse, often a version of Ephrem's heptosyllabic couplets. Most of these works are considerably later compositions in Greek. Students of Ephrem often refer to this corpus as having a single author called \"Greek Ephrem\", or ''Ephraem Graecus'' (as opposed to the real Ephrem the Syrian). This is not to say that all texts ascribed to Ephrem in Greek are by others, but many are. Although Greek compositions are the main source of pseudepigraphal material, there are also works in [[Latin]], [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. There has been very little critical examination of these works, and many are still treasured by some churches as authentic.\n\nThe best known of these writings is the ''[[Prayer of Saint Ephrem]]'', which is recited at every service during [[Great Lent]] and other fasting periods in [[Eastern Christianity]].\n\n==Veneration as a saint==\n[[File:George John Ephraim Triptychon fragment Sinai 14th century.jpg|thumb|Saints Ephrem (right) [[St. George|George]] (top) and [[St. John Damascene|John Damascene]] on a 14th-century triptych]]\n[[File:Ic\u00f4ne Ephrem le Syrien.jpg|thumb|Contemporary Romanian icon (2005)]]\nSoon after Ephrem's death, legendary accounts of his life began to circulate. One of the earlier \"modifications\" is the statement that Ephrem's father was a pagan priest of Abnil or Abizal. However, internal evidence from his authentic writings suggest that he was raised by Christian parents.<ref>[https://oca.org/saints/lives/2018/01/28/100328-venerable-ephraim-the-syrian \"Venerable Ephraim the Syrian\", Orthodox Church in America]</ref> \n\nThe second legend attached to Ephrem is that he was a monk. In Ephrem's day, monasticism was in its infancy in Egypt. He seems to have been a part of the [[members of the covenant]], a close-knit, urban community of Christians that had \"covenanted\" themselves to service and had [[sexual abstinence|refrained from sexual activity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Some of the Syriac terms that Ephrem used to describe his community were later used to describe monastic communities, but the assertion that he was monk is anachronistic.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Later hagiographers often painted a picture of Ephrem as an extreme ascetic, but the internal evidence of his authentic writings show him to have had a very active role, both within his church community and through witness to those outside of it.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nEphrem is venerated as an example of monastic discipline in [[Eastern Christianity]]. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] scheme of hagiography, Ephrem is counted as a Venerable Father (i.e., a sainted Monk). His [[feast day]] is celebrated on 28 January and on the Saturday of the Venerable Fathers ([[Cheesefare]] Saturday), which is the Saturday before the beginning of [[Great Lent]].\n\nEphrem is popularly believed to have taken legendary journeys.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In one of these he visits [[Basil of Caesarea]]. This links the Syrian Ephrem with the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] and is an important theological bridge between the spiritual view of the two, who held much in common. Ephrem is also supposed to have visited [[Saint Pishoy]] in the monasteries of [[Scetes]] in [[Egypt]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As with the legendary visit with Basil, this visit is a theological bridge between the origins of monasticism and its spread throughout the church.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nOn 5 October 1920, Pope [[Benedict XV]] proclaimed Ephrem a [[Doctor of the Church]] (\"Doctor of the Syrians\").<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_05101920_principi-apostolorum-petro_en.html PRINCIPI APOSTOLORUM PETRO] at Vatican.va</ref> This proclamation was made before critical editions of Ephrem's authentic writings were available.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe most popular title for Ephrem is ''Harp of the Spirit'' (Syriac: {{lang|syr|\u071f\u0722\u072a\u0710 \u0715\u072a\u0718\u071a\u0710}}, ''Ken\u0101r\u00e2 d-R\u00fb\u1e25\u00e2''). He is also referred to as the Deacon of Edessa, the Sun of the Syrians and a Pillar of the Church.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05498a.htm New Advent] at newadvent.org</ref>\n\nHis Roman Catholic feast day of 9 June conforms to his date of death. For 48 years (1920\u20131969), it was on 18 June, and this date is still observed in the Extraordinary Form.\n\nEphrem is honored with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on June 10.\n\n==Translations==\n* San Efr\u00e9n de N\u00edsibis ''Himnos de Navidad y Epifan\u00eda'', by [[Efrem Yildiz Sadak]] Madrid, 2016 (in Spanish). {{ISBN|978-84-285-5235-6}}\n* ''Sancti Patris Nostri Ephraem Syri opera omnia quae exstant'' (3 vol), by [[Peter Ambarach]] Roma, 1737-1743.\n* St. Ephrem ''Hymns on Paradise'', translated by Sebastian Brock (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1990). {{ISBN|0-88141-076-4}}\n* St. Ephrem the Syrian ''Commentary on Genesis, Commentary on Exodus, Homily on our Lord, Letter to Publius'', translated by Edward G.

ECS was introduced in 1990 with the launch of the [[Amiga 3000]]. Amigas produced from 1990 onwards featured a mix of OCS and ECS chips, such as later versions of the [[Amiga 500]] and the [[Commodore CDTV]]. Other ECS models were the [[Amiga 500+]] in 1991 and lastly the [[Amiga 600]] in 1992. \n\nNotable improvements were the ''[[MOS Technology Agnus|Super Agnus]]'' and the ''Hires [[Original_Chip_Set#Denise|Denise]]'' chips. The sound and floppy controller chip, ''[[Original_Chip_Set#Paula|Paula]]'', remained unchanged from the OCS design. Super Agnus supports 2 [[megabyte|MB]] of [[CHIP RAM]], whereas the original [[Original_Chip_Set#Agnus|Agnus]]/''Fat Agnus'' and subsequent ''Fatter Agnus'' can address 512 [[kilobyte|KB]] and 1 MB, respectively. The ECS Denise chip offers ''Productivity'' (640&times;480 non-interlaced) and ''SuperHires'' (1280&times;200 or 1280&times;256) display modes (also available in interlaced mode), which are however limited to only 4 on-screen colors. Essentially, a 35 [[Nanosecond|ns]] pixel mode was added plus the ability to run arbitrary horizontal and vertical scan rates. This made other display modes possible, but only the aforementioned modes were supported originally out of the box. For example, the Linux Amiga framebuffer device driver allows the use of several other display modes. Other improvements were the ability of the blitter to copy regions larger than 1024&times;1024 pixels in one operation and the ability to display sprites in border regions (outside of any display window where bitplanes are shown). ECS also allows software switching between 60Hz and 50Hz video modes.\n\nThese improvements largely favored application software, which benefited from higher resolution and VGA-like display modes, rather than games. As an incremental update, ECS was intended to be backward compatible with software designed for OCS machines, though some pre-ECS games were found to be incompatible. Additionally, features from the improved [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 2 operating system were used in subsequent software, and since these two technologies largely overlap, some users misjudged the significance of ECS. It is possible to upgrade some OCS machines, such as the Amiga 500, to obtain partial or full ECS functionality by replacing OCS chips with ECS versions. ECS was followed by the third generation [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset with the launch of the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]]\n* [[Amiga Ranger Chipset]]\n* [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]]\n* [[Amiga custom chips]]\n* [[Amiga Advanced Architecture chipset|AAA]]\n* [[Commodore AA+ Chipset|AA+]]\n* [[Hombre chipset]]\n* [[List of home computers by video hardware]]\n\n{{Amiga hardware}}\n\n[[Category:Amiga chipsets]]\n[[Category:Graphics chips]]\n[[Category:MOS Integrated Circuits]]\n[[Category:Sound chips]]\n[[Category:AmigaOS]]", "sha1": "0wpfel1s8waiicofxphnz7v9tfezog6"}}, {"title": "European Space Operations Centre", "ns": "0", "id": "10361", "revision": {"id": "862022994", "parentid": "862022434", "timestamp": "2018-10-01T17:35:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Danno612", "id": "170329"}, "comment": "/* ESTRACK */ Remove [[Maspalomas]], [[Villafranca]]  as these are no longer core stations.

The main European launch vehicle [[Ariane 5]] is operated through [[Arianespace]] with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA to manufacture the [[Orion Spacecraft]] service module, that will fly on the [[Space Launch System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Orion|title=Orion|website=European Space Agency}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Orion/European_Service_Module|title=European Service Module|website=European Space Agency}}</ref>\n\nThe agency's facilities are distributed among the following centres:\n\n* ESA science missions are based at [[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands;\n* Earth Observation missions at [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]] in [[Frascati]], Italy;\n* ESA Mission Control ([[European Space Operations Centre|ESOC]]) is in [[Darmstadt]], Germany;\n* the [[European Astronaut Centre]] (EAC) that trains astronauts for future missions is situated in [[Cologne]], Germany;\n* a research institute created in 2009, the [[European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications]] (ECSAT), is at [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus|Harwell]], England;\n* and the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC) is located in [[Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada]], [[Comunidad de Madrid|Madrid]], Spain.\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n{{main|ESRO}}\n[[File:ESA-ESTEC5.jpg|thumb|right|[[European Space Research and Technology Centre|ESTEC]] buildings in [[Noordwijk]], Netherlands. ESTEC was the main technical centre of ESRO and remains so for the successor organisation, ESA.]]\n\nAfter [[World War II]], many European scientists left [[Western Europe]] in order to work with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik shock]], [[Edoardo Amaldi]] (Italy) and [[Pierre Auger]] (France), two prominent members of the Western European scientific community, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries, including [[Harrie Massey]] (United Kingdom).\n\nThe Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with developing a launch system, [[European Launcher Development Organization|ELDO]] (European Launch Development Organization), and the other the precursor of the European Space Agency, [[ESRO]] (European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites.\n\nESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with ELDO. ESA had ten founding member states: Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.esa.int/For_Media/Press_Releases/ESA_turns_30!_A_successful_track_record_for_Europe_in_space | title = ESA turns 30! A successful track record for Europe in space | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 31 May 2005}}</ref> These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a [[de facto]] fashion. ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, [[Cos-B]], a space probe monitoring [[Gamma-ray astronomy|gamma-ray emissions]] in the universe, which was first worked on by ESRO.\n\n===Later activities===\n[[File:Ariane 1 Le Bourget FRA 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Mock-up of the {{Nowrap |[[Ariane 1]]}}]]\n\nThe ESA collaborated with [[NASA]] on the [[International Ultraviolet Explorer]] (IUE), the world's first high-orbit telescope, which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA began [[Giotto mission|Giotto]], its first deep-space mission, to study the comets [[Comet Halley|Halley]] and [[26P/Grigg\u2013Skjellerup|Grigg\u2013Skjellerup]]. [[Hipparcos]], a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]] and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] were all jointly carried out with NASA. Later scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] space probe, to which ESA contributed by building the [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] landing module [[Huygens (spacecraft)|Huygens]].\n\nAs the successor of [[European Launcher Development Organisation|ELDO]], ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. [[Ariane 1]], launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two versions of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the [[Ariane 4]], which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding [[Ariane 5]] experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 82 successful launches until 2018. The successor launch vehicle of [[Ariane 5]], the [[Ariane 6]], is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s.\n\nThe beginning of the new millennium saw ESA become, along with agencies like NASA, [[JAXA]], [[ISRO]], [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]] and [[Roscosmos]], one of the major participants in scientific [[Space science|space research]]. Although ESA had relied on co-operation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the [[Military of the United States|United States military]]) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with Russia. A 2011 press issue thus stated:<ref name=\"international-coop\" />\n\n{{quote|Russia is ESA's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already underway in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners.}}\n\nNotable outcomes are ESA's include [[SMART-1]], a probe testing cutting-edge new space propulsion technology, the [[Mars Express]] and [[Venus Express]] missions, as well as the development of the Ariane 5 rocket and its role in the [[International Space Station|ISS]] partnership.

First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's space industry capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pecs.esa.int/node/24 |title=PECS: General Overview |publisher=European Space Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523104757/http://pecs.esa.int/node/24 |archivedate=23 May 2009 }}</ref> Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to co-operate with ESA on various levels:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n|-\n!

The EU is already the largest single donor to ESA's budget and non-ESA EU states are observers at ESA.\n\n==Launch vehicle fleet==\nESA has a fleet of different launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: [[Ariane 5]], [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz-2]] and [[Vega (launcher)|Vega]]. Rocket launches are carried out by [[Arianespace]], which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as [[CNES]], at ESA's [[Guiana Space Centre]]. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher [[latitude]]s. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500&nbsp;m/s due to the higher [[rotational velocity]] of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.\n\n===Ariane 5===\n{{main|Ariane 5}}\n[[File:Ariane 5ECA on its way to launch pad ELA-3.jpg|thumb|[[Ariane 5]] ECA transported to the [[ELA-3]] launch pad]]\nThe Ariane 5 rocket is ESA's primary launcher. It has been in service since 1997 and replaced [[Ariane 4]]. Two different [[Ariane 5#Variants|variants]] are currently in use. The heaviest and most used version, the {{nowrap|Ariane 5 ECA}}, delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into [[Geostationary transfer orbit|GTO]]. It failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made 82 consecutive successful [[Ariane 5#Ariane 5 flights|flights]] until a partial failure in January 2018. The other version, {{nowrap|Ariane 5 ES}}, was used to launch the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] (ATV) to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and will be used to launch four [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] navigational satellites at a time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Launch vehicles - Ariane 5|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Ariane_5|publisher=www.esa.int|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Launchers/Launch_vehicles/Ariane_5_ES|title = Ariane 5 ES|date = |accessdate = 8 September 2014|website = ESA|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, ESA agreed to build an upgraded variant called [[Ariane 5#Ariane 5 ME|{{nowrap|Ariane 5 ME}}]] (Mid-life Evolution) which would increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to GTO and feature a restartable second stage to allow more complex missions.

In addition, the Soyuz rocket\u2014which has been the Russian's space launch workhorse for some 40 years\u2014is proven technology with a very good safety record. Russia benefits in that it gets access to the Kourou launch site.

Merbold.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulf Merbold]] became the first ESA astronaut to fly into space.]]\nAt the time ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was [[Czechoslovak]] [[Vladim\u00edr Remek]] who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space being [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union) \u2013 on a [[Soviet space programme|Soviet]] [[Soyuz spacecraft]], followed by the [[Poles|Pole]] [[Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski]] and [[East German]] [[Sigmund J\u00e4hn]] in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as [[Intercosmos]], primarily involved the participation of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. In 1982, however, [[Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien]] became the first [[Western Bloc|non-Communist Bloc]] astronaut on a flight to the Soviet [[Salyut 7]] space station.\n\nBecause Chr\u00e9tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French [[CNES]] astronaut corps, the German [[Ulf Merbold]] is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the [[STS-9]] [[Space Shuttle]] mission that included the first use of the European-built [[Spacelab]] in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by ESA (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the [[Soviet Union]] and later Russia, including numerous visits to [[Mir]].\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the [[European Astronaut Centre]] in [[Cologne]], Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to the [[International Space Station]]. As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the [[European Astronaut Corps]] were selected - five men and one woman.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Closing_in_on_new_astronauts | title = Closing in on new astronauts | date = 24 September 2008 | accessdate=6 September 2014 | publisher = European Space Agency}}</ref>\n\n===Astronaut names===\n{{See also|European Astronaut Corps}}\n\nThe astronauts of the European Space Agency are:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Clervoy]]<ref group=note name=Mir />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}}   [[Samantha Cristoforetti]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Belgium|state}} [[Frank De Winne]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Spain}}   [[Pedro Duque]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Reinhold Ewald]]<ref group=note name=Mir />\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[L\u00e9opold Eyharts]]<ref group=note name=Mir /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Alexander Gerst]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}}   [[Umberto Guidoni]]<ref group=note name=retired /><ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Christer Fuglesang]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Andr\u00e9 Kuipers]]<ref group=note name=ISS />\n*{{flagicon|Denmark}} [[Andreas Mogensen]]<ref group=note name=selection2009 />\n*{{flagicon|Italy}} [[Paolo A.

Around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the [[Space Shuttle]] and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the [[Ariane 5]] rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in [[low Earth orbit]] space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The [[Columbus Man-Tended Free Flyer|Columbus space station programme]] had a similar fate.\n\nIn the 21st century, ESA started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]], whose prototype by [[Airbus|EADS]], called [[EADS Phoenix|Phoenix]], has already been tested. While projects such as [[Hopper (spacecraft)|Hopper]] are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the [[Russian Space Agency]] have emerged. Following talks with the [[Russian Space Agency]] in 2004 and June 2005,<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/space/article/0,14493,1489679,00.html | date = 22 May 2005 | title = Europe to hitch space ride on Russia's rocket | first = Robin | last = McKie | work = [[The Observer]]}}</ref> a co-operation between ESA and the [[Russian Space Agency]] was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed [[Kliper]], a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A \u20ac50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to the [[CSTS|Crew Space Transportation System]] (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] design. This project was pursued with [[Roskosmos]] instead of the cancelled Kliper proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft was contemplated for 2008.\nIn mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a \u20ac21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV which is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coppinger |first=Rob |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/hyperbola/2009/07/picture-eads-astrium-wins-21-m.html |title=EADS Astrium wins \u20ac21 million reentry vehicle study |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date= |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, ESA decided to join NASA's [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion programme]]. The ATV would form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA's new manned spacecraft. ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/nov/17/britons-could-explore-deep-space|title=Project Orion raises hopes that Britain could have its own man on the moon|publisher=The Observer|date=17 November 2012|author=Robin McKie|accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, ESA signed an agreement with [[Sierra Nevada Corporation]] for co-operation in [[Dream Chaser]] project.

Its headquarters are in central [[Paris]]. CNES is the main participant on the Ariane project. Indeed, CNES designed and tested all Ariane family rockets (mainly from its centre in [[\u00c9vry, Essonne|\u00c9vry]] near [[Paris]])\n* The [[UK Space Agency]] is a partnership of the UK government departments which are active in space. Through the UK Space Agency, the partners provide delegates to represent the UK on the various ESA governing bodies. Each partner funds its own programme.\n* The [[Italian Space Agency]] (''Agenzia Spaziale Italiana'' or ASI) was founded in 1988 to promote, co-ordinate and conduct space activities in Italy. Operating under the Ministry of the Universities and of Scientific and Technological Research, the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the Council of Ministers. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy's delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies.\n* The [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) (German: ''Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e.

Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, the [[Space Shuttle]] has been the primary launch vehicle used by ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Spacelab]] programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights on which ESA participate with astronauts in experiments.\n\nIn robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been ESA's main partner. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] was a joint NASA-ESA mission, along with the [[Infrared Space Observatory]], [[INTEGRAL]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], and others.

This includes shaping the lips to the [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]] of a [[woodwind instrument]] or the [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] of a [[brass instrument]]. The word is of [[French language|French]] origin and is related to the root ''{{wiktfra|bouche}}'', 'mouth'. Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles.\n\n==Brass embouchure==\nWhile performing on a brass instrument, the sound is produced by the player buzzing his or her lips into a mouthpiece. Pitches are changed in part through altering the amount of muscular contraction in the lip formation. The performer's use of the air, tightening of cheek and jaw muscles, as well as tongue manipulation can affect how the embouchure works.\n\nEven today, many brass pedagogues{{Who|date=August 2011}} take a rigid approach to teaching how a brass player's embouchure should function. Many of these authors{{Which|date=August 2011}} also disagree with each other regarding which technique is correct. Research{{Which|date=August 2011}} suggests efficient brass embouchures depend on the player using the method that suits that player's particular anatomy (see below). Individual differences in dental structure, lip shape and size, jaw shape and the degree of jaw malocclusion, and other anatomical factors will affect whether a particular embouchure technique will be effective or not.<ref>''How The Chops Work'', [[Clint McLaughlin]], 2003</ref>\n\nIn 1962, [[Philip Farkas]] hypothesized<ref name=\"artofbrass\">''The Art of Brass Playing'', Philip Farkas, 1962</ref> that the air stream traveling through the lip aperture should be directed straight down the shank of the mouthpiece. He believed that it would be illogical to \"violently deflect\" the air stream downward at the point of where the air moves past the lips. In this text, Farkas also recommends that the lower jaw be protruded so that the upper and lower teeth are aligned.\n\nIn 1970, Farkas published a second text<ref name=\"farkasphoto\">''A Photographic Study of 40 Virtuoso Horn Players'', Philip Farkas, 1970</ref> which contradicted his earlier writing. Out of 40 subjects, Farkas showed that 39 subjects directed the air downward to varying degrees and one subject directed the air in an upward direction at various degrees. The lower jaw position seen in these photographs show more variation from his earlier text as well.\n\nThis supports what was written by trombonist and brass pedagogue [[Donald S. Reinhardt]] in 1942.<ref>''Pivot System For Trumpet'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1942</ref><ref>''Pivot System for Trombone'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1942</ref> In 1972,<ref>''The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1972</ref> Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as mouthpiece placement and the general direction of the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the mouthpiece higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the mouthpiece lower, so that more lower lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air stream direction and mouthpiece placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.<ref>\"A Study of Lip Vibrations with High-Speed Photography\", ''International Trombone Association Journal'', Lloyd Leno, 1987</ref>\n\nMore controversial was Reinhardt's description and recommendations regarding a phenomenon he termed a \"pivot\". According to Reinhardt, a successful brass embouchure depends on a motion wherein the performer moves both the mouthpiece and lips as a single unit along the teeth in an upward and downward direction. As the performer ascends in pitch, he or she will either move the lips and mouthpiece together slightly up towards the nose or pull them down together slightly towards the chin, and use the opposite motion to descend in pitch. Whether the player uses one general pivot direction or the other, and the degree to which the motion is performed, depends on the performer's anatomical features and stage of development. The placement of the mouthpiece upon the lips doesn't change, but rather the relationship of the rim and lips to the teeth. While the angle of the instrument may change as this motion follows the shape of the teeth and placement of the jaw, contrary to what many brass performers and teachers believe, the angle of the instrument does not actually constitute the motion Reinhardt advised as a pivot.\n\nLater research supports Reinhardt's claim that this motion exists and might be advisable for brass performers to adopt. John Froelich<ref>\"The Mouthpiece Forces Used During Trombone Performances\", ''International Trombone Association Journal'', John Froelich, 1990</ref> describes how mouthpiece pressure towards the lips (vertical forces) and shear pressure (horizontal forces) functioned in three test groups, student trombonists, professional trombonists, and professional symphonic trombonists. Froelich noted that the symphonic trombonists used the least amount of both direct and shear forces and recommends this model be followed. Other research notes that virtually all brass performers rely upon the upward and downward embouchure motion.<ref>''The Correlation Between Doug Elliott's Embouchure Types and Playing and Selected Physical Characteristics Among Trombonists'' (David Wilken, doctoral dissertation, [[Ball State University]], 2000)</ref><ref>''An Analysis, Clarification, and Revaluation of Donald Reinhardt's Pivot System for Brass Instruments'' (David Ray Turnbull, doctoral thesis, [[Arizona State University]], 2001</ref> Other authors and pedagogues remain skeptical about the necessity of this motion, but scientific evidence supporting this view has not been sufficiently developed at this time.\n\nSome noted brass pedagogues prefer to instruct the use of the embouchure from a less analytical point of view. [[Arnold Jacobs]], a tubist and well-regarded brass teacher, believed that it was best for the student to focus on his or her use of the air and musical expression to allow the embouchure to develop naturally on its own.<ref>''Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind'', Brian Frederiksen, 1996</ref> Other instructors, such as Carmine Caruso, believed that the brass player's embouchure could best be developed through coordination exercises and drills that bring all the muscles into balance that focus the student's attention on his or her time perception.<ref>''Musical Calisthenics for Brass'', Carmine Caruso, 1979</ref> Still other authors who have differing approaches to embouchure development include [[Louis Maggio]],<ref>''Original Louis Maggio System for Brass'', C. MacBeth</ref> [[Jeff Smiley]],<ref>''The Balanced Embouchure'', Jeff Smiley</ref> [[Jerome Callet]].<ref>''Superchops'', Jerome Callet</ref><ref>''Trumpet Secrets'', Jerome Callet</ref> and [[Clint McLaughlin]].<ref>''Tensionless Playing'' and \"The 4 Trumpet Octave Keys\" http://www.BbTrumpet.com, Clint 'Pops' McLaughlin</ref>\n\n===Farkas embouchure===\nMost professional performers, as well as instructors, use a combination called a puckered smile. Farkas<ref name=\"artofbrass\" /> told people to blow as if they were trying to cool soup. [[Raphael Mendez]] advised saying the letter \"M\".<ref>http://www.bbtrumpet.com/embouchures.html</ref> The skin under the lower lip will be taut with no air pocket. The lips do not overlap nor do they roll in or out. The corners of the mouth are held firmly in place. To play with an extended range one should use a pivot, tongue arch and lip to lip compression.\n\nAccording to Farkas<ref name=\"artofbrass\" /> the mouthpiece should have {{2/3}} upper lip and {{1/3}} lower lip (French horn), {{2/3}} lower lip and {{1/3}} upper lip (trumpet and cornet), and more latitude for lower brass (trombone, baritone, and tuba). For trumpet, some also advocate {{1/2}} upper lip and {{1/2}} lower lip.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Farkas claimed placement was more important for the instruments with smaller mouthpieces.<ref name=\"artofbrass\" /> The lips should not overlap each other, nor should they roll in or out. The mouth corners should be held firm. Farkas speculated that the horn should be held in a downward angle to allow the air stream to go straight into the mouthpiece, although his later text<ref name=\"farkasphoto\" /> shows that air stream direction actually is either upstream or downstream and is dependent upon the ratio of upper or lower lip inside the mouthpiece, not the horn angle. Farkas advised to moisten the outside of the lips, then form the embouchure and gently place the mouthpiece on it.<ref name=\"artofbrass\" /> He also recommended there must be a gap of {{convert|1/3|in|mm|0}} or so between the teeth so that the air flows freely.\n\n===Arban vs. Saint-Jacome===\nArban and Saint-Jacome were both cornet soloists and authors of well respected and still used method books. Arban stated undogmatically that he believed the mouthpiece should be placed {{1/3}} on the top lip. Saint-Jacome to the contrary said dogmatically that the mouthpiece should be placed \"two-thirds for the upper and the rest for the under according to all professors and one-third for the upper and two-thirds for the under according to one sole individual, whom I shall not name.\"<ref>Original text: http://www.purtle.com/saint-jacome-method-original-text.html</ref>\n\n====Buzzing embouchure====\nThe Farkas set is the basis of most lip buzzing embouchures. Mendez did teach lip buzzing by making the student lip buzz for a month before they could play their trumpet and got great results. <ref>http://www.bbtrumpet.com/lip-buzzing-embouchure-and-mendez/</ref> One can initiate this type of buzz by using the same sensation as spitting seeds, but maintaining a continued flow of air. This technique assists the development of the Farkas approach by preventing the player from using an aperture that is too open.\n\n===Stevens\u2013Costello embouchure===\n\nStevens\u2013Costello embouchure has its origins in the William Costello embouchure and was further developed by [[Roy Stevens]].<ref>''The Complete Stevens-Costello Embouchure Technique, 2nd Edition'' by Roy Stevens & Bill Moriarity, Amazon Create Space</ref> It uses a slight rolling in of both lips and touching evenly all the way across. It also uses mouthpiece placement of about 40\u201350% top lip and 50\u201360% lower lip. The teeth will be about {{convert|1/4|to|1/2|in|mm|0}} apart and the teeth are parallel or the jaw slightly forward.\n\nThere is relative mouthpiece pressure to the given air column. One exercise to practice the proper weight to air relationship is the palm exercise where the player holds the horn by laying it on its side in the palm of the hand, not grasping it. The lips are placed on the mouthpiece and the player blows utilizing the weight of the horn in establishing a sound.\n\n===Maggio embouchure===\n\nA puckered embouchure, used by most players, and sometimes used by jazz players for extremely high \"screamer\" notes. Maggio claimed that the pucker embouchure gives more endurance than some systems. Carlton MacBeth is the main proponent of the pucker embouchure. <ref>http://www.bbtrumpet.com/maggio-embouchure/</ref> The Maggio system was established because Louis Maggio had sustained an injury which prevented him from playing. In this system the player cushions the lips by extending them or puckering (like a monkey). This puckering enables the players to overcome physical malformations. It also lets the player play for an extended time in the upper register. The pucker can make it easy to use to open an aperture. Lots of very soft practice can help overcome this. Claude Gordon was a student of Louis Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke and systematized the concepts of these teachers. Claude Gordon made use of pedal tones for embouchure development as did Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke. All three stressed that the mouthpiece should be placed higher on the top lip for a more free vibration of the lips.\n\n===Tongue-controlled embouchure===\n\nThis embouchure method, advocated by a minority of brass pedagogues such as Jerome Callet, has not yet been sufficiently researched to support the claims that this system is the most effective approach for all brass performers.\n\nAdvocates of Callet's approach believe that this method was recommended and taught by the great brass instructors of the early 20th Century. Two French trumpet technique books, authored by Jean-Baptiste Arban and Saint-Jacome, were translated into English for use by American players. According to some, due to a misunderstanding arising from differences in pronunciation between French and English, the commonly used brass embouchure in Europe was incorrectly interpreted.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Callet attributes this difference in embouchure technique as the reason the great players of the past were able to play at the level of technical virtuosity which they did, although the increased difficulty of contemporary compositions for brass seem to indicate that the level of brass technique achieved by today's performers equals or even exceeds that of most performers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nCallet's method of brass embouchure consists of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times. The corners of the mouth always remain relaxed, and only a small amount of air is used. The top and bottom lips curl inward and grip the forward tongue. The tongue will force the teeth, and subsequently the throat, wide open, supposedly resulting in a bigger, more open sound. The forward tongue resists the pressure of the mouthpiece, controls the flow of air for lower and higher notes, and protects the lips and teeth from damage or injury from mouthpiece pressure. Because of the importance of the tongue in this method many refer to this as a \"tongue-controlled embouchure\". This technique facilitates the use of a smaller mouthpiece and larger bore instruments. It results in improved intonation and stronger harmonically related partials across the player's range.\n\n==Woodwind embouchure==\n[[File:SfondoNINI2b.JPG|thumb|Flute embouchure]]\n\n===Flute embouchure===\n\nA variety of [[flute|transverse flute]] embouchures are employed by professional flautists, though the most natural form is perfectly symmetrical, the corners of the mouth relaxed (i.e. not smiling), the lower lip placed along and at a short distance from the embouchure hole. It must be stressed, however, that achieving a symmetrical, or perfectly centred blowing hole ought not to be an end in itself. Indeed, French flautist [[Marcel Moyse]] did not play with a symmetrical embouchure.\n\nThe end-blown [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[kaval]], [[shakuhachi]] and [[hocchiku]] flutes demand especially difficult embouchures, sometimes requiring many lessons before any sound can be produced.\n\nThe embouchure is an important element to tone production. The right embouchure, developed  with \"time, patience, and intelligent work\",<ref>{{cite book\n\n | author = [[Marcel Moyse]]\n\n | title = De la Sonorit\u00e9\n\n | publisher= A. Leduc\n\n | year = 1934\n\n}}</ref> will produce a beautiful sound and a correct intonation. The embouchure is produced with the muscles around the lips: principally  the [[orbicularis oris muscle]] and the [[Depressor anguli oris muscle|depressor anguli oris]], whilst avoiding activiation of [[Zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]], which will produce a smile, flattening the top lip against the maxillary (upper jaw) teeth. Beginner flute-players tend to suffer fatigue in these muscles, and notably struggle to use the depressor muscle, which necessarily helps to keep the top lip directing the flow of air across the embouchure hole. These muscles have to be properly warmed up and exercised before practicing. Tone development exercises including long notes and harmonics must be done as part of the warm up every day.\n\nSome further adjustments to the embouchure are necessary when moving from the transverse orchestral flute to the piccolo. With the piccolo, it becomes necessary to place the near side of the embouchure hole slightly higher on the lower lip, i.e. above the lip margin, and greater muscle tone from the lip muscles is needed to keep the stream/pressure of air directed across the smaller embouchure hole, particularly when playing in higher piccolo registers.\n\n===Reed instrument embouchure===\n[[File:WikiLoveMusikHamburg2017 B-Klarinette 1K4A0846B.jpg|thumb|Clarinet embouchure.]]\nWith the woodwinds, aside from the [[flute]], [[piccolo]], and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], the sound is generated by a [[reed (music)|reed]] and not with the lips. The embouchure is therefore based on sealing the area around the reed and mouthpiece. This serves to prevent air from escaping while simultaneously supporting the reed, allowing it to vibrate, and constrict the reed preventing it from vibrating too much. With woodwinds, it is important to ensure that the mouthpiece is not placed too far into the mouth, which would result in too much vibration (no control), often creating a sound an octave (or harmonic twelfth for the clarinet) above the intended note. If the mouthpiece is not placed far enough into the mouth, no sound will be generated, as the reed will not vibrate.\n\nThe standard embouchures for single reed woodwinds like the [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] are variants of the ''single lip embouchure'', formed by resting the reed upon the bottom lip, which rests on the [[teeth]] and is supported by the chin muscles and the [[buccinator]] muscles on the sides of the mouth. The top teeth rest on top of the mouthpiece. The manner in which the lower lip rests against the teeth differs between clarinet and saxophone embouchures.  In clarinet playing, the lower lip is rolled over the teeth and corners of the mouth are drawn back, which has the effect of drawing the upper lip around the mouthpiece to create a seal due to the angle at which the mouthpiece rests in the mouth. With the [[saxophone embouchure]], the lower lip rests against, but not over, the teeth as in pronouncing the letter \"V\" and the corners of the lip are drawn in (similar to a drawstring bag).  With the less common double-lip embouchure, the top lip is placed under (around) the top teeth. In both instances, the position of the tongue in the mouth plays a vital role in focusing and accelerating the air stream blown by the player. This results in a more mature and full sound, rich in [[overtone]]s.\n\nThe [[double reed]] woodwinds, the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]], have no mouthpiece. Instead the reed is two pieces of cane extending from a metal tube (oboe \u2013 staple) or placed on a [[bocal]] ([[bassoon]], [[Cor anglais|English horn]]). The reed is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to the single reed woodwinds, the reed is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on [[musical tuning|tuning]], [[timbre|tone]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] control.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n*[[Double buzz]] relating to the brass players embouchure\n*[[Saxophone embouchure]]\n*[[Roy Stevens]] relating to the Stevens\u2013Costello

Mangum grew up making [[music]] and sharing cassette tapes in [[Ruston, Louisiana]] while attending high school.<ref name=\"E6 Story\"/> They started several bands and pet projects; Doss and Hart with [[the Olivia Tremor Control]] (then called Synthetic Flying Machine), Mangum with [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], and Schneider with [[the Apples in Stereo]]. Together, they held a mutual admiration for the music of the 1960s, especially the [[the Beach Boys|Beach Boys]], considering the unfinished ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' project the era's \"[[Holy Grail]]\".<ref name=\"Dillon2014\"/>\n\nWishing to emulate the Beach Boys' [[Brother Records]],<ref name=\"Dillon2014\"/> Schneider created the Elephant 6 [[record label]] when he moved to [[Denver, Colorado]] in late 1991 to attend the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. According to Schneider, Hart coined the name \"Elephant 6\" and Schneider added \"Recording Company.\" <ref name=\"E6 Story\"/> In Denver, Schneider and new friends founded the Apples (which eventually became the [[the Apples in Stereo|Apples in Stereo]]). Recorded at the newly built [[Pet Sounds Studio]], and released in June 1993, The Apples' [[Tidal Wave 7\"|''Tidal Wave'' 7\" EP]] was the first Elephant 6 product. Hart designed the Art Nouveau-inspired Elephant 6 logo for the label of The Apples EP.\n\nDoss had moved to [[Athens, Georgia]] where he joined Hart and Mangum in Synthetic Flying Machine, which became [[the Olivia Tremor Control]]. They released ''[[California Demise]]'' as their first recording, and the Elephant 6's second.<ref name=\"E6 Story\"/> Afterwards, the base for The Elephant 6 moved from Denver to Athens.<ref name=\"E6 Story\"/>\n\n===Success, disbandment, and continuation===\nSeveral Elephant 6 projects began to find commercial success in the late 1990s, including [[Beulah (band)|Beulah]], [[the Minders]], [[Elf Power]], [[Dressy Bessy]], [[the Music Tapes]], and [[of Montreal]], as well as the founding bands. Most of the bands subsequently signed with major record labels; E6 as an entity slowly deteriorated until the collective called it quits \u2014 due to recording difficulties and lack of organization \u2014 in 2002. The collective's bands all moved on to various labels and projects of their own.\n\nHowever, many band members are still friends and even tour together under various guises. Many live together on the [[Orange Twin Conservation Community]] in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]]. The term \"Elephant 6\" has since come to refer to a broad range of bands and spin-off projects that the record label has spawned.\n\nIn 2007 [[The Apples in Stereo]] featured the Elephant 6 logo on their album ''[[New Magnetic Wonder]]'', announcing \"The Elephant 6 Recording Company re-opens our doors and windows, and invites the world: join together with your friends and make something special, something meaningful, something to remember when you are old.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} This marked the first major release in five years to bear the Elephant 6 logo.\n\nIn 2008, the Elephant 6 logo was also used when [[Julian Koster]] released his long-awaited [[Music Tapes For Clouds and Tornadoes]] under the name [[the Music Tapes]]. He also assembled The Elephant 6 Holiday Surprise Tour which featured contributions from [[Will Cullen Hart]] and [[Bill Doss]] of [[Olivia Tremor Control]], [[Scott Spillane]] of [[the Gerbils]], [[Andrew Reiger]] and [[Laura Carter (musician)|Laura Carter]] of [[Elf Power]], [[Theo Hilton]] of [[Nana Grizol]], [[John Fernandes]] and [[Eric Harris (musician)|Eric Harris]] of OTC, The Music Tapes and [[Circulatory System]], [[Robbie Cucchiaro]] of The Music Tapes, Charlie Johnston and [[Suzanne Allison]] of [[the 63 Crayons]], [[Nesey Gallons]], [[Jeff Mangum]], and [[Peter Erchick]].  This ensemble tour was widely seen as a resurgence of Elephant 6 as a productive, cohesive entity. The show took place in the UK, curated by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] as part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England.<ref>[http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php ATP curated by Jeff Mangum]</ref>\n\nIn recent years, [[Robert Schneider]] has explored a number of experimental music projects, such as the Teletron mind-controlled synthesizer and [[Non-Pythagorean scale]] of his own invention. Indeed, since the inception of Elephant 6, members of the collective showed a strong interest and participation in experimental music, particularly [[the Olivia Tremor Control]] and [[Von Hemmling]].\n\n==List of bands part of or associated with Elephant 6==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*[[The Apples in Stereo]]\n*[[Bablicon]]\n*[[Beulah (band)|Beulah]]\n*[[Black Swan Network]]\n*[[Casper & the Cookies]]\n*[[Chocolate U.S.A.]]\n*[[Circulatory System]]\n*[[Dressy Bessy]]\n*[[Elf Power]]\n*[[The Essex Green]]\n*[[Frosted Ambassador]]\n*[[The Gerbils]]\n*[[A Hawk and a Hacksaw]]\n*[[The High Water Marks]]\n*[[The Instruments]]\n*[[The Ladybug Transistor]]\n*[[The Late B.P.

transnational and transdenominational movement, evangelicalism had from the outset encompassed considerable and often problematic diversity, but this diversity had been held in check by the commonalities evangelicals on either side of the North Atlantic shared - most notably a clear consensus about the essential content of the gospel and a shared sense of the priority of awakening those who inhabitated a broadly Christian environment to the urgent necessity of a conscious individual decision to turn to Christ in repentance and faith. Evangelicalism had maintained an ambiguous relationship with the structures of Christendom, whether those structures took the institutional form of a [[Established church|legal union between church and state]], as in most of the United Kingdom, or the more elusive character that obtained in the United States, where the sharp [[Separation of church and state in the United States|constitutional separation between church and state]] masked an underlying set of shared assumptions about the Christian (and indeed Protestant) identity of the nation. Evangelicals had differed over whether the moral imperative of a national recognition of godly religion should also imply the national recognition of a particular church, but all had been agreed that being born or baptized within the boundaries of Christendom did not in itself make one a Christian.|author=Brian Stanley|source=''The Global Diffusion of Evangelicalism: The Age of Billy Graham and John Stott'' (2013), p. 11, Vol. 5, [[InterVarsity Press|IVP Academic]], [[Downers Grove]]: [[Illinois]], {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2585-1}}.}}</ref><ref name=Oxf>{{cite book|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary | year=1978| publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.operationworld.org/glossary | title=Operation World}}</ref> Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or [[Born again (Christianity)|\"born again\" experience]] in receiving salvation, in the authority of the [[Bible]] as [[God]]'s revelation to humanity, and in [[Evangelism|spreading the Christian message]].

Its light, he argued, was hidden under a bushel of ecclesiastical authority, tradition, and liturgy. The essence of the saving message for Luther was justification by faith alone, the article by which not only the church stands or falls but each individual as well. [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Johannes Eck]] denigrated those who accepted this view and referred to them as 'evangelicals.'}}</ref> Into the 21st century, ''evangelical'' has continued in use as a synonym for ([[Mainline Protestant|mainline]]) Protestant in continental Europe, and elsewhere. This usage is reflected in the names of Protestant denominations, such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (a union of [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed]] churches) and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]].{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=16}}\n\nIn the English-speaking world, ''evangelical'' was commonly applied to describe the series of revival movements that occurred in Britain and North America during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=2}} Christian historian [[David Bebbington]] writes that, \"Although 'evangelical', with a lower-case initial, is occasionally used to mean 'of the gospel', the term 'Evangelical', with a capital letter, is applied to any aspect of the movement beginning in the 1730s.\"{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=1}} According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''evangelicalism'' was first used in 1831.{{Sfn|Worthen|2014|p=273}}\n\nThe term may also be used outside any religious context to characterize a generic missionary, reforming, or redeeming impulse or purpose.

To evangelicals, the central message of the gospel is [[justification by faith]] in Christ and [[repentance]], or turning away, from [[sin]]. Conversion differentiates the Christian from the non-Christian, and the change in life it leads to is marked by both a rejection of sin and a corresponding personal [[Sanctification|holiness]] of life. A conversion experience can be emotional, including grief and sorrow for sin followed by great relief at receiving forgiveness. The stress on conversion differentiates evangelicalism from other forms of Protestantism by the associated belief that an [[assurance of salvation]] will accompany conversion. Among evangelicals, individuals have testified to both sudden and gradual conversions.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=5\u20138}}\n\n''Biblicism'' is reverence for the [[Protestant Bible|Bible]] and a high regard for [[biblical authority]]. All evangelicals believe in [[biblical inspiration]], though they disagree over how this inspiration should be defined. Many evangelicals believe in [[biblical inerrancy]], while other evangelicals believe in [[biblical infallibility]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=12\u201314}}\n\n''Crucicentrism'' is the centrality that evangelicals give to the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]], the saving [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[resurrection of Jesus]], that offers forgiveness of sins and new life. This is understood most commonly in terms of a [[substitutionary atonement]], in which Christ died as a substitute for sinful humanity by taking on himself the guilt and punishment for sin.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=15\u201316}}\n\n''Activism'' describes the tendency toward active expression and sharing of the gospel in diverse ways that include preaching and social action. This aspect of evangelicalism continues to be seen today in the proliferation of evangelical voluntary religious groups and [[parachurch organizations]].{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=12}}\n\n==Diversity==\n{{Further|List of Christian denominations}}\n[[File:Panel Discussion 2.jpg|thumb|Together For the Gospel, an evangelical pastors' conference held biennially. A panel discussion with (from left to right) [[Albert Mohler]], [[Ligon Duncan]], [[C. J.

The [[Reformed]], [[Baptists|Baptist]], [[Wesleyan]], [[Pentecostal]], [[Churches of Christ]], [[Plymouth Brethren]], [[Charismatic movement|charismatic Protestant]], and [[Nondenominational Christianity|nondenominational Protestant]] traditions have all had strong influence within contemporary evangelicalism.{{Sfn | Mohler | 2011 | pp=117}}<ref>Brian Stiller, ''Evangelicals Around the World: A Global Handbook for the 21st Century'', Thomas Nelson, USA, 2015, p. 28, 90</ref> Some [[Anabaptist]] denominations (such as the [[The Brethren Church|Brethren Church]])<ref name=NAEdenom>{{cite web|url = https://www.nae.net/denominations/ | title = Denominations | website = www.nae.net | publisher = National Association of Evangelicals | access-date = November 27, 2017}}</ref> are evangelical, and some [[Lutherans]] self-identify as evangelicals. There are also [[evangelical Anglicanism|evangelical Anglicans]].<ref name=Coulter/>\n\nIn the early 20th century, evangelical influence declined within [[mainline Protestantism]] and [[Christian fundamentalism]] developed as a distinct religious movement. Between 1950 and 2000 a mainstream evangelical consensus developed that sought to be more inclusive and more culturally relevant than fundamentalism, while maintaining conservative Protestant teaching. According to [[Brian Stanley (historian) |Brian Stanley]], professor of [[world Christianity]], this new postwar consensus is termed ''neo-evangelicalism'', the ''new evangelicalism'', or simply ''evangelicalism'' in the United States, while in Great Britain and in other English-speaking countries, it is commonly termed ''[[conservative evangelicalism in the United Kingdom|conservative evangelicalism]]''. Over the years, less-conservative evangelicals have challenged this mainstream consensus to varying degrees. Such movements have been classified by a variety of labels, such as progressive, open, post-conservative, and post-evangelical.{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp=27\u201328}}\n\n===Christian fundamentalism===\n\n[[Christian fundamentalism| Fundamentalism]] (sometimes known as conservative evangelicalism)<ref>{{cite book|last= Harris|first= Harriet A. |title= Fundamentalism and Evangelicals|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LXkSDAAAQBAJ|accessdate= 24 October 2017|year= 1998|publisher= Clarendon Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-826960-1|pages= 58\u201359|quote= The overriding implication of Fundamentalism is that conservative evangelicals are in fact fundamentalist but that they reject the term because of its pejorative connotations: 'By what term would \"fundamentalists\" prefer to be called?

Failing to reform the mainline churches, fundamentalists separated from them and established their own churches, refusing to participate in [[Ecumenism| ecumenical]] organizations such as the [[National Council of Churches]] (founded in 1950). They also made [[Ecclesiastical separatism| separatism]] (rigid separation from non-fundamentalist churches and their [[culture]]) a true test of faith. According to historian [[George Marsden]], most fundamentalists are Baptists and [[dispensationalist]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=3\u20134}}\n\n===Mainstream varieties===\n[[File:Book of Common Prayer 1760.jpg|thumb|The Prayer Book of 1662 included the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] emphasized by [[evangelical Anglican]]s.]]\nMainstream evangelicalism is historically divided between two main orientations: [[Confessionalism (religion)| confessionalism]] and [[revivalism]]. These two streams have been critical of each other. Confessional evangelicals have been suspicious of unguarded [[religious experience]], while revivalist evangelicals have been critical of overly intellectual teaching that (they suspect) stifles vibrant [[spirituality]].{{Sfn | Olson | 2011 | pp= 241\u2013242}} In an effort to broaden their appeal, many contemporary evangelical congregations intentionally avoid identifying with any single form of evangelicalism. These \"generic evangelicals\" are usually theologically and socially conservative, but their churches often present themselves as [[Nondenominational Christianity| nondenominational]] within the broader evangelical movement.{{Sfn | Reimer | 2003 | pp=29}}\n\nIn the words of [[Albert Mohler]], president of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], confessional evangelicalism refers to \"that movement of Christian believers who seek a constant convictional continuity with the theological formulas of the Protestant Reformation\". While approving of the evangelical distinctions proposed by Bebbington, confessional evangelicals believe that authentic evangelicalism requires more concrete definition in order to protect the movement from theological liberalism and from [[heresy in Christianity |heresy]]. According to confessional evangelicals, subscription to the [[ecumenical creeds]] and to the Reformation-era confessions of faith (such as the [[Reformed confessions of faith| confessions of the Reformed churches]]) provides such protection.{{Sfn | Mohler | 2011 | pp=103\u2013104}} Confessional evangelicals are represented by conservative [[Presbyterian]] churches (emphasizing the [[Westminster Confession]]), certain Baptist churches that emphasize historic Baptist confessions such as the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith|Second London Confession]], [[Evangelical Anglicanism |evangelical Anglicans]] who emphasize the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] (such as in the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney]], Australia{{Sfn | Stanley | 2013 | pp= 58}}), and some [[confessional Lutherans]] with pietistic convictions.{{Sfn | Ellingsen | 1991 | pp=222, 238}}<ref name=Coulter>Dale M.

Retrieved December 17, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe emphasis on historic Protestant orthodoxy among confessional evangelicals stands in direct contrast to an anti-creedal outlook that has exerted its own influence on evangelicalism, particularly among churches strongly affected by revivalism and by [[pietism]]. Revivalist evangelicals are represented by some quarters of [[Methodism]], the [[Holiness Movement |Wesleyan Holiness]] churches, the Pentecostal/[[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic]] churches, some Anabaptist churches, and some Baptists and Presbyterians.<ref name=Coulter/> Revivalist evangelicals tend to place greater emphasis on religious experience than their confessional counterparts.{{Sfn | Olson | 2011 | pp=241\u2013242}}\n\n===Non-conservative varieties===\n\nEvangelicals dissatisfied with the movement's conservative mainstream have been variously described as progressive evangelicals, post-conservative evangelicals, [[Open Evangelical]]s and [[post-evangelicalism| post-evangelicals]]. Progressive evangelicals, also known as the [[evangelical left]], share theological or social views with other [[Progressive Christianity| progressive Christians]] while also identifying with evangelicalism. Progressive evangelicals commonly advocate for women's equality, [[pacifism]] and [[social justice]].{{Sfn | Marsden | 1991 | pp=75}}\n\nAs described by Baptist theologian [[Roger E. Olson]], post-conservative evangelicalism is a theological school of thought that adheres to the four marks of evangelicalism, while being less rigid and more inclusive of other Christians. According to Olson, post-conservatives believe that doctrinal truth is secondary to spiritual experience shaped by [[Scripture]]. Post-conservative evangelicals seek greater dialogue with other Christian traditions and support the development of a multicultural evangelical theology that incorporates the voices of women, racial minorities, and Christians in the developing world. Some post-conservative evangelicals also support [[open theism]] and the possibility of near [[universal salvation]].<ref name=OlsonCentury>Roger E. Olson, [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 \"Postconservative Evangelicals Greet the Postmodern Age\"] {{Webarchive| url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101003723/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=85 |date= 2016-01-01 }}, ''The Christian Century'' (May 3, 1995), pp. 480\u2013483. Retrieved December 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe term \"Open Evangelical\" refers to a particular Christian school of thought or [[churchmanship]], primarily in Great Britain (especially in the [[Church of England]]). Open evangelicals describe their position as combining a traditional evangelical emphasis on the nature of scriptural authority, the teaching of the [[ecumenical creeds]] and other traditional doctrinal teachings, with an approach towards culture and other [[theology|theological]] points-of-view which tends to be more inclusive than that taken by other evangelicals. Some open evangelicals aim to take a middle position between conservative and charismatic evangelicals, while others would combine conservative theological emphases with more liberal social positions.{{Sfn | Randall | 2005 | p=52}}\n\nBritish author Dave Tomlinson coined the phrase ''post-evangelical'' to describe a movement comprising various trends of dissatisfaction among evangelicals. Others use the term with comparable intent, often to distinguish evangelicals in the so-called [[emerging church movement]] from post-evangelicals and anti-evangelicals. Tomlinson argues that \"linguistically, the distinction ''[between evangelical and post-evangelical]'' resembles the one that sociologists make between the [[modernism |modern]] and [[postmodernism |postmodern]] eras\".{{Sfn | Tomlinson | 2007 | p= 28}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Nikolaus_Ludwig_von_Zinzendorf_(portrait_by_Balthasar_Denner).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|[[Count von Zinzendorf]] was a major influence on [[John Wesley]] in founding the Methodist movement.]]\nEvangelicalism did not take recognizable form until the 18th century, first in Britain and its North American colonies. Nevertheless, there were earlier developments within the larger Protestant world that preceded and influenced the later evangelical revivals. According to religion scholar, social activist, and politician [[Randall Balmer]], Evangelicalism resulted \"from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain \u2013 warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans\".{{Sfn | Balmer| 2002 |pp=vii\u2013viii}} Historian [[Mark Noll]] adds to this list [[High Church]] Anglicanism, which contributed to Evangelicalism a legacy of \"rigorous spirituality and innovative organization\".{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=50}}\n\nDuring the 17th century, [[Pietism]] emerged in Europe as a movement for the revival of [[piety]] and devotion within the Lutheran church. As a protest against \"cold orthodoxy\" or an overly formal and rational Christianity, Pietists advocated for an experiential religion that stressed high moral standards for both clergy and lay people. The movement included both Christians who remained in the [[liturgical]], [[state church]]es as well as [[Separatism#Religious separatism|separatist]] groups who rejected the use of baptismal fonts, altars, pulpits, and confessionals. As Pietism spread, the movement's ideals and aspirations influenced and were absorbed into early Evangelicalism.{{Sfn | Balmer | 2002 | pp=542\u2013543}}\n\nThe Presbyterian heritage not only gave Evangelicalism a commitment to Protestant orthodoxy but also contributed a revival tradition that stretched back to the 1620s in Scotland and Northern Ireland.{{Sfn | Longfield | 2013 | pp=7}} Central to this tradition was the [[communion season]], which normally occurred in the summer months. For Presbyterians, celebrations of [[Holy Communion]] were infrequent but popular events preceded by several Sundays of preparatory preaching and accompanied with preaching, singing, and prayers.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=44, 112}}\n\nPuritanism combined Calvinism with teaching that conversion was a prerequisite for church membership and a stress on the study of Scripture by lay people. It took root in New England, where the [[Congregational church]] was an established religion. The [[Half-Way Covenant]] of 1662 allowed parents who had not testified to a conversion experience to have their children baptized, while reserving Holy Communion for converted church members alone.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=54\u201355}} By the 18th century, Puritanism was in decline and many ministers were alarmed at the loss of religious piety. This concern over declining religious commitment led many people to support evangelical revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=46\u201347}}\n\nHigh Church Anglicanism also exerted influence on early Evangelicalism. High Churchmen were distinguished by their desire to adhere to [[primitive Christianity]]. This desire included imitating the faith and ascetic practices of early Christians as well as regularly partaking of Holy Communion. High Churchmen were also enthusiastic organizers of voluntary religious societies. Two of the most prominent were the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]], which distributed Bibles and other literature and built schools, and the [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]], which was created to facilitate missionary work in British colonies. [[Samuel Wesley (poet)|Samuel]] and [[Susanna Wesley]], the parents of John and Charles Wesley, were both devoted advocates of High [[Churchmanship]].{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=66\u201367}}\n\n===18th century===\n{{See also|First Great Awakening}}\n[[File:A Faithful Narrative of the Surprizing Work of God by Jonathan Edwards 1737.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Jonathan Edwards' account of the revival in Northampton was published in 1737 as ''[[A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in the Conversion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton]]'']]\n\nIn the 1730s, Evangelicalism emerged as a distinct phenomenon out of religious revivals that began in Britain and New England. While religious revivals had occurred within Protestant churches in the past, the evangelical revivals that marked the 18th century were more intense and radical.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76}} Evangelical revivalism imbued ordinary men and women with a confidence and enthusiasm for sharing the gospel and converting others outside of the control of established churches, a key discontinuity with the Protestantism of the previous era.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=74}}\n\nIt was developments in the doctrine of assurance that differentiated Evangelicalism from what went before. Bebbington says, \"The dynamism of the Evangelical movement was possible only because its adherents were assured in their faith.\"{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=42}} He goes on:\n\n{{Quote | Whereas the Puritans had held that assurance is rare, late and the fruit of struggle in the experience of believers, the Evangelicals believed it to be general, normally given at conversion and the result of simple acceptance of the gift of God. The consequence of the altered form of the doctrine was a metamorphosis in the nature of popular Protestantism. There was a change in patterns of piety, affecting devotional and practical life in all its departments. The shift, in fact, was responsible for creating in Evangelicalism a new movement and not merely a variation on themes heard since the Reformation.{{Sfn | Bebbington | 1993 | pp=43}}}}\n\nThe first local revival occurred in Northampton, Massachusetts, under the leadership of Congregationalist minister [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. In the fall of 1734, Edwards preached a sermon series on \"Justification By Faith Alone\", and the community's response was extraordinary. Signs of religious commitment among the [[laity]] increased, especially among the town's young people. The revival ultimately spread to 25 communities in western Massachusetts and central Connecticut until it began to wane by the spring of 1735.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=76\u201378}} Edwards was heavily influenced by Pietism, so much so that one historian has stressed his \"American Pietism\".{{Sfn | Lovelace | 2007 | pp=}} One practice clearly copied from European Pietists was the use of small groups divided by age and gender, which met in private homes to conserve and promote the fruits of revival.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=77}}\n\nAt the same time, students at [[Yale University]] (at that time Yale College) in New Haven, Connecticut, were also experiencing revival.

During this spiritual crisis, John Wesley was directly influenced by Pietism. Two years before his conversion, Wesley had traveled to the newly established colony of Georgia as a missionary for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He shared his voyage with a group of [[Moravian Brethren]] led by [[August Gottlieb Spangenberg]]. The Moravians' faith and piety deeply impressed Wesley, especially their belief that it was a normal part of Christian life to have an assurance of one's salvation.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=84}} Wesley recounted the following exchange with Spangenberg on February 7, 1736:\n\n{{Quote|[Spangenberg] said, \"My brother, I must first ask you one or two questions. Have you the witness within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness with your spirit that you are a child of God?\" I was surprised, and knew not what to answer. He observed it, and asked, \"Do you know Jesus Christ?\" I paused, and said, \"I know he is the Savior of the world.\" \"True,\" he replied, \"but do you know he has saved you?\" I answered, \"I hope he has died to save me.\" He only added, \"Do you know yourself?\" I said, \"I do.\" But I fear they were vain words.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=85}}}}\n\nWesley finally received the assurance he had been searching for at a meeting of a religious society in London. While listening to a reading from [[Martin Luther]]'s preface to the [[Epistle to the Romans]], Wesley felt spiritually transformed:\n\n{{Quote|About a quarter before nine, while [the speaker] was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away ''my'' sins, even ''mine'', and saved ''me'' from the law of sin and death.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=97}}}}\n\nPietism continued to influence Wesley, who had translated 33 Pietist hymns from German to English. Numerous German Pietist hymns became part of the English Evangelical repertoire.{{Sfn | Shantz | 2013 | pp=279\u2013280}} By 1737, Whitefield had become a national celebrity in England where his preaching drew large crowds, especially in London where the [[Fetter Lane Society]] had become a center of evangelical activity.{{Sfn | Noll | 2004 | pp=87, 95}} Whitfield joined forces with Edwards to \"fan the flame of revival\" in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] in 1739\u201340.

It reached people who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety and their self-awareness. To the evangelical imperatives of Reformation Protestantism, 18th century American Christians added emphases on divine outpourings of the Holy Spirit and conversions that implanted within new believers an intense love for God.

It described the mood of positivism and non-militancy that characterized that generation. The new generation of Evangelicals set as their goal to abandon a militant Bible stance. Instead, they would pursue dialogue, intellectualism, non-judgmentalism, and appeasement. They further called for an increased application of the gospel to sociological, political, and economic areas.\n\nThe self-identified fundamentalists also cooperated in separating their \"neo-Evangelical\" opponents from the ''fundamentalist'' name, by increasingly seeking to distinguish themselves from the more open group, whom they often characterized derogatorily by Ockenga's term, \"neo-Evangelical\" or just \"Evangelical\".\n\nThe fundamentalists saw the Evangelicals as often being too concerned about social acceptance and intellectual respectability, and being too accommodating to a perverse generation that needed correction.

The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have [[piston valve]]s, though models with [[rotary valve]]s do exist. \n\nThe euphonium may be played in bass clef as a non-[[transposing instrument]] or in treble clef as a transposing instrument. In British brass bands, it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument, while in American band music, parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef, or both.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe euphonium is in the family of [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]], more particularly low-brass instruments with many relatives. It is extremely similar to a [[baritone horn]]. The bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium, and the baritone is primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the euphonium is predominantly conical bore<ref name=\"Euphonium\" />. It is controversial whether this is sufficient to make them two different instruments. In the trombone family large and small bore trombones are both called trombones, while the cylindrical [[trumpet]] and the conical [[flugelhorn]] are given different names.  As with the trumpet and flugelhorn, the two instruments are easily doubled by one player, with some modification of breath and [[embouchure]], since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering.<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite web| last = Werden| first = David| title = Euphonium, Baritone, or ???| url = http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| accessdate = 2008-01-29| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212225121/http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| archivedate = 12 February 2008| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical euphonium offers a mellower sound.\n\nThe ''American baritone'', featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved, forward-pointing bell, was dominant in American school bands throughout most of the 20th century, its weight, shape, and configuration conforming to the [[Marching instrument|needs of the marching band]].  While this instrument is a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, somewhere between the classic baritone horn and euphonium, it was almost universally labeled a \"baritone\" by both band directors and composers, thus contributing to the confusion of terminology in the United States.\n\nSeveral late 19th century music catalogs (such as Pepper and Lyon & Healy) sold a euphonium-like instrument called the \"B{{music|flat}} bass\" (to distinguish it from the E{{music|flat}} and BB{{music|flat}} bass).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5-_7UCbLfDqTE1BNnNYTGNiQmM/edit|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1880}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L&H-1894.pdf|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1894|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407064700/http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L%26H-1894.pdf|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In these catalog drawings, the B{{music|flat}} Bass had thicker tubing than the baritone; both had three valves. Along the same lines, [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] introduced the \"Bass-baritone\", and distinguished it from the baritone. The thicker tubing of the three-valve B{{music|flat}} bass allowed for production of strong false-tones, providing chromatic access to the pedal register.\n\n[[Ferdinand Sommer]]'s original name for the instrument was the ''euphonion''.<ref name=\"Grove\">{{GroveOnline|title=Euphonium|author=Clifford Bevan|access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> It is sometimes called the tenor tuba in B{{music|flat}}, although this can also refer to other [[Tuba#Types and construction|varieties of tuba]]. Names in other languages, as included in scores, can be ambiguous as well. They include French ''basse'', ''saxhorn basse'', and ''tuba basse''; German ''Baryton'', ''Tenorbass'', and ''Tenorbasshorn''; Italian ''baritono'', ''bombardino'', ''eufonio'', and ''flicorno basso''.<ref name=\"Grove\"/> The most common German name, ''Baryton'', may have influenced Americans to adopt the name \"baritone\" for the instrument, due to the influx of German musicians to the United States in the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Grove\" />\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:Serpent groves.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], the oldest ancestor of all low brass instruments]]\n\nAs a baritone-voiced brass instrument, the euphonium traces its ancestry to the [[ophicleide]] and ultimately back to the [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]].  The search for a satisfactory foundational wind instrument that could support massed sound above its pitch took many years.  While the serpent was used for over two centuries dating back to the late [[Renaissance]], it was notoriously difficult to control its pitch and tone quality due to its disproportionately small open finger holes.  The ophicleide, which was used in bands and orchestras for a few decades in the early to mid-19th century, used a system of keys and was an improvement over the serpent but was still unreliable, especially in the high register.\n\nWith the invention of the piston valve system {{circa}} 1818, the construction of brass instruments with an even sound and facility of playing in all registers became possible.  The euphonium is said to have been invented, as a \"wide-bore, valved bugle of baritone range\", by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar in 1843, though [[Carl Moritz]] in 1838 and [[Adolphe Sax]] in 1843 have also been credited.  While Sax's family of [[saxhorn]]s were invented at about the same time and the bass saxhorn is very similar to a euphonium, there are also differences{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}.\n\nThe \"British-style\" compensating euphonium was developed by [[David Blaikley]] in 1874, and has been in use in Britain with the basic construction little changed since then.\n\nModern day euphonium makers have been working to further enhance the construction of the euphonium. Companies such as [https://www.adams-music.com/shop/product/detail/?i=Adams+Euphonium&id=1EP0A&t=wf&lid=1033 Adams] and [http://www.besson.com/en/instruments/euphoniums/ Besson] have been leading the way in perfecting the instrument. Adams euphoniums have developed an adjustable lead pipe receiver which allows players to change the timbre of the instrument to whatever they player finds preferable. Besson has also been credited with the adjustable main tuning slide trigger, which allows players more flexibility with intonation.\n\n== Construction and general characteristics ==\n\nThe euphonium, like the tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B{{music|flat}}. For a valved brass instrument like the euphonium, this means that when no [[valve]]s are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B{{music|flat}} [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. It is generally orchestrated as a [[Transposing instrument|non-transposing instrument]] like the [[trombone]], written at [[concert pitch]] in the [[bass clef]] with higher passages in the [[tenor clef]]. [[Treble clef]] euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much [[concert band]] music:<ref group=\"note\">The major-ninth is transposition for the sake of trumpet players doubling on euphonium.</ref> in the [[Brass band (British style)|British-style brass band]] tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B{{music|flat}} transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.\n\nProfessional models have three top-action valves, played with the first three fingers of the right hand, plus a \"compensating\" fourth valve, generally found midway down the right side of the instrument, played with the left index finger; such an instrument is shown at the top of this page.  Beginner models often have only the three top-action valves, while some intermediate \"student\" models may have a fourth top-action valve, played with the fourth finger of the right hand.  Compensating systems are expensive to build, and there is in general a substantial difference in price between compensating and non-compensating models.  For a thorough discussion of the valves and the compensation system, see the article on [[brass instruments]].\n\n[[File:EuphoniumAndTuba wb.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A euphonium (left) and tuba (right), the two lowest conical-bore instruments]]\n\nThe euphonium has an extensive range, comfortably from C<sub>2</sub> to about B{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> for intermediate players {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} (using [[scientific pitch notation]]).  In professional hands this may extend from B<sub>0</sub> to as high as B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>.  The lowest notes obtainable depend on the valve set-up of the instrument. All instruments are chromatic down to E<sub>2</sub>, but four-valved instruments extend that down to at least C<sub>2</sub>.  Non-compensating four-valved instruments suffer from intonation problems from E{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> down to C<sub>2</sub> and cannot produce the low B<sub>1</sub>; compensating instruments do not have such intonation problems and can play the low B<sub>1</sub>.<ref group=\"note\">Thus, only on four-valved, compensating instruments is a full chromatic scale from the pedal range up possible.</ref> From B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> down lies the \"pedal range\", i.e., the fundamentals of the instrument's harmonic series.  They are easily produced on the euphonium as compared to other brass instruments, and the extent of the range depends on the make of the instrument in exactly the same way as just described.  Thus, on a compensating four-valved instrument, the lowest note possible is B<sub>0</sub>, sometimes called double pedal B, which is six ledger lines below the bass clef.\n\nAs with the other conical-bore instruments, the [[cornet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[tuba]], the euphonium's tubing (excepting the tubing in the valve section, which is necessarily cylindrical) gradually increases in diameter throughout its length, resulting in a softer, gentler tone compared to cylindrical-bore instruments such as the [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[sudrophone]], and [[baritone horn]].  While a truly characteristic euphonium sound is rather hard to define precisely, most players would agree that an ideal sound is dark, rich, warm, and velvety, with virtually no hardness to it. This also has to do with the different models preferred by British and American players.<ref name=\"Harvard Dictionary of Music\">{{Cite journal|last =Apel|first=Willi|year = 1969| title = Harvard Dictionary of Music|pages = 105\u2013110|place=Cambridge:|publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1972.|postscript =<!-- None -->\n}}</ref>\n\nThough the euphonium's fingerings are no different from those of the trumpet or tuba, beginning euphoniumists will likely experience significant problems with intonation, response, and range compared to other beginning brass players{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.  In addition, it is very difficult for students, even of high-school age, to develop the rich sound characteristic of the euphonium, due partly to the instrument models used in schools and partly to the lack of awareness of good euphonium sound models.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Types ==\n\n===Compensating===\n\nThe compensating euphonium is common among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming off of the back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E<sub>2</sub> down to B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.\n\n=== Double-bell ===\n{{Main article|Double bell euphonium}}\n\nA creation unique to the United States was the [[Double bell euphonium|double-bell euphonium]], featuring a second smaller bell in addition to the main one; the player could switch bells for certain passages or even for individual notes by use of an additional valve, operated with the left hand.  Ostensibly, the smaller bell was intended to emulate the sound of a trombone (it was cylindrical-bore) and was possibly intended for performance situations in which trombones were not available.  The extent to which the difference in sound and timbre was apparent to the listener, however, is up for debate.  ''Harry Whittier'' of the Patrick S. Gilmore band introduced the instrument in 1888, and it was used widely in both school and service bands for several decades.  ''Harold Brasch'' (see \"List of important players\" below) brought the British-style compensating euphonium to the United States c. 1939, but the double-belled euphonium may have remained in common use even into the 1950s and 1960s.  In any case, they have become rare (they were last in Conn's advertisements in the 1940s, and King's catalog in the 1960s),<ref>1963 H.N.

Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands in schools, and in [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|Drum and Bugle Corps]], and some corps (such as the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps|Blue Devils]] and [[Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps|Phantom Regiment]]) march all-euphonium sections rather than only marching Baritone or a mix of both. Depending on the manufacturer, the weight of these instruments can be straining to the average marcher and require great strength to hold during practices and performances, leading to nerve problems in the right pinky, a callus on the left hand, and possibly back and arm problems.\n\nAnother form of the marching euphonium is the convertible euphonium. Recently widely produced, the horn resembles a convertible tuba, being able to change from a concert upright to a marching forward bell on either the left or right shoulder. These are mainly produced by Jupiter or Yamaha, but other less expensive versions can be found.\n\n=== Five valves ===\nThe five-valve euphonium (noncompensating) is an extremely rare variation of the euphonium manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Britain's [[Besson (company)|Besson]] musical instrument company and Highams of Manchester Musical Instrument Company. Besson and Highams's ''Clearbore'' five-valve vintage euphoniums are among the rarest and most valuable in existence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Besson five-valve euphonium featured the standard three [[piston valve]]s horizontally on top, but had an additional two piston valves off to the side. The standard euphonium has eight possible [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] and non-fingering positions by which sound is produced. The Besson and the Highams \"clearbore\" model rare fourth and fifth extra \"side\" valves change the possible fingering and non-fingering positions from eight to thirty-two.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe term 'five-valve euphonium' does not refer to variations of the [[double bell euphonium]] made by various brass instrument companies during the same time period.{{Weasel inline|date=April 2010}} Some of the double-bell euphoniums had five valves, with the fifth valve either on top with the other four, or by itself off to the side, but the double-bell fifth valve was used for switching the sound to the second smaller [[trombone]]-sized [[Wind instrument#Parts|bell]], and not for changing the fingering [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the instrument. Also, {{Interlanguage link multi|V\u00e1clav Franti\u0161ek \u010cerven\u00fd|cs|3=V\u00e1clav Franti\u0161ek \u010cerven\u00fd|lt=Cerveny}} Musical Instruments manufactures several euphoniums with five vertical [[rotary valve]]s today, but this is an unrelated recent development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== The euphonium in ensembles and professional job opportunities ==\n{{Main article|Euphonium repertoire}}\n\nThe euphonium has historically been exclusively a ''band'' instrument (rather than an ''orchestra'' or ''jazz'' instrument), whether of the ''wind'' or ''brass'' variety, where it is frequently featured as a solo instrument.  Because of this, the euphonium has been called the \"king of band instruments\", or the \"[[cello]] of the band\", because of its similarity in timbre and ensemble role to the stringed instrument. Euphoniums typically have extremely important parts in many [[march (music)|marches]] (such as those by [[John Philip Sousa]]), and in brass band music of the [[Music of the United Kingdom|British tradition]].\n\nOther ensembles including euphonium are the tuba-euphonium quartet or larger tuba-euphonium ensemble; the [[brass quintet]], where it can supply the tenor voice, though the trombone is much more common in this role; and other mixed brass ensemble. Such ensembles are almost non-existent: they are more likely to be semi-professional or amateur in nature.  Most of the [[United States Armed Forces]] [[service bands]] include a tuba-euphonium quartet made up of players from the band that occasionally performs in its own right.\n\nThe euphonium is not traditionally an orchestral instrument and has not been common in symphony orchestras. However, there are a few works from the late Romantic period, in which composers wrote a part for ''tenor tuba'', all of which are played on the euphonium: most notably [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[Planets Suite]]'' and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' by [[Richard Strauss]]. In addition, the euphonium is sometimes used in older orchestral works as a replacement for its predecessors, such as the [[ophicleide]], or, less correctly, the bass trumpet or the [[Wagner tuba]], both of which are significantly different instruments, and still in use today.\n\nFinally, while the euphonium was not historically part of the standard jazz [[big band]] or combo, the instrument's technical facility and large range make it well-suited to a jazz solo role, and a jazz euphonium niche has been carved out over the last 40 or so years, largely starting with the pioneer [[Rich Matteson]] (see \"List of important players\" below).  The euphonium can also double on a trombone part in a jazz combo. Jazz euphoniums are most likely to be found in tuba-euphonium groups, though modern [[funk]] or [[rock music|rock]] bands occasionally feature a brass player doubling on euphonium, and this trend is growing.\n\nDue to this dearth of performance opportunities, aspiring euphonium players in the United States are in a rather inconvenient position when seeking future employment.  Often, college players must either obtain a graduate degree and go on to teach at the college level, or audition for one of the major or regional military service bands. Because these bands are relatively few in number and the number of euphonium positions in the bands is small (2\u20134 in most service bands), job openings do not occur very often and when they do are highly competitive; before the current slate of openings in four separate bands, the last opening for a euphonium player in an American service band was in May 2004. A career strictly as a solo performer, unaffiliated with any university or performing ensemble, is a very rare sight, but some performers, such as Riki McDonnell, have managed to do it.\n\nIn Britain, Australia and New Zealand the strongest euphonium players are most likely to find a position in a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]], but even though they often play at world-class levels, the members of the top brass bands are in most cases unpaid amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} There are hundreds, if not thousands, of brass bands in Britain (and the Commonwealth) ranging in standard from world class to local bands. Even [[The Salvation Army]] has strong ties to the brass band world, as this was a common and practical musical genre in the 1800s.  Almost all brass bands in Britain perform regularly, particularly during the summer months. A large number of bands also enter contests against other brass bands of a similar standard. Each band requires two euphoniums (principal and second) and consequently there are considerable opportunities for euphonium players.\n\nDue to limited vocational opportunities, there are a considerable number of relatively serious, quasi-professional avocational euphonium players participating in many higher-caliber unpaid ensembles. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n== College use in the United States ==\nUnlike a generation or two ago, many colleges with music programs now offer students the opportunity to major in euphonium.  However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2\u20134 is common{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium.  Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.\n\n== Notable euphonists ==\n{{Main article|List of euphonium players}}\n\nThe euphonium world is and has become more crowded than is commonly thought, and there have been many noteworthy players throughout the instrument's history.  Traditionally, three main national schools of euphonium playing have been discernible: American, British, and Japanese.  Now, euphoniumists are able to learn this specific art in many other countries around the world today.\n\nGerman Ferdinand Sommer, if one discounts the claims of Moritz and Sax each of whose horns also approached a euphonium in nature, in addition to being credited with inventing the euphonium as the Sommerhorn in 1843, as a soloist on the horn, qualifies as the first euphonium player to significantly advance and alter the understanding of the instrument.<ref>Baritone History, North Dakota State University, at {{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221235020/http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 10/15/2011</ref><ref>Bone, Lloyd E., The Euphonium Sourcebook, University of Indiana Press, 2007 edition, P.7</ref> Below are a select few of the players most famous and influential in their respective countries, and whose contributions to the euphonium world are undeniable, in terms of recordings, commissions, pedagogy, and increased recognition of the instrument.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n* [[Alfred James Phasey]] (1834\u20131888), English ophicleide, baritone and euphonium artist credited with modifying the bore of the baritone [[saxhorn]], precursor of the [[baritone horn]], to enlarge it and make it more resonant thereby creating the first true euphonium which he went on to popularize as a performer and author of an early instructional method for tenor brass.<ref>Bouldersdome, H.

Since its invention in 1843, the euphonium has always had an important role in ensembles, but solo literature was slow to appear, consisting of only a handful of lighter solos until the 1960s.  Since then, however, the breadth and depth of the solo euphonium repertoire has increased dramatically.\n\nIn the current age, there has been a huge number of new commissions and repertoire development and promotion through Steven Mead's World of the Euphonium Series and the Beyond the Horizon series from Euphonium.com.   There has also been a vast number of new commissions by more and more players and a proliferation of large scale Consortium Commissions that are occurring including current ones in 2008 and 2009 organized by Brian Meixner (Libby Larson), Adam Frey (The Euphonium Foundation Consortium), and Jason Ham (David Gillingham).\n\n[[File:Amilcareponchielli.jpg|thumb|right|187px|[[Amilcare Ponchielli]], composer of the first original euphonium solo]]\n\nUpon its invention, it was clear that the euphonium had, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, a wide range and had a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range.  It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, gaining it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voices solo instrument in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] settings, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].  It is no surprise, then, that when British composers \u2013 some of the same ones who were writing for brass bands \u2013 began to write serious, original music for the concert band in the early 20th century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role.\n\nWhen American composers also began writing for the concert band as its own artistic medium in the 1930s and 1940s, they continued the British brass and concert band tradition of using the euphonium as the principal tenor-voiced solo.\nThis is not to say that composers, then and now, valued the euphonium only for its lyrical capabilities.  Indeed, examination of a large body of concert band literature reveals that the euphonium functions as a \"jack of all trades.\"\n\nThough the euphonium was, as previously noted, embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have, by and large, not taken advantage of this capability.  There are, nevertheless, several orchestral works, a few of which are standard repertoire, in which composers have called for instruments, such as the Wagner tuba, for which euphonium is commonly substituted in the present.\n\nIn contrast to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphoniumists were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument's multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the euphonium.\n\nThe earliest surviving solo composition written specifically for euphonium or one of its saxhorn cousins is the ''Concerto per Flicorno Basso'' (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli.  For almost a century after this, the euphonium solo repertoire consisted of only a dozen or so virtuosic pieces, mostly light in character.  However, in the 1960s and 1970s, American composers began to write the first of the \"new school\" of serious, artistic solo works specifically for euphonium.  Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium.  In a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces.  More and more composers have become aware of the tremendous soloistic capabilities of the euphonium, and have constantly \"pushed the envelope\" with new literature in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques.\n\nFinally, the euphonium has, thanks to a handful of enterprising individuals, begun to make inroads in jazz, pop and other non-concert performance settings.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[William Bell (tuba player)]]\n* [[Baritone and Euphonium Manufacturers]]\n\n==References==\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20051030200338/http://www.lowbrassnmore.com/euponiumhistory.htmRetrieved on 28 January 2008 \n* https://web.archive.org/web/20051217074115/http://nikknakks.net/Euphonium/Retrieved on 28 January 2008 \n* http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2198574/HISTORY-OF-THE-BARITONE-AND-THE-EUPHONIUM\n*\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[doi:10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.L2274882|Weston, Stephen. 2015 \"Bass-Euphonium.\" ''Grove Music Online.'' 13 Sep. 2018.]] (by subscription)\n*[http://www.euphonium.com Euphonium.com] Focused on the IEI, new repertoire, a forum for the euphonium, and the activities of Adam Frey.\n* [http://www.euphonium.net/ Euphonium.net] Steven Mead's personal website.\n* [http://www.iteaonline.org/ The International Tuba-Euphonium Association], a professional organization for tubists and euphonists.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050921203827/http://www.tubanews.com/ Tuba News], a free monthly online publication for tuba and euphonium players.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071209063310/http://www.tubaeuphoniumpress.com/ Tuba-Euphonium Press], publishing house for new euphonium and tuba music.\n* [http://www.brass-forum.co.uk Brass-Forum.co.uk], a UK-based brass discussion forum.\n* [http://www.dwerden.com/talk/forum/ Tuba-Euphonium Forum], a discussion forum for euphonium and tuba.\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/brassacoustics.html Acoustics of Brass Instruments] from [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music Music Acoustics] at the University of New South Wales.\n* [http://www.olemiss.edu/lowbrass/lowbrassmethods/charts/euphoniumbcfingering.pdf Euphonium fingering chart] \n* [http://www.dwerden.com/emg/ Euphonium Music Guide] A list of original euphonium literature.\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Euphonium}}\n{{Musical instruments |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Bass (sound)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brass instruments]]\n[[Category:B-flat instruments]]\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Horns]]\n[[Category:German musical instruments]]\n[[Category:English musical instruments]]", "sha1": "328290kf4q32e8sdxupane1wfvhzo52"}}, {"title": "Entire function", "ns": "0", "id": "10372", "revision": {"id": "856613267", "parentid": "856613193", "timestamp": "2018-08-26T13:16:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wtmitchell", "id": "136745"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/WWVHN|WWVHN]] ([[User talk:WWVHN|talk]]): unexplained content removal ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "In [[complex analysis]], an '''entire function''', also called an '''integral function,''' is a complex-valued [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] at all finite points over the whole [[complex plane]].

The [[radius of convergence]] is infinite, which implies that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} |a_n|^{\\frac{1}{n}}=0</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\ln|a_n|}n=-\\infty.</math>\n\nAny power series satisfying this criterion will represent an entire function.\n\nIf (and only if) the coefficients of the power series are all real then the function evidently takes real values for real arguments, and the value of the function at the [[complex conjugate]] of ''z'' will be the complex conjugate of the value at ''z''. Such functions are sometimes called self-conjugate (the conjugate function, <math>F^*(z)</math>, being given by <math>\\bar F(\\bar z)).</math><ref>See for example {{cite web|title=A proof of the Riemann Hypothesis|url=http://www.math.purdue.edu/~branges/proof-riemann.pdf| author=Louis de Branges|authorlink=Louis de Branges de Bourcia|date=Sep 17, 2013| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130920101241/http://www.math.purdue.edu/~branges/proof-riemann.pdf |archivedate=Sep 20, 2013| page=17 et al.}}</ref>\n\nIf the real part of an entire function is known in a neighborhood of a point then both the real and imaginary parts are known for the whole complex plane, [[up to]] an imaginary constant. For instance, if the real part is known in a neighborhood of zero, then we can find the coefficients for ''n'' > 0 from the following derivatives with respect to a real variable ''r'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Re}a_n &=\\frac 1{n!}\\frac{d^n}{dr^n}\\operatorname{Re}f(r) && \\text{at }r=0 \\\\\n\\operatorname{Im}a_n &=\\frac 1{n!}\\frac{d^n}{dr^n}\\operatorname{Re}f\\left (re^{-\\frac{i\\pi}{2n}} \\right ) && \\text{at }r=0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(Likewise, if the imaginary part is known in a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] then the function is determined up to a real constant.) In fact, if the real part is known just on an arc of a circle, then the function is determined up to an imaginary constant. (For instance, if it the real part is known on part of the unit circle, then it is known on the whole unit circle by [[analytic extension]], and then the coefficients of the infinite series are determined from the coefficients of the [[Fourier series]] for the real part on the unit circle.) Note however that an entire function is '''''not''''' determined by its real part on all curves. In particular, if the real part is given on any curve in the complex plane where the real part of some other entire function is zero, then any multiple of that function can be added to the function we are trying to determine. For example, if the curve where the real part is known is the real line, then we can add ''i'' times any self-conjugate function. If the curve forms a loop, then it is determined by the real part of the function on the loop since the only functions whose real part is zero on the curve are those that are everywhere equal to some imaginary number.\n\nThe [[Weierstrass factorization theorem]] asserts that any entire function can be represented by a product involving its [[zero of a function|zeroes]] (or \"roots\").\n\nThe entire functions on the complex plane form an [[integral domain]] (in fact a [[Pr\u00fcfer domain]]). They also form a [[commutative]] [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] over the complex numbers.\n\n[[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]] states that any [[bounded function|bounded]] entire function must be constant.  Liouville's theorem may be used to elegantly prove the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nAs a consequence of Liouville's theorem, any function that is entire on the whole [[Riemann sphere]] (complex plane ''and'' the point at infinity) is constant. Thus any non-constant entire function must have a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the complex [[point at infinity]], either a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] for a polynomial or an [[essential singularity]] for a [[transcendental function|transcendental]] entire function.  Specifically, by the [[Casorati\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], for any transcendental entire function ''f'' and any complex ''w'' there is a [[sequence]] <math>(z_m)_{m\\in\\N}</math> such that \n\n:<math>\\lim_{m\\to\\infty} |z_m| = \\infty, \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} f(z_m) = w.</math>\n\n[[Picard theorem|Picard's little theorem]] is a much stronger result: any non-constant entire function takes on every complex number as value, possibly with a single exception. When an exception exists, it is called a [[lacunary value]] of the function. The possibility of a lacunary value is illustrated by the [[exponential function]], which never takes on the value 0. One can take a suitable branch of the logarithm of an entire function that never hits 0, so that this will also be an entire function (according to the [[Weierstrass factorization theorem]]). The logarithm hits every complex number except possibly one number, which implies that the first function will hit any value other than 0 an infinite number of times. Similarly, a non-constant, entire function that does not hit a particular value will hit every other value an infinite number of times.\n\nLiouville's theorem is a special case of the following statement:\n\n:'''Theorem:''' Assume ''M, R'' are positive constants and ''n'' is a non-negative integer. An entire function ''f'' satisfying the inequality <math>|f(z)| \\le M |z|^n</math> for all ''z'' with <math>|z| \\ge R,</math> is necessarily a polynomial, of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] at most ''n''.<ref>The converse is also true as for any polynomial <math>p(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^na_k z^k</math> of degree ''n'' the inequality <math>|p(z)| \\le \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n|a_k|\\right) |z|^n</math> holds for any {{nowrap begin}}|''z''| \u2265 1{{nowrap end}}.</ref> Similarly, an entire function ''f'' satisfying the inequality <math>M |z|^n \\le |f(z)|</math> for all ''z'' with <math>|z| \\ge R,</math> is necessarily a polynomial, of degree at least ''n''.\n\n==Growth==\n\nEntire functions may grow as fast as any increasing function: for any increasing function ''g'': [0,\u221e) \u2192 [0,\u221e) there exists an entire function ''f'' such that ''f''(''x'') > ''g''(|''x''|) for all real ''x''. Such a function ''f'' may be easily found of the form:\n\n:<math>f(z)=c+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{z}{k}\\right)^{n_k}</math>\n\nfor a constant ''c'' and a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers ''n<sub>k</sub>''. Any such sequence defines an entire function ''f''(''z''), and if the powers are chosen appropriately we may satisfy the inequality ''f''(''x'') > ''g''(|''x''|) for all real ''x''. (For instance, it certainly holds if one chooses ''c'' := ''g''(2) and, for any integer <math>k \\ge 1, n_k: = 2 \\left\\lceil k \\ln g(k+2) \\right \\rceil</math> although this gives powers that may be about twice as high as needed.)\n\n==<span id=\"order of an entire function\"></span> Order and type ==\nThe '''order''' (at infinity) of an entire function <math>f(z)</math> is defined using the [[limit superior]] as:\n\n:<math>\\rho=\\limsup_{r\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln \\left (\\ln\\| f \\|_{\\infty, B_r} \\right ) }{\\ln r},</math>\n\nwhere ''B<sub>r</sub>'' is the disk of radius ''r'' and <math>\\|f \\|_{\\infty, B_r}</math> denotes the [[supremum norm]] of <math>f(z)</math> on ''B<sub>r</sub>''. The order is a non-negative real number or infinity (except when <math>f(z) = 0</math> for all ''z''). In other words, the order of <math>f(z)</math> is the [[infimum]] of all ''m'' such that: \n\n:<math>f(z) = O \\left (\\exp \\left (|z|^m \\right ) \\right ), \\quad \\text{as } z \\to \\infty.</math>\n\nThe example of <math>f(z) = \\exp(2z^2)</math> shows that this does not mean ''f''(''z'') = O(exp(|''z''|<sup>''m''</sup>)) if <math>f(z)</math> is of order ''m''.\n\nIf <math>0<\\rho < \\infty,</math> one can also define the '''''type''''':\n\n:<math>\\sigma=\\limsup_{r\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln  \\| f\\|_{\\infty,B_r}} {r^\\rho}.</math>\n\nIf the order is 1 and the type is ''\u03c3'', the function is said to be \"of [[exponential type]] ''\u03c3''\". If it is of order less than 1 it is said to be of exponential type 0.\n\nIf\n\n:<math> f(z)=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^n,</math>\n\nthen the order and type can be found by the formulas\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\rho &=\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n\\ln n}{-\\ln|a_n|} \\\\[6pt]\n(e\\rho\\sigma)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}} &= \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty} n^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}} |a_n|^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nLet <math>f^{(n)}</math> denote the ''n''<sup>th</sup> derivative of ''f'', then we may restate these formulas in terms of the derivatives at any arbitrary point ''z''<sub>0</sub>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\rho &=\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n\\ln n}{n\\ln n-\\ln|f^{(n)}(z_0)|}=\\left(1-\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\ln|f^{(n)}(z_0)|}{n\\ln n}\\right)^{-1} \\\\[6pt]\n(\\rho\\sigma)^{\\frac{1}{\\rho}} &=e^{1-\\frac{1}{\\rho}} \\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{|f^{(n)}(z_0)|^{\\frac{1}{n}}}{n^{1-\\frac{1}{\\rho}}}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe type may be infinite, as in the case of the [[reciprocal gamma function]], or zero (see example below under [[#Order 1]]).\n\n===Examples===\nHere are some examples of functions of various orders:\n\n====Order \u03c1====\nFor arbitrary positive numbers ''\u03c1'' and ''\u03c3'' one can construct an example of an entire function of order ''\u03c1'' and type ''\u03c3'' using:\n\n:<math>f(z)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{e\\rho\\sigma}{n} \\right )^{\\frac{n}{\\rho}} z^n</math>\n\n====Order 0====\n* Non-zero polynomials\n*<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 2^{-n^2} z^n</math>\n\n====Order 1/4====\n:<math>f(\\sqrt[4]z)</math> \nwhere \n:<math>f(u)=\\cos(u)+\\cosh(u)</math>\n\n====Order 1/3====\n:<math>f(\\sqrt[3]z)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>f(u)=e^u+e^{\\omega u}+e^{\\omega^2 u}=e^u+2e^{-\\frac{u}{2}}\\cos \\left (\\frac{\\sqrt 3u}{2} \\right ), \\quad \\text{with } \\omega \\text{ a complex cube root of 1}.</math>\n\n====Order 1/2====\n:<math>\\cos \\left (a\\sqrt z \\right )</math> with ''a'' \u2260 0 (for which the type is given by ''\u03c3'' = |''a''|)\n\n====Order 1====\n*exp(''az'') with ''a'' \u2260 0 (''\u03c3'' = |''a''|)\n*sin(''z'')\n*cosh(''z'')\n*the [[Bessel function]] ''J''<sub>0</sub>(''z''){{citation needed|reason=Quick calculation seems to point to a order of 1/2| date =August 2016}}\n*the [[reciprocal gamma function]] 1/\u0393(''z'') (''\u03c3'' is infinite)\n*<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{(n\\ln n)^n}. \\quad (\\sigma=0)</math>\n\n====Order 3/2====\n* [[Airy function]] Ai(''z'')\n\n====Order 2====\n*exp(\u2212''az''<sup>2</sup>) with ''a'' \u2260 0 (''\u03c3'' = |''a''|)\n\n====Order infinity====\n*exp(exp(''z''))\n\n==<span id=\"genus of an entire function\"></span> Genus of an entire function  ==\nEntire functions of finite order have [[Jacques Hadamard|Hadamard]]'s canonical representation:\n\n:<math>f(z)=z^me^{P(z)}\\prod_{n=1}^\\infty\\left(1-\\frac{z}{z_n}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{z}{z_n}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{p}\\left(\\frac{z}{z_n}\\right)^p\\right),</math>\n\nwhere <math>z_k</math> are those [[zero of a function|roots]] of <math>f</math> that are not zero (<math>z_k \\neq 0</math>), <math>P</math> a polynomial (whose degree we shall call <math>q</math>), and <math>p</math> is the smallest non-negative integer such that the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{|z_n|^{p+1}}</math>\n\nconverges. The non-negative integer <math>g=\\max\\{p,q\\}</math> is called the genus of the entire function <math>f</math>.\n\nIf the order \u03c1 is not an integer, then <math>g = \\lbrack \\rho \\rbrack</math> is the integer part of <math>\\rho</math>. If the order is a positive integer, then there are two possibilities: <math>g = \\rho-1</math> or <math>g = \\rho </math>.\n\nFor example, <math>\\sin, \\cos</math> and <math>\\exp</math> are entire functions of genus ''1''.\n\n==Other examples==\nAccording to [[J. E. Littlewood]], the [[Weierstrass sigma function]] is a 'typical' entire function. This statement can be made precise in the theory of random entire functions: the asymptotic behavior of almost all entire functions is similar to that of the sigma function. Other examples include the [[Fresnel integral]]s, the [[Jacobi theta function]], and the [[reciprocal Gamma function]].  The exponential function and the error function are special cases of the [[Mittag-Leffler function]]. According to the fundamental [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem|theorem of Paley and Wiener]], [[Fourier transform]]s of functions with bounded support are entire functions or order ''1'' and finite type.\n\nOther examples are solutions of linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients. If the coefficient at the highest derivative is constant, then all solutions of such equations are entire functions. For example, the exponential function, sine, cosine, [[Airy function]]s and [[Parabolic cylinder function]]s arise in this way. The class of entire functions is closed with respect to compositions. This makes it possible to study [[holomorphic dynamics|dynamics of entire functions]].\n\nAn entire function of the square root of a complex number is entire if the original function is [[even function|even]], for example <math>\\cos(\\sqrt{z})</math>.\n\nIf a sequence of polynomials all of whose roots are real converges in a neighborhood of the origin to a limit which is not identically equal to zero, then this limit is an entire function. Such entire functions form the [[Laguerre\u2013P\u00f3lya class]], which can also be characterized in terms of the Hadamard product, namely, ''f'' belongs to this class if and only if in the Hadamard representation all ''z<sub>n</sub>'' are real, ''p'' \u2264 1, and ''P''(''z'') = ''a'' + ''bz'' + ''cz''<sup>2</sup>, where ''b'' and ''c'' are real, and ''c'' \u2264 0. For example, the sequence of polynomials \n\n:<math>\\left (1-\\frac{(z-d)^2}{n} \\right )^n</math> \n\nconverges, as ''n'' increases, to exp(\u2212(''z''\u2212''d'')<sup>2</sup>). The polynomials \n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( \\left (1+\\frac{iz}{n} \\right )^n+ \\left (1-\\frac{iz}{n} \\right )^n \\right )</math> \n\nhave all real roots, and converge to cos(''z''). The polynomials \n\n:<math> \\prod_{m=1}^n \\left(1-\\frac{z^2}{\\left ( \\left (m-\\frac{1}{2} \\right )\\pi \\right )^2}\\right)</math> \n\nalso converge to cos(''z''), showing the buildup of the Hadamard product for cosine.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jensen's formula]]\n* [[Carlson's theorem]]\n* [[Exponential type]]\n* [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]]\n* [[Wiman-Valiron theory]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | author = Ralph P.

Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\" etc.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holman|first1=William|title=A Handbook to Literature|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New Jersey|page=193|edition=9}}</ref>\n\nEssays are commonly used as [[literary criticism]], political [[manifestos]], learned [[arguments]], observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. Almost all  modern essays  are written in [[prose]], but works in [[Poetry|verse]] have been dubbed essays (e.g., [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[An Essay on Criticism]]'' and ''[[An Essay on Man]]''). While brevity usually defines an essay, voluminous works like [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and [[Thomas Malthus]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' are counterexamples.\n\nIn some countries (e.g., the United States and Canada), essays have become a major part of formal [[education]]. Secondary students are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills; [[admissions essay|admission essays]] are often used by [[university|universities]] in selecting applicants, and in the humanities and social sciences essays are often used as a way of assessing the performance of students during final exams.\n\nThe concept of an \"essay\" has been extended to other media beyond writing. A [[Essay#Film|film essay]] is a movie that often incorporates documentary filmmaking styles and focuses more on the evolution of a theme or idea. A [[photo essay|photographic essay]] covers a topic with a linked series of [[photographs]] that may have accompanying text or [[Photo caption|captions]].\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Locke Essay 1690.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Locke]]'s 1690 ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.]]\nAn essay has been defined in a variety of ways. One definition is a \"prose composition with a focused subject of discussion\" or a \"long, systematic discourse\".<ref>[http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm Gale \u2013 Free Resources \u2013 Glossary \u2013 DE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425123427/http://www.gale.cengage.com/free_resources/glossary/glossary_de.htm |date=2010-04-25 }}.

[[Aldous Huxley]], a leading essayist, gives guidance on the subject.<ref>Aldous Huxley, ''Collected Essays'', \"Preface\".</ref> He notes that \"the essay is a literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything\", and adds that \"by tradition, almost by definition, the essay is a short piece\". Furthermore, Huxley argues that \"essays belong to a literary species whose extreme variability can be studied most effectively within a three-poled frame of reference\". \nThese three poles (or worlds in which the essay may exist) are:\n* The personal and the autobiographical: The essayists that feel most comfortable in this pole \"write fragments of reflective autobiography and look at the world through the keyhole of anecdote and description\".\n* The objective, the factual, and the concrete particular: The essayists that write from this pole \"do not speak directly of themselves, but turn their attention outward to some literary or scientific or political theme. Their art consists of setting forth, passing judgment upon, and drawing general conclusions from the relevant data\".\n* The abstract-universal: In this pole \"we find those essayists who do their work in the world of high abstractions\", who are never personal and who seldom mention the particular facts of experience.\nHuxley adds that the most satisfying essays \"...make the best not of one, not of two, but of all the three worlds in which it is possible for the essay to exist.\"\n\nThe word ''essay'' derives from the French infinitive ''essayer'', \"to try\" or \"to attempt\".  In English ''essay'' first meant \"a trial\" or \"an attempt\", and this is still an alternative meaning.  The Frenchman [[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533\u20131592) was the first author to describe his work as essays; he used the term to characterize these as \"attempts\" to put his thoughts into writing, and his essays grew out of his [[commonplacing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |title=Book Use Book Theory: 1500\u20131700: Commonplace Thinking |publisher=Lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801200451/http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/webexhibits/bookusebooktheory/commonplacethinking.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}</ref>  Inspired in particular by the works of [[Plutarch]], a translation of whose ''\u0152uvres Morales'' (''Moral works'') into French had just been published by [[Jacques Amyot]], Montaigne began to compose his essays in 1572; the first edition, entitled ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', was published in two volumes in 1580.  For the rest of his life, he continued revising previously published essays and composing new ones. [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|essays]], published in book form in 1597, 1612, and 1625, were the first works in English that described themselves as ''essays''.  [[Ben Jonson]] first used the word ''essayist'' in English in 1609, according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.\n\n==History==\n{{globalize|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Europe===\nEnglish essayists included [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]] (1577\u20131641) and [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605\u20131682). In France, [[Michel de Montaigne]]'s three volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' in the mid 1500s contain over 100 examples widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay. In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] wrote about courtly manners in his essay ''Il Cortigiano''. In the 17th century, the [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Graci\u00e1n]] wrote about the theme of wisdom.<ref name=\"britannica1\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay essay (literature) \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204053246/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/192869/essay |date=2009-12-04 }}. Britannica.com. Retrieved March 22, 2011.</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], essays were a favored tool of polemicists who aimed at convincing readers of their position; they also featured heavily in the rise of [[periodical literature]], as seen in the works of [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] wrote essays for the general public. The early 19th century, in particular, saw a proliferation of great essayists in English \u2013 [[William Hazlitt]], [[Charles Lamb]], [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Thomas de Quincey]] all penned numerous essays on diverse subjects. In the 20th century, a number of essayists tried to explain the new movements in art and culture by using essays (e.g., [[T.S. Eliot]]). Whereas some essayists used essays for strident political themes, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and [[Willa Cather]] wrote lighter essays. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Edmund Wilson]], and [[Charles du Bos]] wrote literary criticism essays.<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n\n===Japan===\n{{main article|Zuihitsu}}\nAs with the [[novel]], essays existed in Japan several centuries before they developed in Europe with a genre of essays known as ''zuihitsu'' \u2014 loosely connected essays and fragmented ideas. Zuihitsu have existed since almost the beginnings of Japanese literature. Many of the most noted early works of Japanese literature are in this genre. Notable examples include ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' (c. 1000), by court lady [[Sei Sh\u014dnagon]], and ''[[Tsurezuregusa]]'' (1330), by particularly renowned Japanese Buddhist monk [[Yoshida Kenk\u014d]]. Kenk\u014d described his short writings similarly to Montaigne, referring to them as \"nonsensical thoughts\" written in \"idle hours\". Another noteworthy difference from Europe is that women have traditionally written in Japan, though the more formal, Chinese-influenced writings of male writers were more prized at the time.\n\n==Forms and styles==\nThis section describes the different forms and styles of essay writing. These forms and styles are used by an array of authors, including university students and professional [[List of essayists|essayists]].\n\n===Cause and effect===\nThe defining features of a \"cause and effect\" essay are causal chains that connect from a cause to an effect, careful language, and chronological or emphatic order. A writer using this rhetorical method must consider the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], determine the [[Intention|purpose]], consider the [[audience]], think critically about different causes or consequences, consider a thesis statement, arrange the parts, consider the [[language]], and decide on a conclusion.<ref>Chapter 7: Cause and Effect in Glenn, Cheryl.

Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Compare and contrast===\nCompare and contrast essays are characterized by a basis for comparison, points of comparison, and analogies. It is grouped by the object (chunking) or by point (sequential). The comparison highlights the similarities between two or more similar objects while contrasting highlights the differences between two or more objects. When writing a compare/contrast essay, writers need to determine their purpose, consider their audience, consider the basis and points of comparison, consider their thesis statement, arrange and develop the comparison, and reach a conclusion. Compare and contrast is arranged emphatically.<ref>Chapter 6: Comparison and Contrast in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Descriptive===\nDescriptive writing is characterized by [[sensory perception|sensory]] details, which appeal to the physical senses, and details that appeal to a reader's emotional, physical, or intellectual sensibilities. Determining the purpose, considering the audience, creating a dominant impression, using descriptive language, and organizing the description are the rhetorical choices to consider when using a description. A description is usually arranged spatially but can also be [[chronological]] or emphatic. The focus of a description is the scene. Description uses tools such as [[denotative]] language, [[connotative]] language, [[figurative language]], [[metaphor]], and [[simile]] to arrive at a dominant impression.<ref>Chapter 2: Description in Glenn, Cheryl.

This form benefits from presenting a broader perspective while countering a possible flaw that some may present. This type is sometimes called an ethics paper'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|title=How to Write an Ethics Paper (with Pictures) - wikiHow|accessdate=2016-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828152926/http://www.wikihow.com/Write-an-Ethics-Paper|archivedate=2016-08-28|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Exemplification===\nAn exemplification essay is characterized by a generalization and relevant, representative, and believable examples including [[anecdote]]s. Writers need to consider their subject, determine their purpose, consider their audience, decide on specific examples, and arrange all the parts together when writing an exemplification essay.<ref>Chapter 4: Exemplification in Glenn, Cheryl.

[[Anne Fadiman]] notes that \"the genre's heyday was the early nineteenth century,\" and that its greatest exponent was [[Charles Lamb]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fadiman|first=Anne|author-link=Anne Fadiman|title=At Large and At Small: Familiar Essays|page=x}}</ref>  She also suggests that while critical essays have more brain than the heart, and personal essays have more heart than brain, familiar essays have equal measures of both.<ref>Fadiman, ''At Large and At Small'', xi.</ref>\n\n===History (thesis)===\nA history essay sometimes referred to as a thesis essay describes an argument or claim about one or more historical events and supports that claim with evidence, arguments, and references. The text makes it clear to the reader why the argument or claim is as such.<ref>History Essay Format & Thesis Statement, (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===Narrative===\nA [[narrative]] uses tools such as [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, [[Flashforward|flash-forwards]], and [[Transition (fiction)|transitions]] that often build to a climax. The focus of a narrative is the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]. When creating a narrative, authors must determine their purpose, consider their audience, establish their point of view, use dialogue, and organize the narrative. A narrative is usually arranged chronologically.<ref>Chapter 3 Narration in Glenn, Cheryl. Making Sense: A Real-World Rhetorical Reader. Ed. Denise B. Wydra, et al. Second ed. Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2005.</ref>\n\n===Argumentative===\nAn [[argumentative]] essay is a [[criticism|critical]]  piece of writing, aimed at presenting objective [[analysis]] of the subject matter, narrowed down to a single topic. The main idea of all the criticism is to provide an opinion either of positive or negative implication. As such, a critical essay requires research and analysis, strong internal logic and sharp structure. Its structure normally builds around  introduction with a topic's relevance and a [[thesis statement]], body paragraphs with arguments linking back to the main thesis, and conclusion. In addition, an argumentative essay may include a refutation section where conflicting ideas are acknowledged, described, and criticized. Each [[argument]] of argumentative essay should be supported with sufficient evidence, relevant to the point.\n\n===Economic===\nAn [[economic]] essay can start with a thesis, or it can start with a theme. It can take a narrative course and a descriptive course. It can even become an [[argumentative]] essay if the author feels the need. After the introduction, the author has to do his/her best to expose the economic matter at hand, to analyze it, evaluate it, and draw a conclusion. If the essay takes more of a narrative form then the author has to expose each aspect of the economic puzzle in a way that makes it clear and understandable for the reader\n\n===Reflective===\nA ''reflective essay'' is an [[analysis|analytical]] piece of writing in which the writer describes a real or imaginary scene, event, interaction, passing thought, memory, or form \u2014 adding a personal reflection on the meaning of the topic in the author's life. Thus, the focus is not merely descriptive. The writer doesn\u2019t just describe the situation,  but revisits the scene with more detail and emotion to examine what went well, or reveal a need for additional learning \u2014 and may relate what transpired to the rest of the author's life.\n\n===Other logical structures===\nThe logical progression and organizational structure of an essay can take many forms. Understanding how the movement of thought is managed through an essay has a profound impact on its overall cogency and ability to impress. A number of alternative logical structures for essays have been visualized as diagrams, making them easy to implement or adapt in the construction of an argument.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |title='Mission Possible' by Dr. Mario Petrucci |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-10-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026012057/http://www.mariopetrucci.com/MissionPossible-StudySkills.htm |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Academic==\n[[File:Czythumbur.jpg|thumb|[[University student]]s, like these students doing research at a university library, are often assigned essays as a way to get them to analyze what they have read.]] \n{{main article|Free response}}\nIn countries like the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], essays have become a major part of a formal [[education]] in the form of [[free response]] questions. Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants (''see'' [[admissions essay]]). In both secondary and tertiary education, essays are used to judge the mastery and comprehension of the material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. In some courses, university students must complete one or more essays over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} mid-term and end of term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.\n\nIn these countries, so-called academic essays also called ''papers'', are usually more formal than literary ones.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} They may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the [[first-person narrative|first person]] often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} are often more discursive.  They sometimes begin with a short summary analysis of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a [[literature review]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nLonger essays may also contain an introductory page that defines words and phrases of the essay's topic. Most academic institutions require that all substantial facts, quotations, and other supporting material in an essay be referenced in a [[bibliography]] or works cited page at the end of the text. This scholarly convention helps others (whether teachers or fellow scholars) to understand the basis of facts and quotations the author uses to support the essay's argument and helps readers evaluate to what extent the argument is supported by evidence, and to evaluate the quality of that evidence. The academic essay tests the student's ability to present their thoughts in an organized way and is designed to test their intellectual capabilities.\n\nOne of the challenges facing universities is that in some cases, students may submit essays purchased from an [[essay mill]] (or \"paper mill\") as their own work. An \"essay mill\" is a [[ghostwriting]] service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since [[plagiarism]] is a form of [[academic dishonesty]] or [[academic fraud]], universities and colleges may investigate papers they suspect are from an essay mill by using [[plagiarism detection]] software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Khomami |first=Nadia |title=Plan to crack down on websites selling essays to students announced |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427193720/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/21/plan-to-crack-down-on-websites-selling-essays-to-students-announced |archivedate=27 April 2017 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Magazine or newspaper==\n{{main|Long-form journalism}}\nEssays often appear in magazines, especially magazines with an intellectual bent, such as ''[[The Atlantic]]'' and ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]''.

Some newspapers also print essays in the [[op-ed]] section.\n[[File:Harper's_February_(1895).jpeg|thumb|An 1895 cover of ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'', a US magazine that prints a number of essays per issue.]]\n\n==Employment==\nEmployment essays detailing experience in a certain occupational field are required when applying for some jobs, especially government jobs in the United States. Essays known as Knowledge Skills and Executive Core Qualifications are required when applying to certain US federal government positions.\n\nA KSA, or \"Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities,\" is a series of narrative statements that are required when applying to Federal government job openings in the United States. KSAs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary for the successful performance of a position are contained on each job vacancy announcement. KSAs are brief and focused essays about one's career and educational background that presumably qualify one to perform the duties of the position being applied for.\n\nAn Executive Core Qualification, or ECQ, is a narrative statement that is required when applying to Senior Executive Service positions within the US Federal government. Like the KSAs, ECQs are used along with resumes to determine who the best applicants are when several candidates qualify for a job. The Office of Personnel Management has established five executive core qualifications that all applicants seeking to enter the Senior Executive Service must demonstrate.\n\n==Non-literary types==\n\n===Film===\nA film essay (or \"cinematic essay\") consists of the evolution of a theme or an idea rather than a plot per se, or the film literally being a cinematic accompaniment to a narrator reading an essay.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} From another perspective, an essay film could be defined as a [[documentary film]] visual basis combined with a form of commentary that contains elements of self-portrait (rather than autobiography), where the signature (rather than the life story) of the filmmaker is apparent.

Many communication channels are subject to [[channel noise]], and thus errors may be introduced during transmission from the source to a receiver. Error detection techniques allow detecting such errors, while error correction enables reconstruction of the original data in many cases.\n\n== Definitions ==\n''Error detection '' is the detection of errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission from the transmitter to the receiver. ''Error correction'' is the detection of errors and reconstruction of the original, error-free data.\n\n== History ==\nThe modern development of [[error correction code]]s is credited to [[Richard Hamming]] in 1947.<ref name=Thompson>{{citation|first=Thomas M.|last=Thompson|title=From Error-Correcting Codes through Sphere Packings to Simple Groups|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|year=1983|series=The Carus Mathematical Monographs (#21)|isbn=0-88385-023-0|page=vii}}</ref> A description of [[Hamming code|Hamming's code]] appeared in [[Claude Shannon]]'s ''A Mathematical Theory of Communication''<ref>{{citation|first=C.E.|last=Shannon|title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|volume=27|year=1948|location= p. 418}}</ref> and was quickly generalized by [[Marcel J. E. Golay]].<ref>{{citation|first=Marcel J. E.|last=Golay|title=Notes on Digital Coding|journal=Proc.I.R.E. (I.E.E.E.)|volume=37|year=1949|location= p. 657}}</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nAll error-detection and correction schemes add some [[Redundancy (information theory)|redundancy]] (i.e., some extra data) to a message, which receivers can use to check consistency of the delivered message, and to recover data that has been determined to be corrupted. Error-detection and correction schemes can be either [[systematic code|systematic]] or non-systematic. In a systematic scheme, the transmitter sends the original data, and attaches a fixed number of ''check bits'' (or ''parity data''), which are derived from the data bits by some [[deterministic algorithm]]. If only error detection is required, a receiver can simply apply the same algorithm to the received data bits and compare its output with the received check bits; if the values do not match, an error has occurred at some point during the transmission. In a system that uses a non-systematic code, the original message is transformed into an encoded message carrying the same information and that has at least as many bits as the original message.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nGood error control performance requires the scheme to be selected based on the characteristics of the communication channel. Common [[channel model]]s include memory-less models where errors occur randomly and with a certain probability, and dynamic models where errors occur primarily in [[burst error|bursts]]. Consequently, error-detecting and correcting codes can be generally distinguished between ''random-error-detecting/correcting'' and ''burst-error-detecting/correcting''. Some codes can also be suitable for a mixture of random errors and burst errors.\n\nIf the [[channel capacity]] cannot be determined, or is highly variable, an error-detection scheme may be combined with a system for retransmissions of erroneous data. This is known as [[#Automatic repeat request|automatic repeat request]] (ARQ), and is most notably used in the Internet. An alternate approach for error control is [[#Hybrid schemes|hybrid automatic repeat request]] (HARQ), which is a combination of ARQ and error-correction coding.\n\n== Implementation ==\nError correction may generally be realized in two different ways:\n* ''[[Automatic repeat request]] (ARQ)'' (sometimes also referred to as ''backward error correction''): This is an error control technique whereby an error detection scheme is combined with requests for retransmission of erroneous data. Every block of data received is checked using the error detection code used, and if the check fails, retransmission of the data is requested \u2013 this may be done repeatedly, until the data can be verified.\n* ''[[Forward error correction]] (FEC)'': The sender encodes the data using an ''error-correcting code (ECC)'' prior to transmission. The additional information (redundancy) added by the code is used by the receiver to recover the original data. In general, the reconstructed data is what is deemed the \"most likely\" original data.\n\nARQ and FEC may be combined, such that minor errors are corrected without retransmission, and major errors are corrected via a request for retransmission: this is called ''[[hybrid automatic repeat-request]] (HARQ)''.\n\n== Error detection schemes ==\nError detection is most commonly realized using a suitable [[hash function]] (or [[checksum]] algorithm). A hash function adds a fixed-length ''tag'' to a message, which enables receivers to verify the delivered message by recomputing the tag and comparing it with the one provided.\n\nThere exists a vast variety of different hash function designs. However, some are of particularly widespread use because of either their simplicity or their suitability for detecting certain kinds of errors (e.g., the [[cyclic redundancy check]]'s performance in detecting [[burst error]]s).\n\nA random-error-correcting code based on [[Maximum likelihood decoding#Minimum distance decoding|minimum distance]] coding can provide a strict guarantee on the number of detectable errors, but it may not protect against a [[preimage attack]]. A repetition code, described in the section below, is a special case of error-correcting code: although rather inefficient, a repetition code is suitable in some applications of error correction and detection due to its simplicity.\n\n=== Repetition codes ===\n{{Main|Repetition code}}\nA ''repetition code'' is a coding scheme that repeats the bits across a channel to achieve error-free communication. Given a stream of data to be transmitted, the data are divided into blocks of bits. Each block is transmitted some predetermined number of times. For example, to send the bit pattern \"1011\", the four-bit block can be repeated three times, thus producing \"1011 1011 1011\". However, if this twelve-bit pattern was received as \"1010 1011 1011\" \u2013 where the first block is unlike the other two \u2013 it can be determined that an error has occurred.\n\nA repetition code is very inefficient, and can be susceptible to problems if the error occurs in exactly the same place for each group (e.g., \"1010 1010 1010\" in the previous example would be detected as correct). The advantage of repetition codes is that they are extremely simple, and are in fact used in some transmissions of [[numbers station]]s.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cisquet.nl/numbers.htm\n|title=Numbers (and other mysterious) stations\n|author=Frank van Gerwen\n|accessdate={{date|2012-03-12}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/08/mysterious-russian-numbers-station-changes-broadcast-after-20-years/\n|publisher=''Gizmodo''\n|accessdate={{date|2012-03-12}}\n|date={{date|2010-08-25}}\n|author=Gary Cutlack\n|title=Mysterious Russian \u2018Numbers Station\u2019 Changes Broadcast After 20 Years\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Parity bits ===\n{{Main|Parity bit}}\nA ''parity bit'' is a bit that is added to a group of source bits to ensure that the number of set bits (i.e., bits with value 1) in the outcome is even or odd. It is a very simple scheme that can be used to detect single or any other odd number (i.e., three, five, etc.) of errors in the output. An even number of flipped bits will make the parity bit appear correct even though the data is erroneous.\n\nExtensions and variations on the parity bit mechanism are [[horizontal redundancy check]]s, [[vertical redundancy check]]s, and \"double,\" \"dual,\" or \"diagonal\" parity (used in [[Non-standard RAID levels#RAID-DP|RAID-DP]]).\n\n=== Checksums ===\n{{Main|Checksum}}\nA ''checksum'' of a message is a [[modular arithmetic]] sum of message code words of a fixed word length (e.g., byte values). The sum may be negated by means of a [[Ones' complement|ones'-complement]] operation prior to transmission to detect errors resulting in all-zero messages.\n\nChecksum schemes include [[parity bit]]s, [[check digit]]s, and [[longitudinal redundancy check]]s. Some checksum schemes, such as the [[Damm algorithm]], the [[Luhn algorithm]], and the [[Verhoeff algorithm]], are specifically designed to detect errors commonly introduced by humans in writing down or remembering identification numbers.\n\n=== Cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) ===\n{{Main|Cyclic redundancy check}}\nA ''cyclic redundancy check (CRC)'' is a non-secure [[hash function]] designed to detect accidental changes to digital data in computer networks; as a result, it is not suitable for detecting maliciously introduced errors. It is characterized by specification of what is called a ''generator polynomial'', which is used as the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]] over a [[finite field]], taking the input data as the [[dividend]], such that the [[remainder]] becomes the result.\n\nA cyclic code has favorable properties that make it well suited for detecting [[burst error]]s. CRCs are particularly easy to implement in hardware, and are therefore commonly used in digital [[computer network|networks]] and storage devices such as [[hard disk drives]].\n\nEven parity is a special case of a cyclic redundancy check, where the single-bit CRC is generated by the divisor ''x'' + 1.\n\n=== Cryptographic hash functions ===\n{{Main|Cryptographic hash function}}\nThe output of a ''cryptographic hash function'', also known as a ''message digest'', can provide strong assurances about [[data integrity]], whether changes of the data are accidental (e.g., due to transmission errors) or maliciously introduced. Any modification to the data will likely be detected through a mismatching hash value. Furthermore, given some hash value, it is infeasible to find some input data (other than the one given) that will yield the same hash value. If an attacker can change not only the message but also the hash value, then a ''keyed hash'' or [[message authentication code]] (MAC) can be used for additional security. Without knowing the key, it is not possible for the attacker to easily or conveniently calculate the correct keyed hash value for a modified message.\n\n=== Error-correcting codes ===\n{{Main|Forward error correction}}\nAny error-correcting code can be used for error detection. A code with ''minimum [[Hamming distance]]'', ''d'', can detect up to ''d'' \u2212 1 errors in a code word. Using minimum-distance-based error-correcting codes for error detection can be suitable if a strict limit on the minimum number of errors to be detected is desired.\n\nCodes with minimum Hamming distance ''d'' = 2 are degenerate cases of error-correcting codes, and can be used to detect single errors. The [[parity bit]] is an example of a single-error-detecting code.\n\n== Error correction ==\n\n=== Automatic repeat request (ARQ) ===\n{{Main|Automatic repeat request}}\n[[Automatic repeat request|Automatic Repeat reQuest]] (ARQ) is an error control method for data transmission that makes use of error-detection codes, acknowledgment and/or negative acknowledgment messages, and [[Timeout (computing)|timeouts]] to achieve reliable data transmission. An ''acknowledgment'' is a message sent by the receiver to indicate that it has correctly received a [[Frame (networking)|data frame]].\n\nUsually, when the transmitter does not receive the acknowledgment before the timeout occurs (i.e., within a reasonable amount of time after sending the data frame), it retransmits the frame until it is either correctly received or the error persists beyond a predetermined number of retransmissions.\n\nThree types of ARQ protocols are [[Stop-and-wait ARQ]], [[Go-Back-N ARQ]], and [[Selective Repeat ARQ]].\n\nARQ is appropriate if the communication channel has varying or unknown [[channel capacity|capacity]], such as is the case on the Internet. However, ARQ requires the availability of a [[Backward channel|back channel]], results in possibly increased [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] due to retransmissions, and requires the maintenance of buffers and timers for retransmissions, which in the case of [[network congestion]] can put a strain on the server and overall network capacity.<ref name=\"reliable-erasure-code\">A. J. McAuley, ''Reliable Broadband Communication Using a Burst Erasure Correcting Code'', ACM SIGCOMM, 1990.</ref>\n\nFor example, ARQ is used on shortwave radio data links in the form of [[ARQ-E]], or combined with multiplexing as [[ARQ-M]].\n\n=== Error-correcting code ===\nAn [[error-correcting code]] (ECC) or forward error correction (FEC) code is a process of adding [[redundancy (information theory)|redundant]] data, or ''parity data'', to a message, such that it can be recovered by a receiver even when a number of errors (up to the capability of the code being used) were introduced, either during the process of transmission, or on storage. Since the receiver does not have to ask the sender for retransmission of the data, a [[backchannel]] is not required in forward error correction, and it is therefore suitable for [[simplex communication]] such as [[broadcasting]]. Error-correcting codes are frequently used in [[OSI model|lower-layer]] communication, as well as for reliable storage in media such as [[Compact Disc|CDs]], [[DVD]]s, [[hard disk]]s, and [[random access memory|RAM]].\n\nError-correcting codes are usually distinguished between [[convolutional code]]s and [[block code]]s:\n* ''Convolutional codes'' are processed on a bit-by-bit basis. They are particularly suitable for implementation in hardware, and the [[Viterbi decoder]] allows [[maximum likelihood decoding|optimal decoding]].\n* ''Block codes'' are processed on a [[Block (telecommunications)|block-by-block]] basis. Early examples of block codes are [[repetition code]]s, [[Hamming code]]s and [[multidimensional parity-check code]]s. They were followed by a number of efficient codes, [[Reed\u2013Solomon code]]s being the most notable due to their current widespread use. [[Turbo code]]s and [[low-density parity-check code]]s (LDPC) are relatively new constructions that can provide almost [[:Category:Capacity-approaching codes|optimal efficiency]].\n\n[[Shannon's theorem]] is an important theorem in forward error correction, and describes the maximum [[information rate]] at which reliable communication is possible over a channel that has a certain error probability or [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). This strict upper limit is expressed in terms of the [[channel capacity]]. More specifically, the theorem says that there exist codes such that with increasing encoding length the probability of error on a [[channel model|discrete memoryless channel]] can be made arbitrarily small, provided that the [[code rate]] is smaller than the channel capacity. The code rate is defined as the fraction ''k/n'' of ''k'' source symbols and ''n'' encoded symbols.\n\nThe actual maximum code rate allowed depends on the error-correcting code used, and may be lower. This is because Shannon's proof was only of existential nature, and did not show how to construct codes which are both optimal and have [[polynomial time|efficient]] encoding and decoding algorithms.\n\n=== Hybrid schemes ===\n{{Main|Hybrid ARQ}}\n[[Hybrid ARQ]] is a combination of ARQ and forward error correction. There are two basic approaches:<ref name=\"reliable-erasure-code\" />\n* Messages are always transmitted with FEC parity data (and error-detection redundancy). A receiver decodes a message using the parity information, and requests retransmission using ARQ only if the parity data was not sufficient for successful decoding (identified through a failed integrity check).\n* Messages are transmitted without parity data (only with error-detection information). If a receiver detects an error, it requests FEC information from the transmitter using ARQ, and uses it to reconstruct the original message.\n\nThe latter approach is particularly attractive on an [[Binary erasure channel|erasure channel]] when using a [[Fountain code|rateless erasure code]].\n\n== Applications ==\nApplications that require low latency (such as telephone conversations) cannot use [[Automatic repeat request|Automatic Repeat reQuest]] (ARQ); they must use [[forward error correction]] (FEC). By the time an [[Automatic repeat request|ARQ]] system discovers an error and re-transmits it, the re-sent data will arrive too late to be any good.\n\nApplications where the transmitter immediately forgets the information as soon as it is sent (such as most television cameras) cannot use [[Automatic repeat request|ARQ]]; they must use [[Forward error correction|FEC]] because when an error occurs, the original data is no longer available. (This is also why [[Forward error correction|FEC]] is used in data storage systems such as [[RAID]] and [[distributed data store]]).\n\nApplications that use ARQ must have a [[return channel]]; applications having no return channel cannot use ARQ.  Applications that require extremely low error rates (such as digital money transfers) must use [[Automatic repeat request|ARQ]].  Reliability and inspection engineering also make use of the theory of error-correcting codes.<ref>{{cite journal\n|url= http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/SCI_paper.pdf\n|title=Self-correcting inspection procedure under inspection errors\n|author1=Ben-Gal I. |author2=Herer Y. |author3=Raz T. |publisher=IIE Transactions on Quality and Reliability, 34(6), pp. 529-540.\n|year=2003|format=PDF\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Internet ===\nIn a typical [[TCP/IP]] stack, error control is performed at multiple levels:\n* Each [[Ethernet]] [[Data frame|frame]] carries a [[Cyclic redundancy check|CRC-32]] [[checksum]]. Frames received with incorrect checksums are discarded by the receiver hardware.\n* The [[IPv4]] header contains a checksum protecting the contents of the header. [[Packet (information technology)|Packets]] with mismatching checksums are dropped within the network or at the receiver.\n* The checksum was omitted from the [[IPv6]] header in order to minimize processing costs in [[network routing]] and because current [[link layer]] technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection (see also RFC 3819).\n* [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] has an optional checksum covering the payload and addressing information from the UDP and IP headers. Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded by the [[operating system]] [[network stack]]. The checksum is optional under IPv4, only, because the Data-Link layer checksum may already provide the desired level of error protection.\n* [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] provides a checksum for protecting the payload and addressing information from the TCP and IP headers. Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded within the network stack, and eventually get retransmitted using ARQ, either explicitly (such as through [[triple-ack]]) or implicitly due to a [[timeout (computing)|timeout]].\n\n=== Deep-space telecommunications ===\nDevelopment of error-correction codes was tightly coupled with the history of deep-space missions due to the extreme dilution of signal power over interplanetary distances, and the limited power availability aboard space probes. Whereas early missions sent their data uncoded, starting from 1968, digital error correction was implemented in the form of (sub-optimally decoded) [[convolutional code]]s and [[Reed\u2013Muller code]]s.<ref name=\"deep-space-codes\">K. Andrews et al., ''The Development of Turbo and LDPC Codes for Deep-Space Applications'', Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 95, No. 11, Nov. 2007.</ref> The Reed\u2013Muller code was well suited to the noise the spacecraft was subject to (approximately matching a [[Gaussian function|bell curve]]), and was implemented at the Mariner spacecraft for missions between 1969 and 1977.\n\nThe [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] missions, which started in 1977, were designed to deliver color imaging amongst scientific information of [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].<ref name=\"voyager\">{{cite book |first1=William Cary |last1=Huffman |first2=Vera S. |last2=Pless |author-link2=Vera Pless |title=Fundamentals of Error-Correcting Codes |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-78280-7}}</ref> This resulted in increased coding requirements, and thus, the spacecraft were supported by (optimally [[Viterbi decoder|Viterbi-decoded]]) convolutional codes that could be [[concatenated code|concatenated]] with an outer [[Binary Golay code|Golay (24,12,8) code]].\n\nThe Voyager 2 craft additionally supported an implementation of a [[Reed\u2013Solomon code]]: the concatenated Reed\u2013Solomon\u2013Viterbi (RSV) code allowed for very powerful error correction, and enabled the spacecraft's extended journey to [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. Both crafts used V2 RSV coding due to ECC system upgrades after 1989.\n\nThe [[CCSDS]] currently recommends usage of error correction codes with performance similar to the Voyager 2 RSV code as a minimum. Concatenated codes are increasingly falling out of favor with space missions, and are replaced by more powerful codes such as [[Turbo code]]s or [[LDPC code]]s.\n\nThe different kinds of deep space and orbital missions that are conducted suggest that trying to find a \"one size fits all\" error correction system will be an ongoing problem for some time to come. For missions close to Earth, the nature of the [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[communication channel]] is different from that which a spacecraft on an interplanetary mission experiences. Additionally, as a spacecraft increases its distance from Earth, the problem of correcting for noise gets bigger.\n\n=== Satellite broadcasting (DVB) ===\nThe demand for satellite [[transponder]] bandwidth continues to grow, fueled by the desire to deliver television (including new channels and [[High Definition TV]]) and IP data. Transponder availability and bandwidth constraints have limited this growth, because transponder capacity is determined by the selected [[modulation]] scheme and [[Forward error correction]] (FEC) rate.\n\nOverview\n* [[QPSK]] coupled with traditional Reed Solomon and Viterbi codes have been used for nearly 20 years for the delivery of digital satellite TV.\n* Higher order modulation schemes such as [[8PSK]], [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|16QAM]] and [[32QAM]] have enabled the satellite industry to increase transponder efficiency by several orders of magnitude.\n* This increase in the information rate in a transponder comes at the expense of an increase in the carrier power to meet the threshold requirement for existing antennas.\n* Tests conducted using the latest chipsets demonstrate that the performance achieved by using Turbo Codes may be even lower than the 0.8 [[Decibel|dB]] figure assumed in early designs.{{Citation needed|reason=latest means when? which tests?|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Data storage ===\n\nError detection and correction codes are often used to improve the reliability of data storage media.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  A \"parity track\" was present on the first [[magnetic tape data storage]] in 1951. The \"Optimal Rectangular Code\" used in [[group coded recording]] tapes not only detects but also corrects single-bit errors. Some [[file format]]s, particularly [[archive formats]], include a checksum (most often [[CRC32]]) to detect corruption and truncation and can employ redundancy and/or [[parity file]]s to recover portions of corrupted data. [[Cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding|Reed Solomon codes]] are used in [[compact disc]]s to correct errors caused by scratches.\n\nModern hard drives use CRC codes to detect and Reed\u2013Solomon codes to correct minor errors in sector reads, and to recover data from sectors that have \"gone bad\" and store that data in the spare sectors.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080202143103/http://www.myharddrivedied.com/presentations_whitepaper.html My Hard Drive Died]. Scott A. Moulton</ref> [[RAID]] systems use a variety of error correction techniques to correct errors when a hard drive completely fails.  Filesystems such as [[ZFS]] or [[Btrfs]], as well as some [[RAID]] implementations, support [[data scrubbing]] and resilvering{{Citation needed|reason=this is not a widely used term, so a citation is required |date=October 2018}}, which allows bad blocks to be detected and (hopefully) recovered before they are used. The recovered data may be re-written to exactly the same physical location, to spare blocks elsewhere on the same piece of hardware, or the data may be rewritten onto replacement hardware.\n\n=== {{Anchor|LINUX-EDAC|BLUESMOKE}}Error-correcting memory ===\n{{Main|ECC memory}}\n\n[[Dynamic random access memory|DRAM]] memory may provide stronger protection against [[soft error]]s by relying on error correcting codes.<ref>\"[https://www.academia.edu/37439828/A_Survey_of_Techniques_for_Improving_Error-Resilience_of_DRAM A Survey of Techniques for Improving Error-Resilience of DRAM]\", Journal of systems architecture, 2018</ref> Such [[Dynamic random access memory#Errors and error correction|error-correcting memory]], known as ''ECC'' or ''EDAC-protected'' memory, is particularly desirable for mission-critical applications, such as scientific computing, financial, medical, etc. as well as deep-space applications due to increased [[cosmic ray|radiation]] in the space.\n\nError-correcting memory controllers traditionally use [[Hamming code]]s, although some use [[triple modular redundancy]].\n\n[[Forward error correction#Interleaving|Interleaving]] allows distributing the effect of a single cosmic ray potentially upsetting multiple physically neighboring bits across multiple words by associating neighboring bits to different words. As long as a [[single event upset]] (SEU) does not exceed the error threshold (e.g., a single error) in any particular word between accesses, it can be corrected (e.g., by a single-bit error correcting code), and the illusion of an error-free memory system may be maintained.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Using StrongArm SA-1110 in the On-Board Computer of Nanosatellite\n |publisher   = Tsinghua Space Center, [[Tsinghua University]], Beijing\n |accessdate  = 2009-02-16\n |url         = http://www.apmcsta.org/File/doc/Conferences/6th%20meeting/Chen%20Zhenyu.doc\n}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=May 2018}}<!-- I wish I had a better reference --></ref>\n\nIn addition to hardware providing features required for ECC memory to operate, [[operating system]]s usually contain related reporting facilities that are used to provide notifications when soft errors are transparently recovered. An increasing rate of soft errors might indicate that a [[DIMM]] module needs replacing, and such feedback information would not be easily available without the related reporting capabilities. One example is the [[Linux kernel]]'s ''EDAC'' subsystem (previously known as ''bluesmoke''), which collects the data from error-checking-enabled components inside a computer system; beside collecting and reporting back the events related to ECC memory, it also supports other checksumming errors, including those detected on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]].<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Monitoring-Memory-Errors\n | title = Error Detection and Correction\n | accessdate = 2014-08-12\n | author = Jeff Layton | publisher = ''[[Linux Magazine]]''\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://bluesmoke.sourceforge.net/\n | title = EDAC Project\n | accessdate = 2014-08-12\n | website = bluesmoke.sourceforge.net\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/edac.txt\n |title       = Documentation/edac.txt\n |work        = Linux kernel documentation\n |date        = 2014-06-16\n |accessdate  = 2014-08-12\n |publisher   = [[kernel.org]]\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090905174616/http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/edac.txt\n |archivedate = 2009-09-05\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nA few systems also support [[memory scrubbing]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer science}}\n\n* [[Berger code]]\n* [[Burst error-correcting code]]\n* [[Link adaptation]]\n* [[List of algorithms#Error detection and correction|List of algorithms for error detection and correction]]\n* [[List of error-correcting codes]]\n* [[List of hash functions]]\n* [[Reliability (computer networking)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author1=Shu Lin |author2=Daniel J.

This generalized Euclidean algorithm can be put to many of the same uses as Euclid's original algorithm in the ring of [[integer]]s: in any Euclidean domain, one can apply the Euclidean algorithm to compute the [[greatest common divisor]] of any two elements.  In particular, the greatest common divisor of any two elements exists and can be written as a linear combination \nof them ([[B\u00e9zout's identity]]).  Also every [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in a Euclidean domain is [[principal ideal|principal]], which implies a suitable generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]: every Euclidean domain is a [[unique factorization domain]].\n\nIt is important to compare the class of Euclidean domains with the larger class of [[principal ideal domain]]s (PIDs).  An arbitrary PID has much the same \"structural properties\" of a Euclidean domain (or, indeed, even of the ring of integers), but when an explicit [[algorithm]] for Euclidean division is known, one may use [[Euclidean algorithm]] and [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] to compute [[greatest common divisor]]s and [[B\u00e9zout's identity]]. In particular, the existence of efficient algorithms for Euclidean division of integers and of polynomials in one variable over a field is of basic importance in [[computer algebra]].\n\nSo, given an integral domain ''R'', it is often very useful to know that ''R'' has a Euclidean function: in particular, this implies that ''R'' is a PID.  However, if there is no \"obvious\" Euclidean function, then determining whether ''R'' is a PID is generally a much easier problem than determining whether it is a Euclidean domain.\n\nEuclidean domains appear in the following chain of [[subclass (set theory)|class inclusions]]:\n{{Commutative ring classes}}\n{{Algebraic structures |Ring}}\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''R'' be an integral domain.  A '''Euclidean function''' on ''R'' is a function <math> f </math> from <math>R \\setminus \\{0\\}</math> to the [[non-negative integer]]s satisfying the following fundamental division-with-remainder property:\n\n*(EF1) If ''a'' and ''b'' are in ''R'' and ''b'' is nonzero, then there are ''q'' and ''r'' in ''R'' such that {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''bq'' + ''r''}} and either ''r'' = 0 or {{nowrap|''f''(''r'') &lt; ''f''(''b'')}}.\n\nA '''Euclidean domain''' is an integral domain which can be endowed with at least one Euclidean function.  It is important to note that a particular Euclidean function ''f'' is ''not'' part of the structure of a Euclidean domain: in general, a Euclidean domain will admit many different Euclidean functions.\n\nMost algebra texts require a Euclidean function to have the following additional property:\n\n*(EF2) For all nonzero ''a'' and ''b'' in ''R'', {{nowrap|''f''(''a'') \u2264 ''f''(''ab'')}}.\n\nHowever, one can show that (EF2) is superfluous in the following sense: any domain ''R'' which \ncan be endowed with a function ''g'' satisfying (EF1) can also be endowed with a function ''f'' satisfying (EF1) and (EF2): indeed, for <math> a \\in R \\setminus \\{0\\}</math> one can define ''f''(''a'') as follows<ref>{{Citation | last = Rogers | first = Kenneth | title = The Axioms for Euclidean Domains | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume = 78 | issue = 10 | pages = 1127&ndash;1128 | year = 1971 | doi = 10.2307/2316324 | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]] | jstor = 2316324 | zbl=0227.13007 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>f(a) = \\min_{x \\in R \\setminus \\{0\\}} g(xa)</math>\n\nIn words, one may define ''f''(''a'') to be the minimum value attained by ''g'' on the set of all non-zero elements of the principal ideal generated by ''a''.\n\nA '''multiplicative Euclidean function''' is one such that ''f''(''ab'')=''f''(''a'')''f''(''b'') and ''f''(''a'') is never zero. It follows that ''f''(1)=1 and in fact ''f''(''a'')=1 if and only if ''a'' is a unit.\n\n=== Notes on the definition ===\n\nMany authors use other terms such as \"degree function\", \"valuation function\", \"gauge function\" or \"norm function\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dummit |first1=David |last2=Foote |first2=Richard |title=Abstract algerb |publisher=John Wiley& Sons, Inc |isbn=0-471-43334-9 |page=270 |edition=3}}</ref>, in place of \"Euclidean function\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Some authors also require the domain of the Euclidean function to be the entire ring ''R'';<ref>E.g., Dummit and Foote, Abstract Algebra, 3rd edition, p. 270</ref> however this does not essentially affect the definition, since (EF1) does not involve the value of ''f''(0). The definition is sometimes generalized by allowing the Euclidean function to take its values in any well-ordered set; this weakening does not affect the most important implications of the Euclidean property.\n\nThe property (EF1) can be restated as follows: for any principal ideal ''I'' of ''R'' with nonzero generator ''b'', all nonzero classes of the quotient ring ''R''/''I'' have a representative ''r'' with {{nowrap|''f''(''r'') &lt; ''f''(''b'')}}. Since the possible values of ''f'' are well-ordered, this property can be established by proving {{nowrap|''f''(''r'') &lt; ''f''(''b'')}} for any ''r'' (not in ''I'') with minimal value of ''f''(''r'') in its class. Note that for a Euclidean function that is so established there need not exist an effective method to determine ''q'' and ''r'' in (EF1).\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of Euclidean domains include:\n\n*Any field.

With respect to general principal ideal domains, the existence of factorizations (i.e., that ''R'' is an [[atomic domain]]) is particularly easy to prove in Euclidean domains: choosing a Euclidean function ''f'' satisfying (EF2), ''x'' cannot have any decomposition into more than ''f''(''x'') nonunit factors, so starting with ''x'' and repeatedly decomposing reducible factors is bound to produce a factorization into irreducible elements.\n* Any element of ''R'' at which ''f'' takes its globally minimal value is invertible in ''R''.

The length DC being shorter, it is used to \"measure\" BA, but only once because remainder EA is less than DC. EA now measures (twice) the shorter length DC, with remainder FC shorter than EA. Then FC measures (three times) length EA. Because there is no remainder, the process ends with FC being the GCD. On the right [[Nicomachus]]' example with numbers 49 and 21 resulting in their GCD of 7 (derived from Heath 1908:300).]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Euclidean algorithm'''{{Ref_label|a|a|none}}, or '''Euclid's algorithm''', is an efficient method for computing the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a [[remainder]]. It is named after the ancient Greek [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]], who first described it in [[Euclid's Elements|his ''Elements'']] (c. 300 BC).\nIt is an example of an ''[[algorithm]]'', a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules,\nand is one of the oldest algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to their [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]], and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.  For example, 21 is the GCD of 252 and 105 (as 252&nbsp;=&nbsp;21&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;12 and 105&nbsp;=&nbsp;21&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;5), and the same number 21 is also the GCD of 105 and  252&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;105&nbsp;=&nbsp;147. Since this replacement reduces the larger of the two numbers, repeating this process gives successively smaller pairs of numbers until the two numbers become equal.  When that occurs, they are the GCD of the original two numbers.  By [[extended Euclidean algorithm|reversing the steps]], the GCD can be expressed as a [[linear combination|sum]] of the two original numbers each multiplied by a positive or negative [[integer]], e.g., {{nowrap begin}}21 = 5 \u00d7 105 + (\u22122) \u00d7 252.{{nowrap end}} The fact that the GCD can always be expressed in this way is known as [[B\u00e9zout's identity]].\n\nThe version of the Euclidean algorithm described above (and by Euclid) can take many subtraction steps to find the GCD when one of the given numbers is much bigger than the other. A more efficient version of the algorithm shortcuts these steps, instead replacing the larger of the two numbers by its remainder when divided by the smaller of the two (with this version, the algorithm stops when reaching a zero remainder). With this improvement, the algorithm never requires more steps than five times the number of digits (base 10) of the smaller integer.  This was proven by [[Gabriel Lam\u00e9]] in 1844, and marks the beginning of [[computational complexity theory]].  Additional methods for improving the algorithm's efficiency were developed in the 20th century.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications.  It is used for reducing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s to their [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]] and for performing [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in [[modular arithmetic]]. Computations using this algorithm form part of the [[cryptographic protocol]]s that are used to secure [[internet]] communications, and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by [[integer factorization|factoring large composite numbers]].  The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve [[Diophantine equation]]s, such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to construct [[continued fraction]]s, and to find accurate [[Diophantine approximation|rational approximations]] to real numbers.   Finally, it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in [[number theory]] such as [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]] and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|uniqueness of prime factorizations]].  The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths (real numbers), but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers, such as [[Gaussian integer]]s and [[polynomial]]s of one variable.  This led to modern [[abstract algebra]]ic notions such as [[Euclidean domain]]s.\n\n==Background: greatest common divisor==\n{{main|Greatest common divisor}}\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two [[natural number]]s ''a'' and ''b''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' is the largest natural number that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' without leaving a remainder. Synonyms for the GCD include the ''greatest common factor'' (GCF), the ''highest common factor'' (HCF), the ''highest common divisor'' (HCD), and the ''greatest common measure'' (GCM). The greatest common divisor is often written as gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b'') or, more simply, as (''a'',&nbsp;''b''),<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=16}}</ref> although the latter notation is ambiguous, also used for concepts such as an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in the [[ring of integers]], which is closely related to GCD.\n\nIf gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, then ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be [[Coprime integers|coprime]] (or relatively prime).<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=21}}</ref> This property does not imply that ''a'' or ''b'' are themselves [[prime number]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=32}}</ref> For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a prime number, since they both have two prime factors: 6&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3 and 35&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.\n\n[[File:24x60.svg|thumb|upright|alt=\"Tall, slender rectangle divided into a grid of squares. The rectangle is two squares wide and five squares tall.\"|A 24-by-60 rectangle is covered with ten 12-by-12 square tiles, where 12 is the GCD of 24 and 60. More generally, an ''a''-by-''b'' rectangle can be covered with square tiles of side-length ''c'' only if ''c'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''.]]\n\nLet ''g'' = gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b''). Since ''a'' and ''b'' are both multiples of ''g'', they can be written ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mg'' and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ng'', and there is no larger number ''G''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''g'' for which this is true. The natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'' must be coprime, since any common factor could be factored out of ''m'' and ''n'' to make ''g'' greater. Thus, any other number ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' must also divide ''g''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' of ''a'' and ''b'' is the unique (positive) common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' that is divisible by any other common divisor ''c''.<ref>{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=31}}</ref>\n\nThe GCD can be visualized as follows.<ref>{{cite book | last = Grossman|first= J. W. | year = 1990 | title = Discrete Mathematics | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | isbn = 0-02-348331-8 | page = 213}}</ref> Consider a rectangular area ''a'' by ''b'', and any common divisor ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' exactly. The sides of the rectangle can be divided into segments of length ''c'', which divides the rectangle into a grid of squares of side length ''c''. The greatest common divisor ''g'' is the largest value of ''c'' for which this is possible. For illustration, a 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of: 1-by-1 squares, 2-by-2 squares, 3-by-3 squares, 4-by-4 squares, 6-by-6 squares or 12-by-12 squares. Therefore, 12 is the greatest common divisor of 24 and 60. A 24-by-60 rectangular area can be divided into a grid of 12-by-12 squares, with two squares along one edge (24/12&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) and five squares along the other (60/12&nbsp;=&nbsp;5).\n\nThe GCD of two numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used multiple times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both ''a'' and ''b''.<ref name=\"Schroeder_21\" >{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> For example, since 1386 can be factored into 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;11, and 3213 can be factored into 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63&nbsp;=&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the [[empty product]]), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Ogilvy | first1 = C.

The set of all integral linear combinations of ''a'' and ''b'' is actually the same as the set of all multiples of ''g'' (''mg'', where ''m'' is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by ''a'' and ''b'' is the ideal generated by&nbsp;''g'' alone (an ideal generated by a single element is called a [[principal ideal]], and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ''ua''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''vb''). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.\n\nThe GCD of three or more numbers equals the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers,<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=25}}</ref> but it can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> For example,\n\n: {{math|1=gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'') = gcd(''a'',&nbsp;gcd(''b'',&nbsp;''c'')) = gcd(gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b''),&nbsp;''c'') = gcd(gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''c''),&nbsp;''b'').}}\n\nThus, Euclid's algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers, suffices to calculate the GCD of arbitrarily many integers.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Procedure===\nThe Euclidean algorithm proceeds in a series of steps such that the output of each step is used as an input for the next one. Let ''k'' be an integer that counts the steps of the algorithm, starting with zero. Thus, the initial step corresponds to ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the next step corresponds to ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and so on.\n\nEach step begins with two nonnegative remainders ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub> and ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;2</sub>. Since the algorithm ensures that the remainders decrease steadily with every step, ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub> is less than its predecessor ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;2</sub>. The goal of the ''k''th step is to find a [[quotient]] ''q''<sub>''k''</sub> and [[remainder]] ''r''<sub>''k''</sub> that satisfy the equation\n\n:<math>r_{k-2} = q_k r_{k-1} + r_k</math>\n\nand that have ''r''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''r''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub>. In other words, multiples of the smaller number ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub> are subtracted from the larger number ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;2</sub> until the remainder ''r''<sub>''k''</sub> is smaller than ''r''<sub>''k''&minus;1</sub>.\n\nIn the initial step (''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), the remainders ''r''<sub>\u22122</sub> and ''r''<sub>\u22121</sub> equal ''a'' and ''b'', the numbers for which the GCD is sought. In the next step (''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), the remainders equal ''b'' and the remainder ''r''<sub>0</sub> of the initial step, and so on. Thus, the algorithm can be written as a sequence of equations\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na &= q_0  b + r_0 \\\\\nb &= q_1 r_0 + r_1 \\\\\nr_0 &= q_2 r_1 + r_2 \\\\\nr_1 &=q_3 r_2 + r_3 \\\\\n&\\,\\,\\,\\vdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf ''a'' is smaller than ''b'', the first step of the algorithm swaps the numbers. For example, if ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'', the initial quotient ''q''<sub>0</sub> equals zero, and the remainder ''r''<sub>0</sub> is ''a''. Thus, ''r''<sub>''k''</sub> is smaller than its predecessor ''r''<sub>''k''\u22121</sub> for all ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0.\n\nSince the remainders decrease with every step but can never be negative, a remainder ''r''<sub>''N''</sub> must eventually equal zero, at which point the algorithm stops.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=18}}</ref> The final nonzero remainder ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> is the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. The number ''N'' cannot be infinite because there are only a finite number of nonnegative integers between the initial remainder ''r''<sub>0</sub> and zero.\n\n===Proof of validity===\nThe validity of the Euclidean algorithm can be proven by a two-step argument.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|pp=16\u201320}}</ref> In the first step, the final nonzero remainder ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> is shown to divide both ''a'' and ''b''. Since it is a common divisor, it must be less than or equal to the greatest common divisor ''g''. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', including ''g'', must divide ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>; therefore, ''g'' must be less than or equal to ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''g''.\n\nTo demonstrate that ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> divides both ''a'' and ''b'' (the first step), ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> divides its predecessor ''r''<sub>''N''\u22122</sub>\n\n: {{math|1=''r''<sub>''N''\u22122</sub> = ''q''<sub>''N''</sub> ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>}}\n\nsince the final remainder ''r''<sub>''N''</sub> is zero. ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> also divides its next predecessor ''r''<sub>''N''\u22123</sub>\n\n: {{math|1=''r''<sub>''N''\u22123</sub> = ''q''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> ''r''<sub>''N''\u22122</sub> + ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>}}\n\nbecause it divides both terms on the right-hand side of the equation. Iterating the same argument, ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> divides all the preceding remainders, including ''a'' and ''b''. None of the preceding remainders ''r''<sub>''N''\u22122</sub>, ''r''<sub>''N''\u22123</sub>, etc. divide ''a'' and ''b'', since they leave a remainder. Since ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''g''.\n\nIn the second step, any natural number ''c'' that divides both ''a'' and ''b'' (in other words, any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'') divides the remainders ''r''<sub>''k''</sub>. By definition, ''a'' and ''b'' can be written as multiples of ''c'' : ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc'' and ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''nc'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are natural numbers. Therefore, ''c'' divides the initial remainder ''r''<sub>0</sub>, since ''r''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sub>0</sub>''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sub>0</sub>''nc''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''m''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''q''<sub>0</sub>''n'')''c''. An analogous argument shows that ''c'' also divides the subsequent remainders ''r''<sub>1</sub>, ''r''<sub>2</sub>, etc. Therefore, the greatest common divisor ''g'' must divide ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>, which implies that ''g''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>. Since the first part of the argument showed the reverse (''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''g''), it follows that ''g''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>. Thus, ''g'' is the greatest common divisor of all the succeeding pairs:<ref>{{harvnb|Knuth|1997}}, p. 320</ref><ref name=\"Lovasz_2003\">{{cite book | last1 = Lov\u00e1sz |first1=L.|author1-link=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz|last2= Pelik\u00e1n|first2=J.|last3=Vesztergombi|first3= K. |author3-link= Katalin Vesztergombi | year = 2003 | title = Discrete Mathematics: Elementary and Beyond | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York | isbn = 0-387-95584-4 | pages = 100\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n: {{math|1=''g'' = gcd(''a'', ''b'') = gcd(''b'', ''r''<sub>0</sub>) = gcd(''r''<sub>0</sub>, ''r''<sub>1</sub>) = \u2026 = gcd(''r''<sub>''N''\u22122</sub>, ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>) = ''r''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub>.}}\n\n===Worked example===\n[[File:Euclidean algorithm 1071 462.gif|upright|thumb|alt=Animation in which progressively smaller square tiles are added to cover a rectangle completely.|Subtraction-based animation of the Euclidean algorithm.

To begin, multiples of 462 are subtracted from 1071 until the remainder is less than 462.

The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the dimensions of the original rectangle.

After that ''r''<sub>''k''</sub> and ''r''<sub>''k''\u22121</sub> are exchanged and the process is iterated. Euclidean division reduces all the steps between two exchanges into a single step, which is thus more efficient. Moreover, the quotients are not needed, thus one may replace Euclidean division by the [[modulo operation]], which gives only the remainder. Thus the iteration of the Euclidean algorithm becomes simply\n\n: {{math|1=''r''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''r''<sub>''k''\u22122</sub> mod ''r''<sub>''k''\u22121</sub>.}}\n\n===Implementations===\nImplementations of the algorithm may be expressed in [[pseudocode]].

[[B\u00e9zout's identity]], and therefore the previous algorithm, can both be generalized to the context of [[Euclidean domain]]s.\n\n===Principal ideals and related problems===\nB\u00e9zout's identity provides yet another definition of the greatest common divisor ''g'' of two numbers ''a'' and ''b''.<ref name=\"Leveque_p33\" >{{Harvnb|LeVeque|1996|p=33}}</ref> Consider the set of all numbers ''ua''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''vb'', where ''u'' and ''v'' are any two integers. Since ''a'' and ''b'' are both divisible by ''g'', every number in the set is divisible by ''g''. In other words, every number of the set is an integer multiple of ''g''. This is true for every common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''. However, unlike other common divisors, the greatest common divisor is a member of the set; by B\u00e9zout's identity, choosing ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''s'' and ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t'' gives ''g''. A smaller common divisor cannot be a member of the set, since every member of the set must be divisible by ''g''. Conversely, any multiple ''m'' of ''g'' can be obtained by choosing ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ms'' and ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mt'', where ''s'' and ''t'' are the integers of B\u00e9zout's identity. This may be seen by multiplying B\u00e9zout's identity by ''m'',\n\n: {{math|1=''mg'' = ''msa'' + ''mtb''.}}\n\nTherefore, the set of all numbers ''ua''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''vb'' is equivalent to the set of multiples ''m'' of ''g''. In other words, the set of all possible sums of integer multiples of two numbers (''a'' and ''b'') is equivalent to the set of multiples of gcd(''a'', ''b''). The GCD is said to be the generator of the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of ''a'' and ''b''. This GCD definition led to the modern [[abstract algebra]]ic concepts of a [[principal ideal]] (an ideal generated by a single element) and a [[principal ideal domain]] (a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] in which every ideal is a principal ideal).\n\nCertain problems can be solved using this result.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=23}}</ref> For example, consider two measuring cups of volume ''a'' and ''b''. By adding/subtracting ''u'' multiples of the first cup and ''v'' multiples of the second cup, any volume ''ua''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''vb'' can be measured out. These volumes are all multiples of ''g''&nbsp;=&nbsp;gcd(''a'',&nbsp;''b'').\n\n===Extended Euclidean algorithm===\n{{Main|Extended Euclidean algorithm}}\n\nThe integers ''s'' and ''t'' of B\u00e9zout's identity can be computed efficiently using the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].

If another number ''w'' also divides ''L'' but is coprime with ''u'', then ''w'' must divide ''v'', by the following argument: If the greatest common divisor of ''u'' and ''w'' is 1, then integers ''s'' and ''t'' can be found such that\n\n: {{math|1=1 = ''su'' + ''tw''&nbsp;.}}\n\nby B\u00e9zout's identity. Multiplying both sides by ''v'' gives the relation\n\n: {{math|1=''v'' = ''suv'' + ''twv'' = ''sL'' + ''twv''&nbsp;.}}\n\nSince ''w'' divides both terms on the right-hand side, it must also divide the left-hand side, ''v''. This result is known as [[Euclid's lemma]].<ref name=\"Ore, p. 44\">{{Harvnb|Ore|1948|p=44}}</ref> Specifically, if a prime number divides ''L'', then it must divide at least one factor of ''L''. Conversely, if a number ''w'' is coprime to each of a series of numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, then ''w'' is also coprime to their product, ''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''a''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.<ref name=\"Ore, p. 44\"/>\n\nEuclid's lemma suffices to prove that every number has a unique factorization into prime numbers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|pp=281\u2013292}}</ref> To see this, assume the contrary, that there are two independent factorizations of ''L'' into ''m'' and ''n'' prime factors, respectively\n\n: {{math|1=''L'' = ''p''<sub>1</sub>''p''<sub>2</sub>\u2026''p''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>2</sub>\u2026''q''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;.}}\n\nSince each prime ''p'' divides ''L'' by assumption, it must also divide one of the ''q'' factors; since each ''q'' is prime as well, it must be that ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''. Iteratively dividing by the ''p'' factors shows that each ''p'' has an equal counterpart ''q''; the two prime factorizations are identical except for their order. The unique factorization of numbers into primes has many applications in mathematical proofs, as shown below.\n\n===Linear Diophantine equations===\n[[File:Diophante Bezout.svg|thumb|alt=\"A diagonal line running from the upper left corner to the lower right.

Both terms in ''ax''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''by'' are divisible by ''g''; therefore, ''c'' must also be divisible by ''g'', or the equation has no solutions. By dividing both sides by ''c''/''g'', the equation can be reduced to Bezout's identity\n\n: {{math|1=''sa'' + ''tb'' = ''g''}}\n\nwhere ''s'' and ''t'' can be found by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=108\u2013109}}</ref> This provides one solution to the Diophantine equation, ''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''s'' (''c''/''g'') and ''y''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t'' (''c''/''g'').\n\nIn general, a linear Diophantine equation has no solutions, or an infinite number of solutions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosen|2000|pp=120\u2013121}}</ref> To find the latter, consider two solutions, (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) and (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>), where\n\n: {{math|1=''ax''<sub>1</sub> + ''by''<sub>1</sub> = ''c'' = ''ax''<sub>2</sub> + ''by''<sub>2</sub>}}\n\nor equivalently\n\n: {{math|1=''a''(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''x''<sub>2</sub>) = ''b''(''y''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''y''<sub>1</sub>).}}\n\nTherefore, the smallest difference between two ''x'' solutions is ''b''/''g'', whereas the smallest difference between two ''y'' solutions is ''a''/''g''.

If the solutions are required to be ''positive'' integers (''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0,&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0), only a finite number of solutions may be possible. This restriction on the acceptable solutions allows some systems of Diophantine equations with more unknowns than equations to have a finite number of solutions;<ref>{{Harvnb|Stark|1978|p=47}}</ref> this is impossible for a [[system of linear equations]] when the solutions can be any [[real number]] (see [[Underdetermined system]]).\n\n===Multiplicative inverses and the RSA algorithm===\nA [[finite field]] is a set of numbers with four generalized operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as [[commutativity]], [[associativity]] and [[distributivity]]. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;\u2026,&nbsp;12} using [[modular arithmetic]]. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced [[modulo operation|modulo]] 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0\u201312. For example, the result of 5&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;35&nbsp;mod&nbsp;13&nbsp;=&nbsp;9. Such finite fields can be defined for any prime ''p''; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also be defined for any power ''m'' of a prime ''p''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup>. Finite fields are often called [[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]] fields, and are abbreviated as GF(''p'') or GF(''p''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup>).\n\nIn such a field with ''m'' numbers, every nonzero element ''a'' has a unique [[modular multiplicative inverse]], ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> such that {{nowrap|1=''aa''<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>''a''&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''m''.}} This inverse can be found by solving the congruence equation ''ax''&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''m'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=107\u2013109}}</ref> or the equivalent linear Diophantine equation<ref>{{Harvnb|Stillwell|1997|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref>\n\n: {{math|1=''ax'' + ''my'' = 1.}}\n\nThis equation can be solved by the Euclidean algorithm, as described [[#Linear Diophantine equations|above]]. Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the [[RSA algorithm]], which is widely used in [[electronic commerce]]; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|p=134}}</ref> Note that although the RSA algorithm uses [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] rather than fields, the Euclidean algorithm can still be used to find a multiplicative inverse where one exists. The Euclidean algorithm also has other applications in [[error-correcting code]]s; for example, it can be used as an alternative to the [[Berlekamp\u2013Massey algorithm]] for decoding [[BCH code|BCH]] and [[Reed\u2013Solomon code]]s, which are based on Galois fields.<ref>{{cite book|title=Error Correction Coding: Mathematical Methods and Algorithms|page=266|first=T.

Instead of representing an integer by its digits, it may be represented by its remainders ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> modulo a set of ''N'' coprime numbers ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>:<ref>{{Harvnb|Schroeder|2005|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nx_1 & \\equiv x \\pmod {m_1} \\\\\nx_2 & \\equiv x \\pmod {m_2} \\\\\n& \\,\\,\\,\\vdots \\\\\nx_N & \\equiv x \\pmod {m_N} \\,.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe goal is to determine ''x'' from its ''N'' remainders ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>. The solution is to combine the multiple equations into a single linear Diophantine equation with a much larger modulus ''M'' that is the product of all the individual moduli ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>, and define ''M''<sub>''i''</sub> as\n\n: <math> M_i = \\frac M {m_i}. </math>\n\nThus, each ''M''<sub>''i''</sub> is the product of all the moduli ''except'' ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>. The solution depends on finding ''N'' new numbers ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> such that\n\n: <math> M_i h_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod {m_i} \\,. </math>\n\nWith these numbers ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>, any integer ''x'' can be reconstructed from its remainders ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> by the equation\n\n: <math> x \\equiv (x_1 M_1 h_1 + x_2 M_2 h_2 + \\cdots + x_N M_N h_N) \\pmod M \\,.</math>\n\nSince these numbers ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> are the multiplicative inverses of the ''M''<sub>''i''</sub>, they may be found using Euclid's algorithm as described in the previous subsection.\n\n===Stern\u2013Brocot tree===\n{{main|Stern\u2013Brocot tree}}\nThe Euclidean algorithm can be used to arrange the set of all positive [[rational number]]s into an infinite [[binary search tree]], called the [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]].\nThe number 1 (expressed as a fraction 1/1) is placed at the root of the tree, and the location of any other number ''a''/''b'' can be found by computing gcd(''a'',''b'') using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether ''a''/''b'' is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number ''a''/''b''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concrete mathematics|page=123|author1-link=Ronald Graham|last1=Graham|first1=R.|author2-link=Donald Knuth|last2=Knuth|first2=D.

Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as [[commutative property|commutativity]], [[associative property|associativity]] and [[distributive property|distributivity]].\n\nThe generalized Euclidean algorithm requires a ''Euclidean function'', i.e., a mapping {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|R}} into the set of nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} in {{mvar|R}}, there exist {{mvar|q}} and {{mvar|r}} in {{mvar|R}} such that {{math|1=''a'' = ''qb'' + ''r''}} and {{math|''f''(''r'') &lt; ''f''(''b'')}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Concrete Abstract Algebra: From Numbers to Gr\u00f6bner Bases|first=Niels|last=Lauritzen|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521534109|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BdAbcje-TZUC&pg=PA130|ref=harv}}</ref> An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers [[#Gaussian integers|above]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&nbsp;132</ref> The function {{mvar|f}} can be the magnitude of the number or the [[degree of a polynomial]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&nbsp;161</ref> The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces ''f'' inexorably; hence, if {{mvar|f}} can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps.

Any Euclidean domain is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD), although the converse is not true.<ref name=\"sharpe\"/> The Euclidean domains and the UFD's are subclasses of the [[GCD domain]]s, domains in which a greatest common divisor of two numbers always exists.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987}}, p.&nbsp;52</ref> In other words, a greatest common divisor may exist (for all pairs of elements in a domain), although it may not be possible to find it using a Euclidean algorithm. A Euclidean domain is always a [[principal ideal domain]] (PID), an [[integral domain]] in which every [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is a [[principal ideal]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|2003}}, p.&nbsp;131</ref> Again, the converse is not true: not every PID is a Euclidean domain.\n\nThe unique factorization of Euclidean domains is useful in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all [[Pythagorean triple]]s and in proving [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]].<ref name=\"Stillwell_2003\" /> Unique factorization was also a key element in an attempted proof of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] published in 1847 by Gabriel Lam\u00e9, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on a suggestion of [[Joseph Liouville]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Lam\u00e9 |first=G. |authorlink=Gabriel Lam\u00e9| year = 1847 | title = M\u00e9moire sur la r\u00e9solution, en nombres complexes, de l'\u00e9quation A<sup>n</sup> + B<sup>n</sup> + C<sup>n</sup> = 0 | journal = J.

Although this approach succeeds for some values of {{mvar|n}} (such as {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the [[Eisenstein integer]]s), in general such numbers do {{em|not}} factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some [[cyclotomic field]]s led [[Ernst Kummer]] to the concept of [[ideal number]]s and, later, [[Richard Dedekind]] to [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]].<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician) | last=Edwards|first=H.|title=Fermat's last theorem: a genetic introduction to algebraic number theory|year=2000|publisher=Springer|page=76}}</ref>\n\n====Unique factorization of quadratic integers====\n\n[[File:Eisenstein primes.svg|thumb|alt=\"A set of dots lying within a circle.

Quadratic integers are generalizations of the Gaussian integers in which the [[imaginary unit]] ''i'' is replaced by a number {{mvar|\u03c9}}. Thus, they have the form {{math|''u'' + ''v\u03c9''}}, where {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} are integers and {{mvar|\u03c9}} has one of two forms, depending on a parameter {{mvar|D}}.

Similarly, they have a common left divisor if {{math|1=''\u03b1'' = ''\u03b4\u03be''}} and {{math|1=''\u03b2'' = ''\u03b4\u03b7''}} for some choice of {{mvar|\u03be}} and {{mvar|\u03b7}} in the ring. Since multiplication is not commutative, there are two versions of the Euclidean algorithm, one for right divisors and one for left divisors.<ref name=\"stillwell151-152\"/> Choosing the right divisors, the first step in finding the {{math|gcd(''\u03b1'', ''\u03b2'')}} by the Euclidean algorithm can be written\n\n:<math>\\rho_0 = \\alpha - \\psi_0\\beta = (\\xi - \\psi_0\\eta)\\delta,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>0</sub>}} represents the quotient and {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub>}} the remainder. This equation shows that any common right divisor of {{mvar|\u03b1}} and {{mvar|\u03b2}} is likewise a common divisor of the remainder {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub>}}. The analogous equation for the left divisors would be\n\n:<math>\\rho_0 = \\alpha - \\beta\\psi_0 = \\delta(\\xi - \\eta\\psi_0).</math>\n\nWith either choice, the process is repeated as above until the greatest common right or left divisor is identified. As in the Euclidean domain, the \"size\" of the remainder {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub>}} must be strictly smaller than {{mvar|\u03b2}}, and there must be only a finite number of possible sizes for {{math|''\u03c1''<sub>0</sub>}}, so that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate.<ref name=\"entgtrg\">{{cite book|title=Elementary Number Theory, Group Theory and Ramanujan Graphs|volume=55|series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts|first1=Giuliana|last1=Davidoff|first2=Peter|last2=Sarnak|first3=Alain|last3=Valette|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=9780521531436|contribution=2.6 The Arithmetic of Integer Quaternions|pages=59\u201370|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlvfFDJOGZ8C&pg=PA59}}</ref>\n\nMost of the results for the GCD carry over to noncommutative numbers.

It uses [[numerical weather prediction]] methods to prepare forecasts and their initial conditions, and it contributes to monitoring the relevant parts of the Earth system.\n\n== Work and projects ==\n\n=== Forecasting ===\n[[Numerical weather prediction]] (NWP) requires input of meteorological data, collected by satellites and [[earth observation]] systems such as automatic and manned stations, aircraft, ships and [[weather balloon]]s.  [[data assimilation|Assimilation of this data]] is used to produce an initial state of a computer model of the atmosphere, from which an [[atmospheric model]] is used to forecast the weather. These forecasts are typically:\n* medium-range forecasts, predicting the weather up to 15 days ahead\n* monthly forecasts, predicting the weather on a weekly basis 30 days ahead\n* seasonal forecasts up to 12 months ahead.\n\nOver the past three decades ECMWF's wide-ranging programme of research has played a major role in developing such assimilation and modelling systems. This improves the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting by about a day per decade, so that a seven-day forecast now (2015) is as accurate as a three-day forecast was four decades ago (1975).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1520769/the-forecast-for-weather-technology |title=The Forecast For Weather Technology |publisher=Sky News |date=2015-07-17 |accessdate=2016-01-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Monthly and seasonal forecasts ===\nECMWF's monthly and seasonal forecasts provide early predictions of events such as [[heat wave]]s, cold spells and droughts, as well as their impacts on sectors such as agriculture, energy and health. Since ECMWF runs a wave model, there are also predictions of coastal waves and storm surges in European waters which can be used to provide warnings.\n\n=== Early warning of severe weather events ===\nForecasts of severe weather events allow appropriate mitigating action to be taken and contingency plans to be put into place by the authorities and the public. The increased time gained by issuing accurate warnings can save lives, for instance by evacuating people from a [[storm surge]] area. Authorities and businesses can plan to maintain services around threats such as high winds, floods or snow.\n\nIn October 2012 the ECMWF model suggested seven days in advance that [[Hurricane Sandy]] was likely to make landfall on the [[East Coast of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web |title=How Math helped forecast Hurricane Sandy |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=how-math-helped-forecast-superstorm-sandy |last1=Roulstone |first1=Ian |last2=Norbury |first2=John |publisher=Scientific American |date=25 July 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>\nIt also predicted the intensity and track of the [[November 2012 nor'easter]], which impacted the east coast a week after Sandy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/moderatestrength-noreaster-may-hit-sandydevastated-areas-wednesday|title=Moderate-strength Nor'easter may hit Sandy-devastated areas Wednesday {{!}} Category 6\u2122|website=www.wunderground.com|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\nECMWF's Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) was developed as a tool to identify where the EPS forecast distribution differs substantially from that of the model climate{{clarify|date=January 2016}}. It contains information regarding variability of weather parameters, in location and time and can highlight an abnormality of a weather situation without having to define specific space- and time-dependent thresholds.\n\n=== Satellite data ===\n{{peacock|section|date=February 2015}}\nECMWF, through its partnerships with EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU and the European Science community has established a leading position for Europe in the exploitation of satellite data for operational numerical weather prediction, and for operational seasonal forecasting with coupled atmosphere-ocean-land models. The increasing amount of satellite data and the development of more sophisticated ways of extraction information from that data have made a major contribution to improving the accuracy and utility of NWP forecasts.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} ECMWF continuously endeavours to improve the use of satellite observations for NWP.\n\n=== Reanalysis ===\n{{main article|ECMWF re-analysis}}\n{{peacock|section|date=February 2015}}\nECMWF makes significant contributions to support research on climate variability, pioneering an approach known as [[meteorological reanalysis|reanalysis]].  This involves feeding weather observations collected over decades into a NWP system to recreate past atmospheric, sea- and land-surface conditions over specific time periods to obtain a clearer picture of how the climate has changed. Reanalysis provides a four-dimensional picture of the atmosphere and effectively allows monitoring of the variability and change of global climate, thereby contributing also to the understanding and attribution of climate change.\n\nTo date, and with support from Europe's National Meteorological Services and the European Commission, ECMWF has conducted two major reanalyses of the global atmosphere: the first [[ECMWF re-analysis]] (ERA-15) project generated reanalyses from December 1978 to February 1994; the [[ERA-40]] project generated reanalyses from September 1957 to August 2002.\n\n=== Operational forecast model ===\n{{main article|Integrated Forecast System}}\nECMWF's operational forecasts are produced from its \"[[Integrated Forecast System]]\" (sometimes informally known in the United States as the \"European model\") which is run every twelve hours and forecasts out to ten days.\n\nIt includes both in a \"deterministic forecast\" mode and as an [[ensemble forecasting|ensemble]]. The deterministic forecast is a single model run that is relatively high in both resolution but also in computational expense. The ensemble is relatively low (about half that of the deterministic) in resolution and so in computational expense, so less accurate. But it is run 51 times in parallel, from slightly different initial conditions to give a spread of likelihood over the range of the forecast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/modelling-and-prediction |title=Modelling and Prediction |publisher=ECMWF |accessdate=2016-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[EUMETNET]]\n*[[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites|EUMETSAT]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book| title=Medium-Range Weather Prediction \u2013 the European Approach | last=Woods | first=Austin | publisher=Springer | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-387-26928-3}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official Website}}\n* ECMWF Re-analysis (ERA)\n:: {{cite web |url= http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/ERA-15/index.html |title= ERA-15 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= Aug 11, 2004 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040811190105/http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/ERA-15/index.html }}\n:: {{cite web |url= http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/Project/index.html |title= ERA-40 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= Aug 11, 2004 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040811192422/http://www.ecmwf.int/research/era/Project/index.html }}\n* [http://www.top500.org/site/47752 ECMWF] on [[TOP500]]\n\n\n{{National Meteorological Organisations}}\n{{Major Scientific Research Facilities based in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Atmospheric, Oceanographic and Climate Models}}\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:European Centre For Medium-Range Weather Forecasts}}\n[[Category:1975 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Climate of Europe]]\n[[Category:Climate of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:European research networks]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1975]]\n[[Category:Governmental meteorological agencies in Europe]]\n[[Category:Information technology organisations in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Meteorological institutions and stations]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Reading, Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Research institutes established in 1975]]\n[[Category:Research institutes in Berkshire]]\n[[Category:Borough of Wokingham]]", "sha1": "8v5i9n71icxqksoars7te2me6q4y8ui"}}, {"title": "European Broadcasting Union", "ns": "0", "id": "10380", "revision": {"id": "865956677", "parentid": "857689132", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T08:38:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ariso Light", "id": "26370063"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|EBU}}\n{{merge from|EBU R128|discuss=Talk:European Broadcasting Union#Merger proposal|date=June 2018}}\n{{EngvarB|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Organization\n|name = European Broadcasting Union<br />Union europ\u00e9enne de radio-t\u00e9l\u00e9vision\n|image = European Broadcasting Union logo.svg\n|map = EBU Member Elliptic.svg\n|mcaption = Countries with one or more members are in dark blue.

It fostered programming exchanges between members and mediated technical disputes between members that were mostly concerned with frequency and interference issues. It was in effect taken over by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and when the conflict ended in the eyes of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] it was a compromised organisation that they could not trust.\n\nIn the spring of 1946, representatives of the Soviet radio committee proposed forming a new organisation; however, at the same time preparations were being made for an inter-governmental \u201cEuropean Broadcasting Conference\u201d (EBC) in [[Copenhagen]] in 1948 to draw up a new plan for frequency use in the European Broadcasting Area (EBA). It was considered necessary to have an organisation that could implement the \u201cCopenhagen Wavelength Plan\u201d but there was disagreement among broadcasters and particularly a fear expressed by the [[BBC]] that a new association might be dominated by the USSR and its proposal to give each of its [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent states]] one vote. France proposed that it would have four votes with the inclusion of [[List of French possessions and colonies|its North African colonies]]. Great Britain felt it would have little influence with just one vote.\n\nOn 27 June 1946 the alternative [[International Radio and Television Organisation|International Broadcasting Organisation]] (IBO) was founded with 26 members and without British participation. The following day the IBU met in General Assembly and an attempt was made to dissolve it but failed; though 18 of its 28 members left to join the IBO.<ref name=\"ebu.ch\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf|title=50 years of Eurovision (1954-2004)|last=(EBU)|first=European Broadcasting Union|website=www.ebu.ch}}</ref> For a period of time in the late 1940s both the IBU and IBO vied for the role of organising frequencies but Britain decided to be in involved in neither. The BBC attempted but failed to find suitable working arrangements with them. However, for practical purposes the IBO rented the IBU technical centre in Brussels and employed its staff. The BBC then proposed a new solution based on the IBO changing its constitution so there will be only one member per ITU country, thus ensuring a Western majority over the USSR and its satellite states. In August 1949 a meeting took place in [[Stresa]], Italy but it resulted in disagreement between delegates on how to resolve the problems. One proposal was for the European Broadcasting Area to be replaced by one that would exclude Eastern Europe, the [[Levant]] and North Africa.\n\nAfter Stresa, a consensus emerged among the Western Europeans to form a new organisation and the BBC proposed it be based in London. Meetings in Paris on 31 October and 1 November 1949 sealed the fate of the IBU and IBO, but it was decided not to allow [[West Germany]] to be a founder of the new organisation. On 13 February 1950 the European Broadcasting Union had its first meeting with 23 members from the ITU defined European Broadcasting Area at the Imperial Hotel in [[Torquay]], England. The first president was Ian Jacob of the BBC who remained at the helm for 10 years while its operation was largely dominated by the BBC due to its financial, technical and staff input. The most important difference between the EBU and its predecessors was that EBU membership was for broadcasters and not governments. Early delegates said EBU meetings were cordial and professional and very different from the abrupt tone of its predecessors. West Germany was admitted in 1951 and a working relationship forged with the USSR\u2019s Organisation for International Radio and TV (OIRT) which existed in parallel with the EBU until its merger in 1993.

This includes provision of technical information to Members via conferences and workshops, as well as in written form (such as the [https://tech.ebu.ch/techreview EBU Technical Review], and the [https://tech.ebu.ch/publications/tech-i EBU tech-''i''] magazine).\n\nThe EBU also encourages active collaboration between its Members on the basis that they can freely share their knowledge and experience, thus achieving considerably more than individual Members could achieve by themselves. Much of this collaboration is achieved through Project Groups which study specific technical issues of common interest: for example, EBU Members have long been preparing for the revision of the 1961 Stockholm Plan.\n\nThe EBU places great emphasis on the use of open standards. Widespread use of open standards (such as [[MPEG-2]], [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]], [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], etc.) ensures interoperability between products from different vendors, as well as facilitating the exchange of programme material between EBU Members and promoting \"horizontal markets\" for the benefit of all consumers.\n\nEBU Members and the EBU Technical Department have long played an important role in the development of many systems used in radio and television broadcasting, such as:\n*The AES/EBU digital audio interface, formally known as [[AES3]];\n*Serial and parallel interfaces for digital video ([[ITU-R]] Recommendations 601 and 656);\n*[[Radio Data System|RDS]] \u2013 the radio data system used on FM broadcasting.\n*[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf The EBU Loudness Recommendation R 128] and 'EBU Mode' meters ([https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341])\n\nThe EBU has also actively encouraged the development and implementation of:\n\n*[[Digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) through Eureka Project 147 and the WorldDAB Forum.\n*[[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) through the DVB Project and DigiTAG.\n*Digital radio in the bands currently used for AM broadcasting through [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] (Digital Radio Mondiale).\n*Standardisation of [[Digital video recorder|PVR]] systems through the [[TV-Anytime]] Forum.\n*Development of other content distribution networks on the internet through P2PTV; EBU Project Group D/P2P, from November 2007 to April 2008, with a trial of selected member channels, thanks to Octoshape's distribution platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.ch/members/EBU_Media_portal_update2.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211122659/http://www.ebu.ch/members/EBU_Media_portal_update2.php|archivedate=2012-02-11|title=P2P Media Portal Trial|date=10 July 2008|publisher=EBU|accessdate=2008-07-10}}</ref> The EBU is also part of the European P2P-Next project.\n\n==Greek state broadcaster controversy of 2013==\nOn 11 June 2013, the Greek government shut down the state broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation|ERT]], at short notice, citing government spending concerns related to the [[European debt crisis|Euro crisis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/132876/article/ekathimerini/news/greek-public-broadcaster-ert-to-be-shut-down-reopened-with-fewer-employees|title=Greek public broadcaster ERT to be shut down, reopened with fewer employees|publisher=ekathimerini.com|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> In response, the European Broadcasting Union set up a makeshift studio on the same day, near the former ERT offices in Athens, in order to continue providing EBU Members with the news-gathering and broadcast relay services which had formerly been provided by ERT.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/12/ert-shutdown-european-broadcasting-union-makeshift-studio-greece|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|title=ERT (Greek state broadcaster), Media, Television industry (Media), Radio industry (Media), Greece (News), Europe (News), World news, Digital media, Internet, Social media|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe EBU put out a statement expressing its \"profound dismay\" at the shutdown, urged the [[Prime Minister of Greece|Greek Prime Minister]] \"to use all his powers to immediately reverse this decision\" and offered the \"advice, assistance and expertise necessary for ERT to be preserved\".<ref>[https://www.ebu.ch/cms/en/sites/ebu/contents/news/2013/06/ebu-urges-greek-government-to-re.html EBU urges Greek government to reverse decision on ERT].

ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used.\n\nThe technology has been under development since the mid-1980s and at present is actively being researched in the United States by the [[Army Research Laboratory]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]] and defense industry contractors, including [[FMC Corporation]], [[General Dynamics Land Systems]], [[Olin Corporation|Olin Ordnance]], and [[Soreq Nuclear Research Center]].<ref>Taulbee, Steve (1993). [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2979777;view=1up;seq=7 ARL Ballistics Research], U.S. Army Research Laboratory, p. 5.</ref>  It is possible that electrothermal-chemical gun propulsion will be an integral part of US Army's future combat system and those of other countries such as [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  \nElectrothermal-chemical technology is part of a broad research and development program that encompasses all electric gun technology, such as [[railgun]]s and [[coil gun]]s.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Image:XM360.png|right|thumb|305px|The XM360.]]\n\nThe constant battle between [[vehicle armour|armour]] and armor-piercing round has led to continuous development of the main battle tank design. The evolution of American anti-tank weapons can be traced back to requirements to combat [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] tanks.  In the late 1980s, it was thought that the protection level of the Future Soviet Tank (FST) could exceed 700&nbsp;mm of rolled homogeneous armour equivalence at its maximum thickness, which was effectively immune against the contemporary [[M829|M-829]] [[kinetic energy penetrator|armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot]].<ref>Ropelewski, ''Soviet Gains in Armor/Antiarmor Shape US Army Master Plan'', p.69</ref>  In the 1980s the most immediate method available to NATO to counter Soviet advances in armour technology was the adoption of a 140&nbsp;mm main gun, but this required a redesigned turret that could incorporate the larger breech and ammunition, and it also required some sort of automatic loader.<ref>Schemmer, ''Army, SecDef's Office at Loggerheads over Antiarmor'', p.53</ref> Although the 140&nbsp;mm gun was considered a real interim solution it was decided after the fall of the Soviet Union that the increase in muzzle energy it provided was not worth the increase in weight. Resources were therefore spent on research into other programs that could provide the needed muzzle energy. One of the most successful alternative technologies remains electrothermal-chemical ignition.\n\nMost proposed advances in gun technology are based on the assumption that the solid propellant as a stand-alone propulsion system is no longer capable of delivering the required muzzle energy.  This requirement has been underscored by the appearance of the Russian [[T-90]] main battle tank.  Even the elongation of current gun tubes, such as the new German 120&nbsp;mm L/55,<ref>The length of the cannon can be found by multiplying the diameter of the barrel and the caliber length.  For example, the M256, which is a 120 mm L/44, has a total length of 5.28 m, while the 120 mm L/55 has a total length of 6.6 m.</ref> which was introduced by Rheinmetall is considered only an interim solution as it does not offer the required increase in muzzle velocity.<ref>Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p. 29</ref>  Even advanced kinetic energy ammunition such as the United States' [[M-829A3]] is considered only an interim solution against future threats.<ref>Pengelley, ''The new era in tank main armament'', p.1522</ref> To that extent the solid propellant is considered to have reached the end of its usefulness, although it will remain the principal propulsion method for at least the next decade{{clarify|date=July 2015}} until newer technologies mature.<ref>Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p.30</ref>  To improve on the capabilities of a solid propellant weapon the electrothermal-chemical gun may see production as early as 2016.<ref>Kruse, ''Studies on Germany's Future 140 mm Tank Gun System'', p. 1</ref>\n\nETC technology offers a medium-risk upgrade and is developed to the point that further improvements are so minor that it can be considered mature.{{cn|date=July 2015}}  The lightweight American 120&nbsp;mm XM-291 came close to achieving 17 MJ of muzzle energy, which is the lower-end muzzle energy spectrum for a 140&nbsp;mm gun.<ref>Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.5</ref>  However, the success of the XM-291 does not imply the success of ETC technology as there are key parts of the propulsion system that are not yet understood or fully developed, such as the plasma ignition process.  Nevertheless, there is substantial existing evidence that ETC technology is viable and worth the money to continue development.  Furthermore, it can be integrated into current gun systems.<ref>Sauerwein, ''Rheinmetall's NPzK''</ref>\n\n== How it works ==\n[[Image:ETC.png|right|thumb|305px|A diagram of a working electrothermal-chemical gun.]]\n\nAn electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma cartridge to ignite and control the ammunition's propellant, using electrical energy as a catalyst to begin the process.  Originally researched by Dr. Jon Parmentola for the U.S. Army, it has grown into a very plausible successor to a standard solid propellant tank gun.  Since the beginning of research the United States has funded the XM-291 gun project with USD 4,000,000, basic research with USD 300,000, and applied research with USD 600,000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  Since then it has been proven to work, although efficiency to the level required has not yet been accomplished.  ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used.  It will also reduce pressure placed on the barrel in comparison to alternative technologies that offer the same muzzle energy given the fact that it helps spread the propellant's gas much more smoothly during ignition.<ref>Hilmes, ''Aspects of future MBT conception''</ref>  Currently, there are two principal methods of plasma initiation: the flashboard large area emitter (FLARE) and the triple coaxial plasma igniter (TCPI).\n\n=== Flashboard large area emitter ===\nFlashboards run in several parallel strings to provide a large area of plasma or ultraviolet radiation and uses the breakdown and vaporization of gaps of diamonds to produce the required plasma.  These parallel strings are mounted in tubes and oriented to have their gaps azimuthal to the tube's axis. It discharges by using high pressure air to move air out of the way.<ref>Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.11-12</ref>  FLARE initiators can ignite propellants through the release of plasma, or even through the use of ultraviolet heat radiation.<ref>Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'', p.13-15</ref>   The absorption length of a solid propellant is sufficient to be ignited by radiation from a plasma source.  However, FLARE has most likely not reached optimal design requirements and further understanding of FLARE and how it works is completely necessary to ensure the evolution of the technology.  If FLARE provided the XM-291 gun project with the sufficient radiative heat to ignite the propellant to achieve a muzzle energy of 17 MJ one could only imagine the possibilities with a fully developed FLARE plasma igniter.  Current areas of study include how plasma will affect the propellant through radiation, the deliverance of mechanical energy and heat directly and by driving gas flow.  Despite these daunting tasks FLARE has been seen as the most plausible igniter for future application on ETC guns.<ref>For further technical information on FLARE ''see:'' P. Diamond</ref>\n\n=== Triple coaxial plasma igniter ===\nA coaxial igniter consists of a fully insulated conductor, covered by four strips of aluminum foil.  All of this is further insulated in a tube about 1.6&nbsp;cm in diameter that is perforated with small holes.  The idea is to use an electrical flow through the conductor and then exploding the flow into vapor and then breaking it down into plasma.  Consequently, the plasma escapes through the constant perforations throughout the insulating tube and initiates the surrounding propellant.  A TCPI igniter is fitted in individual propellant cases for each piece of ammunition.  However, TCPI is no longer considered a viable method of propellant ignition because it may damage the fins and does not deliver energy as efficiently as a FLARE igniter.<ref>TCPI is also covered in ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study'' by P. Diamond</ref>\n\n== Feasibility ==\n[[Image:60mmETC.PNG|right|thumb|305px|The 60 mm ETC gun developed by the US Navy at FMC as an ETC CIWS proof of principle demonstrator.]]\n\nThe XM-291 is the best existing example of a working electrothermal-chemical gun.  It was an alternate technology to the heavier caliber 140&nbsp;mm gun by using the dual-caliber approach.  It uses a breech that is large enough to accept 140&nbsp;mm ammunition and be mounted with both a 120&nbsp;mm barrel and a 135&nbsp;mm or 140&nbsp;mm barrel.  The XM-291 also mounts a larger gun tube and a larger ignition chamber than the existing M256 L/44 main gun.<ref>Pengelley, ''A new era in tank main armament'', p. 1522</ref>  Through the application of electrothermal-chemical technology the XM-291 has been able to achieve muzzle energy outputs that equate that to a low-level 140&nbsp;mm gun, while achieving muzzle velocities greater than those of the larger 140&nbsp;mm gun.<ref>Sharoni, ''The Future Combat System'', p.31</ref>  Although the XM-291 does not mean that ETC technology is viable it does offer an example that it is possible.\n\nETC is also a more viable option than other alternatives by definition. ETC requires much less energy input from outside sources, like a battery, than a [[railgun]] or a [[coilgun]] would.  Tests have shown that energy output by the propellant is higher than energy input from outside sources on ETC guns.<ref>P. Diamond, ''Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study''</ref>  In comparison, a railgun currently cannot achieve a higher muzzle velocity than the amount of energy input.  Even at 50% efficiency a rail gun launching a projectile with a kinetic energy of 20 MJ would require an energy input into the rails of 40 MJ, and 50% efficiency has not yet been achieved.<ref>Horst, ''Recent Advances in Anti-Armor Technology'', p.6</ref>  To put this into perspective, a rail gun launching at 9 MJ of energy would need roughly 32 MJ worth of energy from capacitors.  Current advances in energy storage allow for energy densities as high as 2.5 MJ/dm\u00b3, which means that a battery delivering 32 MJ of energy would require a volume of 12.8 dm\u00b3 per shot; this is not a viable volume for use in a modern main battle tank, especially one designed to be lighter than existing models.<ref>Zahn, ''The Future Combat System: Minimizing Risk While Maximizing Capability'', p.20</ref>  There has even been discussion about eliminating the necessity for an outside electrical source in ETC ignition by initiating the plasma cartridge through a small explosive force.<ref>Yangmeng, ''A Novel Concept of Electrothermal Chemical Gun without Power Supply'', p.1</ref>\n\nFurthermore, ETC technology is not only applicable to solid propellants.  To increase muzzle velocity even further electrothermal-chemical ignition can work with liquid propellants, although this would require further research into plasma ignition.  ETC technology is also compatible with existing projects to reduce the amount of recoil delivered to the vehicle while firing.  Understandably, recoil of a gun firing a projectile at 17 MJ or more will increase directly with the increase in muzzle energy in accordance to [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's third law of motion]] and successful implementation of recoil reduction mechanisms will be vital to the installation of an ETC powered gun in an existing vehicle design.  For example, [[OTO Melara]]'s new lightweight 120&nbsp;mm L/45 gun has achieved a recoil force of 25 t by using a longer recoil mechanism (550&nbsp;mm) and a pepperpot muzzle brake.<ref>Hilmes, ''Arming Future MBTs'', p.79</ref>  Reduction in recoil can also be achieved through mass attenuation of the thermal sleeve.  The ability of ETC technology to be applied to existing gun designs means that for future gun upgrades there's no longer the necessity to redesign the turret to include a larger breech or caliber gun barrel.\n\nSeveral countries have already determined that ETC technology is viable for the future and have funded indigenous projects considerably.  These include the United States, Germany<ref>Hilmes, ''Modern German Tank Development'', p.20-21.</ref> and the United Kingdom, amongst others.  The United States' XM360, which is planned to equip the [[Future Combat Systems]] [[Mounted Combat System]] light tank and may be the [[M1 Abrams]]' next gun upgrade, is reportedly based on the XM291 and may include ETC technology, or portions of ETC technology. Tests of this gun have been performed using \"precision ignition\" technology, which may refer to ETC ignition.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite paper\n  | last = Diamond\n  | first = P.\n  | title = Electro Thermal Chemical Gun Technology Study\n  | publisher = The MITRE Corporation\n  | version =\n  | date = March 1999\n  | url = \n  | format = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Hilmes\n  | first = Rolf\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Arming Future MBTs - Some Considerations\n  | journal = Military Technology\n  | volume = \n  | issue = 12/2004\n  | publisher = Moench Verlagsgesellschaft Mbh\n  |date=December 2004\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Hilmes\n  | first = Rolf\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Aspects of future MBT conception\n  | journal = Military Technology\n  | volume = 23\n  | issue = 6\n  | publisher = Moench Verlagsgesellschaft Mbh\n  | date = June 30, 1999\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Hilmes\n  | first = Rolf\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Battle Tanks for the Bundeswehr: Modern German Tank Development, 1956-2000\n  | journal = Armor\n  | volume = \n  | issue = January\u2013February 2001\n  | publisher = Fort Knox: US Army Armor Center\n  | date = January 1, 2001\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | accessdate =\n  | issn = 0004-2420  }}\n* {{cite paper\n  | last= Horst\n  | first = Albert W. \n  | title = Recent advances in anti-armor technology\n  | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\n  | version =\n  | year = 1997\n  | url = \n  | format =\n  | accessdate =  |display-authors=etal}}\n* {{cite paper\n  | last= Kruse\n  | first = Dr. Josef\n  | title = Study on Germany's Future 140mm Tank Gun System - Conventional and ETC -\n  | version = \n  | publisher = Rheinmetall\n  | date = April 1999\n  | url = \n  | format = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Ogorkiewicz\n  | first = Richard M.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Future tank guns Part I: solid and liquid propellant guns\n  | journal = International Defense Review\n  | volume = \n  | issue = 12/1990\n  | publisher = Janes\n  |date=December 1990\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Pengelley\n  | first = Rupert\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = A new era in tank main armament: The options multiply\n  | journal = International Defense Review\n  | volume = \n  | issue = 11/1989\n  | publisher = Janes\n  |date=November 1989\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Ropelewski\n  | first = Robert R.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Soviet Gains in Armor/Antiarmor Shape US Army Master Plan\n  | journal = Armed Forces Journal International\n  | volume = \n  | issue = \n  | publisher = U.S. Army\n  |date=February 1989\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Schemmer\n  | first = Benjamin F.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Army, SecDef's Office at Loggerheads over Antiarmor\n  | journal = [[Armed Forces Journal International]]\n  | volume = \n  | issue = \n  | publisher = U.S. Army\n  |date=May 1989\n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate =  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Sharoni\n  | first = Asher H.\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Lawrence D.

Derived from the [[Boeing 707]], it provides all-weather surveillance, command, control, and communications, and is used by the [[United States Air Force]], [[NATO]], [[Royal Air Force]], [[French Air Force]], and [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]. The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating [[radar dome]] above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the US Air Force (USAF) was seeking an aircraft to replace its piston-engined [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star]], which had been in service for over a decade. After issuing preliminary development contracts to three companies, the USAF picked Boeing to construct two airframes to test Westinghouse Electric and [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes]]'s competing radars. Both radars used [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler technology]], with Westinghouse's design emerging as the contract winner. Testing on the first production E-3 began in October 1975.\n\nThe first USAF E-3 was delivered in March 1977, and during the next seven years, a total of 34 aircraft were manufactured. NATO, as a single identity, also had 18 aircraft manufactured, basing them in Germany. The E-3 was also sold to the United Kingdom (seven) and France (four) and [[Saudi Arabia]] (five, plus eight E-3-derived tanker aircraft). In 1991, when the last aircraft had been delivered, E-3s participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]], playing a crucial role of directing [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition]] aircraft against the enemy. Throughout the aircraft's service life, numerous upgrades were performed to enhance its capabilities. In 1996, Westinghouse Electric's Defense & Electronic Systems division, was acquired by Northrop Corporation before its being renamed [[Northrop Grumman Mission Systems]], which currently supports the E-3's radar.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1963, the USAF asked for proposals for an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) to replace its [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|EC-121 Warning Stars]], which had served in the [[airborne early warning]] role for over a decade.<ref>Wilson 1998, p.&nbsp;72.</ref> The new aircraft would take advantage of improvements in radar technology and in computer aided radar data analysis and data reduction.

Some of the parts to be removed are no longer on the market or have become very expensive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.e3a.nato.int/eng/html/stories/story_102.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630121739/http://www.e3a.nato.int/eng/html/stories/story_102.htm |archivedate=30 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvidshub.net/video/411646/nato-e-3a-arrives-davis-monthan-afb#.VZvF7vlVikq|title=A NATO E-3A Arrives at Davis-Monthan AFB|author=|date=|website=dvidshub.net|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 November 2015, an E-3G was deployed to the Middle East to begin \"immediately\" flying combat missions in support of [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] against ISIL, marking the first combat deployment of the upgraded AWAC Block 40/45.  The $2.7 billion development effort started in 2003, with the first five aircraft achieving initial operational capability (IOC) in July 2015.  The Block 40/45 upgrade is the most extensive the E-3 has undergone, replacing its 1970s computer technology with an early 2000s standard and including a deployable ground system that receives, processes, and disseminates data. The Air Force plans to convert 24 AWACS to E-3G standard, while retiring seven from the fleet to avoid upgrade costs and harvest out-of-production components.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-e-3g-makes-middle-east-combat-debut-419318/ Boeing E-3G makes Middle East combat debut] \u2013 Flightglobal.com, 19 November 2015</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:FAF9052 (F-UJCB) (15285956727).jpg|thumb|A French Air Force E-3F in 2014]]\n\n;EC-137D\n:Two prototype AWACS aircraft with JT3D engines, one fitted with a Westinghouse Electric radar and the other with a Hughes Aircraft Company radar.

Spyflight, June 2008.</ref>\n\n===Future===\nThe Air Force began an analysis of alternatives (AOA) in March 2010 for its next generation ground [[moving target indication]] (GMTI) radar aircraft fleet.  The study was completed in March 2012 and recommended buying a new business jet-based [[ISTAR#ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance)|ISR]] aircraft, such as an Air Force version of the Navy [[P-8 Poseidon]], and the [[RQ-4 Global Hawk|RQ-4B Global Hawk Block 40]].  However, at a [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] meeting on 20 March 2012, the Air Force said it cannot afford a new ISR platform.  The E-8 is considered viable in the near and medium terms.  As of October 2012, a test plane has had a [[Hewlett-Packard]] central computer installed, with work to begin on the rest in 2013.  Before the AOA started, Northrop Grumman received funds for two batches of new engines.  One set of engines has flown on a JSTARS test plane, and the other set is in storage.  The Air Force does not plan to replace the engines of the 16-plane fleet due to the fiscal environment.

The radome for the side-looking radar is visible under the forward fuselage.]]\nThe E-8C is an aircraft modified from the [[Boeing 707]]-300 series commercial airliner.  The E-8 carries specialized radar, communications, operations and control subsystems. The most prominent external feature is the 40&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) canoe-shaped radome under the forward fuselage that houses the 24&nbsp;ft (7.3&nbsp;m) APY-7 [[passive electronically scanned array]] [[Side looking airborne radar]] antenna.<ref name=\"USAF factsheet attribution\"/>\n\nThe E-8C can respond quickly and effectively to support worldwide military contingency operations. It is a jam-resistant system capable of operating while experiencing heavy [[electronic countermeasures]]. The E-8C can fly a mission profile for 9 hours without refueling. Its range and on-station time can be substantially increased through [[in-flight refueling]].\n\n===Radar and systems===\n[[File:Pave Mover Antenna Array, view 1, prototype for J-STARS antenna, Norden, 1981-1983 - National Electronics Museum - DSC00429.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pave Mover]] Radar, the prototype for the JSTARS radar]]\n[[File:E-8 crewmembers.JPG|thumb|Crew members uploading software onto an E-8 during preparations for a flight|alt=]]\n\nThe AN/APY-7 radar can operate in wide area surveillance, [[Moving target indication|ground moving target indicator]] (GMTI), fixed target indicator (FTI) target classification, and [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) modes.\n\nTo pick up moving targets, the [[Doppler radar]] looks at the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency shift of the returned signal. It can look from a long range, which the military refers to as a high standoff capability. The antenna can be tilted to either side of the aircraft for a 120-degree field of view covering nearly 50,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 (19,305 mile\u00b2) and can simultaneously track 600 targets at more than 250&nbsp;km (152 miles).<ref name=\"USAF factsheet attribution\"/> The GMTI modes cannot pick up objects that are too small, insufficiently dense, or stationary.  Data processing allows the APY-7 to differentiate between armored vehicles (tracked tanks) and trucks, allowing targeting personnel to better select the appropriate ordnance for various targets.\n\nThe system's SAR modes can produce images of stationary objects. Objects with many angles (for example, the interior of a pick-up bed) will give a much better radar signature, or specular return. In addition to being able to detect, locate and track large numbers of ground vehicles, the radar has a limited capability to detect helicopters, rotating antennas and low, slow-moving fixed-wing aircraft.<ref name=\"USAF factsheet attribution\"/>\n[[File:GMTI JSTARS.jpg|thumb|Joint STARS GMTI overlaid on aerial image|alt=]]\n\nThe radar and computer subsystems on the E-8C can gather and display broad and detailed battlefield information. Data is collected as events occur. This includes position and tracking information on enemy and friendly ground forces. The information is relayed in near-real time to the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s common ground stations via the secure jam-resistant surveillance and control data link (SCDL) and to other ground [[C4I]] nodes beyond line-of-sight via ultra high frequency satellite communications.<ref name=\"USAF factsheet attribution\"/>\n\nOther major E-8C prime mission equipment are the communications/datalink (COMM/DLX) and operations and control (O&C)subsystems.

It cannot identify exactly what type of vehicle a target is, tell what equipment it has, or discern whether it is friendly, hostile, or a bystander, so commanders often crosscheck the JSTARS data against other sources. In the Army, JSTARS data is analyzed in and disseminated from a Ground Station Module (GSM).\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:E-8 pilots cleaning windshields.JPG|thumb|Pilots from [[Robins Air Force Base]] cleaning the windshields of their E-8 before a mission in [[Iraq]]|alt= ]]\n\nThe two E-8A development aircraft were deployed in 1991 to participate in [[Operation Desert Storm]] under the direction of Albert J. Verderosa, even though they were still in development. The joint program accurately tracked mobile [[Iraq]]i forces, including tanks and [[Scud]] missiles. Crews flew developmental aircraft on 49 combat sorties, accumulating more than 500 combat hours and a 100% mission effectiveness rate.\n\nThese Joint STARS developmental aircraft also participated in [[Operation Joint Endeavor]], a [[NATO]] peacekeeping mission, in December 1995. While flying in friendly air space, the test-bed E-8A and pre-production E-8C aircraft monitored ground movements to confirm compliance with the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] agreements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Crews flew 95 consecutive operational sorties and more than 1,000 flight hours with a 98% mission effectiveness rate.\n\nThe [[93d Air Control Wing]], which activated 29 January 1996, accepted its first aircraft, 11 June 1996, and deployed in support of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in October. The provisional 93d Air Expeditionary Group monitored treaty compliance while [[NATO]] rotated troops through [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The first production E-8C and a pre-production E-8C flew 36 operational sorties and more than 470 flight hours with a 100% effectiveness rate. The wing declared initial operational capability 18 December 1997 after receiving the second production aircraft. Operation Allied Force saw Joint STARS in action again from February to June 1999 accumulating more than 1,000 flight hours and a 94.5% mission-effectiveness rate in support of the U.S. lead [[Kosovo War]].\n\nOn 1 October 2002, the 93d Air Control Wing (93 ACW) was \"blended\" with the [[116th Bomb Wing]] in a ceremony at [[Robins Air Force Base]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  The 116 BW was an [[Air National Guard]] wing equipped with the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B]] Lancer bomber at [[Robins AFB]].  As a result of a USAF reorganization of the [[B-1B]] force, all B-1Bs were assigned to active duty wings, resulting in the 116 BW lacking a current mission.  Extensive efforts by the [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia's governor]] and [[United States congressional delegations from Georgia|congressional delegation]] led to the resulting \"blending\", with the newly created wing designated as the [[116th Air Control Wing]] (116 ACW). The 93 ACW was inactivated the same day.  The 116 ACW constituted the first fully blended wing of active duty and Air National Guard airmen.\n\nThe 116 ACW has been heavily involved in both [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and Operation Iraqi Freedom, earning high marks for operational effectiveness and recently completing 10,000 combat hours.  The wing took delivery of the 17th and final E-8C on 23 March 2005.  The E-8C Joint STARS routinely supports various taskings of the Combined Force Command Korea during the [[North Korea]]n winter exercise cycle and for the [[United Nations]] enforcing resolutions on Iraq. The twelfth production aircraft, outfitted with an upgraded operations and control subsystem, was delivered to the USAF on 5 November 2001.\n\nOn 13 March 2009, a Joint STARS aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair when a test plug was left on a fuel tank vent, subsequently causing the fuel tank to rupture during in-flight refueling.

His approach has been described as \"like a medieval engineer\" as in an age of [[computer aided design]] and significant resources for research and development teams, he worked entirely by intuition.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> Eric relied on his long personal experience of international [[Off-roading|off road]] competition riding and would prepare his initial designs for a new motorcycle frame in chalk on the wall of his workshop. Experimenting with different lines until he was satisfied, Eric would then form the steel tubing using his chalk drawings as a guide. Only when he had built a working prototype motorcycle would he start work on a final jig for mass production. He was once quoted as saying \"I know when it's right and it screams at me when it's wrong.\"<ref name=\"guardian\"/>\n\nIn the late 1960s, the British motorcycle industry was unable to support a national team to compete in the [[International Six Days Enduro|International Six Days Trial]] so, Cheney hand built a limited number of ISDT Cheney-Triumphs using his own design of twin down-tube frame with a specially tuned [[Triumph Speed Twin|Triumph 5TA]] engine. Fitted with tapered conical hubs, special motocross forks and large alloy fuel tanks, a Cheney Triumph was first used in the 1968 British Trophy Team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/WService=wslive_pub/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=USA&MJ=3ea1957089632c0194d57e4b22fdc308&screen=lotdetailsNoFlash&iSaleItemNo=4587770&iSaleNo=18346&iSaleSectionNo=2 |title=British Trophy Team |accessdate=3 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308212339/http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/wspd_cgi.sh/WService%3Dwslive_pub/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=USA&MJ=3ea1957089632c0194d57e4b22fdc308&screen=lotdetailsNoFlash&iSaleItemNo=4587770&iSaleNo=18346&iSaleSectionNo=2 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }} </ref> In 1970 and 1971 three 504cc Cheney Triumphs were used by the British team in the ISDT, in which Cheney won a manufacturer's prize.<ref name=\"guardian\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Cheney|title=Cheney|work=Graces Guide|accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref> Replicas were built, but production was short-lived due to a shortage of engines.\n\n[[File:BSA 500cc B50 Victor 1973.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|1973 Cheney 500&nbsp;cc [[BSA B50]] Victor]]\nCheney's most noted successes were in the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] [[road racing]] championships, with [[Phil Read]] using his [[Motorcycle frame|chassis]] in tandem with a [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] engine to win the [[1971 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1971]] [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|250cc world championship]].<ref name=\"guardian\"/> His designs were the last British ones to win a Grand Prix.

With that in mind, the organization of this book is as follows: The first half of the text develops fundamental results that are common to all the applications. The concept of multiple regression and the linear regression model in particular constitutes the underlying platform of most modeling, even if the linear model itself is not ultimately used as the empirical specification.}}</ref> Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualised as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.\n\n[[File:Okuns law differences 1948 to mid 2011.png|thumb|right|Okun's law representing the relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The fitted line is found using regression analysis.]]\n\nFor example, consider [[Okun's law]], which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (<math>\\Delta\\ \\text{Unemployment}</math>) is a function of an intercept (<math> \\beta_0 </math>), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient <math> \\beta_1 </math> and an error term, <math>\\varepsilon</math>:\n\n:<math> \\Delta\\ \\text {Unemployment} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Growth} + \\varepsilon. </math>\n\nThe unknown parameters <math> \\beta_0 </math> and <math> \\beta_1 </math> can be estimated.  Here <math> \\beta_1 </math> is estimated to be \u22121.77 and <math> \\beta_0 </math> is estimated to be 0.83. This means that if GDP growth increased by one percentage point, the unemployment rate would be predicted to drop by 1.77 points.  The model could then be tested for [[statistical significance]] as to whether an increase in growth is associated with a decrease in the unemployment, as [[hypothesis test|hypothesized]]. If the estimate of <math> \\beta_1 </math> were not significantly different from 0, the test would fail to find evidence that changes in the growth rate and unemployment rate were related. The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in [[polynomial least squares]].\n\n==Theory==\n{{see also|Estimation theory}}\nEconometric theory uses [[statistical theory]] and [[mathematical statistics]] to evaluate and develop econometric methods.<ref name=\"Greene Econometrics \u2013 mathematical statistics and statistical theory\" /><ref name=\"Wooldridge Econometrics \u2013 mathematical statistics\" /> Econometricians try to find [[estimator]]s that have desirable statistical properties including [[Bias of an estimator|unbiasedness]], [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]], and [[Consistent estimator|consistency]]. An estimator is unbiased if its expected value is the true value of the parameter; it is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size gets larger, and it is efficient if the estimator has lower standard error than other unbiased estimators for a given sample size. [[Ordinary least squares]] (OLS) is often used for estimation since it provides the BLUE or \"best linear unbiased estimator\" (where \"best\" means most efficient, unbiased estimator) given the [[Gauss-Markov (disambiguation)|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions. When these assumptions are violated or other statistical properties are desired, other estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood estimation]], [[generalized method of moments]], or [[generalized least squares]] are used. [[Bayes estimator|Estimators that incorporate prior beliefs]] are advocated by those who favour [[Bayesian statistics]] over traditional, classical or [[Frequentist probability|\"frequentist\" approaches]].\n\n==Methods==\n{{Main|Methodology of econometrics}}\n\n''Applied econometrics'' uses theoretical econometrics and real-world [[economic data|data]] for assessing economic theories, developing [[econometric model]]s, analysing [[economic history]], and [[economic forecast|forecasting]].<ref>[[Clive Granger]] (2008). \"forecasting,\"\n''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].

The parameter <math>\\beta_1</math> measures the increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year of education. The term <math>\\varepsilon</math> is a random variable representing all other factors that may have direct influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters, <math>\\beta_0 \\mbox{ and } \\beta_1 </math> under specific assumptions about the random variable <math>\\varepsilon</math>. For example, if <math>\\varepsilon</math> is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation can be estimated with [[linear regression|ordinary least squares]].\n\nIf the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. For example, people born in certain places may have higher wages and higher levels of education. Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.\n\nThe most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that <math>\\epsilon</math> is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render <math>\\beta_1</math> identifiable.<ref name=pearl00>{{cite book |first=Judea |last=Pearl |year=2000 |title=Causality: Model, Reasoning, and Inference |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521773628 }}</ref> An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by [[David Card|Card]] (1999).<ref name=Card:00>{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |year=1999 |chapter=The Causal Effect of Education on Earning |editor-last=Ashenfelter |editor-first=O. |editor2-last=Card |editor2-first=D. |title=Handbook of Labor Economics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |pages=1801\u20131863 |isbn=0444822895 }}</ref>\n\n==Journals==\nThe main journals that publish work in econometrics are ''[[Econometrica]]'', the ''[[Journal of Econometrics]]'', the ''[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]'', ''[[Econometric Theory]]'', the ''[[Journal of Applied Econometrics]]'', ''[[Econometric Reviews]]'', the ''[[Econometrics Journal]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1368-4221 |title=The Econometrics Journal \u2013 Wiley Online Library |publisher=Wiley.com |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref> ''[[Applied Econometrics and International Development]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Business & Economic Statistics]]''.\n\n==Limitations and criticisms==\n{{see also|Criticisms of econometrics}}\n\nLike other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a [[spurious relationship]] where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated.

Emacs Lisp is also termed '''Elisp''', although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.<ref name=\"cmu.edu\">[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/lang/lisp/doc/history/cl.txt{{dead link|date=July 2018}}]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nUsers of Emacs commonly write Emacs Lisp code to customize and extend Emacs.  Other options include the ''Customize'' feature that's been in GNU Emacs since version 20.  Itself written in Emacs Lisp, Customize provides a set of [[preference]]s pages allowing the user to set options and preview their effect in the running Emacs session. When the user saves their changes, Customize simply writes the necessary Emacs Lisp code to the user's [[config file]], which can be set to a special file that only Customize uses, to avoid the possibility of altering the user's own file.\n\nEmacs Lisp can also function as a [[scripting language]], much like the [[Unix]] [[Bourne shell]] or [[Perl]], by calling Emacs in ''batch mode''.  In this way it may be called from the command line or via an executable file, and its editing functions, such as buffers and movement commands are available to the program just as in the normal mode. No [[user interface]] is presented when Emacs is started in batch mode; it simply executes the passed-in script and exits, displaying any output from the script.\n\n==Compared to other Lisp dialects==\nEmacs Lisp is most closely related to [[Maclisp]], with some later influence from [[Common Lisp]].<ref>\"GNU Emacs Lisp is largely inspired by [[Maclisp]], and a little by Common Lisp.  If you know Common Lisp, you will notice many similarities. However, many features of Common Lisp have been omitted or simplified in order to reduce the memory requirements of GNU Emacs.  Sometimes the simplifications are so drastic that a Common Lisp user might be very confused.  We will occasionally point out how GNU Emacs Lisp differs from Common Lisp.\" \u2013 from the \"History\" section of the \"Introduction\" to the Emacs Lisp Manual, as of Emacs 21</ref> It supports [[procedural programming|imperative]] and [[functional programming]] methods. [[Richard Stallman]] chose Lisp as the extension language for his rewrite of Emacs (the original used [[Text Editor and Corrector]] (TECO) as its extension language) because of its powerful features, including the ability to treat functions as data. Although the Common Lisp standard had yet to be formulated, [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] existed at the time Stallman was rewriting [[Gosling Emacs]] into GNU Emacs. He chose not to use it because of its comparatively poor performance on workstations (as opposed to the [[minicomputer]]s that were Emacs' traditional home), and he wanted to develop a dialect which he thought would be more easily optimized.<ref>\"So the development of that operating system, the GNU operating system, is what led me to write the GNU Emacs. In doing this, I aimed to make the absolute minimal possible Lisp implementation. The size of the programs was a tremendous concern. There were people in those days, in 1985, who had one-megabyte machines without virtual memory. They wanted to be able to use GNU Emacs. This meant I had to keep the program as small as possible.\" \u2013 from [https://www.gnu.org/gnu/rms-lisp.html \"My Lisp Experiences and the Development of GNU Emacs\"]</ref>\n\nThe Lisp dialect used in Emacs differs substantially from the more modern Common Lisp and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] dialects used for applications programming. A prominent characteristic of Emacs Lisp is in its use of dynamic rather than lexical [[scope (programming)|scope]] by default (see below). That is, a function may reference local variables in the scope it is called from, but not in the scope where it was defined.\n\n{{Lisp}}\n\n==Example==\n\nTo understand the logic behind Emacs Lisp, it is important to remember that there is an emphasis on providing data structures and features specific to making a versatile text editor over implementing a general-purpose programming language. For example, Emacs Lisp cannot easily read a file a line at a time\u2014the entire file must be read into an Emacs buffer. However, Emacs Lisp provides many features for navigating and modifying buffer text at a sentence, paragraph, or higher syntactic level as defined by modes.\n\nHere follows a simple example of an Emacs extension written in Emacs Lisp.  In Emacs, the editing area can be split into separate areas called ''windows'', each displaying a different ''buffer''. A buffer is a region of text loaded into Emacs' memory (possibly from a file) which can be saved into a text document.\n\nUsers can press the default \"<tt>C-x 2</tt>\" [[key binding]] to open a new window. This runs the Emacs Lisp function <tt>split-window-vertically</tt>. Normally, when the new window appears, it displays the same buffer as the previous one. Suppose we wish to make it display the next available buffer. In order to do this, the user writes the following Emacs Lisp code, in either an existing Emacs Lisp source file or an empty Emacs buffer:\n\n<source lang=\"emacs\">\n(defun my-split-window-func ()\n  (interactive)\n  (split-window-vertically)\n  (set-window-buffer (next-window) (other-buffer)))\n\n(global-set-key \"\\C-x2\" 'my-split-window-func )\n</source>\n\nThe first statement, <tt>(defun ...)</tt>, defines a new function, <tt>my-split-window-func</tt>, which calls <tt>split-window-vertically</tt> (the old window-splitting function), then tells the new window to display another (new) buffer. The second statement, <tt>(global-set-key ...)</tt> re-binds the key sequence \"C-x 2\" to the new function.\n\nThis can also be written using the feature called ''[[Advice (programming)#Use|advice]]'', which allows the user to create [[wrapper (programming)|wrappers]] around existing functions instead of defining their own.  This has the advantage of not requiring keybindings to be changed and working wherever the original function is called, as well as being simpler to write but the disadvantage of making debugging more complicated.

Advice can also be specified to execute after the original function, around it\u2014literally wrapping the original, or to conditionally execute the original function based on the results of the advice.\n\nEmacs 24.4 replaces<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.24.4|title=NEWS.24.4}}</ref> this <tt>defadvice</tt> mechanism with <tt>advice-add</tt>, which is claimed to be more flexible and simpler.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Porting-old-advice.html|title=Porting old advices|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The advice above could be reimplemented using the new system as:\n\n<source lang=\"emacs>\n(defun switch-to-next-window-in-split ()\n  (set-window-buffer (next-window) (other-buffer)))\n\n(advice-add 'split-window-vertically :before #'switch-to-next-window-in-split)\n</source>\n\nThese changes take effect as soon as the code is [[eval#Lisp|evaluated]]. It is not necessary to recompile, restart Emacs, or even [[rehash]] a configuration file. If the code is saved into an Emacs init file, then Emacs will load the extension the next time it starts. Otherwise, the changes must be reevaluated manually when Emacs is restarted.\n\n==Source code==\nEmacs Lisp code is stored in [[filesystem]]s as [[plain text]] files, by convention with the filename suffix \"<tt>.el</tt>\". The user's init file is an exception, often appearing as \"<tt>.emacs</tt>\" despite being evaluated as any Emacs Lisp code. Recent versions of Emacs (\"recent\" in a 40-year-old program meaning roughly any version released since the mid-1990s) will also load <tt>~/.emacs.el</tt> and <tt>~/.emacs.d/init.el</tt>. Additionally, users may specify any file to load as a config file on the command line, or explicitly state that no config file is to be loaded. When the files are loaded, an [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreter]] component of the Emacs program reads and parses the functions and variables, storing them in memory. They are then available to other editing functions, and to user commands. Functions and variables can be freely modified and redefined without restarting the editor or reloading the config file.\n\nIn order to save time and memory space, much of the functionality of Emacs loads only when required. Each set of optional features shipped with Emacs is implemented by a collection of Emacs code called a [[package (package management system)|package]] or [[Library (computing)|library]]. For example, there is a library for highlighting keywords in program source code, and a library for playing the game of [[Tetris]]. Each library is implemented using one or more Emacs Lisp source files. Libraries can define one or more ''major modes'' to activate and control their function.\n\nEmacs developers write certain functions in C. These are ''primitives'', also termed ''built-in functions'' or ''subrs''. Although primitives can be called from Lisp code, they can only be modified by editing the C source files and recompiling. In [[GNU Emacs]], primitives are not available as external libraries; they are part of the Emacs executable. In [[XEmacs]], runtime loading of such primitives is possible, using the operating system's support for dynamic linking. Functions may be written as primitives because they need access to external data and libraries not otherwise available from Emacs Lisp, or because they are called often enough that the comparative speed of C versus Emacs Lisp makes a worthwhile difference.\n\nHowever, because errors in C code can easily lead to [[segmentation violation]]s or to more subtle bugs, which crash the editor, and because writing C code that interacts correctly with the Emacs Lisp [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] is error-prone, the number of functions implemented as primitives is kept to a necessary minimum.\n\n===Byte code===\n''Byte-compiling'' can make Emacs Lisp code execute faster. Emacs contains a [[compiler]] which can translate Emacs Lisp source files into a special representation termed [[bytecode]]. Emacs Lisp bytecode files have the [[filename suffix]] \"<tt>.elc</tt>\". Compared to source files, bytecode files load faster, occupy less space on the disk, use less memory when loaded, and run faster.\n\nBytecode still runs more slowly than primitives, but functions loaded as bytecode can be easily modified and re-loaded. In addition, bytecode files are platform-independent. The standard Emacs Lisp code distributed with Emacs is loaded as bytecode, although the matching source files are usually provided for the user's reference as well. User-supplied extensions are typically not byte-compiled, as they are neither as large nor as computationally intensive.\n\n==Language features==\n\nNotably, the \"cl\" package implements a fairly large subset of [[Common Lisp]].\n\nEmacs Lisp (unlike some other Lisp implementations) does not do [[tail-call optimization]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lisp programmers will want to note that the current Emacs Lisp compiler does not optimize tail recursion|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Porting-Common-Lisp.html|publisher=Gnu.org|accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Without this, [[tail recursion]]s can eventually lead to [[stack overflow]].\n\nThe [[apel (emacs)|apel]] library aids in writing portable Emacs Lisp code, with the help of the polysylabi platform bridge.\n\nEmacs Lisp is a [[Lisp-2]] meaning that it has a function namespace which is separate from the namespace it uses for other variables.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/learn-elisp-for-emacs/RKRDc1Qw3Bs|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref>\n\n===From dynamic to lexical scoping===\nLike MacLisp, Emacs Lisp uses dynamic [[scope (programming)|scope]], offering static (or lexical) as an option starting from version 24.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emacs 24.1 released|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2012-06/msg00164.html|publisher=Lists.gnu.org|accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> It can be activated by setting the file local variable <code>lexical-binding</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2011-04/msg00043.html |title=Lexical binding |publisher=Lists.gnu.org |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding#toc8 |title=Dynamic Binding Vs Lexical Binding |publisher=EmacsWiki |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>\n\nIn dynamic scoping, if a programmer declares a variable within the scope of a function, it is available to subroutines called from within that function. Originally, this was intended as an [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]]; lexical scoping was still uncommon and of uncertain performance. \"I asked RMS when he was implementing emacs lisp why it was dynamically scoped and his exact reply was that lexical scope was too inefficient.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/gregs/ll1-discuss-archive-html/msg00650.html |title=T |publisher=People.csail.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> Dynamic scoping was also meant to provide greater flexibility for user customizations. However, dynamic scoping has several disadvantages. Firstly, it can easily lead to bugs in large programs, due to unintended interactions between variables in different functions. Secondly, accessing variables under dynamic scoping is generally slower than under lexical scoping.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nAlso, the <code>lexical-let</code> macro in the \"cl\" package does provide effective lexical scope to Emacs Lisp programmers, but while \"cl\" is widely used, <code>lexical-let</code> is rarely used.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html The Emacs page at the GNU Project]\n\n{{Lisp programming language}}\n{{EmacsNavbox}}\n{{Portal bar|Free software}}\n\n[[Category:Articles with example Lisp code]]\n[[Category:Emacs|Lisp]]\n[[Category:Free compilers and interpreters]]\n[[Category:Lisp programming language family]]\n[[Category:Scripting languages]]\n[[Category:Text editors]]", "sha1": "eby67n14okcv7nmrf05ufuqvb3mu4d1"}}, {"title": "Edward Bulwer-Lytton", "ns": "0", "id": "10393", "revision": {"id": "864912570", "parentid": "864840575", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T10:59:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bmcln1", "id": "1340662"}, "comment": "singe spaces for double; ref spacings", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{distinguish|text=his son, [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton]], [[Governor-General of India]]}}\n{{for|the British general|Edward Bulwer (British Army officer)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{short description|British statesman and author}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name = The Lord Lytton\n| honorific-prefix = [[The Right Honourable]]\n| honorific-suffix = [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]]\n| image = Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton by Henry William Pickersgill.jpg\n| party = [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] (1831\u20131841)<br> [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] (1851\u20131866)\n| monarch1 = [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]\n| order1 = [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]\n| predecessor1 = [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]\n| primeminister1 = [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]]\n| successor1 = [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|The Duke of Newcastle]]\n|birth_name=Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton\n| birth_date = {{birth date|df=yes|1803|5|25}}\n| birth_place = London\n| death_date = {{death date and age|df=yes|1873|1|18|1803|5|25}}\n| death_place = [[Torquay]]\n| nationality = [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]\n| spouse = [[Rosina Bulwer Lytton|Rosina Doyle Wheeler]] <br> (1802\u20131882)\n| alma_mater = [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] <br> [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]]\n| imagesize = 200px\n| term_start1 = 5 June 1858\n| term_end1 = 11 June 1859\n}}\n\n'''Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (25 May 1803 \u2013 18 January 1873) was an English novelist, poet, playwright and politician. He served as a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] MP from 1831 to 1841 and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP from 1851 to 1866. He was [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] from June 1858 to June 1859, during which time he selected [[Richard Clement Moody]] to be the founder of [[British Columbia]]. Bulwer-Lytton was offered the Crown of Greece in 1862, after the abdication of [[Otto, King of Greece|King Otto]], but declined it. He became Baron Lytton of Knebworth in the British peerage in 1862.\n\nBulwer-Lytton was the father of the statesman [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton]], who served as [[Governor-General of India]] and as British Ambassador to France, and composed poetry under the pseudonym Owen Meredith.\n\nBulwer-Lytton's literary works were highly popular and his [[bestseller|bestselling novels]] earned him a large fortune. He invented the phrases \"the [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton#Quotations|great unwashed]]\", \"pursuit of the [[almighty dollar]]\", \"[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]\", and \"[[Guardian of the Threshold|dweller on the threshold]]\". Then came a sharp decline in his literary reputation, so that he is known for little more than the much-parodied opening line \"[[It was a dark and stormy night]]\", the first seven words of his novel ''[[Paul Clifford]]'' (1830). The sardonic [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]] attempts to find the \"opening sentence of the worst of all possible novels\".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/may/17/dickens-browning-lear-reputation</ref><ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=8GS8DWMLRYEC&pg=PA139</ref><ref>https://io9.gizmodo.com/5780430/an-appreciation-of-lord-bulwer-lytton</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/13/us/wonderfully-terrible-writers-discovered.html</ref>\n\n==Life==\nBulwer-Lytton was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of [[Heydon Hall]] and [[Wood Dalling]], Norfolk and [[Elizabeth Barbara Lytton]], daughter of [[Richard Warburton Lytton]] of [[Knebworth House]], Hertfordshire. He had two older brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799\u20131877) and [[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Henry]] (1801\u20131872), later Lord Dalling and Bulwer.\n\nWhen Edward was four, his father died and his mother moved to London. He was a delicate, neurotic child and was discontented at a number of boarding schools.

He wrote in a variety of genres, including [[historical fiction]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Romance novel|romance]], the [[occult]], and science fiction.

(Also present that evening were [[Charles Pelham Villiers]] and [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Alexander Cockburn]]. The young Villiers was to have a long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] in 1859.) <!-- Blake, 59-->\n\nBulwer-Lytton reached the height of his popularity with the publication of ''Godolphin'' (1833).

He used this rather disparaging term in his 1830 novel ''Paul Clifford'':\n\n<blockquote>He is certainly a man who bathes and \"lives cleanly\", (two especial charges preferred against him by Messrs. [[the Great Unwashed]]).<ref>{{cite book |author = Edward Bulwer Lytton Baron Lytton| author2 = Eric Robinson| title = Paul Clifford| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jZtCAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PR5#v=onepage&q&f=false | year = 1838| publisher = Baudry's European Library | page = x, footnote}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' has been cited as the first source, but inspection of the original text shows this to be wrong. However, the term \"the Unwashed\" with the same meaning, appears in ''The Parisians'': \"He says that Paris has grown so dirty since 4 September, that it is only fit for the feet of the Unwashed.\" ''The Parisians'', though, was not published until 1872, while [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel ''Pendennis'' (1850) uses the phrase ironically, implying it was already established. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] refers to \"Messrs. [[the Great Unwashed]]\" in Lytton's ''Paul Clifford'' (1830), as the earliest instance.\n\nBulwer-Lytton is also credited with an appellation for the Germans: \"Das Volk der Dichter und Denker\" (The people of poets and thinkers).\n\n===Theosophy===\nAlso the writers of [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]] were influenced by his work. [[Annie Besant]] and especially [[Helena Blavatsky]] incorporated his thoughts and ideas from particularly ''The Last Days of Pompeii'', ''Vril, the Power of the Coming Race'' and ''[[Zanoni]]'' in her own books.<ref>Edward Bulwer-Lytton, ''The Coming Race'', Introduction by David Seed, Wesleyan University Press, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-xlc8edbEC&pg=PR42&lpg=PR42&dq=%22The+Coming+Race+had+an+influence+on+figures+like+Madame+Blavatsky%22&source=bl&ots=_VXvtB0qiU&sig=22O56HxmSUs0ESBLU3IsEp8d00g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V7QFUu7VGMn24QT4zYDoAg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Coming%20Race%20had%20an%20influence%20on%20figures%20like%20Madame%20Blavatsky%22&f=false p. xlii].</ref><ref>Brian Stableford, ''The A to Z of Fantasy Literature'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7JKw5FYA4GgC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22Blavatsky+drew+a+good+deal+of+inspiration+from+Bulwer-Lytton's%22&source=bl&ots=VAIq8nwjTP&sig=7HcGE56chAEMfT7S_j8v60bg_f8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3bQFUpDsOKG04AS3-YCYBQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Blavatsky%20drew%20a%20good%20deal%20of%20inspiration%20from%20Bulwer-Lytton's%22&f=false \"Blavatsky, Madame (1831\u20131991)\"].</ref>\n\n===Contest===\n{{Further information| Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest}}\nBulwer-Lytton's name lives on in the annual [[Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest]], in which contestants think up terrible openings for imaginary novels, inspired by the first line of his 1830 novel ''[[Paul Clifford]]'':<ref>Edward Bulwer Lytton, ''Paul Clifford'' (Paris, France: Baudry's European Library, 1838), [https://books.google.com/books?id=jZtCAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false page 1].</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[[It was a dark and stormy night]]; the rain fell in torrents\u2014except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.</blockquote>\n\nEntrants in the contest seek to capture the rapid changes in point of view, the florid language, and the atmosphere of the full sentence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The opening was popularized by the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, in which [[Snoopy]]'s sessions on the typewriter usually began with [[It was a dark and stormy night]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasADarkAndStormyNight |title=It Was a Dark and Stormy Night |publisher=Television Tropes & Idioms |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The same words also form the first sentence of Madeleine L'Engle\u2019s [[Newbery Medal]]-winning novel ''[[A Wrinkle in Time]].'' Similar wording appears in Edgar Allan Poe's 1831 short story, ''[[The Bargain Lost]]'', although not at the very beginning. It reads:\n\n<blockquote>It was a dark and stormy night. The rain fell in cataracts.</blockquote>\n\n===Operas===\nSeveral of Bulwer-Lytton's novels were made into operas, one of which, ''[[Rienzi|Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen]]'' (1842) by [[Richard Wagner]], eventually became more famous than the novel. ''Leonora'' (1846) by [[William Henry Fry]], the first European-styled \"grand\" opera composed in the United States, is based on Bulwer-Lytton's play ''[[The Lady of Lyons]]'', as is [[Frederic Cowen]]'s first opera ''[[Pauline (opera)|Pauline]]'' (1876).  Verdi rival [[Errico Petrella]]'s most successful opera, ''[[Jone (opera)|Jone]]'' (1858), was based upon Bulwer-Lytton's ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'', and was performed all over the world until the First World War. ''Harold, the Last of the Saxons'' (1848) was the source for Verdi's opera ''[[Aroldo]]'' in 1857.\n\n===Magazines===\nIn 1831 Bulwer-Lytton became the editor of the ''New Monthly'' but he resigned the following year. In 1841, he started the ''Monthly Chronicle'', a semi-scientific magazine. During his career he wrote poetry, prose, and stage plays; his last novel was ''Kenelm Chillingly'', which was in course of publication in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood\u2019s Magazine]]'' at the time of his death in 1873.\n\n===Translations===\nBulwer-Lytton's works of fiction and non-fiction were translated in his day and since then into many languages, including Serbian (by [[Laza Kostic]]), German, Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Finnish, and Spanish. In 1879, his ''Ernest Maltravers'' was the first complete novel from the West to be translated into Japanese.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keene |first=Donald |title=Dawn to the West: Japanese Literature of the Modern Era |year=1984 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston| location=New York |isbn=0-03-062814-8 |page=62}}</ref>\n\n===Place names===\nIn Queensland, Australia the Brisbane suburb of Lytton is to be found on Bulwer Island which today is home to the Port of Brisbane.\nAlso in Queensland on Moreton Island (Moorgumpin) is located another settlement by the name of Bulwer.\nThe township of Lytton, Quebec (today part of [[Montcerf-Lytton, Quebec|Montcerf-Lytton]]) was named after him<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=37667 |language=French |title=Lytton |publisher=[[Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec]] |work=Banque de noms de lieux du Qu\u00e9bec |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref> as was [[Lytton, British Columbia]], and Lytton, Iowa.

L. Zamenhof]] developed [[Esperanto]] in the 1870s and 80s and published the first publication about it, ''[[Unua Libro]]'', in 1887. The number of Esperanto speakers has grown gradually since then, although it has not had much support from governments and international organizations and has sometimes been outlawed or otherwise suppressed.\n\n==Standardized Yiddish ==\nAround 1880, while in Moscow and approximately simultaneously with working on Esperanto, Zamenhof made an aborted attempt to standardize [[Yiddish]], based on his native Bialystok (Northeastern) dialect, as a unifying language for the Jews of the Russian Empire.  He even used a Latin alphabet, with the letters ''\u0107, h\u0301, \u015b, \u017a'' (the same as in early drafts of Esperanto, later ''\u0109, \u0125, \u015d, \u0135'') and ''\u011b'' for [[schwa]].  However, he concluded there was no future for such a project, and abandoned it, dedicating himself to Esperanto as a unifying language for all humankind.<ref>Christer Kiselman, [http://www2.math.uu.se/~kiselman/pau2008.pdf \"Esperanto: Its origins and early history\"], in Andrzej Pelczar, ed., 2008, ''Prace Komisji Spraw Europejskich PAU'', vol.

At first he considered a revival of [[Latin]], but after learning it in school he decided it was too complicated to be a common means of international communication. When he learned English, he realised that [[grammatical conjugation|verb conjugations]] were unnecessary, and that grammatical systems could be much simpler than he had expected. He still had the problem of memorising a large vocabulary, until he noticed two Russian signs labelled ''\u0428\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f'' (''\u0161vejtsarskaja,'' a porter's lodge \u2013 from ''\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0446\u0430\u0440'' ''\u0161vejtsar,'' a porter) and ''\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f'' (''konditerskaja,'' a confectioner's shop \u2013 from ''\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440'' ''konditer,'' a confectioner). He then realised that a judicious use of [[affix]]es could greatly decrease the number of root words needed for communication. He chose to take his vocabulary from [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], the languages that were most widely taught in schools around the world and would therefore be recognisable to the largest number of people.\n\nZamenhof taught an [[Proto-Esperanto|early version of the language]] to his high-school classmates.  Then, for several years, he worked on translations and poetry to refine his creation. In 1895 he wrote, \"I worked for six years perfecting and testing the language, even though it had seemed to me in 1878 that it was already completely ready.\" When he was ready to publish, the Czarist censors would not allow it.  Stymied, he spent his time in translating works such as the Bible and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].  This enforced delay led to continued improvement.  In July 1887 he published his ''[[Unua Libro]]'' (''First Book''), a basic introduction to the language. This was essentially the language spoken today.\n\n== ''Unua Libro'' to Declaration of Boulogne (1887\u20131905)==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ido (language)|Ido]] -->\n''[[Unua Libro]]'' was published in 1887. At first the movement grew most in the Russian empire and eastern Europe, but soon spread to western Europe and beyond: to Argentina in 1889; to Canada in 1901; to Algeria, Chile, Japan, Mexico, and Peru in 1903; to Tunisia in 1904; and to Australia, the United States, Guinea, [[Indochina]], New Zealand, [[Tonkin]], and Uruguay in 1905.\n\nIn its first years Esperanto was used mainly in publications by Zamenhof and early adopters like [[Antoni Grabowski]], in extensive correspondence (mostly now lost), in the magazine ''[[La Esperantisto]]'', published from 1889 to 1895 and only occasionally in personal encounters.\n\nIn 1894, under pressure from Wilhelm Trompeter, the publisher of the magazine ''La Esperantisto'', and some other leading users, Zamenhof reluctantly put forward a radical reform to be voted on by readers. He proposed the reduction of the alphabet to 22 letters (by eliminating the accented letters and most of their sounds), the change of the plural to ''-i'', the use of a positional accusative instead of the ending ''-n'', the removal of the distinction between adjectives and adverbs, the reduction of the number of [[participles]] from six to two, and the replacement of the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|table of correlatives]] with more Latinate words or phrases. These reforms were overwhelmingly rejected, but some were picked up in [[esperantido|subsequent reforms]] (such as [[Ido (language)|Ido]]) and criticisms of the language.  In the following decade Esperanto spread into western Europe, especially France. By 1905 there were already 27 magazines being published ([[#References|Auld 1988]]).\n\nA small international conference was held in 1904, leading to the first world congress in August 1905 in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], France.  There were 688 Esperanto speakers present from 20 nationalities.  At this congress, Zamenhof officially resigned his leadership of the Esperanto movement, as he did not want personal prejudice against himself (or [[anti-Semitism]]) to hinder the progress of the language.  He proposed a [[Declaration of Boulogne|declaration]] on founding principles of the Esperanto movement, which the attendees of the congress endorsed.\n\n== Declaration of Boulogne to present (1905\u2013present)==\nWorld congresses have been held every year since 1905, except during the two World Wars.\n\nThe autonomous territory of [[Neutral Moresnet]], between Belgium and Germany, had a sizable proportion of Esperanto-speakers among its small and multiethnic population.  There was a proposal to make Esperanto its official language.\n\nIn the early 1920s, a great opportunity seemed to arise for Esperanto when the [[Iran|Iranian]] delegation to the [[League of Nations]] proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations, following a report by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]], an official delegate of League of Nations during the 13th World Congress of Esperanto in Prague.<ref>http://www.esperanto.ie/en/zaft/zaft_2.html</ref> Ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against, the French delegate, [[Gabriel Hanotaux]]. Hanotaux did not like how the French language was losing its position as the international language and saw Esperanto as a threat. However, two years later the League recommended that its member states include Esperanto in their educational curricula. Many people see the 1920s as the heyday of the Esperanto movement.\n\nIn 1941, the Soviet Union started performing mass arrests, deportations, and killings of many Esperantists and their relatives for fear of an anti-nationalistic movement, but it was interrupted by the [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of the Original Literature of Esperanto, 1887-2007|publisher=Mondial|isbn=978-1-59569-090-6|page=162}}</ref>\n\nHitler wrote in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://archive.org/stream/meinkampf035176mbp#page/n463/mode/2up/search/esperanto\n|author=Adolf Hitler\n|title=Mein Kampf (Reynal And Hitchcock English edition)\n|work=Volume 1, Chapter XI, page 423\n|year=1941\n|accessdate=2009-12-23\n}}</ref> that it was created as a universal language to unite the Jewish [[diaspora]].\nThe creation of a [[Judenrein|Jew-free]] [[National German Esperanto League]] was not enough to placate the Nazis.\nThe teaching of Esperanto was not allowed in [[List of prisoner-of-war camps in Germany|German prisoner-of-war camp]]s during World War II. Esperantists sometimes were able to get around the ban by convincing guards that they were teaching Italian, the language of Germany's closest ally.\n\n[[File:Sixday.jpg|thumb|A Soviet calendar page for 22 October 1935 including the Esperanto ''oktobro'' among other translations.]]\nIn the early years of the [[Soviet Union]], Esperanto was given a measure of government support, and an officially recognized Soviet Esperanto Association came into being.<ref name=\"Harlow\">[http://donh.best.vwh.net/Esperanto/EBook/chap07.html Donald J.

He denounced Esperanto as \"the language of spies\" and had Esperantists exiled or executed. The use of Esperanto was effectively banned until 1956.<ref name=\"Harlow\" />\nWhile Esperanto itself was not enough cause for execution, its use was extended among Jews or trade unionists and encouraged contacts with foreigners.\n\n[[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], on the other hand, made some efforts of promoting [[tourism in Italy]] through Esperanto leaflets and appreciated the similarities of Italian and Esperanto.\n\n[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal's right-wing governments]] cracked down on the language from 1936 until the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} After the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Francoist Spain]] cracked down on the [[Anarchism in Spain|Anarchists]] and [[Catalan nationalist]]s among whom the speaking of Esperanto had been quite widespread; but in the 1950s, the Esperanto movement was tolerated again,<ref name=\"Del Barrio\">''[http://www.nodo50.org/esperanto/artik68es.htm La utilizaci\u00f3n del esperanto durante la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola]'', [[To\u00f1o del Barrio]] and [[Ulrich Lins]].

However, the language experienced something of a renaissance in the 1970s and spread to new parts of the world, such as its veritable explosion in popularity in Iran in 1975. By 1991 there were enough African Esperantists to warrant a pan-African congress. The language continues to spread, although it is not officially recognised by any country, and is part of the state educational curriculum of only a few.\n\n== Evolution of the language ==\nThe [[Declaration of Boulogne]] [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Delphi/9061/bulonja.html&date=2009-10-25+05:59:00] (1905) limited changes to Esperanto.  That declaration stated, among other things, that the basis of the language should remain the ''Fundamento de Esperanto'' (\"Foundation of Esperanto\", a group of early works by Zamenhof), which is to be binding forever: nobody has the right to make changes to it.  The declaration also permits new concepts to be expressed as the speaker sees fit, but it recommends doing so in accordance with the original style.\n\nMany Esperantists believe this declaration stabilising the language is a major reason why the Esperanto speaker community grew beyond the levels attained by other constructed languages and has developed a flourishing culture. Other constructed languages have been hindered from developing a stable speaking community by continual tinkering. Also, many developers of constructed languages have been possessive of their creation and have worked to prevent others from contributing to the language. One such ultimately disastrous case was [[Johann Martin Schleyer|Schleyer]]'s [[Volap\u00fck]]. In contrast, Zamenhof declared that \"Esperanto belongs to the Esperantists\", and moved to the background once the language was published, allowing others to share in the early development of the language.\n\nThe grammatical description in the earliest books was somewhat vague, so a consensus on usage (influenced by Zamenhof's answers to some questions) developed over time within boundaries set by the initial outline ([[#References|Auld 1988]]). Even before the Declaration of Boulogne, the language was remarkably stable; only one set of lexical changes were made in the first year after publication, namely changing \"when\", \"then\", \"never\", \"sometimes\", \"always\" from ''kian'', ''tian'', ''nenian'', ''ian'', ''\u0109ian'' to ''kiam'', ''tiam'', ''neniam'' etc., to avoid confusion with the accusative forms of ''kia'' \"what sort of\", ''tia'' \"that sort of\", etc. Thus Esperanto achieved a stability of structure and grammar similar to that which natural languages enjoy by virtue of their native speakers and established bodies of literature. One could learn Esperanto without having it move from underfoot. Changes could and did occur in the language, but only by acquiring widespread popular support; there was no central authority making arbitrary changes, as happened with [[Volap\u00fck]] and some other languages.\n\nModern Esperanto usage may in fact depart from that originally described in the ''Fundamento'', though the differences are largely semantic (involving changed meaning of words) rather than grammatical or phonological.  The translation given for \"I like this one\", in the sample phrases in the main [[Esperanto]] article, offers a significant example.  According to the ''Fundamento'', ''Mi \u015datas \u0109i tiun'' would in fact have meant \"I esteem this one\".  The traditional usage is ''Tiu \u0109i pla\u0109as al mi'' (literally, \"this one is pleasing to me\"), which reflects the phrasing of most European languages (French ''celui-ci me pla\u00eet'', Spanish ''\u00e9ste me gusta'', Russian ''\u044d\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f'' [eto mnye nravitsya], German ''Das gef\u00e4llt mir'', Italian ''mi piace''). However, the original ''\u0108i tiu pla\u0109as al mi'' continues to be commonly used.\n\nFor later changes to the language, see [[Modern evolution of Esperanto]].\n\n== Dialects, reform projects and derived languages ==\n{{see also|Esperantido}}\n\nEsperanto has not fragmented into regional [[dialect]]s through natural language use. This may be because it is the language of daily communication for only a small minority of its speakers. However at least three other factors work against dialects, namely the centripetal force of the Fundamento, the unifying influence of the Plena Vortaro and its successors, which exemplified usage from the works of Zamenhof and leading writers, and the transnational ambitions of the speech community itself. Slang and [[jargon]] have developed to some extent, but such features interfere with universal communication \u2013 the whole point of Esperanto \u2013 and so have generally been avoided.\n\nHowever, in the early twentieth century numerous reform projects were proposed. Almost all of these [[Esperantido]]s were stillborn, but the very first, [[Ido (language)|Ido]] (\"Offspring\"), had significant success for several years. Ido was proposed by the [[Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language]] in Paris in October 1907. Its main reforms were in bringing the [[alphabet]], [[semantics]], and some [[Grammar|grammatical]] features into closer alignment with the [[Romance languages]], as well as removal of adjectival agreement and the accusative case except when necessary. At first, a number of leading Esperantists put their support behind the Ido project, but the movement stagnated and declined, first with the accidental death of one of its main proponents and later as people proposed further changes, and the number of current speakers is estimated at between 250 and 5000. However, Ido has proven to be a rich source of Esperanto vocabulary.\n\nSome more focused reform projects, affecting only a particular feature of the language, have gained a few adherents. One of these is [[riism]], which modifies the language to incorporate [[non-sexist language]] and [[gender-neutral pronoun]]s. However, most of these projects are specific to individual nationalities (riism from English speakers, for example), and the only changes that have gained acceptance in the Esperanto community have been the minor and gradual bottom-up reforms discussed in the last section.\n\nEsperanto is credited with influencing or inspiring several later competing language projects, such as [[Occidental language|Occidental]] (1922) and [[Novial]] (1928). These always lagged far behind Esperanto in their popularity. By contrast, [[Interlingua]] (1951) has greatly surpassed Ido in terms of popularity. It shows little or no Esperanto influence, however.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Malmkjaer|first1=Kirsten|title=Linguistics Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134596997|page=113|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hDqCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT113|language=en|date=2004-01-08}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline of Esperanto ==\n* 1859: [[L. L. Zamenhof]], the creator of Esperanto, is born in [[Bia\u0142ystok]], Russia (now Poland).\n* 1873: The Zamenhof family moves to [[Warsaw]].\n* 1878: Zamenhof celebrates the completion of his universal language project, ''[[Proto-Esperanto#The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878|Lingwe Uniwersala]]'', with high school friends.\n* 1879: Zamenhof attends medical school in Moscow. His father burns his language project while he's away. Meanwhile [[Johann Martin Schleyer|Schleyer]] publishes a sketch of [[Volap\u00fck language|Volap\u00fck]], the first [[constructed language|constructed international auxiliary language]] to acquire a number of speakers. Many Volap\u00fck clubs will later switch to Esperanto.\n* 1881: Zamenhof returns to Warsaw to continue medical school, and starts to recreate his project.\n* 1887: Zamenhof marries. In July, with his wife's financial help, he publishes ''[[Unua Libro]]'', the first publication introducing Esperanto, in Russian. Polish, German, and French translations are published later that year.\n* 1888: [[Leo Tolstoy]] becomes an early supporter. Zamenhof publishes ''[[Dua Libro]]'', as well as the first English-language edition of ''Unua Libro'', which proved to be filled with errors.\n* 1889: The second English-language edition of ''Unua Libro'' is published in January, translated by [[Richard H. Geoghegan]], and becomes the standard English translation. Henry Phillips, Jr., of the American Philosophical Society, also translates ''Unua Libro'' into English. The first volume of ''[[La Esperantisto]]'' is published in September. The language begins to be called ''Esperanto''.\n* 1894: Zamenhof, reacting to pressure, puts a radical reform to a vote, but it is overwhelmingly rejected. That version of Esperanto is often referred to as [[Reformed Esperanto|Esperanto 1894]].\n* 1895: ''La Esperantisto'' ceases publication. ''[[Lingvo Internacia (periodical)|Lingvo Internacia]]'' begins publication in December.\n* 1901: Zamenhof publishes [[Homaranismo|his ideas on a universal religion]], based on the philosophy of [[Hillel the Elder]].\n* 1905: ''[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]'' is published in the spring. The first [[World Esperanto Congress]] is held in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], with 688 participants and conducted entirely in Esperanto. The [[Declaration of Boulogne]] is drafted and ratified at the congress.\n* 1906: The second [[World Esperanto Congress]] is held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], drawing 1200 participants.

It is designed to have a highly regular grammar, and as such is considered an easy language to learn.\n\nEach part of speech has a unique suffix: nouns end with ''\u2011o''; adjectives with ''\u2011a''; present\u2011tense indicative verbs with ''\u2011as'', and so on.\n\nIt is possible to communicate effectively with a vocabulary of 400 to 500 \"meaning words\", though more exist in the language. The original vocabulary of Esperanto had around 900 meaning words, but was quickly expanded.\n\nReference grammars include the ''[[:eo:Plena Analiza Gramatiko|Plena Analiza Gramatiko (eo)]]'' ({{lang-en|Complete Analytical Grammar}}) by [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kalocsay]] and [[Gaston Waringhien]], and the ''[[Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko]]'' ({{lang-en|Complete Handbook of Esperanto Grammar}}) by [[Bertilo Wennergren]].\n\n==Grammatical summary==\nEsperanto has an [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], no [[grammatical gender]], and simple [[grammatical conjugation|verbal]] and [[noun case|nominal inflections]]. Verbal suffixes indicate four moods, of which the [[Indicative mood|indicative]] has three [[grammatical tense|tenses]], and are [[Inflection#Vs. derivation|derived]] for several [[Lexical aspect|aspects]], but do not agree with the [[grammatical person]] or [[grammatical number|number]] of their [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]. [[Noun]]s and [[adjective]]s have two [[noun case|cases]], [[nominative case|nominative]]/[[oblique case|oblique]] and [[accusative case|accusative]]/[[allative case|allative]], and two [[grammatical number|numbers]], [[Grammatical number|singular]] and [[plural]]; the adjectival form of [[personal pronoun]]s behaves like a [[genitive case]]. Adjectives generally [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns in case and number. In addition to indicating [[direct object]]s, the accusative/allative case is used with nouns, adjectives and [[adverb]]s for showing the destination of a motion, or for replacing certain [[preposition]]s; the nominative/oblique is used in all other situations. The case system allows for a flexible [[word order]] that reflects [[information flow]] and other [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] concerns, as in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Latin]].\n\n==Script and pronunciation==\n{{Main|Esperanto orthography}}\n\nEsperanto uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with six additional letters{{spnd}}\u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d, and \u016d{{spnd}}and does not use the letters q, w, x, or y.\n\nZamenhof suggested [[Italian language|Italian]] as a model for [[Esperanto pronunciation]].\n\n==The article==\nEsperanto has a single [[definite article]], ''la'', which is invariable. It is similar to English \"the\".\n\n''La'' is used:\n\n:For identifiable, countable objects:\n::''Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis la fermilon.''\n:::\"I found a bottle and took off the lid.\"\n:For representative individuals:\n::''La gepardo estas la plej rapida el la bestoj.''\n:::\"The cheetah is the fastest of the animals.\"\n::''La abeloj havas felon, sed ili ne ta\u016dgas por karesi.''\n:::\"Bees have fur, but they're no good for petting.\"\n:For adjectives used as nouns, such as ethnic adjectives used as the names of languages:\n::''la blua''\n::: \"the blue one\"\n::''la angla''\n::: \"English\" (i.e. \"the English language\")\n:For [[possessive pronoun]]s, when definite:\n::''La mia bluas, la via ru\u011das.''\n:::\"Mine is blue, yours is red\".\n\nThe article is also used for [[inalienable possession]] of body parts and [[Kinship terminology|kin terms]], where English would use a [[possessive adjective]]:\n:''Ili tran\u0109is la manon.''\n::\"They cut their hands.\" [one hand each]\n\nThe article ''la'', like the [[demonstrative adjective]] ''tiu'' (this, that), occurs at the beginning of the [[noun phrase]].\n\nThere is no grammatically required [[indefinite article]]: ''homo'' means either \"human being\" or \"a human being\", depending on the context, and similarly the plural ''homoj'' means \"human beings\" or \"some human beings\". The words ''iu'' and ''unu'' (or their plurals ''iuj'' and ''unuj'') may be used somewhat like indefinite articles, but they're closer in meaning to \"some\" and \"a certain\" than to English \"a\". This use of ''unu'' corresponds to English \"a\" when the \"a\" indicates a specific individual.<ref>Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#specifa 'La artikolo'], in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''</ref>\n\n==Parts of speech==\nThe suffixes ''\u2011o'', ''\u2011a'', ''\u2011e'', and ''\u2011i'' indicate that a word is a [[noun]], [[adjective]], [[adverb]], and [[infinitive]] [[verb]], respectively. Many new words can be derived simply by changing these suffixes. Derivations from the word ''vidi'' (to see) are ''vida'' (visual), ''vide'' (visually), and ''vido'' (vision).\n\nEach [[root word]] has an inherent [[part of speech]]: nominal, adjectival, verbal, or adverbial. These must be memorized explicitly and affect the use of the part-of-speech suffixes. With an adjectival or verbal root, the nominal suffix ''\u2011o'' indicates an abstraction: ''parolo'' (an act of speech, one's word) from the verbal root ''paroli'' (to speak); ''belo'' (beauty) from the adjectival root ''bela'' (beautiful); whereas with a noun, the nominal suffix simply indicates the noun. Nominal or verbal roots may likewise be modified with the adjectival suffix ''\u2011a'': ''re\u011da'' (royal), from the nominal root ''re\u011do'' (a king); ''parola'' (spoken). The various verbal endings mean ''to be [__]'' when added to an adjectival root: ''beli'' (to be beautiful); and with a nominal root they mean \"to act as\" the noun, \"to use\" the noun, etc., depending on the semantics of the root: ''re\u011di'' (to reign). There are relatively few adverbial roots, so most words ending in ''-e'' are derived: ''bele'' (beautifully). Often with a nominal or verbal root, the English equivalent is a [[prepositional phrase]]: ''parole'' (by speech, orally); ''vide'' (by sight, visually); ''re\u011de'' (like a king, royally).\n\nThe meanings of part-of-speech affixes depend on the inherent part of speech of the root they are applied to. For example, ''brosi'' (to brush) is based on a nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry ''bros'''o'''),'' whereas ''kombi'' (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under ''komb'''i''').'' Change the suffix to ''-o,'' and the similar meanings of ''brosi'' and ''kombi'' diverge: ''broso'' is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas ''kombo'' is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal ''kombi'' (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix ''-ilo'' is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: ''kombilo'' (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root ''broso'' (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, ''brosi'' (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix ''-ado'' will change a derived verb back to a noun: ''brosado'' (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix ''-eco,'' as in ''infaneco'' (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal ''-o: belo'' (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as ''beleco'' are acceptable and widely used.\n\nA limited number of basic adverbs do not end with ''-e,'' but with an undefined part-of-speech ending ''-a\u016d''. Not all words ending in ''-a\u016d'' are adverbs, and most of the adverbs that end in ''-a\u016d'' have other functions, such as ''hodia\u016d'' \"today\" [noun or adverb] or ''ankora\u016d'' \"yet, still\" [conjunction or adverb]. About a dozen other adverbs are bare roots, such as ''nun'' \"now\", ''tro'' \"too, too much\", not counting the adverbs among the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. (See [[special Esperanto adverbs]].)\n\nOther parts of speech occur as bare roots, without special suffixes. These are the prepositions ''(al'' \"to\"), conjunctions ''(kaj'' \"and\"), interjections ''(ho'' \"oh\"), numerals ''(du'' \"two\"), and pronouns ''(mi'' \"I\"\u2014The final ''-i'' found on pronouns is not a suffix, but part of the root). There are also several grammatical \"[[grammatical particle|particles]]\" that fit neatly into no category, and which must generally precede the words they modify, such as ''ne'' (not), ''anka\u016d'' (also), ''nur'' (only), ''e\u0109'' (even).\n\n==Nouns and adjectives==\nA suffix ''-j'' following the noun or adjective suffixes ''-o'' or ''-a'' makes a word plural. Without this suffix, a [[countable noun]] is understood to be singular. [[Direct object]]s take an [[accusative case]] suffix ''-n,'' which goes after any plural suffix. (The resulting sequence ''-ojn'' rhymes with English ''coin,'' and ''-ajn'' rhymes with ''fine.)''\n\nAdjectives [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with nouns. That is, they are plural if the nouns that they [[Grammatical modifier|modify]] are plural, and accusative if the nouns that they modify are accusative. Compare ''bona tago; bonaj tagoj; bonan tagon; bonajn tagojn'' (good day/days). This requirement allows for free word orders of adjective-noun and noun-adjective, even when two noun phrases are adjacent in [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] or [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] clauses:\n\n:''la knabino feli\u0109a'''n''' knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the girl kissed a happy boy)\n:''la knabino feli\u0109a knabo'''n''' kisis'' (the happy girl kissed a boy).\n\nAgreement clarifies the [[syntax]] in other ways also. Adjectives take the plural suffix when they modify more than one noun, even if those nouns are all singular:\n:''ru\u011da'''j''' domo kaj a\u016dto'' (a red house and [a red] car)\n:''ru\u011da domo kaj a\u016dto'' (a red house and a car).\n\nA [[predicative adjective]] does not take the accusative case suffix even when the noun that it modifies does:\n:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ru\u011da'''n''''' (I painted the red door)\n:''mi farbis la pordo'''n''' ru\u011da'' (I painted the door red).\n\n==Pronouns==\nThere are three types of [[pronoun]]s in Esperanto: [[personal pronoun|personal]] ''(vi'' \"you plural\"), [[demonstrative]] ''(tio'' \"that\", ''iu'' \"someone\"), and [[relative pronoun|relative]]/[[interrogative word|interrogative]] ''(kio'' \"what\").\nAccording to the fifth rule<ref>http://www.akademio-de-esperanto.org/fundamento/gramatiko_angla.html</ref> of the ''Fundamento de Esperanto'':\n{{Quote\n|text= 5. The personal pronouns are: ''mi'', \"I\"; ''vi'', \"thou\", \"you\"; ''li'', \"he\"; ''\u015di'', \"she\"; ''\u011di'', \"it\"; ''si'', \"self\"; ''ni'', \"we\"; ''ili'', \"they\"; ''oni'', \"one\", \"people\", (French \"on\").\n|author=L. L. Zamenhof |title= |source=''Fundamento de Esperanto'' (1905)\n}}\n\n===Personal pronouns===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Grammatical gender]] -->\nThe Esperanto '''[[personal pronoun]]''' system is similar to that of English, but with the addition of a [[reflexive pronoun]].\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Personal pronouns\n! colspan=2 | !! singular !! plural\n|-\n! colspan=2 | first person\n| '''mi''' (I) || '''ni''' (we)\n|-\n! colspan=2 | second person\n| '''vi''' (you){{ref|1|<sup>1</sup>}} || '''vi''' (you)\n|-\n! rowspan=3 | third<br/>person !! masculine\n| '''li''' (he) || rowspan=3 | '''ili''' (they)\n|-\n! feminine\n| '''\u015di''' (she)\n|-\n! neuter\n| '''\u011di''' (it)\n|-\n! colspan=2 | indefinite\n| colspan=2 align=center | '''oni''' (one, [[singular they|they]], [[generic you|you]])\n|-\n! colspan=2 | reflexive\n| colspan=2 align=center | '''si''' (self)\n|}\n\n{{note|1|\u00b9}} Zamenhof introduced the singular second-person pronoun ''ci'' to be used in translations from languages where the [[T\u2013V distinction]] is important, and added it in the ''Dua Libro'' in 1888 clarifying that \"this word is only found in the dictionary; in the language itself it is hardly ever used\".<ref name=\"Dua_Libro\"/> It has never been widely used, even by Zamenhof himself, who didn't include it as a pronoun in the 5th rule of the ''Fundamento''<ref name=\"Fundamento\"/> and in his 28th ''Lingva Respondo'', published in 1908, recommended to use only ''vi''.<ref name=\"Lingvaj_Respondoj_28\"/> The normal usage is to use ''vi'' regardless of number or formality.<ref name=\"PMEG\"/><ref name=\"Eventoj\"/> However, especially in some circles, people have begun to use ''ci'' in practical speech.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nPersonal pronouns take the [[accusative]] suffix ''-n'' as nouns do: ''min'' (me), ''lin'' (him), ''\u015din'' (her). [[Possessive adjective]]s are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a: mia'' (my), ''\u011dia'' (its), ''nia'' (our). These agree with their noun like any other [[adjective]]: ''ni salutis liajn amikojn'' (we greeted his friends). Esperanto does not have separate forms for the [[possessive pronoun]]s; this sense is generally (though not always) indicated with the definite article: ''la mia'' (mine).\n\nThe [[reflexive pronoun]] is used, in non-subject phrases only, to refer back to the subject, usually only in the third and indefinite persons:\n:''li lavis sin'' \"he washed\" (himself)\n:''ili lavis sin'' \"they washed\" (themselves or each other)\n:''li lavis lin'' \"he washed him\" (someone else)\n:''li man\u011dis '''sian''' panon'' \"he ate his bread\" (his own bread)\n:''li man\u011dis '''lian''' panon'' \"he ate his bread\" (someone else's bread).\n\nThe indefinite pronoun is used when making general statements, and is often used where English would have the subject ''it'' with a passive verb,\n:''oni diras, ke ...'' \"One says that...\", meaning: \"they say that ...\" or \"it's said that ...\"\nWith \"impersonal\" verbs where there is actually no item or being that is doing an action, no pronoun is used:\n:''pluvas'' \"rains; is raining; it's raining\".\n\nThe rain is falling by itself, therefore the subject pronoun is omitted.\n\n''\u011ci'' (\"it\"; third person neutral) is mostly used with items that have physical bodies. Zamenhof proposed that this pronoun can also be used as an [[wikt:epicene|epicene]] (gender-neutral) third-person singular pronoun, meaning for use when the gender of an individual is unknown or for when the speaker simply doesn't wish to clarify the gender.<ref>Respondo 23, La Revuo, 1901, A\u016dgusto</ref> However, this proposal is not generally accepted.\n\nIn popular usage it's usually only used when referring to children:\n:''La infano estas ploranta, \u0109ar \u011di volas man\u011di'' \"the child is crying, because it wants to eat\".\nWhen speaking of adults or people in general, in popular usage it is much more common for the demonstrative adjective and pronoun ''tiu'' (\"that thing or person that is already known to the listener\") to be used in such situations. This mirrors languages such as Japanese, but it's not a method that can always be used. For example, in the sentence\n:''Iu \u0135us diris, ke '''tiu''' malsatas'' \"Someone just said that ''that thing/person'' is hungry\",\nthe word ''tiu'' would be understood as referring to someone other than the person speaking (like English pronouns ''this'' or ''that'' but also referring to people), and so cannot be used in place of ''\u011di'', ''li'' or ''\u015di.''\n\n===Other pronouns===\nThe [[demonstrative pronoun|demonstrative]] and [[relative pronoun]]s form part of the [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlative system]], and are described in that article. The pronouns are the forms ending in ''-o'' (simple pronouns) and ''-u'' (adjectival pronouns). Their accusative case is formed in ''-n,'' but the genitive case ends in ''-es,'' which is the same for singular and plural and does not take accusative marking. Compare the nominative phases ''lia domo'' (his house) and ''ties domo'' (that one's house, those ones' house) with the plural ''lia'''j''' domo'''j''''' (his houses) and ''ties domo'''j''''' (that one's houses, those ones' houses), and with the accusative genitive ''lia'''n''' domo'''n''''' and ''ties domo'''n'''.''<ref>An unofficial but widely recognized accusative preposition ''na'' has become popular with some Esperantists on the internet and may be used in such situations, especially when there is no following noun ''(ties,'' accusative ''na ties)''. The purposefully ambiguous preposition ''je'' may be so used as well (accusative ''je ties)'', though normally the ''-es'' words are simply not inflected for case.</ref>\n\n==Prepositions==\nAlthough Esperanto [[word order]] is fairly free, [[preposition]]s must come at the beginning of a [[noun phrase]]. Whereas in languages such as German, prepositions may require that a noun be in various [[case (linguistics)|cases]] ([[accusative]], [[dative]], ''and so on),'' in Esperanto all prepositions govern the [[nominative]]: ''por Johano'' (for John). The only exception is when there are two or more prepositions and one is ''replaced'' by the accusative.\n\nPrepositions should be used with a definite meaning. When no one preposition is clearly correct, the indefinite preposition ''je'' should be used:\n:''ili iros '''je''' la tria de majo'' (they'll go on the third of May: the \"on\" isn't literally true).\n\nAlternatively, the accusative may be used without a preposition:\n:''ili iros la tria'''n''' de majo.''\n\nNote that although ''la trian'' (the third) is in the accusative, ''de majo'' (of May) is still a [[prepositional phrase]], and so the noun ''majo'' remains in the nominative case.\n\nA frequent use of the accusative is in place of ''al'' (to) to indicate the direction or goal of motion ([[allative case|allative construction]]). It is especially common when there would otherwise be a double preposition:\n:''la kato \u0109asis la muson '''en''' la domo'' (the cat chased the mouse '''in''' [inside of] the house)\n:''la kato \u0109asis la muson '''en''' la domo'''n''''' (the cat chased the mouse '''into''' the house).\n\nThe accusative/allative may stand in for other prepositions also, especially when they have vague meanings that add not much to the clause. Adverbs, with or without the case suffix, are frequently used instead of prepositional phrases:\n:''li iris '''al''' sia hejmo'' (he went to his home)\n:''li iris hejme'''n''''' (he went home)\n\nBoth ''por'' and ''pro'' often translate English 'for'. However, they distinguish ''for a goal'' (looking forward in time, or causing: ''por'') and ''for a cause'' (looking back in time, or being caused by: ''pro''): To vote ''por'' your friend means to cast a ballot with their name on it, whereas to vote ''pro'' your friend would mean to vote in their place or as they asked you to.\n\nThe preposition most distinct from English usage is perhaps ''de'', which corresponds to English ''of, from, off,'' and ''(done) by'':\n:''libro '''de''' Johano'' (John''''s''' book)\n:''li venis '''de''' la butiko'' (he came '''from''' the shop)\n:''mordita '''de''' hundo'' (bitten '''by''' a dog)\n\nHowever, English ''of'' corresponds to several Esperanto prepositions also: ''de, el'' (out of, made of), and ''da'' (quantity of, unity of form and contents):\n:''tablo '''el''' ligno'' (a table '''of''' wood)\n:''glaso '''da''' vino'' (a glass '''of''' wine)\n:''listo '''da''' kondi\u0109oj '''de''' la kandidatoj'' (a list '''of''' conditions '''from''' the candidates)\nThe last of these, ''[[wikt:da#Esperanto|da]]'', is semantically Slavic and is difficult for Western Europeans, to the extent that even many Esperanto dictionaries and grammars define it incorrectly.<ref>Sergio Pokrovskij, 2007. \"[http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#Da La artikolo]\", in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''.<br/>See the entry for [[wikt:da#Esperanto|''da'' at Wiktionary]].</ref>\n\nOccasionally a new preposition is coined. Because a bare [[root (linguistics)|root]] may indicate a preposition or [[interjection]], removing the grammatical suffix from another part of speech can be used to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from ''fari'' (to do, to make) we get the preposition ''far'' (done by).\n\n==Verbs==\nAll verbal inflection is regular. There are three tenses, all of which are in the [[indicative mood]]. The other moods are the [[infinitive]], [[conditional mood|conditional]], and [[Jussive mood|jussive]]. No [[Grammatical aspect|aspectual]] distinctions are required by the grammar, but derivational expressions of [[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]] are common.\n\nVerbs do not change form according to their [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. ''I am, we are,'' and ''he is'' are simply ''mi estas, ni estas,'' and ''li estas,'' respectively. Impersonal subjects are not used: ''pluvas'' (it is raining); ''estas muso en la domo'' (there's a mouse in the house).\n\nMost verbs are inherently [[Transitive verb|transitive]] or [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]]. As with the inherent part of speech of a root, this is not apparent from the shape of the verb and must simply be memorized. Transitivity is changed with the suffixes ''-ig-'' (the transitivizer/[[causative]]) and ''-i\u011d-'' (the intransitivizer/[[middle voice]]):\n:''akvo bolas je cent gradoj'' (water boils at 100 degrees)\n:''ni bol'''ig'''as la akvo'''n''''' (we boil the water).\n\n===The verbal paradigm===\nThe tenses have characteristic vowels. ''A'' indicates the present tense, ''i'' the past, and ''o'' the future.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!\n![[indicative mood|Indicative]]\n![[Participle|Active participle]]\n![[Participle|Passive participle]]\n![[Infinitive]]\n![[Jussive mood|Jussive]] ([[volitive modality|volitive]])\n![[conditional mood|Conditional]]\n|-\n![[past tense|Past]]\n|align=\"center\"|-is\n|align=\"center\"|-inta\n|align=\"center\"|-ita\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|-i\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|-u\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|-us\n|-\n![[present tense|Present]]\n|align=\"center\"|-as\n|align=\"center\"|-anta\n|align=\"center\"|-ata\n|-\n![[future tense|Future]]\n|align=\"center\"|-os\n|align=\"center\"|-onta\n|align=\"center\"|-ota\n|}\n\nThe verbal forms may be illustrated with the root ''esper-'' (hope):\n:''esperi'' (to hope)\n:''esperas'' (hopes, is hoping)\n:''esperis'' (hoped, was hoping)\n:''esperos'' (shall hope, will hope)\n:''esperu'' (hope!; a command)\n:''esperus'' (were to hope, would hope)\n\nA verb can be made emphatic with the particle ''ja'' (indeed): ''mi ja esperas'' (I do hope), ''mi ja esperis'' (I did hope).\n\n===Tense===\nAs in English, Esperanto [[present tense]] may be used for generic statements such as \"birds fly\" (''la birdoj flugas'').\n\nThe Esperanto [[future tense|future]] is a true tense, used whenever future time is meant. For example, in English \"(I'll give it to you) when I see you\" the verb \"see\" is in the present tense despite the time being in the future; in Esperanto, future tense is required: ''(Mi donos \u011din al vi) kiam mi vidos vin''.\n\nEsperanto tense is [[relative tense|relative]]. This differs from English absolute tense, where the tense is past, present, or future of the moment of speaking: In Esperanto, the tense of a [[subordinate clause|subordinate verb]] is instead anterior or posterior to the time of the main verb. For example, \"John said that he would go\" is in Esperanto ''Johano diris, ke li iros'' (lit., \"John said that he will go\"); this does not mean that he will go at some point in the future from now (as \"John said that he will go\" means in English), but that at the time he said this, his going was still in the future.\n\n===Mood===\nThe [[conditional mood]] is used for such expressions as ''se mi povus, mi irus'' (if I could, I would go) and ''se mi estus vi, mi irus'' (if I were you, I'd go).\n\nThe [[jussive mood]], is used for wishing and requesting, and serves as the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[subjunctive]]:\n:''Iru!'' (Go!)\n:''Mi petis, ke li venu.'' (I asked him to come.)\n:''Li parolu.'' (Let him speak.)\n:''Ni iru.'' (Let's go.)\n:''Benu \u0109i tiun doma\u0109on.'' (Bless this bad house.)\n:''Mia filino belu!'' (May my daughter be beautiful!)\n\n===Copula===\nThe verb ''esti'' (to be) is both the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] (\"X is Y\") and the existential (\"there is\") verb. As a copula linking two [[noun phrase]]s, it causes neither to take the accusative case. Therefore, unlike the situation with other verbs, word order with ''esti'' can be semantically important: compare ''hundoj estas personoj'' (dogs are people) and ''personoj estas hundoj'' (people are dogs).\n\nIt is becoming increasingly common to replace ''esti''-plus-adjective with a verb: ''la \u0109ielo estas blua'' or ''la \u0109ielo bluas'' (the sky is blue). This is a stylistic rather than grammatical change in the language, as the more economical verbal forms were always found in poetry.<ref>However, the reverse is not true, as this does not change the inherent part of speech: ''Morti'' (to die) does not have the same meaning as ''esti morta'' (to be dead).</ref>\n\n==Participles==\n[[Participle]]s are verbal derivatives. In Esperanto, there are six forms:\n* three aspects: past (or \"perfective\"), present (or \"progressive\"), and future (or \"predictive\")\ntimes\n* two [[Grammatical voice|voices]]: [[active voice|active]] (performing an action) and [[passive voice|passive]] (receiving an action)\nThe participles represent aspect by retaining the vowel of the related verbal tense: '''i''', '''a''', '''o'''. In addition to carrying aspect, participles are the principal means of representing [[Grammatical voice|voice]], with either '''nt''' or '''t''' following the vowel (see next section).\n\n===Adjectival participles===\nThe basic principle of the participles may be illustrated with the verb ''fali'' (to fall). Picture a cartoon character running off a cliff. Before the character falls, they are ''fal'''o'''nta'' (about to fall). As they drop, they are ''fal'''a'''nta'' (falling). After they hit the ground, they are ''fal'''i'''nta'' (fallen).\n\nActive and passive pairs can be illustrated with the transitive verb ''haki'' (to chop). Picture a woodsman approaching a tree with an axe, intending to chop it down. He is ''hak'''ont'''a'' (about to chop) and the tree is ''hak'''ot'''a'' (about to be chopped). While swinging the axe, he is ''hak'''ant'''a'' (chopping) and the tree ''hak'''at'''a'' (being chopped). After the tree has fallen, he is ''hak'''int'''a'' (having chopped) and the tree ''hak'''it'''a'' (chopped).\n\nAdjectival participles agree with nouns in number and case, just as other adjectives do:\n:''ili \u015dparis la arbojn '''hakotajn''''' (they spared the trees [that were] '''to be chopped down''').\n\n===Compound tense===\nCompound tenses are formed with the [[adjectival participle]]s plus ''esti'' (to be) as the auxiliary verb. The participle reflects aspect and voice, while the verb carries tense:\n*Present [[Continuous aspect|progressive]]: ''mi estas kaptanta'' (I am catching [something]), ''mi estas kaptata'' (I am being caught)\n*Present [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]: ''mi estas kaptinta'' (I have caught [something]), ''mi estas kaptita'' (I have been caught, I am caught)\n*Present [[prospective aspect|prospective]]: ''mi estas kaptonta'' (I am going to catch / about to catch), ''mi estas kaptota'' (I am going to be caught / about to be caught)\n\nThese are not used as often as their English equivalents. For \"I ''am'' go''ing'' to the store\", you would normally use the simple present ''mi iras'' in Esperanto.\n\nThe tense and mood of ''esti'' can be changed in these compound tenses:\n:''mi estis kaptinta'' (I had caught)\n:''mi estus kaptonta'' (I would be about to catch)\n:''mi estos kaptanta'' (I will be catching).\n\nAlthough such [[periphrastic]] constructions are familiar to speakers of most European languages, the option of contracting [''esti'' + adjective] into a verb is often seen for adjectival participles:\n\n:''mi estas kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintas'' (I have caught)\n:''mi estis kaptinta'' or ''mi kaptintis'' (I had caught)\n\nThe active synthetic forms are:\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Synthetic compound tenses (active voice)\n! !! Simple verb !! Progressive !! Perfect !! Prospective\n|-\n! Present tense\n| ''mi kaptas'' <br/> (I catch)\n| ''mi kaptantas'' <br/> (I am catching)\n| ''mi kaptintas'' <br/> (I have caught)\n| ''mi kaptontas'' <br/> (I am about to catch)\n|-\n! Past tense\n| ''mi kaptis'' <br/> (I caught)\n| ''mi kaptantis'' <br/> (I was catching)\n| ''mi kaptintis'' <br/> (I had caught)\n| ''mi kaptontis'' <br/> (I was about to catch)\n|-\n! Future tense\n| ''mi kaptos'' <br/> (I will catch)\n| ''mi kaptantos'' <br/> (I will be catching)\n| ''mi kaptintos'' <br/> (I will have caught)\n| ''mi kaptontos'' <br/> (I will be about to catch)\n|-\n! Conditional mood\n| ''mi kaptus'' <br/> (I would catch)\n| ''mi kaptantus'' <br/> (I would be catching)\n| ''mi kaptintus'' <br/> (I would have caught)\n| ''mi kaptontus'' <br/> (I would be about to catch)\n|}\n\nInfinitive and jussive forms are also found. There is a parallel passive paradigm. A few of these forms, notably ''-intus'' and ''-atas'', entered common usage, but most of them are very rare because they are difficult to understand.<ref>Bertilo Wennergren, ''Plena Manlibro de Esperanta Gramatiko'', [http://bertilow.com/pmeg/gramatiko/participoj/kunmetitaj_verboformoj/nekutimaj.html Nekutimaj kunmetitaj verboj]</ref>\n\n===Nominal participles===\nParticiples may be turned into adverbs or nouns by replacing the adjectival suffix ''-a'' with ''-e'' or ''-o.'' This means that, in Esperanto, some nouns may be inflected for tense.\n\nA nominal participle indicates ''one who participates'' in the action specified by the verbal root. For example, ''esperinto'' is a \"hoper\" (past tense), or ''one who had been hoping.''\n\n===Adverbial participles===\n[[Adverbial participle]]s are used with subjectless clauses:\n:''Kaptinte la pilkon, li ekkuris golen'' (Having caught the ball, he started running for the goal).\n\n===Conditional and tenseless participles (unofficial)===\nOccasionally, the participle paradigm will be extended to include conditional participles, with the vowel ''u (-unt-, -ut-).''<ref>Timothy Reagan (2009) ''Language Matters: Reflections on Educational Linguistics'', p. 167</ref> If, for example, in our tree-chopping example, the woodsman found that the tree had been [[Tree spiking|spiked]] and so couldn't be cut down after all, he would be ''hakunta'' and the tree ''hakuta'' (he, the one \"who would chop\", and the tree, the one that \"would be chopped\").\n\nThis can also be illustrated with the verb ''prezidi'' (to preside). Just after the recount of the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 United States presidential election]]:\n*then-president [[Bill Clinton]] was still ''prezid'''a'''nto'' (current president) of the United States,\n*president-elect [[George W. Bush]] was declared ''prezid'''o'''nto'' (president-to-be),\n*the previous president [[George H. W. Bush]] was a ''prezid'''i'''nto'' (former president), and\n*the contending candidate [[Al Gore]] was ''prezid'''u'''nto'' (would-be president \u2013 that is, if the recount had gone differently).<ref>This example is somewhat artificial, because the customary word for 'president' (of a country) is the tense-neutral word ''prezid'''e'''nto.'' ''Prezid'''a'''nto'' is typically used for the presidents of organizations other than sovereign countries, and ''prezid'''i'''nto'' is used for former presidents in such contexts.</ref>\n\nThe tense-neutral word ''prezid'''e'''nto'' is officially a separate root, not a derivative of the verb ''prezidi.''\n\n==Negation==\nA statement is made negative by using ''ne'' or one of the negative ''(neni-)'' [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. Ordinarily, only one negative word is allowed per clause:\n\n: ''Mi ne faris ion ajn.'' I didn't do anything.\n\nTwo negatives within a clause cancel each other out, with the result being a positive sentence.\n\n: ''Mi ne faris nenion. Mi ja faris ion.'' It is not the case that I did nothing. I did do something.\n\nThe word ''ne'' comes before the word it negates:\n: ''Mi ne skribis tion'' (I didn't write that)\n: ''Ne mi skribis tion'' (It wasn't I who wrote that)\n: ''Mi skribis ne tion'' (It wasn't that that I wrote)\n\nThe latter will frequently be reordered as ''ne tion mi skribis'' depending on the flow of information.\n\n==Questions==\n{{main|Interrogatives in Esperanto}}\n\n\"Wh\" questions are asked with one of the interrogative/relative ''(ki-'') [[Table of correlatives (Esperanto)|correlatives]]. They are commonly placed at the beginning of the sentence, but different word orders are allowed for stress:\n\n:''Li scias, kion vi faris'' (He knows what you did.)\n:''Kion vi faris?'' (What did you do?)\n:''Vi faris kion?'' (You did ''what?)''\n\nYes/no questions are marked with the conjunction ''\u0109u'' (whether):\n\n:''Mi ne scias, \u0109u li venos'' (I don't know whether he'll come)\n:''\u0108u li venos?'' (Will he come?)\n\nSuch questions can be answered ''jes'' (yes) or ''ne'' (no) in the European fashion of aligning with the polarity of the answer, or ''\u011duste'' (correct) or ''mal\u011duste'' (incorrect) in the Japanese fashion of aligning with the polarity of the question:\n\n:''\u0108u vi ne iris?'' (Did you not go?)\n:''\u2014 Ne, mi ne iris'' (No, I didn't go); ''\u2014 Jes, mi iris'' (Yes, I went)\n:''\u2014 \u011custe, mi ne iris'' (Correct, I didn't go); ''\u2014 Mal\u011duste, mi iris'' (Incorrect, I did go)\n\nNote that Esperanto questions may have the same word order as statements.\n\n==Conjunctions==\nBasic Esperanto [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] are ''kaj'' (both/and), ''a\u016d'' (either/or), ''nek'' (neither/nor), ''se'' (if), ''\u0109u'' (whether/or), ''sed'' (but), ''anstata\u016d'' (instead of), ''krom'' (besides, in addition to), ''kiel'' (like, as), ''ke'' (that). Like prepositions, they precede the phrase or clause they modify:\n\n:''Mi vidis kaj lin kaj lian amikon'' (I saw both him and his friend)\n:''Estis nek hele nek agrable'' (it was neither clear [sunny] nor pleasant)\n:''\u0109u pro kaprico, \u0109u pro natura lingvo-evoluo'' (whether by whim, or by natural language development)\n:''Li volus, ke ni iru'' (he would like us to go)\n\nHowever, unlike prepositions, they allow the accusative case, as in the following example from [[Don Harlow]]:\n\n:''Li traktis min kiel princon'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as he would treat a prince)\n:''Li traktis min kiel princo'' (He treated me like a prince: that is, as a prince would treat me)\n\n==Interjections==\n[[Interjection]]s may be derived from bare affixes or roots: ''ek!'' (get going!), from the perfective prefix; ''um'' (um, er), from the indefinite/undefined suffix; ''fek!'' (shit!), from ''feki'' (to defecate).\n\n==Word formation==\n{{main|Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation}}\nEsperanto [[morphology (linguistics)|derivational morphology]] uses a large number of lexical and grammatical affixes ([[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[suffix]]es). These, along with compounding, decrease the memory load of the language, as they allow for the expansion of a relatively small number of basic roots into a large vocabulary. For example, the Esperanto root ''vid-'' (see) regularly corresponds to several dozen English words: ''see (saw, seen), sight, blind, vision, visual, visible, nonvisual, invisible, unsightly, glance, view, vista, panorama, observant'' etc., though there are also separate Esperanto roots for a couple of these concepts.\n\n==Numbers==\n\n===Numerals===\nThe cardinal [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals]] are:\n\n:''nul'' (zero)\n:''unu'' (one)\n:''du'' (two)\n:''tri'' (three)\n:''kvar'' (four)\n:''kvin'' (five)\n:''ses'' (six)\n:''sep'' (seven)\n:''ok'' (eight)\n:''na\u016d'' (nine)\n:''dek'' (ten)\n:''cent'' (one hundred)\n:''mil'' (one thousand)\n\nThese are grammatically numerals, not nouns, and as such do not take the accusative case suffix. However, ''unu'' (and only ''unu'') is sometimes used adjectivally or demonstratively, meaning \"a certain\", and in such cases it may take the plural affix ''-j,'' just as the demonstrative pronoun ''tiu'' does:\n:''unu'''j''' homo'''j'''''\n:\"certain people\";\n:''ili kuris unu'''j''' post la aliaj''\n:\"they ran some after others\".\nIn such use ''unu'' is irregular in that it doesn't take the accusative affix ''-n'' in the singular, but does in the plural:\n:''ia'''n''' unu ideo'''n'''''\n:\"some particular idea\",\nbut\n:''unuj objektoj venis en unu'''jn''' mano'''jn''', aliaj en aliajn manojn''\n:\"some objects came into certain hands, others into other hands\".\nAdditionally, when counting off, the final ''u'' of ''unu'' may be dropped, as if it were a part-of-speech suffix:\n:''Un'! Du! Tri! Kvar!''\n\n===Higher numbers===\nAt numbers beyond the thousands, the international roots ''miliono'' (million) and ''miliardo'' (milliard) are used. Beyond this there are two systems: A ''[[Long and short scales|billion]]'' in most English-speaking countries is different from a ''billion'' in most other countries (10<sup>9</sup> ''vs.'' 10<sup>12</sup> respectively; that is, a thousand million ''vs.'' a million million). The international root ''biliono'' is likewise ambiguous in Esperanto, and is deprecated for this reason. An unambiguous system based on adding the Esperanto suffix ''-iliono'' to numerals is generally used instead, sometimes supplemented by a second suffix ''-iliardo:''<ref>\"[http://purl.org/net/voko/revo/art/bilion.html biliono]\" at Reta Vortaro</ref>\n\n:10<sup>6</sup>: ''miliono''\n:10<sup>9</sup>: ''miliardo'' (or ''mil milionoj'')\n:10<sup>12</sup>: ''duiliono''\n:10<sup>15</sup>: ''duiliardo'' (or ''mil duilionoj'')\n:10<sup>18</sup>: ''triiliono''\n:10<sup>21</sup>: ''triiliardo'' (or ''mil triilionoj'')\n:''etc.''\n\nNote that these forms are grammatically nouns, not numerals, and therefore cannot modify a noun directly: ''mil homojn'' (a thousand people [accusative]) but ''milionon da homoj'' (a million people [accusative]).\n\n===Compound numerals and derivatives===\nNumerals are written together as one word when their values are multiplied, and separately when their values are added (''dudek'' 20, ''dek du'' 12, ''dudek du'' 22). Ordinals are formed with the adjectival suffix ''-a,'' quantities with the nominal suffix ''-o,'' multiples with ''-obl-,'' fractions with ''\u2011on\u2011'', collectives with ''\u2011op\u2011'', and repetitions with the root ''\u2011foj\u2011''.\n\n:''sescent sepdek kvin'' (675)\n:''tria'' (third [as in ''first, second, third''])\n:''trie'' (thirdly)\n:''dudeko'' (a score [20])\n:''duobla'' (double)\n:''kvarono'' (one fourth, a quarter)\n:''duope'' (by twos)\n:''dufoje'' (twice)\n\nThe particle ''po'' is used to mark distributive numbers, that is, the idea of distributing a certain number of items to each member of a group. Consequently, the [[logogram]] [[@]] is not used (except in email addresses, of course):\n:''mi donis al ili po tri pomojn'' or ''pomojn mi donis al ili po tri'' (I gave [to] them three apples each).\n\nNote that particle ''po'' forms a phrase with the numeral ''tri'' and is not a preposition for the noun phrase ''tri pomojn,'' so it does not prevent a grammatical object from taking the accusative case.\n\n==Comparisons==\nComparisons are made with the adverbial correlatives ''tiel ... kiel'' (as ... as), the adverbial roots ''pli'' (more) and ''plej'' (most), the antonym prefix ''mal-,'' and the preposition ''ol'' (than):\n\n:''mi skribas tiel bone kiel vi'' (I write as well as you)\n:''tiu estas pli bona ol tiu'' (this one is better than that one)\n:''tio estas la plej bona'' (that's the best)\n:''la mia estas malpli multekosta ol la via'' (mine is less expensive than yours)\n\nImplied comparisons are made with ''tre'' (very) and ''tro'' (too [much]).\n\nPhrases like \"The more people, the smaller the portions\" and \"All the better!\" are translated using ''ju'' and ''des'' in place of \"the\":\n:'''''Ju''' pli da homoj, '''des''' malpli grandaj la porcioj'' (The more people, the smaller the portions)\n:'''''Des''' pli bone!'' (All the better!)\n\n==Word order==\nEsperanto has a fairly [[free word order|flexible word order]]. However, word order does play a role in Esperanto grammar, even if a much lesser role than it does in English. For example, the negative particle ''ne'' generally comes before the element being negated; negating the verb has the effect of negating the entire clause (or rather, there is ambiguity between negating the verb alone and negating the clause):\n:''mi ne iris'' 'I didn't go'\n:''mi ne iris, mi revenis'' 'I didn't go, I came back'\n:''ne mi iris'' or ''iris ne mi'' 'it wasn't me who went'\n:''mi iris ne al la butiko sed hejmen'' 'I went not to the shop but home'.\nHowever, when the entire clause is negated, the ''ne'' may be left till last:\n:''mi iris ne'' 'I went not'.\n\nThe last order reflects a typical [[topic\u2013comment]] (or [[theme\u2013rheme]]) order: Known information, the topic under discussion, is introduced first, and what one has to say about it follows. (I went not: As for my going, there was none.) For example, yet another order, ''ne iris mi'', would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and ''mi'' is given as an example of one who did not go.\n\nCompare:<ref>Sergio Pokrovskij (2007) [http://lingvakritiko.com/2007/02/05/la-artikolo/#vortordo 'La artikolo'], in ''Lingva Kritiko: Studoj kaj notoj pri la Internacia Lingvo''</ref>\n\n:''Pasintjare mi feriis en Italujo''\n::'Last year I vacationed in Italy' (Italy was the place I went on holiday)\n:''En Italujo mi feriis pasintjare''\n::'I vacationed in Italy last year' (last year was when I went)\n:''En Italujo pasintjare mi feriis''\n::'In Italy last year I went on vacation' (a vacation is why I went)\n:''En Italujo pasintjare feriis mi''\n::(I am the one who went)\n\n===The noun phrase===\nWithin a noun phrase, either the order ''adjective\u2013noun'' or ''noun\u2013adjective'' may occur, though the former is somewhat more common. Less flexibility occurs with numerals and demonstratives, with ''numeral\u2013noun'' and ''demonstrative\u2013noun'' being the norm, as in English.\n:''blua \u0109ielo'' 'a blue sky'\n:''tiu \u0109ielo'' 'that sky'\n:''tiu blua \u0109ielo'' 'that blue sky'\n:''sep bluaj \u0109ieloj'' 'seven blue heavens'\n\nAdjective\u2013noun order is much freer. With simple adjectives, adjective\u2013noun order predominates, especially if the noun is long or complex. However, a long or complex adjective typically comes after the noun, in some cases parallel to structures in English, as in the second example below:<ref name=wells/>\n:''homo malgrandanima kaj ege avara'' 'a petty and extremely greedy person'\n:''viza\u011do plena de cikatroj'' 'a face full of scars'\n:''ideo fantazia sed tamen interesa'' 'a fantastic but still interesting idea'\n\nAdjectives also normally occur after correlative nouns. Again, this is one of the situations where adjectives come after nouns in English:\n:''okazis io stranga'' 'something strange happened'\n:''ne \u0109io brilanta estas diamanto'' 'not everything shiny is a diamond'\nChanging the word order here can change the meaning, at least with the correlative ''nenio'' 'nothing':\n:''li man\u011dis nenion etan'' 'he ate nothing little'\n:''li man\u011dis etan nenion'' 'he ate a little nothing'\n\nWith multiple words in a phrase, the order is typically demonstrative/pronoun\u2013numeral\u2013(adjective/noun):\n:''miaj du grandaj amikoj ~ miaj du amikoj grandaj'' 'my two great friends'.\n\nHowever, the article ''la'' precedes a noun phrase:\n:''la blua \u0109ielo'' \"the blue sky\"\n\nIn [[prepositional phrase]]s, the preposition is ''required'' to come at the front of the noun phrase (that is, even before the article ''la''), though it is commonly replaced by turning the noun into an adverb:\n:''al la \u0109ielo'' 'to the sky' or ''\u0109ielen'' 'skywards', never ''*\u0109ielo al''\n\n===Constituent order===\n[[Constituent order]] ''within'' a clause is generally free, apart from copular clauses.\n\nThe default order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], though any order may occur, with subject and object distinguished by case, and other constituents distinguished by prepositions:\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon'' 'the dog chased/hunted the cat'\n:''la katon \u0109asis la hundo''\n:''\u0109asis la hundo la katon''\n:''\u0109asis la katon la hundo''\n:''la hundo la katon \u0109asis''\n:''la katon la hundo \u0109asis''\nThe expectation of a topic\u2013comment (theme\u2013rheme) order apply here, so the context will influence word order: in ''la katon \u0109asis la hundo'', the cat is the topic of the conversation, and the dog is the news; in ''la hundo la katon \u0109asis'', the dog is the topic of the conversation, and it is the action of chasing that is the news; and in ''\u0109asis la hundo la katon'', the action of chasing is already the topic of discussion.\n\nContext is required to tell whether\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon en la \u011dardeno''\nmeans the dog chased a cat which was in the garden, or there, in the garden, the dog chased the cat. These may be disambiguated with\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon, kiu estis en la \u011dardeno''\n::'The dog chased the cat, which was in the garden'\nand\n:''en la \u011dardeno, la hundo \u0109asis la katon''\n::'In the garden, the dog chased the cat'.\n\nOf course, if it chases the cat in''to'' the garden, the case of 'garden' would change:\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon en la \u011dardeno'''n''''', ''en la \u011dardeno'''n''' la hundo \u0109asis la katon'', etc.\n\nWithin copulative clauses, however, there are restrictions. [[Copula (linguistics)|Copulas]] are words such as ''esti'' 'be', ''i\u011di'' 'become', ''resti'' 'remain', and ''\u015dajni'' 'seem', for which neither noun phrase takes the accusative case. In such cases only two orders are generally found: noun-copula-predicate and, much less commonly, predicate-copula-noun.<ref name=wells>John Wells, 1978, ''Lingvistikaj aspektoj de Esperanto'', p 42 ''ff''</ref>\n\nGenerally, if a characteristic of the noun is being described, the choice between the two orders is not important:\n:''sova\u011da estas la vento'' 'wild is the wind', ''la vento estas sova\u011da'' 'the wind is wild'\nHowever, ''la vento sova\u011da estas'' is unclear, at least in writing, as it could be interpreted as 'the wild wind is', leaving the reader to ask, 'is what?'.\n\n===Attributive phrases and clauses===\nIn the sentence above, ''la hundo \u0109asis la katon, kiu estis en la \u011dardeno'' 'the dog chased the cat, which was in the garden', the [[relative pronoun]] ''kiu'' 'which' is restricted to a position ''after'' the noun 'cat'. In general, [[relative clause]]s and attributive prepositional phrases follow the noun they modify.\n\n[[Attributive]] prepositional phrases, which are dependent on nouns, include genitives (''la libro de Johano'' 'John's book') as well as ''la kato en la \u011dardeno'' 'the cat in the garden' in the example above. Their order cannot be reversed: neither ''*la de Johano libro'' nor ''*la en la \u011dardeno kato'' is possible. This behavior is more restrictive than prepositional phrases which are dependent on verbs, and which can be moved around: both ''\u0109asis en la \u011dardeno'' and ''en la \u011dardeno \u0109asis'' are acceptable for 'chased in the garden'.\n\nRelative clauses are similar, in that they are attributive and are subject to the same word-order constraint, except that rather than being linked by a preposition, the two elements are linked by a [[relative pronoun]] such as ''kiu'' 'which':\n:''fu\u011dis la kato, kiun \u011di \u0109asis'' 'the cat which it chased fled'\n:''mi vidis la hundon, kiu \u0109asis la katon'' 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\nNote that the noun and its adjacent relative pronoun do not agree in case. Rather, their cases depend on their relationships with their respective verbs.<ref>This is parallel to the rather archaic distinction in English between 'who' and 'whom'. Other sequences of case are possible, though with different readings: ''fu\u011dis la hundo, kiu \u0109asis \u011din'' 'the dog which chased it fled'; ''mi vidis la katon, kiun la hundo \u0109asis'' 'I saw the cat, which the dog chased'.</ref> However, they do agree in number:\n:''fu\u011dis la kato'''j''', kiu'''j'''n \u011di \u0109asis'' 'the cat'''s''' which it chased fled'\n\nOther word orders are possible, as long as the relative pronoun remains adjacent to the noun it depends on:\n:''fu\u011dis la kato, kiun \u0109asis \u011di'' 'the cat which it chased fled'\n:''vidis mi la hundon, kiu la katon \u0109asis'' 'I saw the dog which chased the cat'\n\n===Clause order===\n[[Coordinate conjunction|Coordinate clauses]] allow flexible word order, but tend to be [[iconicity|iconic]]. For example, in\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon kaj la kato fu\u011dis'' 'the dog chased the cat and the cat fled',\nthe inference is that the cat fled after the dog started to chase it, not that the dog chased a cat which was already fleeing. For the latter reading, the clause order would be reversed:\n:''la kato fu\u011dis, kaj la hundo \u0109asis \u011din'' 'the cat fled, and the dog chased it'\nThis distinction is lost in [[subordinate clause]]s such as the relative clauses in the previous section:\n:''la hundo \u0109asis la katon, kiu fu\u011dis'' 'the dog chased the cat(,) which fled'\nIn written English, a comma disambiguates the two readings, but both typically have a comma in Esperanto.\n\nNon-relative subordinate clauses are similarly restricted. They follow the [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ''ke'' 'that', as in,\n:''Mi estas certa, ke vi havos brilan sukceson'' 'I am certain that you will have a brilliant success'.\n\n==Non-Indo-European aspects==\nEsperanto's vocabulary, [[syntax]], and [[semantics]] derive predominantly from Indo-European national languages. Roots are typically [[Romance languages|Romance]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] in origin. The semantics shows a significant [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence.\n\nIt is often claimed that there are elements of the grammar which are not found in these language families. Frequently mentioned is Esperanto's [[Agglutination|agglutinative morphology]] based on invariant morphemes, and the subsequent lack of [[ablaut]] (internal inflection of its [[root word|roots]]), which Zamenhof himself thought would prove alien to non-Indo-European language speakers. Ablaut is an element of all the source languages; an English example is ''song sing sang sung.'' However, the majority of words in all Indo-European languages inflect without ablaut, as ''cat, cats'' and ''walk, walked'' do in English. (This is the so-called [[strong inflection|strong]]\u2013[[weak inflection|weak]] dichotomy.) Historically, many Indo-European languages have expanded the range of their 'weak' inflections, and Esperanto has merely taken this development closer to its logical conclusion, with the only remaining ablaut being frozen in a few sets of semantically related roots such as ''pli'', ''plej'', ''plu'' (more, most, further), ''tre'', ''tro'' (very, too much), and in the verbal morphemes ''\u2011as'', ''\u2011anta'', ''\u2011ata''; ''\u2011is'', ''\u2011inta'', ''\u2011ita''; ''\u2011os'', ''\u2011onta'', ''\u2011ota''; and ''\u2011us''.\n\nOther features often cited as being nonstandard for an Indo-European language, such as the dedicated suffixes for different parts of speech, or the ''-o'' suffix for singular nouns, actually do occur in Indo\u2011European languages such as Russian.<ref>For example, Russian neuter and feminine nouns end in singular ''-o'' and ''-a,'' adjectives in ''-oje'' and ''-aja,'' adverbs in ''-o'' and ''-e,'' etc.; ''cf.'' also Proven\u00e7al ''la fenestro'' (the window), which is identical to Esperanto ''la fenestro''.</ref> More pertinent is the accusative plural in ''-jn''. Esperanto is superficially similar to the non\u2011Indo\u2011European [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages\u2014that is, it is similar in its mechanics, but not in use. None of these proposed \"non-European\" elements of the original Esperanto proposal were actually taken from non-European or non-Indo-European languages, and any similarities with those languages are accidental.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nEast Asian languages may have had some influence on the development of Esperanto grammar after its creation. The principally cited candidate is the replacement of predicate adjectives with verbs, such as ''la \u0109ielo bluas'' (the sky is blue) for ''la \u0109ielo estas blua'' and ''mia filino belu!'' (may my daughter be beautiful!) for the ''mia filino estu bela!'' mentioned above.\n\n==Sample text==\nThe [[The Lord's Prayer|Pater noster]], from the [[Unua Libro|first Esperanto publication]] in 1887, illustrates many of the grammatical points presented above:\n\n: ''Patro nia, kiu estas en la \u0109ieloj,\n: ''sanktigata estu Via nomo.\n: ''Venu Via regno,\n: ''fari\u011du Via volo,\n: ''kiel en la \u0109ielo, tiel anka\u016d sur la tero.\n: ''Nian panon \u0109iutagan donu al ni hodia\u016d.\n: ''Kaj pardonu al ni niajn \u015duldojn,\n: ''kiel anka\u016d ni pardonas al niaj \u015duldantoj.\n: ''Kaj ne konduku nin en tenton,\n: ''sed liberigu nin de la malbono.\n: ''(\u0108ar Via estas la regno kaj la potenco\n: ''kaj la gloro eterne.)\n: ''Amen.''\n\nThe morphologically complex words (see [[Esperanto vocabulary#Word formation|Esperanto word formation]]) are:\n:{| class=wikitable\n| colspan=\"4\" | ''sanktigata''\n|-\n| '''sankt-''' || '''-ig-''' || '''-at-''' || '''-a'''\n|-\n| ''holy'' || causative || passive<br/>participle || adjective\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"being made holy\"\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" | ''fari\u011du''\n|-\n| '''far-''' || '''-i\u011d-''' || '''-u'''\n|-\n| ''do'' || middle<br/>voice || jussive\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | \"be done\"\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=4 | ''\u0109iutagan''\n|-\n| '''\u0109iu-''' || '''tag-''' || '''-a''' || '''-n'''\n|-\n| ''every'' || ''day'' || adjective || accusative\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"daily\"\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=4 | ''\u015duldantoj''\n|-\n| '''\u015duld-''' || '''-ant-''' || '''-o''' || '''-j'''\n|-\n| ''owe'' || active<br/>participle || noun || plural\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"debtors\"\n|}\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"5\" | ''liberigu nin''\n|-\n| '''liber-''' || '''-ig-''' || '''-u''' || '''ni''' || '''-n'''\n|-\n| ''free'' || causative || jussive || ''we'' || accusative\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" | \"free us\"\n|}\n:{| class=wikitable\n| colspan=\"4\" | ''la malbono''\n|-\n| '''la''' || '''mal-''' || '''bon-''' || '''-o'''\n|-\n| generic<br/>article || antonym || ''good'' || noun\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"evil\"\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Dua_Libro\">\n{{\ncite web\n |url= https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20006/20006-h/20006-h.htm\n |title= Dua Libro de l' Lingvo Internacia (1888)\n |last= Zamenhof\n |first= L.

Esperanto speakers are also more prone to being against globalization and culture-washing or throwing away one's native language,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} meaning that while they want to be able to talk to people they also want those people to \"stay unique\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Native speakers ==\n{{main|Native Esperanto speakers}}\nNative Esperanto speakers are people who have acquired [[Esperanto]] as one of their [[native language]]s.  As of 1996, there were 350 or so attested cases of families with native Esperanto speakers.<ref>Corsetti, Renato (1996).

In the majority of such families, the parents had the same native language, though in many the parents had different native languages, and only Esperanto in common.<ref name=Bergen>Benjamin Bergen (2001), \"[http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~bkbergen/papers/NEJCL.pdf Nativization processes in L1 Esperanto]\", ''Journal of Child Language'' 28:575\u2013595 doi:10.1017/S0305000901004779</ref><ref name=\"lindstedt\">{{Cite journal\n |author=Jouko Lindstedt\n |title=Native Esperanto as a Test Case for Natural Language\n | version =\n |publisher=[[University of Helsinki]] \u2013 Department of Slavonic and Baltic Languages and Literatures\n |date=January 2006\n |url=http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/sky/julkaisut/SKY2006_1/1FK60.1.5.LINDSTEDT.pdf\n |format=PDF\n |accessdate=\n}}</ref>\n\n==Gufujo==\n{{main|Gufujo}}\nEsperanto speakers create a makeshift caf\u00e9 (whether in a rented space or someone's home), using Esperanto coins or voucher-like items as well as real money to pay for food and drink. Live music, poetry reading, or literature reading are usual activities. This custom arose in 1995 in order to contrast with the more usual custom of after-convention partying at a bar.\n\n==Religion==\n\nEsperanto has had an influence on certain religious traditions ([[Oomoto]], [[Baha'i|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], etc., see [[Esperanto#Religion|Esperanto and religion]]). While some Esperantists subscribe to these beliefs, they are not necessarily common, and are certainly not required or encouraged by any Esperanto groups.\n\n==Literature==\n{{main|Esperanto literature}}\nBooks that are translated to Esperanto are not usually internationally famous books, because everyone can already read those in another language that they know. For example, [[Natsume S\u014dseki]]'s \"[[Kokoro]]\" does not exist but several Japanese crime novels, and several Icelandic novels, that have never been translated to English (or any other language) have been translated to Esperanto. One reason for this is that people are actually translating their favourite stories instead of the famous stories, and another is that it's simply cheaper and easier to get the rights to translate a small-time book compared to a famous one.\n\nThe first [[Harry Potter]] book, for example, was translated and the translator enquired about how to purchase translating rights so the book could be published, but [[J.K. Rowling]] refused to allow it to be published in Esperanto (despite Harry Potter being one of the most-translated books in the whole world). In lieu of physical books, the translation now exists as a free download on the internet.\n\nAs Esperanto speakers were persecuted throughout WWII (Esperanto was banned in Germany and the Soviet Union), and even today might be mocked by journalists and the average person, oppression and acceptance have become strong themes in Esperanto writing and conversation.\n\nThere are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazines]]. This is despite that Esperanto has only existed for around 100 years. In comparison, the entire literature of Iceland (a country created in the 900s, and with a population of around 320,000 people) totals to fewer than 50,000 books.<ref>http://blog.archive.org/2011/01/29/all-icelandic-literature-to-go-online/</ref>\n\n==Pasporta Servo==\n\nMany speakers travel the world using the [[Pasporta Servo]] which is a free couchsurfing and homestay service combined, meaning that their trips are possible because they don't have to pay for lodging while at the same time they stay with people who speak a language they know fluently. Many people have commented that this is also a useful tool for actual immigrants, as Esperanto speakers are normally much friendlier {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} and more willing to see the immigrant as a \"human\" compared to the normal natives of the country. For example, it's suggested that an English speaker in Japan should make friends with Esperanto speakers instead, because the Esperanto speakers won't \"simply use the friendship as a way to get free English lessons\".\n\n==Writing==\n\nEsperanto was originally a language that one had to learn entirely through books, and even today most people live apart from each other and converse through the internet, so writing and reading are a big part of Esperanto culture. Most people have created or translated some sort of written work whether fiction or nonfiction, published or available to read online for free.\n\nPenpals have been popular since Esperanto's earliest days, as Esperanto was originally advertised as a language where you could \"send a letter with a message, short list of grammar rules and a dictionary to a complete stranger, and they'll be able to look up the words and write a coherent reply back\". Many people did indeed do this in order to recruit more Esperanto speakers.\n\nAt the time, in the early 1900s, there was no major world language that could be used \"anywhere\" and it was difficult to get accurate information about foreign countries. On top of that, things like stamp collecting were popular hobbies for children. In the modern day, most Esperanto speakers talk to each other through the internet \u2014 which is just the modern version of a penpal.\n\n''[[Monato]]'' (\"month\") is a general news magazine \"like a genuinely international ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' or ''[[Newsweek]]''\", written by local correspondents.\n\nA magazine for the blind, ''A\u016droro'', has been published since 1920 and in general, Esperanto hosts the largest Braille publications in the world \u2014 starting in the early 1900s Esperanto was taught in schools of the blind in Europe, and that is where the trend started.\n\n''[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]'' is the magazine used by the World Esperanto Association to inform its members about everything happening in the Esperanto community.\n\nThere are many more magazines created by individual Esperanto clubs from towns in places such as from Japan and China.\n\n==Conventions==\n\nMany people wear their country's traditional clothing to Esperanto conventions, whether or not they would ever wear it in their own country. Swedish people, for example, who usually never wear their traditional clothing in their own country, may still wear traditional clothing for any meeting involving Esperanto speakers.\n\nEvery year, the World Congress of Esperanto ({{lang-eo|Universala Kongreso de Esperanto}}), which is held in different countries around the world according to year (though it mostly takes place in Europe). Each convention draws in an average of 1500\u20133000 attendees, and the best-attended conferences are those held in [[Central Europe|Central]] or [[Eastern Europe]] (generally meaning Poland, Hungary etc.), as Esperanto is an option for fulfilling mandatory foreign-language requirements in Hungarian schools, and the creator of Esperanto came from Poland (see statistics at [[World Congress of Esperanto]]).<ref name=\"Johnson: Simple, logical and doomed\">{{cite web | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/09/esperanto-0 | title=Johnson: Simple, logical and doomed | date=16 September 2013 | accessdate=16 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n[[Esperanto music]] is usually done in the traditional style of a person's country, but \"international\" music (American pop music, rap music etc.) also exists. Many famous songs are translated to Esperanto as well, for example \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxvUi_MQ3kg La vie en rose]\" and \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yHQxqvdjro En el frente de Gandesa]\" (the links are to the Esperanto versions of the songs on YouTube).\n\nThere are currently radio broadcasts from [[China Radio International]], Melbourne Ethnic Community Radio, [[Radio Habana Cuba]], [[RAI|Radio Audizioni Italiane]] (Rai), [[Radio Polonia]], Radio F.R.E.I. and [[Radio Vatican]]. Many more people have personal podcasts and vlogs.\n\nIn 1964, Jacques-Louis Mah\u00e9 produced the first full-length feature film in Esperanto, entitled ''[[Angoroj]]''. This was followed in 1965 by the first American Esperanto-production: ''[[Incubus (1965 film)|Incubus]]'', starring [[William Shatner]]. Incubus is, however, seen as a common, joke way of first introducing a person to Esperanto as none of the actors even knew how to pronounce Esperanto in the first place, the dialogue is strange and bad due to the scriptwriter not getting a second opinion before the filming was done, and the plot is confusing in general.\n\n[[Internacia Televido]], an internet television channel, began broadcasting in November 2005. Australia is the hotspot of much of the organization behind Esperanto television.\n\nSeveral short [[Esperanto film|films]] have been produced, and at times plays have been recorded \"for television\". {{As of|2003|alt=As of July 2003}}, the Esperanto-language Wikipedia [[:eo:Esperanto-filmo|lists]] 14 films and 3 short films.\n[[Image:2008-07-24 uk pilipovicx 02.JPG|thumb|left|The Serbian actor Sasha Pilipovic presents his cabaret at the [[World Esperanto Congress]], Rotterdam 2008]]\n\nIn 2011, Academy Award-nominated director [[Sam Green (filmmaker)|Sam Green]] (''[[The Weather Underground (film)|The Weather Underground]]''), released a new documentary about Esperanto titled [http://esperantodocumentary.com/ The Universal Language] (La Universala Lingvo.)

Some fan-dubs exist, especially of Disney songs and short scenes, and the quality mirrors that of what would come from any small country or a country \"unused to technology\" (such as Greenland, Kazakhstan, etc.).\n\n==Food==\nAs Esperanto speakers are from all over the world, and families whose children speak Esperanto natively usually have parents from two vastly different countries, recipes incorporating elements from different countries are naturally born. Traditional foods are also enjoyed in settings where a native wouldn't normally mix or eat them.\n\nOne cookbook is ''Internacie kuiri'' \u201cCooking Internationally\u201d by Maria Becker-Meisberger, published by FEL (Flemish Esperanto League), Antwerp 1989, {{ISBN|90-71205-34-7}}. Another is ''Man\u011doj el sanigaj plantoj''  \u201cMeals from Healthy Vegetable Dishes\u201d by Zlata Nani\u0107, published by BIO-ZRNO, Zagreb 2002, {{ISBN|953-97664-5-1}}.\n\nSome Esperanto periodicals, such as ''MONATO'' include recipes from time to time.\n\n==Zamenhof Day==\n[[File:Kastelo Grezijono 1.jpg|thumb|[[Castle of Gr\u00e9silion]], an Esperantist cultural center in France]]\n\nOn December 15 ([[L. L. Zamenhof|L. L. Zamenhof's]] birthday), Esperanto speakers around the world celebrate [[Zamenhof Day]], sometimes called Book Day. It's a common goal to have a book written in Esperanto published on or by that day, as Zamenhof was a strong advocate of the idea that in order to spread Esperanto around the world, its speakers need to create a large body of literature.\n\nThe poem ''[[La Espero]]'' is the Esperanto [[anthem]], and most Esperanto speakers know it by heart.

Emotional dispositions are also comparable to character traits, where someone may be said to be generally disposed to experience certain emotions. For example, an irritable person is generally disposed to feel [[irritation]] more easily or quickly than others do. Finally, some theorists place emotions within a more general category of \"affective states\" where affective states can also include emotion-related phenomena such as [[pleasure]] and [[suffering|pain]], motivational states (for example, [[hunger]] or [[curiosity]]), moods, dispositions and traits.<ref>Schwarz, N. H. (1990). Feelings as information: Informational and motivational functions of affective states.

The first viewpoint is that emotions are discrete and fundamentally different constructs while the second viewpoint asserts that emotions can be characterized on a dimensional basis in groupings.\n\n=== Basic emotions ===\n\n[[File:Emotions - 3.svg|thumb|Examples of basic emotions]]\n\nFor more than 40 years, [[Paul Ekman]] has supported the view that emotions are discrete, measurable, and physiologically distinct. Ekman's most influential work revolved around the finding that certain emotions appeared to be universally recognized, even in cultures that were preliterate and could not have learned associations for facial expressions through media. Another classic study found that when participants contorted their facial muscles into distinct facial expressions (for example, disgust), they reported subjective and physiological experiences that matched the distinct facial expressions. His research findings led him to classify six emotions as basic: [[anger]], [[disgust]], [[fear]], [[happiness]], [[sadness]] and [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]].<ref name=\"Handel\">{{cite web |last=Handel |first=Steven | name-list-format = vanc |title=Classification of Emotions |url=http://www.theemotionmachine.com/classification-of-emotions |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref> Later in his career,<ref name=\"Ekman and Cordaro\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekman P, Cordaro DT | year = 2011 | title = What is meant by calling emotions basic. Emotion review | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 364\u2013370}}</ref> Ekman theorized that other universal emotions may exist beyond these six. In light of this, recent cross-cultural studies led by Daniel Cordaro and Dacher Keltner, both former students of Ekman, extended the list of universal emotions. In addition to the original six, these studies provided evidence for [[amusement]], [[awe]], [[contentment]], [[desire]], [[embarrassment]], [[pain]], [[relief]], and [[sympathy]] in both facial and vocal expressions. They also found evidence for [[boredom]], [[confusion]], [[interest]], [[pride]], and [[shame]] facial expressions, as well as [[contempt]], [[interest]], [[relief]], and [[wikt:triumph|triumph]] vocal expressions.<ref name=\"Cordaro, Keltner, Tshering, Wangchuk and Flynn\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cordaro DT, Keltner D, Tshering S, Wangchuk D, Flynn LM | year = 2016| title = The voice conveys emotion in ten globalized cultures and one remote village in Bhutan. | volume = 16| issue = 1| pages = 117}}</ref><ref name=\"Cordaro, Sun, Keltner, Kamble and Huddar and McNeil\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Cordaro DT, Sun R, Keltner D, Kamble S, Huddar N, McNeil G | year = 2017| title = Universals and cultural variations in 22 emotional expressions across five cultures.}}</ref><ref name=\"Keltner, Oatley and Jenkins\">{{cite journal | last1 = Keltner | last2 = Oatley | last3 = Jenkins | title = Understanding emotions.

The complex emotions could arise from cultural conditioning or association combined with the basic emotions. Alternatively, similar to the way [[primary color]]s combine, ''primary emotions'' could blend to form the full spectrum of human emotional experience. For example, interpersonal [[anger]] and [[disgust]] could blend to form [[contempt]].

This led the way for animal research on emotions and the eventual determination of the neural underpinnings of emotion.\n\n; Contemporary\n\nMore contemporary views along the [[evolutionary psychology]] spectrum posit that both basic emotions and social emotions evolved to motivate (social) behaviors that were adaptive in the ancestral environment.<ref name = \"Gaulin 6\"/> Current research{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} suggests that emotion is an essential part of any human decision-making and planning, and the famous distinction made between reason and emotion is not as clear as it seems. Paul D. MacLean claims that emotion competes with even more instinctive responses, on one hand, and the more abstract reasoning, on the other hand. The increased potential in [[neuroimaging]] has also allowed investigation into evolutionarily ancient parts of the brain. Important neurological advances were derived from these perspectives in the 1990s by [[Joseph E. LeDoux]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e1sio]].\n\nResearch on social emotion also focuses on the physical displays of emotion including body language of animals and humans (see [[affect display]]). For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.<ref name = \"Gaulin 6\"/> Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.<ref name = \"Gaulin 6\"/><ref>Wright, Robert. Moral animal.</ref>\n\n=== Somatic theories ===\n\n[[Somatic marker hypothesis|Somatic]] theories of emotion claim that bodily responses, rather than cognitive interpretations, are essential to emotions. The first modern version of such theories came from [[William James]] in the 1880s. The theory lost favor in the 20th century, but has regained popularity more recently due largely to theorists such as [[John Cacioppo]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cacioppo JT | year = 1998 | title = Somatic responses to psychological stress: The reactivity hypothesis | url = | journal = Advances in psychological science | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 87\u2013114 }}</ref> [[Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e1sio]],<ref name=\"pmid18472250\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Aziz-Zadeh L, Damasio A | title = Embodied semantics for actions: findings from functional brain imaging | journal = Journal of Physiology, Paris | volume = 102 | issue = 1-3 | pages = 35\u20139 | date = 2008 | pmid = 18472250 | doi = 10.1016/j.jphysparis.2008.03.012 }}</ref> [[Joseph E.

In his theory, James proposed that the perception of what he called an \"exciting fact\" directly led to a physiological response, known as \"emotion.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Neil | name-list-format = vanc | title = Physiology of Behavior | publisher = Pearson | series = Emotion | volume = 11th edition | date = January 22, 2012 | page = 388 | isbn = 0205239390}}</ref> To account for different types of emotional experiences, James proposed that stimuli trigger activity in the autonomic nervous system, which in turn produces an emotional experience in the brain. The Danish psychologist [[Carl Lange (physician)|Carl Lange]] also proposed a similar theory at around the same time, and therefore this theory became known as the [[James\u2013Lange theory]]. As James wrote, \"the perception of bodily changes, as they occur, ''is'' the emotion.\" James further claims that \"we feel sad because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble, and either we cry, strike, or tremble because we are sorry, angry, or fearful, as the case may be.\"<ref name=James/>\n\nAn example of this theory in action would be as follows: An emotion-evoking stimulus (snake) triggers a pattern of physiological response (increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.), which is interpreted as a particular emotion (fear). This theory is supported by experiments in which by manipulating the bodily state induces a desired emotional state.<ref>Laird, James, ''Feelings: the Perception of Self'', Oxford University Press</ref> Some people may believe that emotions give rise to emotion-specific actions, for example, \"I'm crying because I'm sad,\" or \"I ran away because I was scared.\" The issue with the James\u2013Lange theory is that of causation (bodily states causing emotions and being ''a priori''), not that of the bodily influences on emotional experience (which can be argued and is still quite prevalent today in biofeedback studies and embodiment theory).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Reisenzein R | year = 1995 | title = James and the physical basis of emotion: A comment on Ellsworth | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 102 | issue = 4| pages = 757\u2013761 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.102.4.757 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough mostly abandoned in its original form, Tim Dalgleish argues that most contemporary neuroscientists have embraced the components of the James-Lange theory of emotions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dalgleish T | year = 2004 | title = The emotional brain | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 582\u201389 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The James\u2013Lange theory has remained influential.

He argued that physiological responses were too slow and often imperceptible and this could not account for the relatively rapid and intense subjective awareness of emotion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Neil | name-list-format = vanc | title = Physiology of Behavior | publisher = Pearson | series = Emotion | volume = 11th edition | date = January 22, 2012 | page = 389 | isbn = 0205239390}}</ref> He also believed that the richness, variety, and temporal course of emotional experiences could not stem from physiological reactions, that reflected fairly undifferentiated fight or flight responses.<ref name=\"Cannon 1929 399\u2013421\">{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Organization for Physiological Homeostasis|journal=Physiological Reviews|year=1929|volume=9|issue=3|pages=399\u2013421|doi=10.1152/physrev.1929.9.3.399}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Walter B.| name-list-format = vanc |title=The James-Lange theory of emotion: A critical examination and an alternative theory.|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=1927|volume=39|pages=106\u2013124|doi=10.2307/1415404}}</ref> An example of this theory in action is as follows: An emotion-evoking event (snake) triggers simultaneously both a physiological response and a conscious experience of an emotion.\n\nPhillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the [[diencephalon]] (particularly the [[thalamus]]), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.<ref name=\"Cannon 1929 399\u2013421\"/>\n\n==== Two-factor theory ====\n{{Main|Two-factor theory of emotion}}\n\n[[Stanley Schachter]] formulated his theory on the earlier work of a Spanish physician, [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]], who injected patients with [[epinephrine]] and subsequently asked them how they felt. Mara\u00f1\u00f3n found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen.  The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear.<ref>{{cite book| authors=Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. Wegner |title=Psychology |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers }}</ref> With his student, [[Jerome E. Singer|Jerome Singer]], Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) ''Gut Reactions''.\n\n=== Cognitive theories ===\n\nWith the two-factor theory now incorporating cognition, several theories began to argue that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts were entirely necessary for an emotion to occur. One of the main proponents of this view was [[Richard Lazarus]] who argued that emotions must have some cognitive [[intentionality]]. The cognitive activity involved in the interpretation of an emotional context may be conscious or unconscious and may or may not take the form of conceptual processing.\n\nLazarus' theory is very influential; emotion is a disturbance that occurs in the following order:\n\n# Cognitive appraisal\u2014The individual assesses the event cognitively, which cues the emotion.\n# Physiological changes\u2014The cognitive reaction starts biological changes such as increased heart rate or pituitary adrenal response.\n# Action\u2014The individual feels the emotion and chooses how to react.\n\nFor example: Jenny sees a snake.\n\n# Jenny cognitively assesses the snake in her presence. Cognition allows her to understand it as a danger.\n# Her brain activates the adrenal glands which pump adrenaline through her blood stream, resulting in increased heartbeat.\n# Jenny screams and runs away.\n\nLazarus stressed that the quality and intensity of emotions are controlled through cognitive processes. These processes underline coping strategies that form the emotional reaction by altering the relationship between the person and the environment.\n\n[[George Mandler]] provided an extensive theoretical and empirical discussion of emotion as influenced by cognition, consciousness, and the autonomic nervous system in two books (Mind and Emotion, 1975, and Mind and Body: Psychology of Emotion and Stress, 1984)\n\nThere are some theories on emotions arguing that cognitive activity in the form of judgments, evaluations, or thoughts are necessary in order for an emotion to occur.\nA prominent philosophical exponent is [[Robert C. Solomon]] (for example, ''The Passions, Emotions and the Meaning of Life'', 1993). Solomon claims that emotions are judgments. He has put forward a more nuanced view which response to what he has called the \u2018standard objection\u2019 to cognitivism, the idea that a judgment that something is fearsome can occur with or without emotion, so judgment cannot be identified with emotion.\nThe theory proposed by [[Nico Frijda]] where appraisal leads to action tendencies is another example.\n\nIt has also been suggested that emotions (affect heuristics, feelings and gut-feeling reactions) are often used as shortcuts to process information and influence behavior.<ref>see the Heuristic\u2013Systematic Model, or HSM, (Chaiken, Liberman, & Eagly, 1989) under [[attitude change]]. Also see the index entry for \"Emotion\" in \"Beyond Rationality: The Search for Wisdom in a Troubled Time\" by Kenneth R. Hammond and in \"Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets\" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.</ref> The [[affect infusion model]] (AIM) is a theoretical model developed by Joseph Forgas in the early 1990s that attempts to explain how emotion and mood interact with one's ability to process information.\n\n; Perceptual theory\n\nTheories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion (Goldie, 2007). A recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves ''perceive'' the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book ''Gut Reactions'', and psychologist James Laird's book ''Feelings''.\n\n; Affective events theory\n\n[[Affective events theory]] is a communication-based theory developed by Howard M. Weiss and Russell Cropanzano (1996), that looks at the causes, structures, and consequences of emotional experience (especially in work contexts). This theory suggests that emotions are influenced and caused by events which in turn influence attitudes and behaviors. This theoretical frame also emphasizes ''time'' in that human beings experience what they call emotion episodes\u2014 a \"series of emotional states extended over time and organized around an underlying theme.\" This theory has been utilized by numerous researchers to better understand emotion from a communicative lens, and was reviewed further by Howard M. Weiss and Daniel J. Beal in their article, \"Reflections on Affective Events Theory\", published in ''Research on Emotion in Organizations'' in 2005.\n\n=== Situated perspective on emotion ===\n\nA situated perspective on emotion, developed by Paul E. Griffiths and Andrea Scarantino, emphasizes the importance of external factors in the development and communication of emotion, drawing upon the [[Situationism (psychology)|situationism]] approach in psychology.<ref>Griffiths, Paul Edmund and Scarantino, Andrea (2005) Emotions in the wild: The situated perspective on emotion.</ref>  This theory is markedly different from both cognitivist and neo-Jamesian theories of emotion, both of which see emotion as a purely internal process, with the environment only acting as a stimulus to the emotion.  In contrast, a situationist perspective on emotion views emotion as the product of an organism investigating its environment, and observing the responses of other organisms.  Emotion stimulates the evolution of social relationships, acting as a signal to mediate the behavior of other organisms.  In some contexts, the expression of emotion (both voluntary and involuntary) could be seen as strategic moves in the transactions between different organisms.  The situated perspective on emotion states that conceptual thought is not an inherent part of emotion, since emotion is an action-oriented form of skillful engagement with the world.  Griffiths and Scarantino suggested that this perspective on emotion could be helpful in understanding phobias, as well as the emotions of infants and animals.\n\n== Genetics ==\n\nEmotions can motivate social interactions and relationships and therefore are directly related with basic [[physiology]], particularly with the [[stress (biology)|stress]] systems. This is important because emotions are related to the anti-stress complex, with an oxytocin-attachment system, which plays a major role in bonding. Emotional [[phenotype]] [[temperament]]s affect social connectedness and fitness in complex social systems (Kurt Kortschal 2013). These characteristics are shared with other species and taxa and are due to the effects of [[gene]]s and their continuous transmission. Information that is encoded in the DNA sequences provides the blueprint for assembling proteins that make up our cells. [[Zygote]]s require genetic information from their parental germ cells, and at every [[speciation]] event, heritable traits that have enabled its ancestor to survive and reproduce successfully are passed down along with new traits that could be potentially beneficial to the offspring.\n\nIn the five million years since the [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]] leading to modern humans and [[chimpanzee]]s split, only about 1.2% of their genetic material has been modified. This suggests that everything that separates us from chimpanzees must be encoded in that very small amount of DNA, including our behaviors. Students that study animal behaviors have only identified intraspecific examples of gene-dependent behavioral phenotypes. In [[vole]]s (Microtus spp.) minor genetic differences have been identified in a [[vasopressin receptor]] gene that corresponds to major species differences in [[social organization]] and the [[mating system]] (Hammock & Young 2005).\nAnother potential example with behavioral differences is the [[FOXP2|FOCP2]] gene, which is involved in neural circuitry handling [[speech]] and [[language]] (Vargha-Khadem et al. 2005). Its present form in humans differed from that of the chimpanzees by only a few mutations and has been present for about 200,000 years, coinciding with the beginning of modern humans (Enard et al. 2002). Speech, language, and social organization are all part of the basis for emotions.\n\n== Neurocircuitry ==\n\nBased on discoveries made through neural mapping of the [[limbic system]], the [[neurobiological]] explanation of human emotion is that emotion is a pleasant or unpleasant mental state organized in the limbic system of the [[mammalian brain]]. If distinguished from reactive responses of [[reptile]]s, emotions would then be mammalian elaborations of general [[vertebrate]] arousal patterns, in which [[neurochemical]]s (for example, [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]], and [[serotonin]]) step-up or step-down the brain's activity level, as visible in body movements, gestures and postures. Emotions can likely be mediated by [[pheromone]]s (see [[fear]]).<ref name=\"Givens\">{{cite web|last=Givens |first=David B. | name-list-format = vanc  |title=Emotion |url=http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/emotion.htm |work=Center for Nonverbal Studies |access-date=7 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140523192511/http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/emotion.htm |archive-date=23 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor example, the emotion of [[love]] is proposed to be the expression of [[paleocircuits]] of the mammalian brain (specifically, modules of the [[cingulate gyrus]]) which facilitate the care, feeding, and grooming of offspring. Paleocircuits are neural platforms for bodily expression configured before the advent of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] [[neuronal circuit|circuits]] for speech. They consist of pre-configured pathways or networks of [[nerve cell]]s in the [[forebrain]], [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]].\n\nThe motor centers of [[reptile]]s react to sensory cues of vision, sound, touch, chemical, gravity, and motion with pre-set body movements and programmed postures. With the arrival of night-active [[mammal]]s, smell replaced vision as the dominant sense, and a different way of responding arose from the [[olfactory]] sense, which is proposed to have developed into [[mammal]]ian emotion and emotional memory. The mammalian brain invested heavily in [[olfaction]] to succeed at night as reptiles slept\u2014one explanation for why olfactory lobes in mammalian brains are proportionally larger than in the reptiles. These odor pathways gradually formed the neural blueprint for what was later to become our limbic brain.<ref name=\"Givens\"/>\n\n[[File:L\u00f6vheim cube of emotion.svg|thumb|[[L\u00f6vheim cube of emotion]]]]\n\nEmotions are thought to be related to certain activities in brain areas that direct our attention, motivate our behavior, and determine the significance of what is going on around us. Pioneering work by [[Paul Broca|Broca]] (1878), [[James Papez|Papez]] (1937), and [[Paul D. MacLean|MacLean]] (1952) suggested that emotion is related to a group of structures in the center of the brain called the [[limbic system]], which includes the [[hypothalamus]], [[cingulate cortex]], [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], and other structures. More recent research has shown that some of these [[limbic system|limbic structures]] are not as directly related to emotion as others are while some non-limbic structures have been found to be of greater emotional relevance.\n\nIn 2011, L\u00f6vheim proposed a direct relation between specific combinations of the levels of the signal substances [[dopamine]], [[noradrenaline]] and [[serotonin]] and eight basic emotions. A model was presented where the signal substances form the axes of a coordinate system, and the eight basic emotions according to [[Silvan Tomkins]] are placed in the eight corners. Anger is, according to the model, for example produced by the combination of low serotonin, high dopamine and high noradrenaline.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = L\u00f6vheim H | title = A new three-dimensional model for emotions and monoamine neurotransmitters | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 341\u20138 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22153577 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.11.016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Prefrontal cortex ===\n\nThere is ample evidence that the left [[prefrontal cortex]] is activated by stimuli that cause positive approach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kringelbach ML, O'Doherty J, Rolls ET, Andrews C | title = Activation of the human orbitofrontal cortex to a liquid food stimulus is correlated with its subjective pleasantness | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1064\u201371 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 12967923 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.10.1064 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.67.541 }}</ref> If attractive stimuli can selectively activate a region of the brain, then logically the converse should hold, that selective activation of that region of the brain should cause a stimulus to be judged more positively.

[[Human sciences]] study the role of emotions in mental processes, disorders, and neural mechanisms. In [[psychiatry]], emotions are examined as part of the discipline's study and treatment of mental disorders in humans. [[Nursing]] studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. [[Psychology]] examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In [[neuroscience]] sub-fields such as [[social neuroscience]] and [[affective neuroscience]], scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In [[linguistics]], the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In [[education]], the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.\n\n[[Social science]]s often examine emotion for the role that it plays in human culture and social interactions. In [[sociology]], emotions are examined for the role they play in human society, social patterns and interactions, and culture. In [[anthropology]], the study of humanity, scholars use ethnography to undertake contextual analyses and cross-cultural comparisons of a range of human activities. Some anthropology studies examine the role of emotions in human activities. In the field of [[communication sciences]], critical organizational scholars have examined the role of emotions in organizations, from the perspectives of managers, employees, and even customers. A focus on emotions in organizations can be credited to [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]]'s concept of [[emotional labor]].

In [[criminology]], a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as [[anomie]] theory and studies of \"toughness,\" aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In [[law]], which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in [[tort law]] claims for compensation and in [[criminal law]] prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In [[political science]], emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.\n\nIn [[philosophy]], emotions are studied in sub-fields such as [[ethics]], the [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]] (for example, [[sensory\u2013emotional]] values, and matters of [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] and [[sentimentality]]), and the [[philosophy of music]] (see also [[Music and emotion]]). In [[history]], scholars examine documents and other sources to interpret and analyze past activities; speculation on the emotional state of the authors of historical documents is one of the tools of interpretation. In [[literature]] and film-making, the expression of emotion is the cornerstone of genres such as drama, melodrama, and romance. In [[communication studies]], scholars study the role that emotion plays in the dissemination of ideas and messages. Emotion is also studied in non-human animals in [[ethology]], a branch of zoology which focuses on the scientific study of animal behavior. Ethology is a combination of laboratory and field science, with strong ties to ecology and evolution. Ethologists often study one type of behavior (for example, [[aggression]]) in a number of unrelated animals.\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe [[history of emotions]] has become an increasingly popular topic recently, with some scholars{{Who|date=June 2017}} arguing that it is an [[essentialism|essential]] category of analysis, not unlike [[Social stratification|class]], [[Race (human categorization)#Social constructions|race]], or [[Gender essentialism|gender]]. Historians, like other social scientists, assume that emotions, feelings and their expressions are regulated in different ways by both different cultures and different historical times, and the [[social constructivism|constructivist]] school of history claims even that some sentiments and [[meta-emotions]], for example [[Schadenfreude]], are learnt and not only regulated by culture. Historians of emotion trace and analyse the changing norms and rules of feeling, while examining emotional regimes, codes, and lexicons from social, cultural, or political history perspectives. Others focus on the history of [[medicine]], [[science]], or [[psychology]]. What somebody can and may feel (and show) in a given situation, towards certain people or things, depends on [[social norms]] and rules; thus historically variable and open to change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/history-of-emotions |title=History of Emotions &#124; Max Planck Institute for Human Development |publisher=Mpib-berlin.mpg.de |access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> Several research centers have opened in the past few years in Germany, England, Spain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unav.edu/web/instituto-cultura-y-sociedad/cultura-emocional-e-identidad |title=Cultura Emocional E Identidad |publisher=unav.edu |access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref> Sweden, and Australia.\n\nFurthermore, research in [[historical trauma]] suggests that some [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] emotions can be passed on from parents to offspring to second and even third generation, presented as examples of [[transgenerational trauma]].\n\n=== Sociology ===\n{{Main|Sociology of emotions}}\n\nA common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (for example, anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (for example, increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (for example, smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational [[sensory cue|cues]].<ref name=\"Thoits, P. A. 1989\"/> One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009).<ref>Turner, J. H. (2007). Human emotions: A sociological theory. London: Routledge.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner JH | year = 2009 | title = The sociology of emotion: Basic Theoretical arguments | url = | journal = Emotion Review | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 340\u2013354 | doi=10.1177/1754073909338305}}</ref> Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.\n\nAttempts are frequently made to regulate emotion according to the conventions of the society and the situation based on many (sometimes conflicting) demands and expectations which originate from various entities. The emotion of anger is in many cultures discouraged in girls and women (expression of anger is also discouraged in men because a man is seen as a threat if he shows anger, which causes people to avoid him or treat him as a danger - particularly women), while fear is discouraged in boys and men. Expectations attached to social roles, such as \"acting as man\" and not as a woman, and the accompanying \"feeling rules\" contribute to the differences in expression of certain emotions. Some cultures encourage or discourage happiness, sadness, or jealousy, and the free expression of the emotion of disgust is considered socially unacceptable in most cultures. Some social institutions are seen as based on certain emotion, such as [[love]] in the case of contemporary institution of [[marriage]]. In advertising, such as health campaigns and political messages, emotional appeals are commonly found. Recent examples include no-smoking health campaigns and political campaigns emphasizing the fear of terrorism.\n\nSociological attention to emotion has varied over time. [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] (1915/1965)<ref>Durkheim, E. (1915/1912). The elementary forms of the religious life, trans. J. W. Swain. New York: Free Press.</ref> wrote about the collective effervescence or emotional energy that was experienced by members of totemic rituals in Australian aborigine society. He explained how the heightened state of emotional energy achieved during totemic rituals transported individuals above themselves giving them the sense that they were in the presence of a higher power, a force, that was embedded in the sacred objects that were worshipped. These feelings of exaltation, he argued, ultimately lead people to believe that there were forces that governed sacred objects.\n\nIn the 1990s, sociologists focused on different aspects of specific emotions and how these emotions were socially relevant. For Cooley (1992),<ref>Cooley, C. H. (1992). Human nature and the social order. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers.</ref> pride and shame were the most important emotions that drive people to take various social actions. During every encounter, he proposed that we monitor ourselves through the \"looking glass\" that the gestures and reactions of others provide. Depending on these reactions, we either experience pride or shame and this results in particular paths of action. Retzinger (1991)<ref>Retzinger, S. M. (1991). Violent emotions: Shame and rage in marital quarrels. London: SAGE.</ref> conducted studies of married couples who experienced cycles of rage and shame. Drawing predominantly on Goffman and Cooley's work, Scheff (1990)<ref>Scheff, J. (1990). Microsociology: discourse, emotion and social structure. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref> developed a micro sociological theory of the social bond. The formation or disruption of social bonds is dependent on the emotions that people experience during interactions.\n\nSubsequent to these developments, Randall Collins (2004)<ref>Collins, R. (2004). Interaction ritual chains. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</ref> formulated his interaction ritual theory by drawing on Durkheim's work on totemic rituals that was extended by Goffman (1964/2013; 1967)<ref>Goffman, E. (1967). Interaction ritual. New York: Anchor Books.</ref><ref>Goffman, E. (1964/2013). Encounters: Two studies in the sociology of interactions. Mansfiled Centre, CT: Martino Publishing.</ref> into everyday focused encounters. Based on interaction ritual theory, we experience different levels or intensities of emotional energy during face-to-face interactions. Emotional energy is considered to be a feeling of confidence to take action and a boldness that one experiences when they are charged up from the collective effervescence generated during group gatherings that reach high levels of intensity.\n\nThere is a growing body of research applying the sociology of emotion to understanding the learning experiences of students during classroom interactions with teachers and other students (for example, Milne & Otieno, 2007;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Milne C, Otieno T | year = 2007 | title = Understanding engagement: Science demonstrations and emotional energy | url = | journal = Science Education | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 532\u2013553 | doi = 10.1002/sce }}</ref> Olitsky, 2007;<ref>Olitsky, S.

These studies show that learning subjects like science can be understood in terms of classroom interaction rituals that generate emotional energy and collective states of emotional arousal like emotional climate.\n\nApart from interaction ritual traditions of the sociology of emotion, other approaches have been classed into one of 6 other categories (Turner, 2009) including:\n\n# evolutionary/biological theories,\n# symbolic interactionist theories,\n# dramaturgical theories,\n# ritual theories,\n# power and status theories,\n# stratification theories, and\n# exchange theories.\n\nThis list provides a general overview of different traditions in the sociology of emotion that sometimes conceptualise emotion in different ways and at other times in complementary ways. Many of these different approaches were synthesized by Turner (2007) in his sociological theory of human emotions in an attempt to produce one comprehensive sociological account that draws on developments from many of the above traditions.\n\n<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargha-Khadem F, Gadian DG, Copp A, Mishkin M | title = FOXP2 and the neuroanatomy of speech and language | journal = Nature Reviews.

James was an American psychologist and philosopher who wrote about educational psychology, psychology of religious experience/mysticism, and the philosophy of pragmatism. Lange was a Danish physician and psychologist. Working independently, they developed the [[James\u2013Lange theory]], a hypothesis on the origin and nature of emotions. The theory states that within human beings, as a response to experiences in the world, the autonomic nervous system creates physiological events such as muscular tension, a rise in heart rate, perspiration, and dryness of the mouth. Emotions, then, are feelings which come about as a result of these physiological changes, rather than being their cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra| name-list-format = vanc |title=What Is the James-Lange Theory of Emotion?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/jindex/g/jameslange.htm|access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Silvan Tomkins]] (1911\u20131991) developed the Affect theory and Script theory.

Stockdale.jpg|alt=|thumb|Prisoner of war [[James Stockdale]] receiving the [[Medal of Honor]] from American president [[Gerald Ford]]; Stockdale was able to retain his sanity during capture by relying on the philosophy of Epictetus]]\n==== James Stockdale ====\nThe philosophy of Epictetus is well known in the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] through the writings and example of [[James Stockdale]], the 1992 [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidential candidate]] of [[Ross Perot presidential campaign, 1992|Ross Perot]] and a [[fighter pilot]] who was shot down while serving in the [[Vietnam War]].  He was introduced to the works of Epictetus while at [[Stanford University]].  In ''Courage under Fire: Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior'' (1993), Stockdale credits Epictetus with helping him endure his seven and a half years in captivity, which included torture and four years in [[solitary confinement]].<ref>Stockdale, James Bond. 1993. ''Courage Under Fire: Testing Epictetus's Doctrines in a Laboratory of Human Behavior.'' Stanford: Hoover Institution/Stanford University.</ref>   When he was shot down, he reportedly said to himself \"I'm leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus!\" as he bailed out.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jul/08/guardianobituaries.usa Obituary: Vice Admiral James Stockdale] The Guardian 2005</ref>\n\nQuoting Epictetus, Stockdale concludes the book with: <blockquote>\"The emotions of grief, pity, and even affection are well-known disturbers of the soul. Grief is the most offensive; Epictetus considered the suffering of grief an act of evil. It is a willful act, going against the will of God to have all men share happiness.\"<ref> Stockdale, ''Courage Under Fire'', p. 235</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n==== Marcus Aurelius ====\nThe philosophy of Epictetus was an influence on the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] (121 to 180 A.D.) whose reign was marked by wars with the resurgent [[Parthia]] in western [[Asia]] and against the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] in [[Europe]]. Aurelius quotes from Epictetus repeatedly in his own work, ''[[Meditations]]'', written during his campaigns in central Europe.<ref>Marcus Aurelius, i. 7; iv. 41; vii. 19; xi. 33\u201337</ref>\n\n==== Simplicius of Cilicia ====\nIn the sixth century, the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], who was persecuted for his pagan beliefs during the reign of [[Justinian]], wrote an extant commentary on the ''Enchiridion''. At the end of the commentary Simplicius wrote: \"Nor does my writing this commentary prove beneficial to others only, for I myself have already found great advantage from it, by the agreeable diversion it has given me, in a season of trouble and public calamity.\" [[George Long (scholar)|George Long]] considered the commentary \"worth reading\", but then opined, \"But how many will read it? Perhaps one in a million.\"<ref>George Long, (1890), ''The Discourses of Epictetus, with the Encheridion and Fragments'', page 390. George Bell and Sons</ref>\n\n==== Bernard Stiegler ====\nWhen [[Bernard Stiegler]] was imprisoned for five years for armed robbery in [[France]], he assembled an \"ensemble of disciplines,\" which he called (in reference to Epictetus) his ''melete''. This ensemble amounted to a practice of reading and writing that Stiegler derived from the writings of Epictetus. This led to his transformation, and upon being released from incarceration he became a professional philosopher. Stiegler tells the story of this transformation in his book, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]''.<ref>Bernard Stiegler, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009).</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe philosophy of Epictetus plays a key role in the 1998 novel by [[Tom Wolfe]], ''[[A Man in Full]]''. This was in part the outcome of discussions Wolfe had with James Stockdale (see above). The importance of Epictetus' Stoicism for Stockdale, its role in ''A Man in Full'', and its significance in Ridley Scott's ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' is discussed by William O. Stephens<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/bill.htm William O.

Lydia, the central character, turns often to ''The Golden Sayings of Epictetus''\u2014the latter being a modern selection from the writings of Epictetus, compiled and translated by Hastings Crossley.\n\nA line from the ''Enchiridion'' is used as a title quotation in ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' by [[Laurence Sterne]], which translates to, \"Not things, but opinions about things, trouble men.\"<ref>Laurence Sterne, ''The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'', ed. Ian Campbell Ross (Oxford Univ. Press, 1983), p. 540.</ref> The quotation alludes to a theme of the novel about how the suffering of many of its characters (above all Walter Shandy) is the result of the opinions and assumptions they make about reality. This is similar to [[Shakespeare]]'s \"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\" - Hamlet: Act 2, Scene 2, and [[John Milton]]'s \"The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.\"\n\nEpictetus is mentioned in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' by [[James Joyce]]: in the fifth chapter of the novel the protagonist Stephen Daedalus discusses Epictetus's famous lamp with a dean of his college.<ref>(pgs. 202\u2013203 of the Penguin Edition).</ref> Epictetus also is mentioned briefly in ''[[Franny and Zooey]]'' by [[J. D. Salinger]], and is referred to by [[Theodore Dreiser]] in his novel ''[[Sister Carrie]]''. Both the longevity of Epictetus's life and his philosophy are alluded to in [[John Berryman]]'s poem, \"Of Suicide.\"\n\nEpictetus is referred to, but not mentioned by name, in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s [[sonnet]] \"To a Friend\". Arnold provides three historical personalities as his inspiration and support in difficult times (Epictetus is preceded by [[Homer]] and succeeded by [[Sophocles]]):\n<blockquote>Much he, whose friendship I not long since won,<br>\nThat halting slave, who in Nicopolis<br>\nTaught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son<br>\nCleared Rome of what most shamed him.<ref>Matthew Arnold, [http://www.poetry-online.org/arnold_to_a_friend.htm ''To A Friend'']</ref></blockquote>\n==== Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais ====\nIn the Chapter XXX of [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]]' ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel|Pantagruel]]'' (c.1532), Pantagruel's tutor Epistemon had his head cut off after a battle. After he had his head reattached and was brought back to life, he recounts his experience of the damned in hell: \"Their estate and condition of living is but only changed after a very strange manner;\"...\"After this manner, those that had been great lords and ladies here, got but a poor scurvy wretched living there below. And, on the contrary, the philosophers and others, who in this world had been altogether indigent and wanting, were great lords there in their turn.\"...\"I saw Epictetus there, most gallantly apparelled after the French fashion, sitting under a pleasant arbour, with store of handsome gentlewomen, frolicking, drinking, dancing, and making good cheer, with abundance of crowns of the sun. Above the lattice were written these verses for his device:\n<br>To leap and dance, to sport and play,\n<br>And drink good wine both white and brown,\n<br>Or nothing else do all the day\n<br>But tell bags full of many a crown.\n<br>When he saw me, he invited me to drink with him very courteously, and I being willing to be entreated, we tippled and chopined together most theologically. In the meantime came [[Cyrus]] to beg one farthing of him for the honour of Mercury, therewith to buy a few onions for his supper. No, no, said Epictetus, I do not use in my almsgiving to bestow farthings. Hold, thou varlet, there's a crown for thee; be an honest man.\"\n\n=== Psychology ===\nPsychologist [[Albert Ellis]], the founder of [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]], credited Epictetus with providing a foundation for his system of [[psychotherapy]].<ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/13/031013ta_talk_green Ageless, Guiltless, by Adam Green].</ref><ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article2816649.ece Obituary by Morton Schatzman in ''The Independent''].</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2146455,00.html Obituary by Oliver Burkeman in ''The Guardian''].</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[Kiyozawa Manshi]], a controversial reformer within the [[Higashi Honganji]] branch of [[Jodo Shinshu]] [[Buddhism]] cited Epictetus as one of the three major influences on his spiritual development and thought.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\n=== Acting ===\nEpictetus' philosophy is an influence on the acting method introduced by [[David Mamet]] and [[William H.

While travelling he produced large quantities of coloured [[wash (visual arts)|wash]] drawings in a distinctive style, which he converted later in his studio into oil and [[watercolour]] paintings, as well as prints for his books.<ref>Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles, ''The Great Age of British Watercolours (1750\u20131880)'', p. 318, 1993, Prestel, {{ISBN|3-7913-1254-5}}</ref> His landscape style often shows views with strong sunlight, with intense contrasts of colour.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1883 Lear spent his summers on [[Monte Generoso]], a mountain on the border between the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Ticino]] and the Italian region of [[Lombardy]].

He had a lifelong ambition to illustrate [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poems; near the end of his life a volume with a small number of illustrations was published.\n\n=== ''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1842\u201346) ===\n[[File:Edward Lear - Temple of Venus and Rome, Rome - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Temple of Venus and Roma]], Rome]]\n[[File:Castello di Celano 02.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[Celano]]]]\nIn 1842 Lear began a journey into the [[Italian peninsula]], travelling through the [[Lazio]], [[Rome]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Apulia]], [[Basilicata]], [[Calabria]], and [[Sicily]]. In personal notes, together with drawings, Lear gathered his impressions on the Italian way of life, folk traditions, and the beauty of the ancient monuments. Of particular interest to Lear was the [[Abruzzo]], which he visited in 1843, through the [[Marsica]] (Celano, Avezzano, [[Alba Fucens]], Trasacco) and the plateau of Cinque Miglia ([[Castel di Sangro]] and Alfedena), by an old sheep track of the shepherds.\n\nLear drew a sketch of the medieval village of Albe with Mount Sirente, and described the medieval village of Celano, with the castle of Piccolomini dominating the vast plain of Lago Fucino, which was drained a few years later to promote agricultural development. At Castel di Sangro, Lear described the winter stillness of the mountains and the beautiful basilica.\n\n===Composer and musician===\n[[File:Lear 1887.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|Lear in 1887, a year before his death.]]\nLear primarily played the piano, but he also played the accordion, flute, and guitar. He composed music for many Romantic and Victorian poems, but was known mostly for his many musical settings of Tennyson's poetry. He published four settings in 1853, five in 1859, and three in 1860. Lear's were the only musical settings that Tennyson approved of. Lear also composed music for many of his nonsense songs, including \"The Owl and the Pussy-cat,\" but only two of the scores have survived, the music for \"The Courtship of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B\u00f2\" and \"The Pelican Chorus\". While he never played professionally, he did perform his own nonsense songs and his settings of others' poetry at countless social gatherings, sometimes adding his own lyrics (as with the song \"The Nervous Family\"), and sometimes replacing serious lyrics with nursery rhymes.<ref>Noakes, Vivien. ''Edward Lear: The Life of a Wanderer'', Revised Edition, pp. 99\u2013100, 2004, {{ISBN|9780750937443}}</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\nLear's most fervent and painful friendship was with Franklin Lushington. He met the young barrister in Malta in 1849 and then toured southern Greece with him. Lear developed an infatuation for him that Lushington did not wholly reciprocate. Although they remained friends for almost forty years, until Lear's death, the disparity of their feelings constantly tormented Lear. Indeed, Lear's attempts at male companionship were not always successful; the very intensity of Lear's affections may have doomed these relationships.<ref>Susan Chitty, That Singular Person Called Lear, Atheneum, 1989</ref>\n\nThe closest he came to marriage was two proposals, both to the same woman 46 years his junior, which were not accepted. For companions he relied instead on friends and correspondents, and especially, during later life, on his Albanian [[Souliotes|Souliote]] chef, Giorgis, a faithful friend and, as Lear complained, a thoroughly unsatisfactory chef.<ref>Levi, Peter.

Lear's birthplace area is now marked with a plaque at Bowman's Mews, Islington, in London, and his bicentenary during 2012 was celebrated with a variety of events, exhibitions and lectures in venues across the world including an International Owl and Pussycat Day on his birth anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |title=International Owl & Pussycat Day, 12 May &#124; Just another WordPress.com site |publisher=Teachingnonsenseinschools.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==Author==\n[[File:Edward Lear sketches dated 15 May 1864, from Paddy Leigh Fermor collection.jpg|thumbnail|Edward Lear sketches dated 15 May 1864, from [[Paddy Leigh Fermor]]'s collection.]]\n[[File:Howatke by Edward Lear 1867.jpg|thumb|left|''Howatke'', by Edward Lear, 1867]]\nIn 1846 Lear published ''[[:s:A Book of Nonsense|A Book of Nonsense]],'' a volume of limericks which went through three editions and helped popularize the form and the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. In 1871 he published ''Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany and Alphabets'', which included his most famous nonsense song, ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' which he wrote for the children of his patron [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]]. Many other works followed.\n\nLear's nonsense books were quite popular during his lifetime, but a rumour developed that \"Edward Lear\" was merely a pseudonym, and the books' true author was the man to whom Lear had dedicated the works, his patron the Earl of Derby. Promoters of this rumour offered as evidence that both men were named Edward, and that \"Lear\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Earl.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc.|year=1894|chapter=Introduction|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#introduction3}}</ref>\n[[File:The falls of the Kalama Albania 1851 by Edward Lear 1812-1888.jpg|thumb|''The falls of the Kalama, [[Albania]] 1851]]\nLear's nonsense works are distinguished by a facility of verbal invention and a poet's delight in the sounds of words, both real and imaginary. A stuffed [[rhinoceros]] becomes a \"diaphanous doorscraper.\" A \"blue Boss-Woss\" plunges into \"a perpendicular, spicular, orbicular, quadrangular, circular depth of soft mud.\" His heroes are Quangle-Wangles, Pobbles, and Jumblies. One of his most famous verbal inventions, the phrase \"[[runcible]] spoon,\" occurs in the closing lines of ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]],'' and is now found in many English dictionaries:\n\n:They dined on [[Ground meat|mince]], and slices of [[quince]]\n::Which they ate with a [[runcible|runcible spoon]];\n:And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand,\n::They danced by the light of the moon,\n:::The moon,\n:::The moon,\n:They danced by the light of the moon.\n\nThough famous for his [[neologisms]], Lear used a number of other devices in his works in order to defy [[Schema (psychology)|reader expectations]]. For example, \"Cold Are the Crabs\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ingeb.org/songs/coldaret.html |title=Cold Are the Crabs |publisher=Ingeb.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> conforms to the [[sonnet]] tradition until its dramatically foreshortened last line.\n\n[[Image:1862ca-a-book-of-nonsense--edward-lear-001.jpg|thumb|''A Book of Nonsense'' (c. 1875 James Miller edition) by Edward Lear]]\nToday, limericks are invariably typeset as four plus one lines. Lear's limericks, however, were published in a variety of formats; it appears that Lear wrote them in manuscript in as many lines as there was room for beneath the picture. For the first three editions most are typeset as, respectively, two, five, and three lines. The cover of one edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonsenselit.org/Lear/BoN/index.html |title=Edward Lear, A Book of Nonsense |publisher=Nonsenselit.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16}}</ref> bears an entire limerick typeset in two lines:\n\n:There was an Old Derry down Derry, who loved to see little folks merry;\n:So he made them a book, and with laughter they shook at the fun of that Derry down Derry.\n\nIn Lear's limericks, the first and last lines usually end with the same word rather than rhyming. For the most part they are truly nonsensical and devoid of any punch line or point. They are completely free of the [[off-color humor|bawdyness]] with which the verse form is now associated. A typical thematic element is the presence of a callous and critical \"they.\" An example of a typical Lear limerick:\n\n:There was an Old Man of [[Aosta|A\u00f4sta]],\n:Who possessed a large Cow, but he lost her;\n:But they said, 'Don't you see,\n:she has rushed up a tree?\n:You invidious Old Man of A\u00f4sta!'\n\nLear's self-description in verse, ''How Pleasant to know Mr. Lear,'' ends with this [[stanza]], a reference to his own mortality:\n\n:He reads but he cannot speak Spanish,\n::He cannot abide ginger-beer;\n:Ere the days of his pilgrimage vanish,\n::How pleasant to know Mr. Lear!\n\nFive of Lear's limericks from the Book of Nonsense, in the 1946 Italian translation by [[Carlo Izzo]], were set to music for choir a cappella by [[Goffredo Petrassi]] in 1952.\n\n==Portrayals==\nEdward Lear has been played in radio dramas by [[Andrew Sachs]] in ''The Need for Nonsense'' by [[Julia Blackburn]] ([[BBC Radio 4]], 9 February 2009)<ref>{{BBC programmes|b00hc407|The Need for Nonsense}}</ref> and by [[Derek Jacobi]] in ''By the Coast of Coromandel'' by Lavinia Murray ([[BBC Radio 4]], 21 December 2011).\n\n==Works==\n*''[[Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots]]'' (1832)\n*''Views in Rome and its Environs'' (1841)\n*''Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall'' (1846)\n*''Book of Nonsense'' (1846)\n*''Illustrated Excursions in Italy'' (1846)\n*''[[Mount Timohorit, Albania]]'' (1848)\n*''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Greece and Albania'' (1851)\n*''The falls of the Kalama Albania (1851)\n*''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Southern Calabria'' (1852)\n*''Poems and Songs by Alfred Tennyson'' (1853, 1859, 1860) Twelve total musical settings published, each being for a Tennyson poem.\n*''Journal of a Landscape Painter in Corsica'' (1870)\n*''Nonsense Songs and Stories'' (1870, dated 1871)<ref>{{cite book|editor=Cox, Michael|title=The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-860634-6}}</ref>\n*''Tortoises, Terrapins, and Turtles'' (1872), introduction by [[John Edward Gray|J.E.

It is also closed under [[derivative|differentiation]]. It is not closed under [[series (mathematics)|limits and infinite sums]]. \n\nImportantly, the elementary functions are ''not'' closed under [[antiderivative|integration]], as shown by [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]], see [[Nonelementary integral]]. The [[Liouvillian function]]s are defined as the elementary functions and, recursively, the integrals of the Liouvillian functions.\n\nSome elementary functions, such as roots, logarithms, or [[inverse trigonometric function]]s, are not [[entire function]]s and may be [[multivalued function|multivalued]].\n\nElementary functions were introduced by [[Joseph Liouville]] in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841.<ref>{{harvnb|Liouville|1833a}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Liouville|1833b}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Liouville|1833c}}.</ref>  An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by [[Joseph Fels Ritt]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{harvnb|Ritt|1950}}.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nExamples of elementary functions include:\n* Addition, e.g. (''x''+1)\n* Multiplication, e.g. (2''x'')\n* [[Polynomial]] functions\n* <math>\\dfrac{e^{\\tan x}}{1+x^2}\\sin\\left(\\sqrt{1+(\\ln x)^2}\\right)</math>\n* <math>-i\\ln(x+i\\sqrt{1-x^2}) </math>\n\nThe last function is equal to <math>\\arccos x</math>, the [[Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Logarithmic_forms|inverse cosine]], in the entire [[complex plane]]. Hence, it is an elementary function. \n\n=== Non-elementary functions ===\nAn example of a function that is ''not'' elementary is the [[error function]]\n\n* <math>\\mathrm{erf}(x)=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^x e^{-t^2}\\,dt,</math>\n\na fact that may not be immediately obvious, but can be proven using the [[Risch algorithm]].\n\n* See also the examples in [[Liouvillian_function#Examples|Liouvillian function]] and [[Nonelementary integral]].\n\n==Differential algebra==\n\nThe mathematical definition of an '''elementary function''', or a function in elementary form, is considered in the context of [[differential algebra]].  A differential algebra is an algebra with the extra operation of derivation (algebraic version of differentiation).  Using the derivation operation new equations can be written and their solutions used in [[field extension|extensions]] of the algebra.  By starting with the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational function]]s, two special types of transcendental extensions (the logarithm and the exponential) can be added to the field building a tower containing elementary functions.\n\nA '''differential field''' ''F'' is a field ''F''<sub>0</sub> (rational functions over the [[rational number|rationals]] '''Q''' for example) together with a derivation map ''u''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u2202''u''.  (Here \u2202''u'' is a new function. Sometimes the notation ''u''&prime; is used.) The derivation captures the properties of differentiation, so that for any two elements of the base field, the derivation is linear\n\n: <math>\\partial (u + v) = \\partial u + \\partial v </math>\n\nand satisfies the [[product rule|Leibniz product rule]]\n\n: <math>\\partial(u\\cdot v)=\\partial u\\cdot v+u\\cdot\\partial v\\,.</math>\n\nAn element ''h''  is a constant if ''\u2202h&nbsp;=&nbsp;0''.   If the base field is over the rationals, care must be taken when extending the field to add the needed transcendental constants.\n\nA function ''u'' of a differential extension ''F''[''u''] of a differential field ''F'' is an '''elementary function''' over ''F'' if the function ''u''\n* is [[Algebraic function|algebraic]] over ''F'', or\n* is an '''exponential''', that is, \u2202''u'' = ''u'' \u2202''a''  for ''a'' \u2208 ''F'', or\n* is a '''logarithm''', that is, \u2202''u'' = \u2202''a''&nbsp;/&nbsp;a for ''a'' \u2208 ''F''.\n(this is [[Liouville's theorem (differential algebra)|Liouville's theorem]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Closed-form expression]]\n* [[Differential Galois theory]]\n* [[Algebraic function]]\n* [[Transcendental function]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Liouville\n | first = Joseph\n | author-link = Joseph Liouville\n | title = Premier m\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9termination des int\u00e9grales dont la valeur est alg\u00e9brique\n | journal = Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique\n | year = 1833a\n | volume = tome XIV\n | pages = 124\u2013148\n | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k433678n/f127.item.r=Liouville\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Liouville\n | first = Joseph\n | author-link = Joseph Liouville\n | title = Second m\u00e9moire sur la d\u00e9termination des int\u00e9grales dont la valeur est alg\u00e9brique\n | journal = Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique\n | year = 1833b\n | volume = tome XIV\n | pages = 149\u2013193\n | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k433678n/f152.item.r=Liouville\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Liouville\n | first = Joseph\n | author-link = Joseph Liouville\n | title = Note sur la d\u00e9termination des int\u00e9grales dont la valeur est alg\u00e9brique\n | journal = [[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]\n | year = 1833c\n | volume = 10\n | pages = 347\u2013359\n | url = http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/dms/loader/img/?PID=GDZPPN002139332\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Ritt\n | first = Joseph\n | author-link = Joseph Ritt\n | title = Differential Algebra\n | publisher = [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]]\n | year = 1950\n | url = http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll33/\n | ref = harv\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n | last = Rosenlicht\n | first = Maxwell\n | author-link = Maxwell Rosenlicht\n | title = Integration in finite terms\n | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]\n | year = 1972\n | volume = 79\n | issue = 9\n | pages = 963\u2013972\n | doi = 10.2307/2318066\n | jstor=2318066\n | ref = harv\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Davenport, J.

Although the content is mostly derived from the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus]]'', it is not a summary of the ''Discourses'' but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing [[metaphysics]], Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. The book is thus a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.\n\nThe ''Enchiridion'' was well-known in the ancient world, and in the medieval period it was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries. In the 15th-century it was translated into [[Latin]], and then, with the advent of printing, into multiple European languages. It reached the height of popularity in the 17th century, in parallel with the [[Neostoicism]] movement.\n\n==Title==\nThe word \"encheiridion\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f10\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd}}) is an adjective meaning \"in the hand\" or \"ready to hand\".<ref name=\"matty263\">{{Harvnb|Matheson|1916|p=263}}</ref> The word sometimes meant a handy sword, or dagger, but coupled with the word \"book\" (''biblion'', {{lang-el|\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd}}) it means a handy book or hand-book.<ref name=\"matty263\"/> Epictetus in the ''Discourses'' often speaks of principles which his pupils should have \"ready to hand\" ({{lang-el|\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1}}).<ref name=\"matty263\"/> Common English translations of the title are '''Manual''' or '''Handbook'''.<ref name=\"oldfart_xii\">{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xii}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nThe work consists of fifty-three short chapters typically consisting of a paragraph or two. It was compiled some time in the early 2nd-century.

Along with the next 13 emperors, Jimmu is not considered an actual, historical figure. Historically verifiable Emperors of Japan date from the early sixth century with Kimmei.</ref>\n\n==Traditional narrative==\nKinmei's contemporary title would not have been ''tenn\u014d'', as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven.\"  Alternatively, Kinmei might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\n\n===Events of Kinmei's life===\nBecause of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kinmei in the [[Nihon Shoki]], some believe that he was actually ruling a rival court to that of Emperors [[Emperor Ankan|Ankan]] and [[Emperor Senka|Senka]]. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kinmei's older brother [[Emperor Senka]] that he gained the throne.\n\nAccording to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73;<ref>Varley, p. 121.</ref> and succession passed to the third son of [[Emperor Keitai]].  This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kinmei. He established his court at Shikishima no Kanazashi Palace (\u78ef\u57ce\u5d8b\u91d1\u523a\u5bae) in [[Yamato Province|Yamato]].<ref name=\"brown262\">Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=w4f5FrmIJKIC&pg=PA261&dq=    p. 262].</ref>\n\nThe emperor's chief counselors were:\n* ''[[omi|\u014comi]]'' (Great Imperial chieftain): Soga no Iname no Sukune, also known as [[Soga no Iname]].<ref name = \"brown262\"/>\n* ''[[muraji|\u014cmuraji]]'' (Great Deity chieftain): Monotobe Okoshi no Muraji, also known as [[Mononobe no Okoshi]].<ref name = \"brown262\"/>\n* ''[[muraji|\u014cmuraji]]'' (Great Deity chieftain): [[\u014ctomo no Kanamura|\u014ctomo Kanamura Maro]], also known as\u3000Otomo no Kanamura.<ref name=\"brown262\"/>\n\nAlthough the imperial court was not moved to the [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kinmei's rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the [[Asuka period]] of [[Yamato period|Yamato]] Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of [[Buddhism]] to Japan from [[Baekje]].\n\nAccording to the Nihon Shoki, Emperor Kinmei received a bronze statue of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] as a gift from the king of [[Baekje|Paekche]] King Song Myong (\u8056\u660e\u738b, ''Seimei \u014c'') along with a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. (However, according to the [[J\u014dg\u016b Sh\u014dtoku H\u014d\u014d Teisetsu]], Buddhism was introduced in 538.) This episode is widely regarded as the official introduction of Buddhism to the country.\n\nWith the introduction of a new religion to the court, a deep rift developed between the [[Mononobe clan]], who supported the worship of [[kami|Japan's traditional deities]], and the Soga clan, who supported the adoption of Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the Nihon Shoki, Emperor Kinmei ruled until his death in 571 and was buried in the Hinokuma no Sakai Burial Mound (\u6867\u9688\u5742\u5408\u9675).

He acceded to the throne after the death of his half brother, [[Emperor Bidatsu]].\n\nThe influential courtiers from Emperor Bidatsu's reign, [[Mononobe no Moriya]], also known as Mononobe Yuge no  Moriya no Muraji or as \u014c-muraji Yuge no Moriya, and [[Soga no Umako]] no Sukune, both remained in their positions during the reign of Emperor Y\u014dmei. Umako was the son of Soga Iname no Sukune, and therefore, he would have been one of Emperor Y\u014dmei's cousins.\n\n* '''585''': In the 14th year of Bidatsu''-tenn\u014d'' 's reign (\u654f\u9054\u5929\u768714\u5e74), he died; and the succession (''senso'') was received by his younger brother.

According to [[Nihon Shoki]], Emperor Yomei believed both in Buddhism and Shintoism. Moriya, the most influential supporter of Shintoism, conspired with Emperor Y\u014dmei's brother, Prince Anahobe, and after Emperor Yomei's death they made an abortive attempt to seize the throne. Although Emperor Y\u014dmei is reported to have died from illness, this incident and the brevity of his reign have led some to speculate that he was actually assassinated by Moriya and Prince Anahobe.\n\n[[Image:Yomei tenno-ryo3200.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Y\u014dmei.]]\nThe actual site of Y\u014dmei's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is  known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Osaka.\n\nThe [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Y\u014dmei's [[mausoleum]].

The seven women sovereigns reigning after Suiko were [[Empress K\u014dgyoku|K\u014dgyoku/Saimei]], [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]], [[Empress Genmei|Genmei]], [[Empress Gensh\u014d|Gensh\u014d]], [[Empress K\u014dken|K\u014dken/Sh\u014dtoku]], [[Empress Meish\u014d|Meish\u014d]] and [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi|Go-Sakuramachi]].\n\n==Traditional narrative==\nBefore her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (her ''imina'')<ref>Brown, pp. 264; prior to [[Emperor Jomei]], the personal names of the emperors (their ''iminia'') were very long and people did not generally use them. The number of characters in each name diminished after Jomei's reign.</ref> was Mikekashiya-hime-no-mikoto,<ref>Varley, p. 126.</ref> also called Toyomike Kashikiya hime no Mikoto.<ref>Ashton, William. (2005). ''Nihongi,'' p. 95 n.2.</ref>\n\nEmpress Suiko had several names including Princess Nukatabe and (possibly posthumous) Toyomike Kashikiya. She was the third daughter of [[Emperor Kinmei]]. Her mother was [[Soga no Iname]]'s daughter, [[Soga no Kitashihime]]. Suiko was the younger sister of Emperor Y\u014dmei.  They had the same mother.\n\n===Life===\nEmpress Suiko was a consort to her half-brother, [[Emperor Bidatsu]], but after Bidatsu's first wife died she became his official consort and was given the title \u014ckisaki (official consort of the emperor). She bore seven children.\n\nAfter Bidatsu's death, Suiko's brother, [[Emperor Y\u014dmei]], came to power for about two years before dying of illness. Upon Y\u014dmei's death, another power struggle arose between the [[Soga clan]] and the [[Mononobe clan]], with the Sogas supporting [[Emperor Sushun|Prince Hatsusebe]] and the Mononobes supporting [[Prince Anahobe]]. The Sogas prevailed once again and Prince Hatsusebe acceded to the throne as [[Emperor Sushun]] in 587. However, Sushun began to resent the power of [[Soga no Umako]], the head of the Soga clan, and Umako, perhaps out of fear that Sushun might strike first, had him assassinated by {{nihongo|Yamatoaya no Ataikoma|\u6771\u6f22\u76f4\u99d2}} in 592. When asked to accede to the throne to fill the power vacuum that subsequently developed, Suiko became the first of what would be several examples in Japanese history where a woman was chosen to accede to the throne to avert a power struggle.\n\n* '''593 ''': In the 2nd year of Sushun''-tenn\u014d'' 's reign (\u5d07\u5cfb\u5929\u7687\u4e8c\u5e74), he died; and contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (''senso'')<ref>Varley,  p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]], [[Emperor Y\u014dzei|Y\u014dzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]] and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].</ref> was received by the consort of former Emperor Bidatsu.  Shortly thereafter, Empress Suiko is said to have ascended to the throne (''sokui'').<ref>Titsingh, p. 39; Brown, pp. 263\u2013264; Varley,  pp. 126\u2013127.</ref>\n\nSuiko's contemporary title would not have been ''tenn\u014d'', as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great Queen who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Suiko might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great Queen of Yamato\".\n\n[[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] was appointed regent the following year. Although political power during Suiko's reign is widely viewed as having been wielded by Prince Sh\u014dtoku and Soga no Umako, Suiko was far from powerless. The mere fact that she survived and her reign endured suggests she had significant political skills.\n\nIn 599, an [[earthquake]] destroyed buildings throughout [[Yamato Province]] in what is now [[Nara Prefecture]].<ref>Hammer, Joshua. (2006). ''Yokohama Burning: The Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire that Helped Forge the Path to World War II'', pp. 62\u201363.</ref>\n\nSuiko's refusal to grant Soga no Umako's request that he be granted the imperial territory known as Kazuraki no Agata in 624 is cited as evidence of her independence from his influence. Some of the many achievements under Empress Suiko's reign include the official recognition of Buddhism by the issuance of the Flourishing Three Treasures Edict in 594. Suiko was also one of the first [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchs in Japan and had taken the vows of a [[nun]] shortly before becoming empress.\n\nThe reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] court in 600, the adoption of the [[Twelve Level Cap and Rank System]] in 603 and the adoption of the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604.\n\nThe  adoption of the [[Sexagenary cycle]] calendar (''Jikkan J\u016bnishi'') in Japan is attributed to Empress Suiko in 604.<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric.

One, [[Emperor Jomei|Prince Tamura]], was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu and was supported by the main line of Sogas, including [[Soga no Emishi]]. The other, [[Prince Yamashiro]], was a son of Prince Sh\u014dtoku and had the support of some lesser members of the Soga clan. After a brief struggle within the Soga clan in which one of Prince Yamashiro's main supporters was killed, Prince Tamura was chosen and he acceded to the throne as [[Emperor Jomei]] in 629.\n\nEmpress Suiko ruled for 35 years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070327i1.html \"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl\",] ''Japan Times''. 27 March 2007.</ref>  [[Empress Genmei]], who was followed on the  throne by her daughter, [[Empress Gensho|Empress Gensh\u014d]], remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\n\n[[File:Suiko tenno-Shinagano Yamadano misasagi.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Empress Suiko]]\nThe actual site of Suiko's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This empress is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Osaka.\n\nThe [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Suiko's [[mausoleum]].

When Naka no \u014ce's mother re-ascended, he continued in the role of her heir and crown prince. In this role, he could and did remain active in the political life of Japan.\n\nIn the fifth year of Saimei's reign, [[Baekje|Paekche]] in [[Korea]] was destroyed in 660. Japan assisted Paekche loyals in an attempt to aid the revival of Paekche dynasty. Early in 661, Saimei responded to the situation by leaving her capital in [[Yamato Province]]. Her plan was to lead a military expedition to Korea. The empress stayed in Ishiyu Temporary Palace in [[Iyo Province]], today [[D\u014dgo Onsen]]. In May she arrived at Asakura Palace in the north part of Tsukushi province in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], today a part of [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]. The allied army of Japan and Paekche was preparing for war against [[Silla]], but the death of the empress thwarted those plans.  In 661, Saimei died in the Asakura Palace before the army departed to [[Korea]]. In October her body was brought from Ky\u016bsh\u016b by sea to Port Naniwa-zu (today [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka city]]); and her state funeral was held in early November.\n\nEmpress Saimei ruled for seven years.

[[Empress K\u014dgyoku]] was his elder sister from the same parents. Chinu was a son of Prince Oshisaka hikohito no \u014de, whose father was the Emperor Bidatsu. He had at least three consorts including his Empress, Hashihito no Himemiko (Princess Hashihito), the daughter of [[Emperor Jomei]] and his sister Empress K\u014dgyoku.  In the 3rd year of K\u014dgyoku''-tenn\u014d'' 's reign (\u7687\u6975\u5929\u7687\u4e09\u5e74), the empress abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by her younger brother.

In 645 he ascended to the throne two days after Prince [[Emperor Tenji|Naka no \u014ce]] (Emperor Tenji) assassinated [[Soga no Iruka]] in the court of K\u014dgyoku. K\u014dgyoku abdicated in favor of her son and crown prince, Naka no \u014ce, but Naka no \u014ce insisted K\u014dtoku should ascend to the throne instead.K\u014dtoku's contemporary title would not have been ''tenn\u014d'', as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\".  Alternatively, K\u014dtoku might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato\".  According to the ''[[Nihonshoki]]'', he was of gentle personality and was in favor of [[Buddhism]].\n\nIn 645 he created a new city in the area called [[Osaka|Naniwa]], and moved the capital from [[Yamato Province]] to this new city (see [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The new capital had a sea port and was good for foreign trade and diplomatic activities.  In 653 K\u014dtoku sent an embassy to the court of the [[Tang dynasty]] in [[China]], but some of the ships were lost ''en route''.\n\nNaka no \u014ce held the rank of crown prince and was the de facto leader of the government. In 653 Naka no \u014ce proposed to move the capital again to Yamato province. K\u014dtoku denied. Naka no \u014ce ignored the emperor's policy and moved to the former province. Many courtiers of the court including, Empress Hashihito, followed him. K\u014dtoku was left in the palace. In the next year he died because of illness. After his death, Naka no \u014ce would not ascend to the throne.  Instead, his mother and the sister of K\u014dtoku, the former Empress Kogyoku ascended to the throne under another name, Empress Saimei.\n\nHe enacted the [[Taika Reform]] edicts.  The system of ''hassh\u014d kyakkan'' (eight ministries and a hundred offices) was first established during the reign of Emperor K\u014dtoku.<ref>Varley, p. 133.</ref>\n\n[[File:Osakano shinagano misasagi.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor K\u014dtoku]]\nThe actual site of K\u014dtoku's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Osaka.

In 644, seeing the Soga continue to gain power, he conspired with [[Nakatomi no Kamatari]] and [[Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro]] to assassinate [[Soga no Iruka]] in what has come to be known as the [[Isshi Incident]]. Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, [[Soga no Emishi]], committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka's adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no \u014ce was named heir apparent. He also married the daughter of his ally Soga no Kurayamada, thus ensuring that a significant portion of the Soga clan's power was on his side.\n\n===Events of Tenji's reign===\nNaka no \u014ce reigned as Emperor Tenji from 661 to 672.\n\n* '''661''': In the {{nihongo|3rd year of Saimei's reign|\u6589\u660e\u5929\u7687\u4e09\u5e74}}, the empress designated her son as her heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that this son would have received the succession (''senso'') after her death or abdication.  Shortly after, she died, and Emperor Tenji could be said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').<ref>Titsingh, p. 54; Varley, H. Paul. (1980). ''Jinn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014dki,'' p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to Emperor Tenji; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]], [[Emperor Y\u014dzei|Y\u014dzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].</ref>\n* '''662''': Tenji is said to have compiled the first Japanese legal code known to modern historians.

In the end, he was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor K\u014dbun|Prince \u014ctomo]], also known as Emperor K\u014dbun, then by Tenji's brother [[Emperor Tenmu|Prince \u014cama]], also known as Emperor Tenmu.

''Gukansh\u014d'', pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\n==Traditional narrative==\nTenmu was the youngest son of [[Emperor Jomei]] and [[Empress K\u014dgyoku]], and the younger brother of the [[Emperor Tenji]]. His name at birth was Prince \u014cama (\u5927\u6d77\u4eba\u7687\u5b50:\u014cama no \u014dji). He was succeeded by [[Empress Jit\u014d]], who was both his niece and his wife. During the reign of his elder brother, Emperor Tenji, Tenmu was forced to marry several of Tenji's daughters because Tenji thought those marriages would help to strengthen political ties between the two brothers. The nieces he married included Princess Unonosarara, today known as Empress Jit\u014d, and [[Princess \u014cta]]. Tenmu also had other consorts whose fathers were influential courtiers.\n\nTenmu had many children, including his crown [[prince Kusakabe]] by Princess Unonosarara; [[Princess T\u014dchi]]; [[Prince \u014ctsu]] and [[Princess \u014cku]] by Princess \u014cta (whose father also was Tenji); and [[Prince Toneri]], the editor of the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and father of [[Emperor Junnin]]. Through Prince Kusakabe, Tenmu had two emperors and two empresses among his descendents. [[Empress K\u014dken]] was the last of these imperial rulers from his lineage.\n\n===Events of Tenmu's life===\nEmperor Tenmu is the first monarch of Japan, to whom the title ''Tenn\u014d'' ([[Emperor of Japan]]) was assigned contemporaneously\u2014not only by later generations.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/587414/tenno  \"Tenn\u014d\" at Critannica.com]; retrieved 2013-8-28.</ref>\n\nThe only document on his life was ''Nihon Shoki''. However, it was edited by his son, Prince Toneri, and the work was written during the reigns of his wife and children, causing one to suspect its accuracy and impartiality. He is also mentioned briefly in the preface to the ''[[Kojiki]]'', being hailed as the emperor to have commissioned them.\n\nTenmu's father died while he was young, and he grew up mainly under the guidance of Empress Saimei.  He was not expected to gain the throne, because his brother Tenji was the crown prince, being the older son of their mother, the reigning empress.\n\nDuring the [[Tenji period]], Tenmu was appointed his crown prince. This was because Tenji had no appropriate heir among his sons at that time, as none of their mothers was of a rank high enough to give the necessary political support. Tenji was suspicious that Tenmu might be so ambitious as to attempt to take the throne, and felt the necessity to strengthen his position through politically advantageous marriages.\n\nTenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions which had been established during the Taika reforms.<ref>[[Kan'ichi Asakawa|Asakawa, Kan'ichi]]. (1903). ''The Early Institutional Life of Japan,'' p. 313.</ref>\n\nIn his old age, Tenji had a son, Prince \u014ctomo, by a low-ranking consort. Since \u014ctomo had weak political support from his maternal relatives, the general wisdom of the time<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancestors|last=de Gruyter|first=Walter|publisher=Mouton Publishers|year=1976|isbn=90-279-7859-X|location=Paris|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> held that it was not a good idea for him to ascend to the throne, yet Tenji was obsessed with the idea.\n\nIn 671 Tenmu felt himself to be in danger and volunteered to resign the office of crown prince to become a monk. He moved to the mountains in Yoshino, [[Yamato Province]] (now [[Yoshino, Nara]]),  officially for reasons of seclusion.  He took with him his sons and one of his wives, Princess Unonosarara, a daughter of Tenji. However, he left all his other consorts at the capital, Omiky\u014d in [[\u014cmi Province]] (today in [[\u014ctsu]]).\n\nA year later, (in 672) Tenji died and Prince \u014ctomo ascended to the throne as [[Emperor K\u014dbun]]. Tenmu assembled an army and marched from Yoshino to the east, to attack the capital of Omiky\u014d in a counterclockwise movement. They marched through Yamato, [[Iga Province|Iga]] and [[Mino Province]]s to threaten Omiky\u014d in the adjacent province. The army of Tenmu and the army of the young Emperor K\u014dbun fought in the northwestern part of Mino (nowadays [[Sekigahara, Gifu]]). Tenmu's army won and K\u014dbun committed suicide, an incident known as the [[Jinshin War]].\n\n:'''Post-Meiji chronology'''\n:* '''''In the 10th year of Tenji''''', in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the 10th year of his reign (\u5929\u667a\u5929\u7687\u5341\u5e74), designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (''senso'') after his father's death.  Shortly thereafter, Emperor K\u014dbun is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').<ref>Brown, pp. 268\u2013269; [[H. Paul Varley|Varley, H. Paul]]. (1980).

Tenmu's reign brought many changes, such as: (1) a centralized war department was organized; (2) the defenses of the Inner Country near the Capital were strengthened; (3) forts and castles were built near Capital and in the western parts of Honsh\u016b\u2014and in Kyushu; (4) troops were reviewed; and all provincial governors were ordered to complete the collection of arms and to study tactics.<ref>Asakawa, pp. 313\u2013314.</ref>\n\n[[Image:TenmuJitoTomb.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial Shinto shrine and mausoleum honoring Emperor Tenmu]]\nIn 673 Tenmu moved the capital back to Yamato on the Kiymihara plain, naming his new capital Asuka.

[[Currency Museum of the Bank of Japan]].]]\nIn the ''Nihon Shoki'', Tenmu is described as a great innovator, but the neutrality of this description is doubtful, since the work was written under the control of his descendants. It seems clear, however, that Tenmu strengthened the power of the emperor and appointed his sons to the highest offices of his government, reducing the traditional influence of powerful clans such as the [[\u014ctomo clan|\u014ctomo]] and [[Soga clan]]s. He renewed the system of ''[[kabane]]'', the hereditary titles of duty and rank, but with alterations, including the abolition of some titles. [[Omi]] and [[Muraji]], the highest kabane in the earlier period, were reduced in value in the new hierarchy, which consisted of eight kinds of kabane. Each clan received a new kabane according to its closeness to the imperial bloodline and its loyalty to Tenmu.\n\nTenmu attempted to keep a balance of power among his sons. Once he traveled to Yoshino together with his sons, and there had them swear to cooperate and not to make war on each other. This turned out to be ineffective: one of his sons, Prince \u014ctsu, was later executed for treason after the death of Tenmu.\n\nTenmu's foreign policy favored the Korean kingdom [[Silla]], which took over the entire Korean peninsula in 676. After the unification of Korea by Silla, Tenmu decided to break diplomatic relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] of China, evidently in order to keep on good terms with Silla.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBGGBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT112&lpg=PT112&dq=Tenmu+silla+policy&source=bl&ots=oMV1sooSrM&sig=w0VjWBA0RcKor1n4hhejAVZ13Iw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiE2MT2yZjSAhVH3IMKHeNdCgcQ6AEILTAE#v=onepage&q=Tenmu%20silla%20policy&f=false|title=A History of Japan|last=Totman|first=Conrad|date=2014-09-11|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119022350|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTenmu used religious structures to increase the authority of the imperial throne. During his reign there was increased emphasis on the tie between the imperial household and [[Ise Grand Shrine]] (dedicated to the ancestor goddess of the emperors, [[Amaterasu]]) by sending his daughter [[Princess \u014cku]] as the newly established [[Sai\u014d]] of the shrine, and several festivals were financed from the national budget. He also showed favor to [[Buddhism]], and built several large temples and monasteries. It is said that Tenmu asked that each household was encouraged to build an altar with a dais where a Buddha-image and a sutra could be placed so that family worshiping could be held, thus inventing the [[butsudan]]. On the other hand, all Buddhist priests, monks and nuns were controlled by the state, and no one was allowed to become a monk without the state's permission. This was aimed at preventing cults and stopping farmers from turning into priests.\n\n====''Kugy\u014d''====\n''[[Kugy\u014d]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u516c\u537f}}) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the [[Emperor of Japan]] in pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] eras.\n\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.  These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career.  During Tenmu's reign, this apex of the  ''[[Daij\u014d-kan]]'' included:\n* ''[[Sadaijin]]'', Soga no Akae no Omi <ref name=\"b269\">Brown, p. 269.</ref>\n* ''[[Udaijin]]'', Nakatomi no Kane no Muraji <ref name=\"b269\"/>\n* ''[[Naidaijin]]''\n\n==Era of Tenmu's reign==\nThe years of Tenmu's reign were marked by only one [[Japanese era name|era name]] or ''neng\u014d'', which was proclaimed in the final months of the emperor's life; and ''Shuch\u014d'' ended with Tenmu's death.<ref name=\"t55-58\">Titsingh, p. 55-58.</ref>\n* ''[[Shuch\u014d]]''  (686)\n\n===Non''-neng\u014d'' period===\nThe early years of Tenmu's reign are not linked by scholars to any era or ''neng\u014d''.<ref name=\"t55-58\"/>  The Taika era innovation of naming time periods \u2013 ''neng\u014d'' \u2013 was discontinued during these years, but it was reestablished briefly in 686.

The four female monarchs before Gensh\u014d were: [[Empress Suiko|Suiko]], [[Empress K\u014dgyoku|K\u014dgyoku]], [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]] and [[Empress Genmei|Genmei]]. The three women sovereigns reigning after Gensh\u014d were [[Empress K\u014dken|K\u014dken]], [[Empress Meish\u014d|Meish\u014d]], and [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi|Go-Sakuramachi]].\n\n==Traditional narrative==\nBefore her ascension to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]], her personal name (''[[imina]]'')<ref>Brown, pp. 264; prior to [[Emperor Jomei]], the personal names of the emperors were very long and people did not generally use them.

Therefore, she was a granddaughter of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]] by her father and a granddaughter of [[Emperor Tenji]] through her mother.<ref>Brown, pp. 271\u2013272.</ref>\n\n===Events of Gensh\u014d's life===\nEmpress Gensh\u014d's  succession to the throne was intended as a regency until Prince Obito, the son of her deceased younger brother Monmu, was mature enough to ascend the throne. Obito would later become the [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]].\n\nObito was appointed Crown Prince in 714 by [[Empress Genmei]]. In the next year, 715, Empress Genmei, then in her fifties, abdicated in favor of her daughter Gensh\u014d. Obito was then 14 years old.\n\n* '''715''' (''[[Reiki (era)|Reiki]] 1, 9th month'')<!-- [http://web.me.com/meyer.eva/www.yukikurete.de/nengo_calc.htm  NengoCalc] \u970a\u4e80\u4e00\u5e74\u4e5d\u6708 -->: In the 7th year of Genmei''-tenn\u014d'' 's reign (\u5143\u660e\u5929\u7687\u4e03\u5e74), the empress abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by her daughter, who held the throne in trust for her younger brother.  Shortly thereafter, Empress Gensh\u014d acceded to the throne (''sokui'') as [[Empress Regnant]].<ref>Brown, pp. 271\u2013272; Varley, pp. 44, 141; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]], [[Emperor Y\u014dzei|Y\u014dzei]], [[emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].</ref>\n\nObito remained the crown prince, heir to the new empress. [[Fujiwara no Fuhito]], the most powerful courtier in Genmei's court, remained at his post until his death in 720. After his death, Prince [[Nagaya]], a grandson of Tenmu and the Empress Gensh\u014d's cousin, seized power. This power shift was a background for later conflicts between Nagaya and Fuhito's four sons during the reign of Emperor Sh\u014dmu (formerly Prince Obito).\n\nUnder Gensh\u014d's reign, the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' was finished in 720.  This was the first Japanese history book. Organization of the law system known as the ''[[ritsury\u014d]]'' was continued under the initiatives of Fuhito until his death. These laws and codes were edited and enacted by [[Fujiwara no Nakamaro]], a grandson of Fuhito, and published as ''[[Y\u014dr\u014d Code|Y\u014dr\u014d ritsury\u014d]]'' under the name of Fuhito. The taxation system which had been introduced by [[Empress Jit\u014d]] in the late 7th century began to malfunction. To compensate for the decreased tax revenue, the \"Act of possession in three generations\", an initiative of Prince Nagaya, was enacted in 723. Under this act, people were allowed to possess a newly cultivated field once every three generations. In the fourth generation, the right of possession would revert to the national government. This act was intended to motivate new cultivation, but it only remained in effect for about 20 years.\n\nEmpress Gensh\u014d reigned for nine years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070327i1.html \"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl\",] ''Japan Times''. March 27, 2007.</ref> Empress Genmei, who was succeeded by her daughter, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\n\nIn 724, Gensh\u014d abdicated in favor of her nephew, who would be known as Emperor Sh\u014dmu. Gensh\u014d lived for 25 years after she stepped down from the throne. She never married and had no children. She died at age 65.<ref>Varley, H. Paul.

Shortly thereafter, Emperor Saga is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').<ref>Titsingh, p. 96; [[#Brown-Ishida|Brown and Ishida]], p. 280; Varley, p. 44; a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jit\u014d|Jit\u014d]], [[Emperor Y\u014dzei|Y\u014dzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].</ref>\n\nSoon after his enthronement, Saga himself took ill. At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga's weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the [[Kusuko Incident]]; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by ''[[taish\u014dgun]]'' [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]], quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict.<ref>Titsingh, p. 98; Varley, p. 151.</ref>  This same Tamuramaro is remembered in [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]'s annual ''nebuta''  or ''neputa'' [[matsuri]] which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats.  These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement.  This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious [[Emishi]] approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro's men.<ref>Boroff, Nicholas.

According to pre-Meiji scholars, his reign spanned the years from 1371 through 1382.<ref>Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). ''Annales des empereurs du japon'', pp. 310\u2013316.</ref>\n\nThis [[Nanboku-ch\u014d]] \"sovereign\" was named after the 10th century [[Emperor En'y\u016b]] and ''go-'' (\u5f8c), translates literally as \"later;\" and thus, he may be called the \"Later Emperor En'y\u016b\", or, in some older sources, may be identified as \"Emperor En'y\u016b, the second\", or as \"Emperor En'y\u016b II.\"\n\n==Genealogy==\nHis personal name was Ohito (\u7dd2\u4ec1).\n\nHe was the second son of the fourth Northern Pretender [[Emperor Go-K\u014dgon]].  His mother was Fujiwara no Nakako (\u85e4\u539f\u4ef2\u5b50), daughter of Hirohashi Kanetsuna (\u5e83\u6a4b\u517c\u7db1).\n*Consort: Itsuko (\u53b3\u5b50), daughter of Sanj\u014d Kintada (\u4e09\u6761\u516c\u5fe0)\n**First son: Imperial Prince Motohito (\u5e79\u4ec1\u89aa\u738b) ([[Emperor Go-Komatsu]])\n**First daughter: Imperial Princess Keiko (1381\u20131399; \u73ea\u5b50\u5185\u89aa\u738b)\n*Lady-in-waiting Fujiwara no Imako (\u85e4\u539f\u4eca\u5b50)\n**Second son: Imperial Prince D\u014dch\u014d (1378\u20131446; \u9053\u671d\u6cd5\u89aa\u738b)\n*Naishi: Ogimachi Sanjo Sanetoshi\u2019s daughter\n*Naishi: Azechi-no-tsubone\n*unknown\n** daughter: ???

Immediately afterwards, he became emperor upon the abdication of his father, [[Emperor Go-K\u014dgon]].  There was said to be a disagreement between Go-K\u014dgon and the retired Northern Emperor [[Emperor Suk\u014d]] over the Crown Prince.  With the support of Hosokawa Yoriyuki, who controlled the [[Ashikaga shogunate|Bakufu]], Go-K\u014dgon's son became the Northern Emperor.\n\nUntil 1374, Go-K\u014dgon ruled as [[Cloistered rule|cloistered emperor]].  In 1368, [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] was named ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'', and with his guardianship, the Imperial Court was stabilized.  In 1382, upon abdicating to [[Emperor Go-Komatsu]], his [[cloistered rule]] began.  Having no actual power, he rebelled, attempting suicide and accusing [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] and his consort Itsuko of adultery.\n\nIn 1392, peace with the Southern Court being concluded, the [[Nanboku-cho|Period of the Northern and Southern Courts]] came to an end.  On 6 June 1393, Go-En'y\u016b died. He is enshrined with other emperors at the imperial tomb called ''Fukakusa no kita no misasagi'' (\u6df1\u8349\u5317\u9675) in [[Fushimi-ku, Kyoto]].\n\n==Eras of Go-En'y\u016b's reign==\nThe years of Go-En'y\u016b's ''Nanboku-ch\u014d'' reign are more specifically identified by more than one [[Japanese era names|era name]] or ''[[neng\u014d]]''.\n\n:'''''Nanboku-ch\u014d'' Southern court'''\n*Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n** ''[[Kentoku]]''        (1370\u20131372)\n** ''[[Bench\u016b]]''  (1372\u20131375)\n** ''[[Tenju]]''          (1375\u20131381)\n** ''[[K\u014dwa (Muromachi period)|K\u014dwa]]''      (1381\u20131384)\n\n:'''''Nanboku-ch\u014d'' Northern court'''\n*Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript)\n** ''[[Oan|\u014can]]''         (1368\u20131375)\n** ''[[Eiwa]]''            (1375\u20131379)\n** ''[[Koryaku|K\u014dryaku]]'' (1379\u20131381)\n** ''[[Eitoku]]''          (1381\u20131384)\n\n==Southern Court rivals==\n*[[Emperor Ch\u014dkei]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Emperor of Japan]]\n* [[List of Emperors of Japan]]\n* [[Imperial cult]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|right|120px|[[Imperial Seal of Japan|Japanese Imperial kamon]] \u2014 a stylized [[chrysanthemum]] blossom]]\n{{Reflist|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[Richard Ponsonby-Fane|Ponsonby-Fane]], Richard Arthur Brabazon.

On Jimmu's death ''Tagishimimi'', a son of Jimmu by a lesser wife, Ahiratsuhime, attempted to seize the throne. Suizei encouraged Kamuyawimimi to slay Tagishimimi, but since he was overcome by fright at the prospect, Suizei accomplished the deed. On this, Kamuyawimimi ceded his rights and declared that Suizei, being braver, should be emperor.<ref>[[Basil Chamberlain|Chamberlain, Basil]]. (1919).

He became the crown prince at the age of four. He was crowned (in 270) at the age of 70 and reigned for 40 years until his death in 310, although none of the TC dates around his reign have any historical basis.

They had five sons and four daughters, including [[Emperor Ank\u014d]] and [[Emperor Y\u016bryaku]].

Swords unearthed from some [[kofun]] tombs, such as the [[Inariyama Sword]] pictured at right, indicate his name was Waka Takeru (\u014ckimi).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Y\u016bryaku is a name posthumously assigned to him by a much later era. He was the fifth and youngest son of [[Emperor Ingy\u014d]]. After his elder brother [[Emperor Ank\u014d]] was murdered, he won the struggle against his other brothers and became the new emperor. His title in his own lifetime was certainly not ''tenn\u014d'', but presumably ''\u014ckimi'' and/or ''Sumeramikoto'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b - amenoshita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi, or sumera no mikoto, Great King who rules all under heaven) and/or king of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b - yamato \u014dkimi, Great King of Yamato). He had three wives (including his consort Kusahahatahi). His successor, Prince Shiraka ([[Emperor Seinei]]), was his son by his wife Kazuraki no Karahime.\n\nIn 463, Y\u016bryaku Tenn\u014d invited the thunder god of the Mimuro hill to come to the Imperial Palace, and ordered Chiisakobe no [[kabane|muraji]] Sugaru to fetch the deity. He obliged, thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation, and rode carrying a halberd with a red banner, symbolising his office of royal messenger. Soon enough, the thunder stroke, and Sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage, to be brought in the Emperor's presence, as a great serpent. But, said Emperor neglected to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence. The thunder kami then showed his displeasure through thundering and threatening fiery eyeballs, and Emperor Y\u016bryaku fled into the interior of the Palace while covering his eyes. The great serpent was returned to Mimuro, and the Emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity. This story is recorded in [[Nihongi]] and mentioned by [[William George Aston]], in \"Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan\" as well as several other books.\n\nAccording to the [[Nihongi]], Y\u016bryaku was of ungovernable and suspicious temperament, and committed many acts of arbitrary cruelty.\n\nThe actual site of Y\u016bryaku's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is not known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') in [[Habikino, Osaka]], which is designated by the [[Imperial Household Agency]] as Y\u016bryaku's [[mausoleum]].

(2006). {{Google books|vaSzIi_HQlsC|''Gateway to Japan,'' pp. 17\u201318.}}</ref> The King 'Bu' in this document is believed to refer to Emperor Y\u016bryaku, in part based on the fact that the character used to write the name (\u6b66) can also be read as ''Take'' or ''Takeru'' in Japanese, and is found in the name by which Emperor Y\u016bryaku was called during his lifetime: Wakatakeru \u014ckimi. <!-- I know this is here because his contemporary Japanese name is cited as being such further up, but that could almost certainly be stated better. And \"Bu\" is also \"Japanese\" (in modern Mandarin it would be \"Wu\"). It also could theoretically be OR because I'm almost certain whoever wrote this knew Japanese and might have drawn the connection him/herself. ~Hijiri88 --> The Chinese historical records state that Bu began his rule before 477, was recognized as the ruler of Japan by the [[Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], and [[Liang Dynasty|Liang]] dynasties, and continued his rule through to 502.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Poetry==\nThis Japanese sovereign's interest in poetry is amongst the more well-documented aspects of his character and reign.

At this point, Oka wanted his elder brother to become emperor; but \u014cke refused.  The two could not reach an agreement. The great men of the court insisted that one or the other of the brothers must accept the throne; but in the end, \u014cka proved to be more adamant.

Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven.\"  Alternatively, Buretsu might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato.\"\n\nBuretsu is described as an essentially wicked historical figure.  ''Nihonshoki'' likened him to [[Di Xin]] of the [[Shang dynasty]], but the record in ''Kojiki'' has no such indication. There are several theories on this difference. Some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor [[Emperor Keitai]] who took over under questionable circumstances.

There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.  Significant differences exist in the records of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''.\n\n''Kojiki'' puts this emperor's birth year at 485; and his date of death is said to have been April 9, 527.<ref name=Japanese_dates>Japanese dates correspond to the traditional [[lunisolar calendar]] used in Japan until 1873.</ref> In the extant account, he is called \u014cdo no Mikoto (\u8881\u672c\u677c\u547d).\n\n''Nihon Shoki'' gives his birth year at 450; and he is said to have died on February 7, 531 or 534.<ref name=Japanese_dates/> In this historical record, he is said to have been called \u014cdo no Kimi (\u7537\u5927\u8ff9\u738b) and Hikofuto no Mikoto (\u5f66\u592a\u5c0a).  Also, records identify him as ''Wo Ofu Ato-no-Hiko Fudo no Mikoto''.\n\nIn other historical records, he is said to have originally been King of [[Koshi Province|Koshi]], a smaller tribal entity, apparently in northern parts of central Japan, perhaps as far as the coast of [[Sea of Japan]].  Some modern reference works of history call Keitai simply ''King Ohoto of Koshi''.<ref name=\"a1-25\">Aston, William. (1998). ''Nihongi,'' Vol. 2, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>\n\nKeitai's contemporary title would not have been ''tenn\u014d'', as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven.\"  Alternatively, Keitai might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato.\"\n\n===Genealogy===\nIf Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then [[Emperor Buretsu]] would have been the last monarch of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.<ref>Aston, William. (1998). ''Nihongi,'' Vol. 1, pp. 393\u2013407.</ref>\n\nKeitai was not the son of the immediate previous monarch. According to the ''Kojiki'' (712) and ''Nihon Shoki'' (720), Buretsu died without a successor, at which time a fifth generation grandson of [[Emperor \u014cjin]], Keitai, came and ascended the throne.\n\nThe genealogical trees of the ''Nihon Shoki'' have been lost, and the accuracy of its account of events remains unknown.  This uncertainty raises arguable doubts about this emperor's genealogy.\n\nGenealogy information is supplemented in ''[[Shaku Nihongi]]'' which quotes from the now lost text ''[[J\u014dg\u016bki]]'' (7th century). It says he was a son of Ushi no Kimi, a grandson of Ohi no Kimi, a great-grandson of Ohohoto no Kimi (brother to [[Emperor Ingy\u014d|Emperor Ingy\u014d's]] consort), a great-great-grandson of Wakanuke Futamata no Kimi, and a great-great-great-grandson of Emperor \u014cjin.\n\nAccording to ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'', his father was Hikoushi no Kimi and his mother was Furihime. When Buretsu died, [[\u014ctomo no Kanamura|Kanamura]] recommended Keitai at his age of 58 as a possible heir to the Yamato throne.\n\nAlthough genealogy information described in ''[[Shaku Nihongi]]'' leaves room for discussion, many scholars acknowledge the blood relationship with the Okinaga clan, a powerful local ruling family or the collateral line of the Imperial family-governed Oumi region (a part of present-day Shiga Prefecture). This family produced many empresses and consorts throughout history. According to ''Nihon Shoki'', Ohohoto no Kimi, the great-grandfather of Emperor Keitai, married into the Okinaga clan. Keitai's mother, Furihime, was from a local ruling family in [[Koshi Province|Koshi]] ([[Echizen Province]]), so his mother brought him to her home after his father's death. Abundant traditions relating to the family have been passed down by shrines and old-established families in both regions.\n\nRegardless of speculation about Keitai's genealogy, it is well settled that there was an extended period of disputes over the succession which developed after Keitai's death.  A confrontation arose between adherents of two branches of the Yamato, pitting the supporters of sons who would become known as [[Emperor Ankan]] and [[Emperor Senka]] against those who were backers of the son who would become known as [[Emperor Kinmei]].<ref>Hall, John Whitney. (1993). {{Google books|OudvOfBHsvwC|''The Cambridge history of Japan: Ancient Japan,'' Vol. I., p. 154.|page=154}}</ref>\n\n==Keitai's reign==\nKeitai declared his ascension in Kusuba, in the northern part of [[Kawachi Province]] (present day Shijonawate, Osaka), and married a younger sister of Buretsu, Princess Tashiraga.  It is supposed that his succession was not welcomed by everyone, and it took about 20 years for Keitai to enter [[Yamato Province]], near Kawachi and the political center of Japan at the time.\n\nIn Keitai's later years, 527 or 528, the [[Iwai Rebellion]] broke out in Tsukushi province, [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. Keitai assigned [[Mononobe no Arakabi|Mononobe no Arakahi]] as Shogun and sent him to Ky\u016bsh\u016b to put down the rebellion.\n\nAmong his sons, [[Emperor Ankan]], [[Emperor Senka]] and [[Emperor Kinmei]] ascended to the throne.<ref name=\"a1-25\"/>\n\nThe actual site of Keitai's [[grave (burial)|grave]] is not known.<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  This emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at the Ooda Chausuyama [[kofun]] in [[Ibaraki, Osaka]].\n\nThe [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Keitai's [[mausoleum]].

''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 45.</ref>\n\n==Legendary narrative==\nKeitai is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, but there is a paucity of information about him. There is insufficient material available for further verification and study.\n\nWhen [[Emperor Ankan]] died, he had no offspring; and succession passed to his youngest brother who will come to be known as Emperor Senka. Emperor Senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years.\n\nSenka's contemporary title would not have been ''tenn\u014d'', as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. Rather, it was presumably ''Sumeramikoto'' or ''Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi'' (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\".  Alternatively, Senka might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\n\nDuring this reign, [[Soga no Iname]]<ref>Titsingh, p. 33.</ref> is believed to have been the first verifiable \"Great Minister\" or ''[[Omi]]'' (also identified as ''\u014c-omi'').\n\nThis emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] (''misasagi'') at Nara. The [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates this location as Senka's [[mausoleum]].<ref name=\"kunaicho\"/>  It is formally named ''Musa no Tsukisaka no e no misasagi'';<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, p. 419.</ref> however, the actual sites of the [[grave (burial)|graves]] of the early emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Emperor of Japan]]\n* [[List of Emperors of Japan]]\n* [[Imperial cult]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[William George Aston|Aston, William George.]] (1896).
