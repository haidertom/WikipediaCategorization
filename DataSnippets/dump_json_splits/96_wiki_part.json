It was based on the [[Intel 8086]] and, like it, had a [[16-bit]] external [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] multiplexed with a 20-bit [[address bus]]. It was also available as the [[Intel 80188|80188]], with an [[8-bit]] external data bus.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Features and performance===\nThe 80186 series was generally intended for [[embedded system]]s, as [[microcontroller]]s with external memory. Therefore, to reduce the number of [[integrated circuits]] required, it included features such as [[clock generator]], [[programmable interrupt controller|interrupt controller]], [[hardware timer|timer]]s, [[wait state]] generator, [[direct memory access|DMA]] channels, and external [[chip select]] lines.\n\nThe initial clock rate of the 80186 was 6&nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]], but due to more hardware available for the [[microcode]] to use, especially for address calculation, many individual instructions ran faster than on an 8086 at the same clock frequency. For instance, the common ''register+immediate''<ref>In fact, all variants, including ''reg+reg'' and ''reg+reg+immediate'' were faster.</ref> [[addressing mode]] was significantly faster than on the 8086, especially when a memory location was both (one of the) operand(s) and the destination. Multiply and divide also showed great improvement being several times as fast as on the original 8086 and multi-bit shifts were done almost four times as quickly as in the 8086.\n\nA few new instructions were introduced with the 80186 (referred to as the 8086-2 instruction set in some [[datasheet]]s): '''enter'''/'''leave''' (replacing several instructions when handling stack frames), '''pusha'''/'''popa''' (push/pop all general registers), '''bound''' (check array index against bounds), and '''ins'''/'''outs''' (input/output of string). A useful ''immediate'' mode was added for the '''push''', '''imul''', and multi-bit shift instructions. These instructions were also included in the contemporary 80286 and in successor chips.  (The instruction set of the 80286 is exactly the instruction set of the 80186 with instructions added only for operations related to the 80286 [[Protected mode]].)\n\n[[File:Intel 80C186 die.JPG|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of Intel 80C186.]]\nThe (redesigned) [[CMOS]] version, 80C186, introduced [[Memory refresh|DRAM refresh]], a power-save mode, and a direct interface to the [[Intel 8087|8087]] or 80187 floating point numeric [[coprocessor]].\n\n== Uses ==\n\n===In personal computers===\nThe 80186 would have been a natural successor to the [[Intel 8086|8086]] in personal computers. However, because its integrated hardware was incompatible with the hardware used in the original IBM PC, the [[Intel 80286|80286]] was used as the successor instead in the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC/AT]].\n\nA few notable [[personal computer]]s used the 80186: the Australian [[Dulmont Magnum]] laptop, one of the first laptops; the [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] Office Assistant, marketed as a PC-like stand-alone word processor; the [[Mindset (computer)|Mindset]]; the [[Siemens]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Siemens PC-D{{!}}PC-D|de|3=Siemens PC-D}} (not 100% [[IBM PC compatible]] but using [[MS-DOS]] 2.11); the [[Compis]] (a [[Sweden|Swedish]] school computer); the French SMT-Goupil G4; the [[RM Nimbus]] (a British school computer); the [[Unisys ICON]] (a Canadian school computer); ORB Computer by ABS; the [[HP 100LX]], [[HP 200LX]], [[HP 1000CX]], and [[HP OmniGo 700LX]]; the [[Tandy 2000]] desktop (a somewhat PC-compatible workstation with sharp graphics for its day); the Telex 1260 (a desktop PC-XT compatible); the [[Philips :YES]]; the Nokia [[MikroMikko|MikroMikko 2]]. [[Acorn Computers|Acorn]] created a plug-in for the BBC Master range of computers containing an 80186-10 with 512&nbsp;KB of RAM, the [[BBC Master#Master 512|BBC Master 512]] system.\n\nIn addition to the above examples of stand-alone implementations of the 80186 for personal computers, there was at least one example of an \"add-in\" accelerator card implementation: the [[Orchid Technology]] PC Turbo 186,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=2i4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=orchid+80186&source=bl&ots=Gm8aSlHRZV&sig=bsX0kNaeUPzxwmVV_p8Z43Rdhqo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIzumY57u9xwIVD0OSCh3EnQxX#v=onepage&q=orchid%2080186&f=false ''Adding Spunk to the IBM PC'' in ''InfoWorld, May 20, 1985'']</ref> released in 1985.

Other groups investigated later included the [[Fraticelli|Spiritual Franciscans]], the [[Hussites]] (followers of [[Jan Hus]]) and the [[Beguines]].

The institution survived as part of the [[Roman Curia]], but in 1908 was given the new name of \"Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office\".

The Church charged councils composed of bishops and archbishops with establishing inquisitions (the [[Medieval Inquisition|Episcopal Inquisition]]). The first Inquisition was temporarily established in [[Languedoc]] (south of France) in 1184. The murder of Pope Innocent's papal legate [[Pierre de Castelnau]] in 1208 sparked the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229). The Inquisition was permanently established in 1229, run largely by the Dominicans<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Inquisition|website=Newadvent.org|accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> in Rome and later at [[Carcassonne]] in Languedoc.\n\n==Medieval Inquisition==\n{{Main|Medieval Inquisition|Ad extirpanda}}\nHistorians use the term \"Medieval Inquisition\" to describe the various inquisitions that started around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s). These inquisitions responded to large popular movements throughout Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or heretical to [[Christianity]], in particular the [[Cathars]] in southern France and the [[Waldensians]] in both southern France and northern Italy. Other Inquisitions followed after these first inquisition movements. The legal basis for some inquisitorial activity came from [[Pope Innocent IV]]'s [[papal bull]] ''[[Ad extirpanda]]'' of 1252, which explicitly authorized (and defined the appropriate circumstances for) the use of [[torture]] by the Inquisition for eliciting confessions from heretics.<ref>Bishop, J (2006).

By 1256 inquisitors were given [[absolution]] if they used instruments of torture.<ref>Larissa Tracy, ''Torture and Brutality in Medieval Literature: Negotiations of National Identity'', (Boydell and Brewer Ltd, 2012), 22; \"''In 1252 Innocent IV licensed the use of torture to obtain evidence from suspects, and by 1256 inquisitors were allowed to absolve each other if they used instruments of torture themselves, rather than relying on lay agents for the purpose...''\".</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century, [[Pope Gregory IX]] (reigned 1227\u20131241) assigned the duty of carrying out inquisitions to the [[Dominican Order]] and [[Franciscan Order]]. By the end of the Middle Ages, [[England]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] were the only large western nations without a papal inquisition.\nMost inquisitors were friars who taught theology and/or law in the universities. They used [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial procedures]], a common legal practice adapted from the earlier Ancient Roman court procedures.<ref>Peters, Edwards. \"Inquisition\", p. 12.</ref> They judged heresy along with bishops and groups of \"assessors\" (clergy serving in a role that was roughly analogous to a jury or legal advisers), using the local authorities to establish a tribunal and to prosecute heretics.

So the Inquisition in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], in the lands of the [[Reconquista]] counties and kingdoms like [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], had a special socio-political basis as well as more fundamental religious motives.\n\nIn some parts of Spain towards the end of the 14th century, there was a wave of violent [[anti-Judaism]], encouraged by the preaching of [[Ferrand Martinez]], [[Archdeacon]] of [[Ecija]]. In the [[pogrom]]s of June 1391 in Seville, hundreds of Jews were killed, and the [[synagogue]] was completely destroyed. The number of people killed was also high in other cities, such as [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Valencia]] and Barcelona.<ref>Kamen, ''Spanish Inquisition'', p. 17. Kamen cites approximate numbers for Valencia (250) and Barcelona (400), but no solid data about C\u00f3rdoba.</ref>\n\nOne of the consequences of these [[pogrom]]s was the mass conversion of thousands of surviving Jews. Forced baptism was contrary to the law of the Catholic Church, and theoretically anybody who had been forcibly baptized could legally return to Judaism. However, this was very narrowly interpreted. Legal definitions of the time theoretically acknowledged that a forced baptism was not a valid sacrament, but confined this to cases where it was literally administered by physical force. A person who had consented to baptism under threat of death or serious injury was still regarded as a voluntary convert, and accordingly forbidden to revert to Judaism.<ref>[[Raymond of Pe\u00f1afort]], ''Summa'', lib. 1 p.33, citing D.45 c.5.</ref>  After the public violence, many of the converted \"felt it safer to remain in their new religion.\"<ref>Kamen, ''Spanish Inquisition'', p. 10.</ref> Thus, after 1391, a new social group appeared and were referred to as ''[[conversos]]'' or ''New Christians''.\n\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478. In contrast to the previous inquisitions, it operated completely under royal Christian authority, though staffed by clergy and orders, and independently of the [[Holy See]]. It operated in Spain and in all Spanish colonies and territories, which included the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], and all Spanish possessions in North, Central, and South America. It primarily targeted forced converts from Islam ([[Morisco]]s, [[Converso]]s and ''secret Moors'') and from [[Judaism]] ([[Converso]]s, [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]] and [[Marrano]]s) &mdash; both groups still resided in Spain after the end of the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic control of Spain]] &mdash; who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or of having fallen back into it.\n\nIn 1492 all Jews who had not converted were expelled from Spain; those who converted became nominal Catholics and thus subject to the Inquisition.\n\n===Inquisition in the Spanish overseas empire===\n{{see also |Mexican Inquisition|Peruvian Inquisition}}\n\nIn the Americas, King Philip II set up three tribunals (each formally titled ''Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisici\u00f3n'') in 1569, one in [[Mexican Inquisition|Mexico]], [[Cartagena de Indias]] (in modern-day Colombia) and [[Peru]].

[[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] had asked [[Pope Leo X]] for the installation of the Inquisition in 1515, but only after his death in 1521 did [[Pope Paul III]] acquiesce.

The Portuguese inquisitors mostly targeted the [[Jew]]ish [[New Christians]] (i.e. ''[[conversos]]'' or ''[[marranos]]''). The Portuguese Inquisition expanded its scope of operations from Portugal to its colonial possessions, including Brazil, [[Cape Verde]], and [[Goa Inquisition|Goa]]. In the colonies, it continued as a religious court, investigating and trying cases of breaches of the tenets of orthodox Roman Catholicism until 1821. King [[John III of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o III]] (reigned 1521\u201357) extended the activity of the courts to cover [[censorship]], [[divination]], [[witchcraft]], and [[bigamy]]. Originally oriented for a religious action, the Inquisition exerted an influence over almost every aspect of Portuguese society: political, cultural, and social.\n\nThe [[Goa Inquisition]], an inquisition largely aimed at Catholic converts from [[Hinduism]] or [[Islam]] who were thought to have returned to their original ways, started in 1560.

According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell on his face and laughed when God (Hebrew, ''[[Elohim]]'') imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age.

When Abraham became one hundred years old, this son was born to him by his first wife Sarah.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|18:10\u201312|HE}}</ref> Though this was Abraham's second son<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|16:15|HE}}</ref> it was Sarah's first and only child.\n\nOn the eighth day from his birth, Isaac was [[Religious male circumcision|circumcised]], as was necessary for all males of Abraham's household, in order to be in compliance with [[Yahweh]]'s covenant.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:1\u20135|HE}}</ref>\n\nAfter Isaac had been weaned, Sarah saw [[Ishmael]] mocking, and urged her husband to cast out [[Hagar]] the bondservant and her son, so that Isaac would be Abraham's sole heir. Abraham was hesitant, but at God's order he listened to his wife's request.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|21:8\u201312|HE}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\n[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ''Akedah'', mosaic on the floor of [[Beit Alfa Synagogue]]]]\n{{main article|Binding of Isaac}}\n\nAt some point in Isaac's youth, his father Abraham brought him to Mount [[Moriah]]. At God's command, Abraham was to build a sacrificial altar and sacrifice his son Isaac upon it. After he had bound his son to the altar and drawn his knife to kill him, at the very last moment an [[angel]] of God prevented Abraham from proceeding. Rather, he was directed to sacrifice instead a nearby ram that was stuck in thickets.\n[[File:Esau and Jacob Presented to Isaac.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The birth of Esau and Jacob, as painted by [[Benjamin West]]]]\n\n===Family life===\nBefore Isaac was 40 (Gen 25:20) Abraham sent [[Eliezer]], his steward, into [[Mesopotamia]] to find a wife for Isaac, from his nephew [[Bethuel]]'s family. Eliezer chose the [[Aramean]] [[Rebecca|Rebekah]] for Isaac. After many years of marriage to Isaac, Rebekah had still not given birth to a child and was believed to be barren. Isaac prayed for her and she conceived. Rebekah gave birth to twin boys, [[Esau]] and [[Jacob]].

This land was still under the control of [[Abimelech|King Abimelech]] as it was in the days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to [[Beersheba]], where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|26|HE}}</ref>\n[[File:Giotto di Bondone 080.jpg|thumb|left|Isaac blessing his son, as painted by [[Giotto di Bondone]]]]\n\n===Birthright===\nIsaac grew old and became blind. He called his son Esau and directed him to procure some venison for him, in order to receive Isaac's blessing. While Esau was hunting, Jacob, after listening to his mother's advice, deceived his blind father by misrepresenting himself as Esau and thereby obtained his father's blessing, such that Jacob became Isaac's primary heir and Esau was left in an inferior position. According to Genesis 25:29\u201334, Esau had previously sold his birthright to Jacob for \"bread and stew of lentils\". Thereafter, Isaac sent Jacob into Mesopotamia to take a wife of his mother's brother's house. After 20 years working for his uncle [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]], Jacob returned home. He reconciled with his twin brother Esau, then he and Esau buried their father, Isaac, in Hebron after he died at the age of 180.<ref name=\"JewishEncyclopedia\">''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'', [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=174&letter=I ''Isaac''].</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|35:28\u201329|HE}}</ref>\n\n===Family tree===\n{{Abraham Family Tree}}\n\n==Burial site==\nAccording to local tradition, the graves of Isaac and [[Rebecca|Rebekah]], along with the graves of Abraham and Sarah and Jacob and [[Leah]], are in the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]].\n\n==Jewish views==\nIn [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical tradition]], the age of Isaac at the time of binding is taken to be 37, which contrasts with common portrayals of Isaac as a child.<ref name=\"New EoJ\">''The New Encyclopedia of Judaism'', ''Isaac''.</ref> The [[rabbi]]s also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac.<ref name=\"New EoJ\"/> The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the [[Atonement in Judaism|mercy of God]] in later [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions.<ref name=\"Britannica-Isaac\">''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', ''Isaac''.</ref> The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the ''aqedah'' (\"binding\").<ref name=\"EoR-Isaac\"/> According to a version of these interpretations, Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived.<ref name=\"EoR-Isaac\"/> According to many accounts of [[Aggadah]], unlike the Bible, it is [[Satan]] who is testing Isaac as an agent of [[God in Judaism|God]].<ref name=\"Brill's New Pauly\">Brock, Sebastian P., ''Brill's New Pauly'', ''Isaac''.</ref> Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred [[martyr]]dom to violation of the [[halakha|Jewish law]].<ref name=\"New EoJ\"/>\n\nAccording to the Jewish tradition, Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer.

Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch [[Jacob]], who too is venerated an Islamic prophet.\n\nIsaac is mentioned fifteen times by name in the [[Quran]], often with his father and his son, [[Jacob]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', W. Montgomery Watt, ''Isaac''</ref> The Quran states that Abraham received \"good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous\", and that God blessed them both (37: 112). In a fuller description, when [[angel]]s came to [[Abraham]] to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], his wife, [[Sarah]], \"laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob\" (11: 71\u201374); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a \"gift\" to Abraham (6: 84; 14: 49\u201350), and 24: 26\u201327 adds that [[God]] made \"prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring\", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson [[Jacob]], and his prophetic great-grandson [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph]]. In the [[Qur'an]], it later narrates that Abraham also praised [[God]] for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (14: 39\u201341).\n\nElsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of [[God]]'s favor to them (12: 6); [[Jacob]]'s sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the [[God]] that their forefathers, \"Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac\", worshiped (2: 127); and the Qur'an commands [[Muslim]]s to believe in the revelations that were given to \"Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs\" (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.<ref>''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', C. Glasse, ''Isaac''</ref>\n\n===Quran===\nThe Quran mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of [[God in Islam|God]]. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God:\n{{Quote|And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them).<br>And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).|Quran, [[sura]] 21 ([[Al-Anbiya]]), [[ayah]] 72\u201373<ref>{{cite quran|21|72|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\n{{Quote|And WE gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, and one of the righteous.|Quran, [[sura]] 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah]] 112<ref>{{cite quran|37|112|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\n==Academic==\nSome scholars have described Isaac as \"a [[legend]]ary figure\" or \"as a figure representing [[tribe|tribal]] history, or \"as a [[nomad|seminomadic]] leader.\"<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\">''Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Christianity'', ''Isaac'', p. 744.</ref> The stories of Isaac, like other patriarchal stories of Genesis, are generally believed to have \"their origin in folk memories and oral traditions of the early Hebrew [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] experience.\"<ref name=\"EoCol-Isaac\">''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Isaac''.</ref> ''The Cambridge Companion to the Bible'' makes the following comment on the biblical stories of the patriarchs:\n\n{{Quote|Yet for all that these stories maintain a distance between their world and that of their time of literary growth and composition, they reflect the political realities of the later periods. Many of the narratives deal with the relationship between the ancestors and peoples who were part of Israel's political world at the time the stories began to be written down (eighth century B.C.E.). Lot is the ancestor of the Transjordanian peoples of Ammon and Moab, and Ishmael personifies the nomadic peoples known to have inhabited north Arabia, although located in the Old Testament in the Negev. Esau personifies Edom (36:1), and Laban represents the Aramean states to Israel's north. A persistent theme is that of difference between the ancestors and the indigenous Canaanites\u2026 In fact, the theme of the differences between Judah and Israel, as personified by the ancestors, and the neighboring peoples of the time of the monarchy is pressed effectively into theological service to articulate the choosing by God of Judah and Israel to bring blessing to all peoples.\"<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to the Bible'', p. 59.</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Martin Noth]], a scholar of the Hebrew Bible, the narratives of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage than that of the West-Jordanian Jacob.<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\"/> At that era, the [[Israelite]] tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern [[Philistia]] with the inhabitants of the settled countryside.<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\"/> The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in the connection between the Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 7:9 (\"the high places of Isaac\").<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\"/>\n\n[[Albrecht Alt]] and Martin Noth hold that, \"The figure of Isaac was enhanced when the theme of promise, previously bound to the cults of the 'God the Fathers' was incorporated into the Israelite creed during the southern-Palestinian stage of the growth of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] tradition.\"<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\"/> According to Martin Noth, at the Southern Palestinian stage of the growth of the Pentateuch tradition, Isaac became established as one of the biblical patriarchs, but his traditions were receded in the favor of Abraham.<ref name=\"EoC1-Isaac\"/>\n\n==In art==\nThe earliest Christian portrayal of Isaac is found in the [[Catacombs of Rome|Roman catacomb]] [[fresco]]es.<ref name=\"Early Christian Art\">{{cite journal|author=Smith, Alison Moore|title=The Iconography of the Sacrifice of Isaac in Early Christian Art|jstor=497708|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=159\u201373|doi=10.2307/497708|year=1922}}</ref> Excluding the fragments, Alison Moore Smith classifies these artistic works in three categories:\n\n{{Quote|\"Abraham leads Isaac towards the altar; or Isaac approaches with the bundle of sticks, Abraham having preceded him to the place of offering ....

The league was born as a result of the escape of several of the best clubs of the old championship organized by the Italian federation, such as Milano Rhinos, Parma Panthers, Bologna Doves and Bolzano Giants. However some of the historic Italian clubs have not joined the new league and continue to participate in different tournaments organized by other federations. This is the case of Legnano Frogs, Torino Giaguari, etc.\nIn the following years a lot of teams moved to the [[FIDAF]] (the federation where the IFL belongs to) and most of the biggest teams are now part of the IFL that is the First Division or in the other 2 divisions.\n\n== IFL teams ==\n*[[Ancona Dolphins]] (2008\u2013present) \n*[[Bergamo Lions]] (2008\u201310, 2012, 2014\u2013present)\n*[[Bologna Doves]] (2008\u201309, 2011\u201312) (now in III Division)\n*[[Bologna Warriors]] (2009\u2013present)\n*[[Bolzano Giants]] (2008\u2013present)\n*[[Catania Elephants]] (2008\u201312) (now in II Division)\n*[[Ferrara Aquile]] (2014\u2013present)\n*[[Lazio Marines]] (2009\u2013present)\n*[[Martesana Daemons]] (2012) (now in II Division)\n*[[Rhinos Milano|Milano Rhinos]] (2008\u2013present)\n*[[Milano Seamen]] (2011\u2013present)\n*[[Napoli Briganti]] (2014\u2013present \u2666) \n*[[Palermo Corsari]] (2008 \u2020) \n*[[Palermo Sharks]] (2008) (now in II Division)\n*[[Parma Panthers]] (2008\u2013present)\n*[[Reggio Emilia Hogs]] (2009\u201313) (now in II Division)\n*[[Roma Grizzlies]] (2015\u2013present \u2021) \n*[[Torino Giaguari]] (2014\u2013present)\n\n\u2020 defunct<br />\n\u2666 due to league expansion the [[Napoli]] team can play the 2015 IFL season and is not relegated to the second division<br />\n\u2021 Roma Grizzlies won the second division championship and earned the right to play the 2015 IFL season<ref>[http://www.iltempo.it/sport/sport-locale/2014/07/14/i-grizzlies-sbranano-gli-elephants-1.1271030 I Grizzlies sbranano gli Elephants - Sport Locale - iltempo<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Championship games==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

largest and easternmost [[province of Indonesia]], comprising most of [[Western New Guinea]]. Papua is bordered by the nation of [[Papua New Guinea]] to the east, and by [[West Papua (province)|West Papua province]] to the west. Since 2002, Papua province has special autonomy status, making it a [[Provinces of Indonesia|special region]]. Its capital is [[Jayapura]]. It was formerly called '''Irian Jaya''' (and earlier '''West Irian''' or '''Irian Barat''') and comprised all of Indonesian New Guinea. In 2002 the current name was adopted and in 2003 West Papua province was created from western parts of Papua province.\n\n== Naming ==\n\"Papua\" is the official Indonesian and internationally recognised name for the province.\n\nDuring the Dutch colonial era the region was known as part of \"Dutch New Guinea\" or \"[[Netherlands New Guinea]]\". Since its annexation in 1969, it became known as \"West Irian\" or \"Irian Barat\" until 1973, and thereafter renamed \"Irian Jaya\" (roughly translated, \"Glorious Irian\") by the [[Suharto]] administration.<ref>{{cite web|author=Simpson, Brad|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB128/|title=Indonesia's 1969 Takeover of West Papua Not by \"Free Choice\"|work=[[National Security Archive]]|date=9 July 2004|accessdate=15 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papuaweb.org/goi/uu-dll/pp1973-05.html |title=Undang-2, Inpres, dll. \u2013 Laws, Decrees, etc.|work=[[Cenderawasih University]]|date=23 February 2005|accessdate=15 March 2009}}</ref> This was the official name until the name \"Papua\" was adopted in 2002. Today, the indigenous inhabitants of this province prefer to call themselves Papuans.\n\nThe name \"West Papua\" was adopted in 1961 by the [[New Guinea Council]] until the [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA) transferred administration to the Republic of Indonesia in 1963. \"West Papua\" has since been used by Papuans as a self-identifying term, especially by those demanding self-determination, and usually refers to the whole of the Indonesian portion of New Guinea. The other Indonesian province that shares New Guinea, West Irian Jaya, has been officially renamed as [[West Papua (province)|''West Papua'']], or ''Papua Barat''. The entire western New Guinea is often referred to as \"West Papua\" internationally \u2013 especially among networks of international solidarity with the West Papuan independence movement.\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Nius Kogoya.jpg|left|thumb|Nius Kogoya, Provincial Representative for Tolikara]]\nThe province of Papua is governed by a directly elected governor (currently Lukas Enembe) and a regional legislature, '''[[People's Representative Council]] of province of Papua''' (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Papua'').{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A government organisation that only exists in Papua is the '''Papuan People's Council''' (''Majelis Rakyat Papua'') Papuan People's Council), which was formed by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]] in 2005 as a coalition of Papuan tribal chiefs, tasked with arbitration and speaking on behalf of Papuan tribal customs.\n\nIndonesian sovereignty over Papua dates back to 1969, when Indonesia conducted a referendum (referred to by the Indonesian government as the [[Act of Free Choice]]) on the self-determination of the peoples of Papua under an agreement with the United Nations to respect any result. Instead of conducting a democratic referendum amongst the general population, Indonesian security forces forcibly coerced a small number of tribal elders to vote to join Indonesia; some elders were not even made aware that a referendum was to be conducted beforehand. Nevertheless, the agreement with the UN was nominally upheld, and was recognised by the international community in spite of protests. This intensified the [[Free Papua Movement|independence movement among indigenous West Papuans]], deepening the [[Papua conflict]], which began when the Dutch withdrew from the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] in 1963. The conflict has continued to the present, with Indonesian security forces being accused of numerous human rights abuses in their suppression of the independence movement. The Indonesian government maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors from entering; those who do must do so covertly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2013/01/201313018313632585.html|title=Goodbye Indonesia|date=31 January 2013|work=People and Power|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 it was proposed to split the province into three government-controlled sectors, sparking Papuan protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldevangelical.org/persec_papua_21nov03.html|title=World Evangelical|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206185259/http://www.worldevangelical.org/persec_papua_21nov03.html|archivedate=6 December 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In January 2003 President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] signed an order dividing Papua into three provinces: Central Irian Jaya (Irian Jaya Tengah), Papua (or East Irian Jaya, Irian Jaya Timur), and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] (Irian Jaya Barat). The formality of installing a local government for Jaraka in Irian Jaya Barat (West) took place in February 2003 and a governor was appointed in November; a government for Irian Jaya Tengah (Central Irian Jaya) was delayed from August 2003 due to violent local protests. The creation of this separate Central Irian Jaya Province was blocked by Indonesian courts, who declared it to be unconstitutional and in contravention of the Papua's special autonomy agreement. The previous division into two provinces was allowed to stand as an established fact.<ref>King, 2004, p.&nbsp;91</ref>\n\n== Special autonomy status ==\nThe province of Papua is one of three provinces to have obtained special autonomy status, the others being [[Aceh]] and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. According to Law 21/2001 on Special Autonomy Status ''(UU Nomor 21 Tahun 2001 tentang Otonomi khusus Papua),'' the provincial government of Papua is provided with authority within all sectors of administration, except for the five strategic areas of foreign affairs, security and defense,  monetary and fiscal affairs, religion and justice. The provincial government is authorised to issue local regulations to further stipulate the implementation of the special autonomy, including regulating the authority of districts and municipalities within the province. Due to its special autonomy status, Papua province is provided with significant amount of special autonomy funds, which can be used to benefit its indigenous peoples. But the province has low fiscal capacity and it is highly dependent on unconditional transfers and the above-mentioned special autonomy fund, which accounted for about 55% of total revenues in 2008.\n\nAfter obtaining its special autonomy status, in order to allow the local population access to timber production benefits, the Papuan provincial government issued a number of decrees, enabling:\n* a Timber Logging Permit for Customary Communities, which enabled local people to carry out timber extraction in small concessions (250 to 1,000 hectares) for one year through a community-based or participatory community cooperative;\n* a Permit to Manage Customary Forests, which was a timber extraction permit for larger concessions (up to 2,000 hectares) for a maximum of 20 years;\n* logging companies had to pay compensations to local communities in addition to all other fees and taxes collected by the national government.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nAs of 2010 (following the separation of West Papua Province in 2003), the residual Papua Province consisted of 28 [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') and one autonomous city (''kota''); these regencies and the city are together subdivided into 385 [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), and thence into \"villages\" (''kelurahan'' and ''desa''). In Papua, as well as in the province of West Papua, ''kecamatan'' are commonly referred to as ''distrik''.\n\nThe regencies (''kabupaten'') and the city (''kota'') are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and according to the latest official (January 2014) Estimates.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is related to an ''[[interdiscipline]]'' or an ''interdisciplinary field,'' which is an organizational unit that crosses traditional boundaries between [[Outline of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] or [[School of thought|schools of thought]], as new needs and professions emerge. Large [[engineering]] teams are usually interdisciplinary, as a [[power station]] or [[mobile phone]] or other project requires the melding of several specialties. However, the term \"interdisciplinary\" is sometimes confined to academic settings.\n\nThe term ''interdisciplinary'' is applied within education and training pedagogies to describe studies that use methods and insights of several established disciplines or traditional fields of study. Interdisciplinarity involves researchers, students, and teachers in the goals of connecting and integrating several academic schools of thought, professions, or technologies\u2014along with their specific perspectives\u2014in the pursuit of a common task. The [[epidemiology]] of [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[global warming]] requires understanding of diverse disciplines to solve complex problems. ''Interdisciplinary'' may be applied where the subject is felt to have been neglected or even misrepresented in the traditional disciplinary structure of research institutions, for example, [[women's studies]] or ethnic area studies. Interdisciplinarity can likewise be applied to complex subjects that can only be understood by combining the perspectives of two or more fields.\n\nThe [[adjective]] ''interdisciplinary'' is most often used in educational circles when researchers from two or more disciplines pool their approaches and modify them so that they are better suited to the problem at hand, including the case of the team-taught course where students are required to understand a given subject in terms of multiple traditional disciplines.  For example, the subject of [[land use]] may appear differently when examined by different disciplines, for instance, [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], [[geography]], and [[politics]].\n\n==Development==\nAlthough \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d and \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d are frequently viewed as twentieth century terms, the concept has historical antecedents, most notably [[Greek philosophy]].<ref name=\"ausburg\">{{cite book|author=Ausburg, Tanya|title=Becoming Interdisciplinary: An Introduction to Interdisciplinary Studies|edition=2nd |location= New York|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing|year=2006}}</ref> [[Julie Thompson Klein]] attests that \"the roots of the concepts lie in a number of ideas that resonate through modern discourse\u2014the ideas of a unified science, general knowledge, synthesis and the integration of knowledge\",<ref>{{cite book|author=Klein, Julie Thompson|title=Interdisciplinarity: History, Theory, and Practice|location=Detroit|publisher=Wayne State University|year=1990}}</ref> while Giles Gunn says that [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[historians]] and [[Playwright|dramatists]] took elements from other realms of knowledge (such as [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]) to further understand their own material.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gunn, Giles|chapter=Interdisciplinary Studies|editor=Gibaldi, J.|title= Introduction to Scholarship in Modern Language and Literatures|location=New York|publisher=Modern Language Association|year=1992|pp=239\u2013240|isbn= 978-0873523851}}</ref> The building of [[Roman roads]] required men who understood [[surveying]], [[material science]], [[logistics]] and several other disciplines. Any broadminded humanist project involves interdisciplinarity, and history shows a crowd of cases, as seventeenth-century Leibniz's task to create a system of universal justice, which required linguistics, economics, management, ethics, law philosophy, politics, and even sinology.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s-Gallego|title=Are Humanism and Mixed Methods Related?

For example, social science disciplines such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] paid little attention to the social analysis of [[technology]] throughout most of the twentieth century. As a result, many social scientists with interests in technology have joined [[science, technology and society]] programs, which are typically staffed by scholars drawn from numerous disciplines. They may also arise from new research developments, such as [[nanotechnology]], which cannot be addressed without combining the approaches of two or more disciplines. Examples include [[quantum information processing]], an amalgamation of [[quantum physics]] and [[computer science]], and [[bioinformatics]], combining [[molecular biology]] with computer science. [[Sustainable development]] as a research area deals with problems requiring analysis and synthesis across economic, social and environmental spheres; often an integration of multiple social and natural science disciplines. Interdisciplinary research is also key to the study of health sciences, for example in studying optimal solutions to diseases.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.S. Edge|author2=S.J. Hoffman|author3=C.L.

On some views, however, interdisciplinarity is entirely indebted to those who specialize in one field of study\u2014that is, without specialists, interdisciplinarians would have no information and no leading experts to consult. Others place the focus of interdisciplinarity on the need to transcend disciplines, viewing excessive specialization as problematic both epistemologically and politically. When interdisciplinary collaboration or research results in new solutions to problems, much information is given back to the various disciplines involved. Therefore, both disciplinarians and interdisciplinarians may be seen in complementary relation to one another.\n\n==Barriers==\nBecause most participants in interdisciplinary ventures were trained in traditional disciplines, they must learn to appreciate differing of perspectives and methods. For example, a discipline that places more emphasis on quantitative \"rigor\" may produce practitioners who think of themselves (and their discipline) as \"more scientific\" than others; in turn, colleagues in \"softer\" disciplines may associate quantitative approaches with an inability to grasp the broader dimensions of a problem. An interdisciplinary program may not succeed if its members remain stuck in their disciplines (and in disciplinary attitudes). On the other hand, and from the disciplinary perspective, much interdisciplinary work may be seen as \"soft\", lacking in rigor, or ideologically motivated; these beliefs place barriers in the career paths of those who choose interdisciplinary work.  For example, interdisciplinary grant applications are often refereed by [[peer review]]ers drawn from established [[Academic discipline|disciplines]]; not surprisingly, interdisciplinary researchers may experience difficulty getting funding for their research. In addition, untenured researchers know that, when they seek [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] and [[tenure]], it is likely that some of the evaluators will lack commitment to interdisciplinarity. They may fear that making a commitment to interdisciplinary research will increase the risk of being denied tenure.\n\nInterdisciplinary programs may fail if they are not given sufficient autonomy. For example, interdisciplinary faculty are usually recruited to a [[joint appointment]], with responsibilities in both an interdisciplinary program (such as [[women's studies]]) and a traditional discipline (such as [[history]]). If the traditional discipline makes the tenure decisions, new interdisciplinary faculty will be hesitant to commit themselves fully to interdisciplinary work. Other barriers include the generally disciplinary orientation of most scholarly journals, leading to the perception, if not the fact, that interdisciplinary research is hard to publish. In addition, since traditional budgetary practices at most universities channel resources through the disciplines, it becomes difficult to account for a given scholar or teacher's salary and time. During periods of budgetary contraction, the natural tendency to serve the primary constituency (i.e., students majoring in the traditional discipline) makes resources scarce for teaching and research comparatively far from the center of the discipline as traditionally understood. For these same reasons, the introduction of new interdisciplinary programs is often resisted because it is perceived as a competition for diminishing funds.\n\nDue to these and other barriers, interdisciplinary research areas are strongly motivated to become disciplines themselves. If they succeed, they can establish their own research funding programs and make their own tenure and promotion decisions. In so doing, they lower the risk of entry. Examples of former interdisciplinary research areas that have become disciplines, many of them named for their parent disciplines, include [[neuroscience]], [[cybernetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. These new fields are occasionally referred to as \"interdisciplines\". On the other hand, even though interdisciplinary activities are now a focus of attention for institutions promoting learning and teaching, as well as organizational and social entities concerned with education, they are practically facing complex barriers, serious challenges and criticism. The most important obstacles and challenges faced by interdisciplinary activities in the past two decades can be divided into \"professional\", \"organizational\", and \"cultural\" obstacles.<ref>{{cite book|author=Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali|title=Interdisciplinary Higher Education; Criticism, Challenges and Obstacles|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&context=researchday|date=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Interdisciplinary studies and studies of interdisciplinarity==\nAn initial distinction should be made between interdisciplinary studies, which can be found spread across the academy today, and the study of interdisciplinarity, which involves a much smaller group of researchers. The former is instantiated in thousands of research centers across the US and the world. The latter has one US organization, the Association for Interdisciplinary Studies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.units.muohio.edu/aisorg/|title=Association for Interdisciplinary Studies Homepage - Association for Interdisciplinary Studies - Oakland University|website=www.units.muohio.edu}}</ref> (founded in 1979), two international organizations, the International Network of Inter- and Transdisciplinarity<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inidtd.org/|title=INIT-Home|website=www.inidtd.org}}</ref> (founded in 2010) and the Philosophy of/as Interdisciplinarity Network<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pin-net.gatech.edu/|title=PIN / HOME|website=pin-net.gatech.edu}}</ref> (founded in 2009), and one research institute devoted to the theory and practice of interdisciplinarity, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity at the University of North Texas (founded in 2008). As of September 1, 2014, the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity has ceased to exist. This is the result of administrative decisions at the University of North Texas.<ref>{{cite web|last1=University of Texas|title=Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity|url=https://webarchive.library.unt.edu/unt/csid/20140911224746/http://csid.unt.edu/news.html#closing|website=University of Texas|publisher=University of Texas|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn '''interdisciplinary study''' is an academic program or process seeking to synthesize broad [[perspective (cognitive)|perspectives]], knowledge, skills, interconnections, and [[epistemology]] in an educational setting. Interdisciplinary programs may be founded in order to facilitate the study of subjects which have some coherence, but which cannot be adequately understood from a single disciplinary perspective (for example, women's studies or [[medievalism|medieval studies]]). More rarely, and at a more advanced level, interdisciplinarity may itself become the focus of study, in a critique of institutionalized disciplines' ways of segmenting knowledge.\n\nIn contrast, '''studies of interdisciplinarity''' raise to self-consciousness questions about how interdisciplinarity works, the nature and history of disciplinarity, and the future of knowledge in [[post-industrial society]]. Researchers at the Center for the Study of Interdisciplinarity have made the distinction between philosophy 'of' and 'as' interdisciplinarity, the former identifying a new, discrete area within philosophy that raises epistemological and metaphysical questions about the status of interdisciplinary thinking, with the latter pointing toward a philosophical practice that is sometimes called 'field philosophy'.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/experiments-in-field-philosophy/?_r=0 | title=Experiments of Field Psychology | work=Opinionator | date=November 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 30, 2016 | author=Frodeman, Robert}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frodeman | first1 = Robert | last2 = Briggle | first2 = Adam | last3 = Holbrook | first3 = J.

The number of interdisciplinary bachelor's degrees awarded annually rose from 7,000 in 1973 to 30,000 a year by 2005 according to data from the National Center of Educational Statistics (NECS). In addition, educational leaders from the Boyer Commission to Carnegie's President [[Vartan Gregorian]] to [[Alan I. Leshner]], CEO of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] have advocated for interdisciplinary rather than disciplinary approaches to problem solving in the 21st century.  This has been echoed by federal funding agencies, particularly the [[National Institutes of Health]] under the direction of [[Elias Zerhouni]], who has advocated that grant proposals be framed more as interdisciplinary collaborative projects than single researcher, single discipline ones.\n\nAt the same time, many thriving longstanding bachelor's in interdisciplinary studies programs in existence for 30 or more years, have been closed down, in spite of healthy enrollment. Examples include Arizona International (formerly part of the [[University of Arizona]]), the School of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Miami University]], and the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Wayne State University]]; others such as the Department of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Appalachian State University]], and [[George Mason University]]'s [[New Century College]], have been cut back. Stuart Henry{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} has seen this trend as part of the [[hegemony]] of the disciplines in their attempt to recolonize the experimental knowledge production of otherwise marginalized fields of inquiry. This is due to threat perceptions seemingly based on the ascendancy of interdisciplinary studies against traditional academia.\n\n==Historical examples==\nThere are many examples of when a particular idea, almost on the same period, arises in different disciplines. One case is the shift from the approach of focusing on \"specialized segments of attention\" (adopting one particular perspective), to the idea of \"instant sensory awareness of the whole\", an attention to the \"total field\", a \"sense of the whole pattern, of form and function as a unity\", an \"integral idea of structure and configuration\". This has happened in painting (with [[cubism]]), physics, poetry, communication and [[educational theory]]. According to [[Marshall McLuhan]], this [[paradigm shift]] was due to the passage from an era shaped by [[mechanization]], which brought sequentiality, to the era shaped by the instant speed of electricity, which brought simultaneity.<ref>[[Marshall McLuhan]] (1964) ''[[Understanding Media]]'', p.13 {{cite web |url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011132326/http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/theory/McLuhan-Understanding_Media-I-1-7.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Efforts to simplify and defend the concept ==\nAn article in the ''Social Science Journal''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1997|title=Ten cheers for interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=|journal=Social Science Journal|volume=34|pages=201\u2013216|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0362-3319(97)90051-3|pmid=}}</ref> attempts to provide a simple, common-sense, definition of interdisciplinarity, bypassing the difficulties of defining that concept and obviating the need for such related concepts as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[pluridisciplinarity]], and [[multidisciplinarity]]:<blockquote>\"To begin with, a discipline can be conveniently defined as any comparatively self-contained and isolated domain of human experience which possesses its own community of experts. Interdisciplinarity is best seen as bringing together distinctive components of two or more disciplines. In academic discourse, interdisciplinarity typically applies to four realms: knowledge, research, education, and theory. Interdisciplinary knowledge involves familiarity with components of two or more disciplines. Interdisciplinary research combines components of two or more disciplines in the search or creation of new knowledge, operations, or artistic expressions. Interdisciplinary education merges components of two or more disciplines in a single program of instruction. Interdisciplinary theory takes interdisciplinary knowledge, research, or education as its main objects of study.\"</blockquote>In turn, interdisciplinary ''richness'' of any two instances of knowledge, research, or education can be ranked by weighing four variables: number of disciplines involved, the \"distance\" between them, the novelty of any particular combination, and their extent of integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|date=1995|title=Fruits, Salads, and Smoothies:  A Working Definition of Interdisciplinarity|url=http://www.uta.edu/faculty/repko/INTS_4391/SMOOTHIE.htm|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=29|pages=119\u2013126|issue=2|doi=|pmid=}}</ref>\n\nInterdisciplinary knowledge and research are important because:\n#\"Creativity often requires interdisciplinary knowledge.\n#Immigrants often make important contributions to their new field.\n#Disciplinarians often commit errors which can be best detected by people familiar with two or more disciplines.\n#Some worthwhile topics of research fall in the interstices among the traditional disciplines.\n#Many intellectual, social, and practical problems require interdisciplinary approaches.\n#Interdisciplinary knowledge and research serve to remind us of the unity-of-knowledge ideal.\n#Interdisciplinarians enjoy greater flexibility in their research.\n#More so than narrow disciplinarians, interdisciplinarians often treat themselves to the intellectual equivalent of traveling in new lands.\n#Interdisciplinarians may help breach communication gaps in the modern academy, thereby helping to mobilize its enormous intellectual resources in the cause of greater social rationality and justice.\n#By bridging fragmented disciplines, interdisciplinarians might play a role in the defense of academic freedom.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Quotations ==\n<blockquote>\"The modern mind divides, specializes, thinks in categories: the Greek instinct was the opposite, to take the widest view, to see things as an organic whole ....

The partial sorted list (black) initially contains only the first element in the list. With each iteration one element (red) is removed from the input data and inserted in-place into the sorted list.]]\n\nInsertion sort [[Iteration|iterates]], consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.\n\nSorting is typically done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there against the largest value in the sorted list (which happens to be next to it, in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the element in place and moves to the next. If smaller, it finds the correct position within the sorted list, shifts all the larger values up to make a space, and inserts into that correct position.\n\nThe resulting array after ''k'' iterations has the property where the first ''k'' + 1 entries are sorted (\"+1\" because the first entry is skipped). In each iteration the first remaining entry of the input is removed, and inserted into the result at the correct position, thus extending the result:\n\n[[Image:insertionsort-before.png|Array prior to the insertion of x]]\n\nbecomes\n\n[[Image:insertionsort-after.png|Array after the insertion of x]]\n\nwith each element greater than ''x'' copied to the right as it is compared against ''x''.\n\nThe most common variant of insertion sort, which operates on arrays, can be described as follows:\n# Suppose there exists a function called ''Insert'' designed to insert a value into a sorted sequence at the beginning of an array. It operates by beginning at the end of the sequence and shifting each element one place to the right until a suitable position is found for the new element. The function has the side effect of overwriting the value stored immediately after the sorted sequence in the array.\n# To perform an insertion sort, begin at the left-most element of the array and invoke ''Insert'' to insert each element encountered into its correct position. The ordered sequence into which the element is inserted is stored at the beginning of the array in the set of indices already examined. Each insertion overwrites a single value: the value being inserted.\n\n[[Pseudocode]] of the complete algorithm follows, where the arrays are [[Zero-based numbering|zero-based]]:<ref name=\"pearls\"/>\n<!--\n***************************************\n\nNOTE TO WOULD-BE BUG FIXERS:\n\nThe variable i is meant to range over all but the first element of A.

In this case insertion sort has a linear running time (i.e., O(''n'')). During each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array.\n\nThe simplest worst case input is an array sorted in reverse order. The set of all worst case inputs consists of all arrays where each element is the smallest or second-smallest of the elements before it. In these cases every iteration of the inner loop will scan and shift the entire sorted subsection of the array before inserting the next element. This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time (i.e., O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)).\n\nThe average case is also quadratic<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/a/17055342|first=Keith|last=Schwarz|title=Why is insertion sort \u0398(n^2) in the average case? (answer by \"templatetypedef\")|publisher=Stack Overflow}}</ref>, which makes insertion sort impractical for sorting large arrays. However, insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even faster than [[quicksort]]; indeed, good [[quicksort]] implementations use insertion sort for arrays smaller than a certain threshold, also when arising as subproblems; the exact threshold must be determined experimentally and depends on the machine, but is commonly around ten.\n\nExample:\nThe following table shows the steps for sorting the sequence {3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1}.  In each step, the key under consideration is underlined. The key that was moved (or left in place because it was biggest yet considered) in the previous step is marked with an asterisk.\n\n <u>3</u>  7  4  9  5  2  6  1\n 3* <u>7</u>  4  9  5  2  6  1\n 3  7* <u>4</u>  9  5  2  6  1\n 3  4* 7  <u>9</u>  5  2  6  1\n 3  4  7  9* <u>5</u>  2  6  1\n 3  4  5* 7  9  <u>2</u>  6  1\n 2* 3  4  5  7  9  <u>6</u>  1\n 2  3  4  5  6* 7  9  <u>1</u>\n 1* 2  3  4  5  6  7  9\n\n==Relation to other sorting algorithms==\nInsertion sort is very similar to [[selection sort]]. As in selection sort, after ''k'' passes through the array, the first ''k'' elements are in sorted order. However, the fundamental difference between the two algorithms is that for selection sort these are the ''k'' smallest elements of the unsorted input, while in insertion sort they are simply the first ''k'' elements of the input. The primary advantage of insertion sort over selection sort is that selection sort must always scan all remaining elements to find the absolute smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list, while insertion sort requires only a single comparison when the ''k''+1th element is greater than the ''k''th element; when this is frequently true (such as if the input array is already sorted or partially sorted), insertion sort is distinctly more efficient compared to selection sort. On average (assuming the rank of the ''k''+1th element rank is random), insertion sort will require comparing and shifting half of the previous ''k'' elements, meaning insertion sort will perform about half as many comparisons as selection sort on average. In the worst case for insertion sort (when the input array is reverse-sorted), insertion sort performs just as many comparisons as selection sort. However, a disadvantage of insertion sort over selection sort is that it requires more writes due to the fact that, on each iteration, inserting the ''k''+1th element into the sorted portion of the array requires many element swaps to shift all of the following elements, while only a single swap is required for each iteration of selection sort. In general, insertion sort will write to the array O(''n''<sup>2</sup>) times, whereas selection sort will write only O({{mvar|n}}) times. For this reason selection sort may be preferable in cases where writing to memory is significantly more expensive than reading, such as with [[EEPROM]] or [[flash memory]].\n\nWhile some [[divide-and-conquer algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]] and [[mergesort]] outperform insertion sort for larger arrays, non-recursive sorting algorithms such as insertion sort or selection sort are generally faster for very small arrays (the exact size varies by environment and implementation, but is typically between seven and fifty elements). Therefore, a useful optimization in the implementation of those algorithms is a hybrid approach, using the simpler algorithm when the array has been divided to a small size.<ref name=\"pearls\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n[[Donald Shell|D.L. Shell]] made substantial improvements to the algorithm; the modified version is called [[Shellsort|Shell sort]].  The sorting algorithm compares elements separated by a distance that decreases on each pass. Shell sort has distinctly improved running times in practical work, with two simple variants requiring O(''n''<sup>3/2</sup>) and O(''n''<sup>4/3</sup>) running time{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nIf the cost of comparisons exceeds the cost of swaps, as is the case for example with string keys stored by reference or with human interaction (such as choosing one of a pair displayed side-by-side), then using ''binary insertion sort''{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} may yield better performance. Binary insertion sort employs a [[binary search algorithm|binary search]] to determine the correct location to insert new elements, and therefore performs \u2308log<sub>2</sub>(''n'')\u2309 comparisons in the worst case, which is O(''n'' log ''n''). The algorithm as a whole still has a running time of O(''n''<sup>2</sup>) on average because of the series of swaps required for each insertion.\n\nThe number of swaps can be reduced by calculating the position of multiple elements before moving them. For example, if the target position of two elements is calculated before they are moved into the right position, the number of swaps can be reduced by about 25% for random data. In the extreme case, this variant works similar to [[merge sort]].\n\nA variant named ''binary merge sort'' uses a ''binary insertion sort'' to sort groups of 32 elements, followed by a final sort using [[merge sort]]. It combines the speed of insertion sort on small data sets with the speed of merge sort on large data sets.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Binary Merge Sort\n| url = https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B8KIVX-AaaGiYzcta0pFUXJnNG8\n|mode=cs2\n}}</ref>\n\nTo avoid having to make a series of swaps for each insertion, the input could be stored in a [[linked list]], which allows elements to be spliced into or out of the list in constant-time when the position in the list is known.<!-- Troubling statement when insert/delete is used. The typical insertion and deletion operations take O(n) if position is not known. The O(1) operations are cons/splice/rplacd. -->  However, searching a linked list requires sequentially following the links to the desired position: a linked list does not have random access, so it cannot use a faster method such as binary search.  Therefore, the running time required for searching is O(''n'') and the time for sorting is O(''n''<sup>2</sup>).<!-- Instead of search, a max operation is more appropriate. --> If a more sophisticated [[data structure]] (e.g., [[heap (data structure)|heap]] or [[binary tree]]) is used, the time required for searching and insertion can be reduced significantly; this is the essence of [[heap sort]] and [[binary tree sort]].\n\nIn 2006 Bender, [[Farach-Colton|Martin Farach-Colton]], and Mosteiro published a new variant of insertion sort called ''[[library sort]]'' or ''gapped insertion sort'' that leaves a small number of unused spaces (i.e., \"gaps\") spread throughout the array. The benefit is that insertions need only shift elements over until a gap is reached. The authors show that this sorting algorithm runs with high probability in O(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'') time.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Bender | first1 = Michael A.\n | last2 = Farach-Colton | first2 = Mart\u00edn | authorlink2 = Martin Farach-Colton\n | last3 = Mosteiro | first3 = Miguel A.\n | year = 2006\n | title = Insertion sort is ''O''(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'')\n | journal = Theory of Computing Systems\n | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 391\u2013397\n | arxiv = cs/0407003\n | doi = 10.1007/s00224-005-1237-z\n | mr = 2218409\n}}</ref>\n\nIf a [[skip list]] is used, the insertion time is brought down to O(log ''n''), and swaps are not needed because the skip list is implemented on a linked list structure.  The final running time for insertion would be O(''n'' log ''n'').\n\n''List insertion sort'' is a variant of insertion sort. It reduces the number of movements.{{Citation needed |date=September 2011}}\n\n===List insertion sort code in C===\nIf the items are stored in a linked list, then the list can be sorted with O(1) additional space.  The algorithm starts with an initially empty (and therefore trivially sorted) list. The input items are taken off the list one at a time, and then inserted in the proper place in the sorted list.

Since 1991, the Ig Nobel Prizes have been awarded to \"honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think.\" The name of the award is a pun on the word ''[[wikt:ignoble|ignoble]],'' which means \"characterized by baseness, lowness, or meanness,\" and is satirical social criticism that identifies \"absurd\" research, although, occasionally, such research has succeeded in yielding useful knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ignoble |title=Merriam Webster Dictionary |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Merriam Webster |accessdate=21 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nOrganized by the scientific humor magazine, the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' (AIR), the Ig Nobel Prizes are presented by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]] in a ceremony at the [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Sanders Theater]], Harvard University, and are followed by the winners\u2019 public lectures at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/09/ig_nobel_prize_2012_improbable_research_presented_in_sept_20_ceremony_and_this_is_improbable_book_.html |title=The Greatest Hits of Weird Science; What the Oscars could learn from the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony |authorlink=Marc Abrahams |first=Marc |last=Abrahams |date=12 September 2012 |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate.com]] }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Ig Nobels were created in 1991 by [[Marc Abrahams]], editor and co-founder of the ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', editor-in-chief of the ''[[Journal of Irreproducible Results]]'' and master of ceremonies at all subsequent awards ceremonies. Awards were presented at that time for discoveries \"that cannot, or should not, be reproduced\". Ten prizes are awarded each year in many categories, including the Nobel Prize categories of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[physiology]]/[[medicine]], [[literature]], and peace, but also other categories such as [[public health]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], and [[interdisciplinary research]]. The Ig Nobel Prizes recognize genuine achievements, with the exception of three prizes awarded in the first year to fictitious scientists [[Josiah S. Carberry]], [[Paul DeFanti]], and [[Administratium|Thomas Kyle]].\n\nThe awards are sometimes [[criticism]] via [[satire]], as in the two awards given for [[homeopathy]] research, prizes in \"[[science education]]\" to the [[Kansas State Department of Education]] and [[Colorado State Board of Education]] for their [[Kansas evolution hearings|stance]] regarding the [[Creation and evolution in public education|teaching of evolution]], and the prize awarded to ''[[Social Text]]'' after the [[Sokal affair]]. Most often, however, they draw attention to [[scientific articles]] that have some humorous or unexpected aspect. Examples range from the discovery that the presence of humans tends to sexually arouse [[ostrich]]es, to the statement that [[black hole]]s fulfill all the technical requirements to be the location of [[Hell]], to research on the \"[[five-second rule]]\" - a tongue-in-cheek belief that food dropped on the floor will not become contaminated if it is picked up within five seconds.\n\nIn 2010, Sir [[Andre Geim]], who had been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2000 for levitating a frog by [[magnetism]],  was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 2010, for his work with [[graphene]].  He thereby became the first (and only) individual to have received both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel.<ref name=\"Overbye_NYT\">{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=Physics Nobel Honors Work on Ultra-Thin Carbon|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/science/06nobel.html|accessdate=5 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Ceremony ==\nThe prizes are presented by genuine [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates]], originally at a ceremony in a lecture hall at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], but now in the [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)|Sanders Theater]] at [[Harvard University]].

In past years, physics professor [[Roy J. Glauber]] swept the stage clean of the airplanes as the official \"Keeper of the Broom.\" Glauber could not attend the 2005 awards because he was traveling to [[Stockholm]] to claim a genuine [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].\n\nThe \"Parade of Ignitaries\" into the hall includes supporting groups. At the 1997 ceremonies, a team of \"cryogenic sex researchers\" distributed a pamphlet titled \"Safe Sex at [[Liquid helium|Four Kelvin]]\". Delegates from the [[Museum of Bad Art]] are often on hand to display some pieces from their collection.\n\n== Outreach ==\nThe ceremony is recorded and broadcast on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] and is shown live over the Internet. The recording is broadcast every year, on the Friday after U.S. [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], on the public radio program ''[[Science Friday]]''.

He is one of the foremost composers of the Post-Romantic era who also had a significant influence on his contemporaries and younger composers. He is best known for his [[piano]] works based on Spanish [[folk music]] idioms. \n\nTranscriptions of many of his pieces, such as ''[[Asturias (Leyenda)]]'', ''[[Granada (Alb\u00e9niz)|Granada]]'', ''[[Sevilla (Alb\u00e9niz)|Sevilla]]'', ''[[Cadiz (Alb\u00e9niz)|Cadiz]]'', ''[[C\u00f3rdoba (Alb\u00e9niz)|C\u00f3rdoba]]'', ''[[Catalu\u00f1a (Alb\u00e9niz)|Catalu\u00f1a]]'', and the ''[[Tango in D]]'', are important pieces for classical guitar, though he never composed for the guitar. The personal papers of Alb\u00e9niz are preserved, among other institutions, in the ''[[Biblioteca de Catalunya]]''.\n\n==Life==\n\n[[File:Alb\u00e9niz with his daughter Laura.jpg|thumb|left|Alb\u00e9niz with his daughter, Laura]]\n\nBorn in [[Camprodon]], province of [[Girona]], to \u00c1ngel Alb\u00e9niz (a customs official) and his wife, Dolors Pascual, Alb\u00e9niz was a [[child prodigy]] who first performed at the age of four. At age seven, after apparently taking lessons from [[Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Marmontel]], he passed the entrance examination for piano at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], but he was refused admission because he was believed to be too young.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.}} By the time he had reached 12, he had made many attempts to run away from home.\n\nHis concert career began at the age of nine when his father toured both Isaac and his sister, Clementina, throughout northern Spain. A popular myth is that at the age of twelve Alb\u00e9niz stowed away in a ship bound for [[Buenos Aires]]. He then found himself in [[Cuba]], then to the United States, giving concerts in New York and San Francisco and then travelled to [[Liverpool]], [[London]] and [[Leipzig]].<ref>[http://www.gramophone.net/ComposerOfTheWeek/View/187 Gramophone Archive]</ref> By age 15, he had already given concerts worldwide.This story is not entirely false, Alb\u00e9niz did travel the world as a performer; however, he was accompanied by his ''father'', who as a customs agent was required to travel frequently. This can be attested by comparing Isaac's concert dates with his father's travel itinerary.\n\nIn 1876, after a short stay at the [[Leipzig Conservatory]], he went to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]] after King Alfonso's personal secretary, [[Guillermo Morphy]], obtained him a royal grant.{{sfn|Clark|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dg60ZjqZLfkC&pg=PA36 36]}} Count Morphy thought highly of Alb\u00e9niz, who would later dedicate ''[[Sevilla (Alb\u00e9niz)|Sevilla]]'' to Morphy's wife when it premiered in Paris in January 1886.{{sfn|Clark|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dg60ZjqZLfkC&pg=PA69 69]}}\n\nIn 1880 Alb\u00e9niz went to [[Budapest]], Hungary, to study with [[Franz Liszt]], only to find out that Liszt was in [[Weimar]], Germany.\n\nIn 1883 he met the teacher and composer [[Felip Pedrell]], who inspired him to write Spanish music such as the ''[[Chants d'Espagne]]''. The first movement (Prelude) of that suite, later retitled after the composer's death as ''[[Chants d'Espagne#1. Prelude|Asturias (Leyenda)]]'', is probably most famous today as part of the [[classical guitar]] repertoire, even though it was originally composed for piano. (Many of Alb\u00e9niz's other compositions were also transcribed for guitar, notably by [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]].) At the [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]], the piano manufacturer [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] sponsored a series of 20 concerts featuring Alb\u00e9niz's music.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.}}\n[[File:Isaac Alb\u00e9niz.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Bookplate|Ex libris]]'' Isaac Alb\u00e9niz by Ismael Smith, around 1921]]\n\nThe apex of Alb\u00e9niz's concert career is considered to be 1889 to 1892 when he had concert tours throughout Europe. During the 1890s Alb\u00e9niz lived in London and Paris. For London he wrote some [[musical comedies]] which brought him to the attention of the wealthy [[Francis Money-Coutts, 5th&nbsp;Baron Latymer]]. Money-Coutts commissioned and provided him with librettos for the opera ''[[Henry Clifford (opera)|Henry Clifford]]'' and for a projected trilogy of [[Arthurian]] operas. The first of these, ''[[Merlin (opera)|Merlin]]'' (1898\u20131902), was thought to have been lost but has recently been reconstructed and performed.<ref>[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/jan01/merlin.htm Review \u2013 Classical Music on the web]</ref> Alb\u00e9niz never completed ''Lancelot'' (only the first act is finished, as a vocal and piano score), and he never began ''Guinevere'', the final part.<ref>[http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/music/albeniz_merlin.htm Celtic Twilight; review of ''Merlin'']</ref>\n\nIn 1900 he started to suffer from [[Bright's disease]] and returned to writing piano music. Between 1905 and 1908 he composed his final masterpiece, ''[[Iberia (Alb\u00e9niz)|Iberia]]'' (1908), a suite of twelve piano \"impressions\".\n\nIn 1883 the composer married his student Rosina Jordana. They had three children: Blanca (who died in 1886), Laura (a painter), and Alfonso (who played for [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the early 1900s before embarking on a career as a diplomat). Two other children died in infancy. His great-granddaughter is [[C\u00e9cilia Attias]], former wife of [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].{{sfn|Henley|Lihoreau|2010|p={{page missing|date=October 2018}}}}\n\nAlb\u00e9niz died from his kidney disease on 18 May 1909 at age 48 in [[Cambo-les-Bains]], in [[Labourd]], south-western France. Only a few weeks before his death, the government of France awarded Alb\u00e9niz its highest honor, the [[Grand-Croix de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]. He is buried at the [[Montju\u00efc Cemetery]], Barcelona.\n\n==Music==\n{{further information|List of compositions by Isaac Alb\u00e9niz}}\n===Early works===\n\nAlb\u00e9niz's early works were mostly \"[[salon music|salon style]]\" music. Alb\u00e9niz's first published composition, ''Marcha Militar'', appeared in 1868. A number of works written before this are now lost.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.|loc=\"Works\"}} He continued composing in traditional styles ranging from [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] and [[Franz Liszt]] until the mid-1880s. He also wrote at least five [[zarzuela]]s, of which all but two are now lost.\n\nPerhaps the best source on the works is Alb\u00e9niz himself. He is quoted as commenting on his earlier period works as:<blockquote>There are among them a few things that are not completely worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe that the people are right when they continue to be moved by ''C\u00f3rdoba, Mallorca'', by the copla of the ''Sevillanas'', by the ''Serenata'', and ''Granada''. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to me like the carvings in the [[Alhambra]], those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}</blockquote>\n\n===Middle period===\n\n[[File:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Isaac Alb\u00e9niz- 027630-D 006622.jpg|thumb|upright|''Alb\u00e9niz'', seen by [[Ramon Casas]] ([[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]])]]\n\nDuring the late 1880s, the strong influence of Spanish style is evident in Alb\u00e9niz's music. In 1883 Alb\u00e9niz met the teacher and composer Felipe Pedrell. Pedrell was a leading figure in the development of nationalist Spanish music. In his book ''The Music of Spain'', [[Gilbert Chase]] describes Pedrell's influence on Alb\u00e9niz: \"What Alb\u00e9niz derived from Pedrell was above all a spiritual orientation, the realization of the wonderful values inherent in Spanish music.\"{{sfn|Chase|1959|p=153}} Felipe Pedrell inspired Alb\u00e9niz to write Spanish music such as the ''[[Suite espa\u00f1ola]]'', Op. 47, noted for its delicate, intricate melody and abrupt dynamic changes.\n\nIn addition to the Spanish spirit infused in Alb\u00e9niz's music, he incorporated other qualities as well. In her biography of Alb\u00e9niz, Pola Baytelman discerns four characteristics of the music from the middle period as follows:\n\n<blockquote>1. The dance rhythms of Spain, of which there are a wide variety. 2. The use of [[cante jondo]], which means deep or profound singing. It is the most serious and moving variety of [[flamenco]] or Spanish gypsy song, often dealing with themes of death, anguish, or religion. 3. The use of exotic scales also associated with flamenco music. The [[Phrygian mode]] is the most prominent in Alb\u00e9niz's music, although he also used the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Mixolydian mode]]s as well as the [[whole-tone scale]]. 4. The transfer of guitar idioms into piano writing. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</blockquote>\n\nFollowing his marriage, Alb\u00e9niz settled in [[Madrid]], Spain and produced a substantial quantity of music in a relatively short period. By 1886 he had written over 50 piano pieces.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.}} Alb\u00e9niz biographer Walter A. Clark says that pieces from this period received enthusiastic reception in the composer's many concerts. Chase describes music from this period,\n\n<blockquote>Taking the guitar as his instrumental model, and drawing his inspiration largely from the peculiar traits of [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] folk music{{nsmdns}}but without using actual folk themes{{nsmdns}}Alb\u00e9niz achieves a stylization of Spanish traditional idioms that while thoroughly artistic, gives a captivating impression of spontaneous improvisation... ''C\u00f3rdoba'' is the piece that best represents the style of Alb\u00e9niz in this period, with its hauntingly beautiful melody, set against the acrid dissonances of the plucked accompaniment imitating the notes of the Moorish [[gusla]]s. Here is the heady scent of jasmines amid the swaying palm trees, the dream fantasy of an Andalusian \"[[Arabian Nights]]\" in which Alb\u00e9niz loved to let his imagination dwell.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</blockquote>\n\n===Later period===\n\nWhile Alb\u00e9niz's crowning achievement, ''[[Iberia (Alb\u00e9niz)|Iberia]]'', was written in the last years of his life in France, many of its preceding works are well-known and of great interest. The five pieces in ''[[Chants d'Espagne]]'', (''Songs of Spain'', published in 1892) are a solid example of the compositional ideas he was exploring in the \"middle period\" of his life. The suite shows what Alb\u00e9niz biographer Walter Aaron Clark describes as the \"first flowering of his unique creative genius\"{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}, and the beginnings of compositional exploration that became the hallmark of his later works. This period also includes his operatic works{{nsmdns}}''[[Merlin (opera)|Merlin]], [[Henry Clifford (opera)|Henry Clifford]]'', and ''[[Pepita Jim\u00e9nez (opera)|Pepita Jim\u00e9nez]]''. His orchestral works of this period include ''Spanish Rhapsody'' (1887) and ''Catalonia'' (1899), dedicated to [[Ramon Casas i Carb\u00f3|Ramon Casas]], who had painted his full-length portrait in 1894.\n\n==Impact==\n\nAs one of the leading composers of his era, Alb\u00e9niz's influences on both contemporary composers and on the future of Spanish music are profound. As a result of his extended stay in France and the friendship he formed with numerous composers there, his composition technique and harmonic language has influenced aspiring younger composers such as [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]]. His activities as conductor, performer and composer significantly raised the profile of Spanish music abroad and encouraged Spanish music and musicians in his own country.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.}}\n\nAlb\u00e9niz's works have become an important part of the repertoire of the classical guitar, many of which have been transcribed by [[Miguel Llobet]] and others. ''[[Asturias (Leyenda)]]'' in particular is heard most often on the guitar, as are ''[[Granada (Alb\u00e9niz)|Granada]]'', ''[[Sevilla (Alb\u00e9niz)|Sevilla]]'', ''[[Cadiz (Alb\u00e9niz)|Cadiz]]'', ''Catalu\u00f1a'', ''[[C\u00f3rdoba (Alb\u00e9niz)|C\u00f3rdoba]]'' and the ''[[Tango in D]]''. Gordon Crosskey and Cuban-born guitarist [[Manuel Barrueco]] have both made solo guitar arrangements of six of the eight-movement ''Suite espa\u00f1ola''. Selections from ''Iberia'' have rarely been attempted on solo guitar but have been very effectively performed by guitar ensembles, such as the performance by [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] and [[Julian Bream]] of ''Iberia's '' opening \"Evocation\". [[The Doors]] incorporated \"Asturias\" into their song \"Spanish Caravan\"; also, [[Iron Maiden|Iron Maiden's]] \"[[Piece of Mind|To Tame a Land]]\" uses the introduction of the piece for the song bridge. More recently, a guitar version of ''Granada'' functions as something of a love theme in [[Woody Allen|Woody Allen's]] 2008 film ''[[Vicky Cristina Barcelona]]''. The 2008 horror film ''[[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]]'' incorporates the theme from ''Asturias'' into its score.\n\nIn 1997 the ''Fundaci\u00f3n Isaac Alb\u00e9niz'' was founded to promote Spanish music and musicians and to act as a research centre for Alb\u00e9niz and Spanish music in general.{{sfn|Barulich|n.d.}}\n\n==In film==\n\nA film about his life entitled ''[[Alb\u00e9niz (film)|Alb\u00e9niz]]'' was made in 1947.

The most contentious areas of the Treaty for the IRA were the disestablishment of the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1919, the abandonment of the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|First D\u00e1il]],<ref>Younger, Calton: ''Ireland\u2019s Civil War'', pp.233\u201335, Fontana Press, 6th imp.

All these issues were the cause of a split in the IRA and ultimately civil war.\n\n[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], the republican leader who had led the Irish negotiating team, argued that the treaty gave \"not the ultimate freedom that all nations aspire and develop, but the freedom to achieve freedom\".  However, anti-treaty militants in 1922 believed that the treaty would never deliver full Irish independence.<ref>For example, Liam Lynch, Ernie O'Malley, and Liam Mellows in \"On Another Man's Wound\" by E O'Malley (Dublin 1979)</ref>\n\n===Split in the Nationalist movement===\n{{See also|IRA and the Anglo-Irish Treaty}}\n\nThe split over the treaty was deeply personal. Many of the leaders on both sides had been close friends and comrades during the War of Independence. This made their disagreement over the treaty all the more bitter. Michael Collins later said that [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] had sent him as [[plenipotentiary]] to negotiate the treaty because he knew that the British would not concede an independent Irish republic and wanted Collins to take the blame for the compromise settlement. He said that he felt deeply betrayed when de Valera refused to stand by the agreement that the plenipotentiaries had negotiated with [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} De Valera, for his part, was furious that Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]] had signed the treaty without consulting him or the Irish cabinet as instructed.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n[[File:Hogan's Flying Column.gif|thumb|[[Third Tipperary Brigade]] Flying Column No. 2 under [[Se\u00e1n Hogan]] during the War of Independence.

Following the Treaty's ratification, in accordance with article 17 of the Treaty, the British-recognised [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State]] was established. Its authority under the Treaty was to provide a \"provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the interval\" before the establishment of the Irish Free State. In accordance with the Treaty, the British Government transferred \"the powers and machinery requisite for the discharge of its duties\". Before the British Government transferred such powers, the members of the Provisional Government each \"signified in writing [their] acceptance of [the Treaty]\".\n\nUpon the Treaty's ratification, de Valera resigned as [[President of the Irish Republic|President of the Republic]] and failed to be re-elected by an even closer vote of 60\u201358. He challenged the right of the D\u00e1il to approve the treaty, saying that its members were breaking their oath to the Irish Republic. De Valera continued to promote a compromise whereby the new Irish Free State would be in \"[[external association]]\" with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] rather than be a member of it (the inclusion of [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|republics within the Commonwealth of Nations]] was not formally implemented until 1949).\n\nIn early March, he formed the \"Cumann na Poblachta\" (Republican Association) party while remaining a member of Sinn F\u00e9in and commenced a speaking tour of the more republican province of [[Munster]] on 17 March 1922. During the tour, de Valera made controversial speeches at [[Carrick on Suir]], [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]], [[Dungarvan]] and [[Waterford]], saying at one point, \"If the Treaty were accepted, the fight for freedom would still go on, and the Irish people, instead of fighting foreign soldiers, will have to fight the Irish soldiers of an Irish government set up by Irishmen.\" At [[Thurles]], several days later, he repeated this imagery and added that the IRA \"would have to wade through the blood of the soldiers of the Irish Government, and perhaps through that of some members of the Irish Government to get their freedom.\" <ref>Hopkinson, Michael: ''GREEN against GREEN The Irish Civil War'', p.71, Gill and Macmillan Dublin (1988), {{ISBN|0-7171-1630-1}}<br />de Valera stated in a speech n Killarney in March 1922, that if the Treaty was accepted by the electorate,<br />\"IRA men will have to march over the dead bodies of their own brothers. They will have to wade through Irish blood.\"</ref>\n\nIn a letter to the [[Irish Independent]] on 23 March, de Valera accepted the accuracy of their report of his comment about \"wading\" through blood, but deplored that the newspaper had published it.<ref>J.J.

He also tried to reach a compromise with anti-treaty IRA leaders by agreeing to a republican-type constitution (with no mention of the British monarchy) for the new state. IRA leaders such as [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]] were prepared to accept this compromise. However, the proposal for a republican constitution was vetoed by the British as being contrary to the terms of the treaty and they threatened military intervention in the Free State unless the treaty were fully implemented.<ref>Helen Litton, ''The Irish Civil War, an Illustrated History'', p. 63, \"Collins was summoned to London... and informed that the draft constitution would have to be altered to acknowledge the authority of the Crown, to include an Oath and to recognise Northern Ireland\";<br />Michael Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 107, \"Winston Churchill told a concerned House of Commons... that a Republic could not be tolerated. He warned that, 'in the event of such a Republic, it will be the intention of the Government to hold Dublin as one of the preliminary essential steps to military operations'.</ref> Collins reluctantly agreed. This completely undermined the electoral pact between the pro- and anti-treaty factions, who went into the Irish general election on 18 June 1922 as hostile parties, both calling themselves [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nThe Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in party won the election with 239,193 votes to 133,864 for Anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in. A further 247,226 people voted for other parties, most of whom supported the Treaty. Labour's 132,570 votes were ambiguous with regard to the Treaty. According to Hopkinson, \"Irish labour and union leaders, while generally pro-Treaty, made little attempt to lead opinion during the Treaty conflict, casting themselves rather as attempted peacemakers.\"<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p46</ref> The election showed that a majority of the Irish electorate accepted the treaty and the foundation of the [[Irish Free State]], but de Valera, his political followers and most of the IRA continued to oppose the treaty. De Valera is quoted as saying, \"the majority have no right to do wrong\".<ref>M.E. Collins, ''Ireland 1868\u20131966'', p. 297.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, under the leadership of Michael Collins and [[Arthur Griffith]], the pro-treaty Provisional Government set about establishing the Irish Free State, and organised the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] \u2013 to replace the IRA \u2013 and a new police force. However, since it was envisaged that the new army would be built around the IRA, Anti-Treaty IRA units were allowed to take over British barracks and take their arms. In practice, this meant that by the summer of 1922, the Provisional Government of [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] controlled only [[Dublin]] and some other areas like [[County Longford]] where the IRA units supported the treaty. Fighting ultimately broke out when the Provisional Government tried to assert its authority over well-armed and intransigent Anti-Treaty IRA units around the country \u2013 particularly a hardline group in Dublin.\n\n==Course of the war==\n{{See also|Timeline of the Irish Civil War}}\n\n===Dublin fighting===\n[[File:Four Courts Conflagration.jpg|thumb|The Four Courts along the [[River Liffey]] quayside.

M. Healy]] wrote of the occupation in late March: \"The Freeman published, on 26 March, an account of the secret debate of the mutineers supplied by the Provisional Government, whereupon Rory O'Connor sallied from the Four Courts and smashed its machinery.

Younger gives the date as 14 April.</ref> These anti-treaty Republicans wanted to spark a new armed confrontation with the British, which they hoped would unite the two factions of the IRA against their common enemy. However, for those who were determined to make the Free State into a viable, self-governing Irish state, this was an act of rebellion that would have to be put down by them rather than the British.\n\n[[Arthur Griffith]] was in favour of using force against these men immediately, but Michael Collins, who wanted at all costs to avoid civil war, left the Four Courts garrison alone until late June 1922. By this point, the Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in party had secured a large majority in the [[Irish general election, 1922|general election]], along with other parties that supported the Treaty. Collins was also coming under continuing pressure from London to assert his government's authority in Dublin.<ref>\"The British [after the election] drew what appeared to them to be the obvious conclusion that it was time for the Provisional Government to assert its authority.\" (Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 111)</ref>\n\n==Assassination of Field Marshal Wilson==\nThe British Government at this time also lost patience with the situation in Dublin as a result of the assassination of Field Marshal [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Hughes Wilson]], a prominent security adviser to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], by I.R.A. men on a street in London on 22 June 1922, with no responsibility for the act being publicly claimed by any IRA authority.<ref>Michael Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 112, \"Joe Sweeney, the pro-treaty military leader in [[Donegal]], recorded meeting Collins shortly after the assassination. He told Ernie O'Malley, 'Collins told me he had arranged the shooting of Wilson... he looked very pleased'. Frank Thornton, one of Collins' old Squad, recalled that the killing was carried out on the direct orders of GHQ. Mick Murphy, of Cork no 1 Brigade, said that when in London he had been asked to take part in the plot, explaining, 'they had instructions then from Michael Collins to shoot Wilson' ... statements from Collins' intelligence agents point to fresh instruction being given in June. It is clear also that [Reginald] Dunne [the assassin] and spent some time closeted with him.\"<br/>ME Collins, ''Ireland 1868\u20131966'', p. 229, \"Evidence has since come to light proving it was Collins, enraged by Wilson's role in the north, who ordered the killing\".<br/>Niall C.

However, on the advice of General [[Nevil Macready]], who commanded the British garrison in Dublin, the plan was cancelled at the last minute. Macready's argument was that British involvement would have united Irish Nationalist opinion against the treaty, and instead Collins was given a last chance to clear the Four Courts himself.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', pp. 115\u2013116</ref>\n\n==Collins orders the assault on the Four Courts==\nThe final straw for the Free State government came on 26 June, when the Four Courts republican garrison kidnapped [[JJ \"Ginger\" O'Connell]] in retaliation for the arrest of Leo Henderson,<ref>The Singing Flame, p 117, Ernie O'Malley</ref> a general in the new [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]]. Collins, after giving the Four Courts garrison a final (and according to [[Ernie O'Malley]], only<ref>O'Malley Notebooks, numerous assertions</ref>) ultimatum to leave the building on 27 June, decided to end the stand-off by bombarding the Four Courts garrison into surrender. The government then appointed Collins as Commander-in-Chief of the National Army. This attack was not the opening shot of the war, as skirmishes had taken place between pro- and anti-treaty IRA factions throughout the country when the British were handing over the barracks. However, this represented the 'point of no return', when all-out war was ''ipso facto'' declared and the Civil War officially began.<ref>In clashes between pro- and anti-treaty fighters prior to 28 June, eight men had been killed and forty-nine wounded. (Niall C. Harrington, ''Kerry Landings'', p. 22)</ref>\n\nCollins ordered Mulcahy to accept a British offer of two 18-pounder field [[artillery]] for use by the new army of the Free State, though General Macready gave just 200 shells of the 10,000 he had in store at Richmond barracks in Inchicore.  The anti-treaty forces in the Four Courts, who possessed only small arms, surrendered after three days of bombardment and the storming of the building by Provisional Government troops (28\u201330 June 1922).  Shortly before the surrender, a massive explosion destroyed the western wing of the complex, including the [[Irish Public Record Office]] (PRO), injuring many advancing Free State soldiers and destroying the records.  Government supporters alleged that the building had been deliberately mined.<ref>[[TM Healy]] memoirs (1928), chapter 46.</ref> Historians dispute whether the PRO was intentionally destroyed by mines laid by the Republicans on their evacuation or if the explosions occurred when their ammunition store was accidentally ignited by the bombardment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cottrell|first=Peter |title=The Irish Civil War 1922\u201323 |publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2008|series= ESSENTIAL HISTORIES |volume=Volume 70 |page=40|isbn=978-1-84603-270-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zn22MvnyW2QC&pg=PA40&dq=%22mines+under+the+public+records+office%22#v=onepage&q=%22mines%20under%20the%20public%20records%20office%22&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hopkinson|first=Michael|title=Green Against Green|publisher=Gill and Macmillan|year=1988|page=179|quote=The Republican garrison had converted this part of the Four Courts into a munitions factory with the cellars underneath being used to store explosives.

Among the dead was Republican leader [[Cathal Brugha]], who made his last stand after exiting the Granville Hotel.  In addition, the Free State took over 500 Republican prisoners.  The civilian casualties are estimated to have numbered well over 250.  When the fighting in Dublin died down, the Free State government was left firmly in control of the Irish capital and the anti-treaty forces dispersed around the country, mainly to the south and west.\n\n===The opposing forces===\n[[File:An2bappeal2bfrom2bdan2bbreen.jpg|thumb|Dan Breen's appeal to free state troops]]\nThe outbreak of the Civil War forced pro- and anti-treaty supporters to choose sides. Supporters of the treaty came to be known as \"pro-treaty\" or Free State Army, legally the [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]], and were often called \"Staters\" by their opponents. The latter called themselves Republicans and were also known as \"anti-treaty\" forces, or Irregulars, a term preferred by the Free State side.\n\nThe Anti-Treaty IRA claimed that it was defending the Irish Republic declared in 1916 during the [[Easter Rising]], confirmed by the [[First D\u00e1il]] and invalidly set aside by those who accepted the compromise of the Free State. \u00c9amon de Valera stated that he would serve as an ordinary IRA volunteer and left the leadership of the Anti-Treaty Republicans to [[Liam Lynch (general)|Liam Lynch]], the [[list of IRA Chiefs of Staff|IRA Chief of Staff]]. De Valera, though the Republican 'President as of October 1922, had little control over military operations.<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, p 439-441</ref> Military operations were directed by Liam Lynch until he was killed on 10 April 1923 and then by Frank Aiken, as of 20 April 1923.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p256</ref>\n\n[[File:Prisoner (6417469255).jpg|thumb|left|National Army soldiers escorting an IRA prisoner of war]]\nThe Civil War split the IRA. When the Civil War broke out, the Anti-Treaty IRA (concentrated in the south and west) outnumbered the pro-Free State forces by roughly 12,000 men to 8,000. Moreover, the Anti-Treaty ranks included many of the IRA's most experienced guerrilla fighters.<ref>Hopkinson Green Against Green, p127. Both are National Army estimates but there were not precises figures for either force at that point.</ref> The paper strength of the IRA in early 1922 was over 72,000 men, but most of them were recruited during the truce with the British and fought in neither the War of Independence nor the Civil War. According to Richard Mulcahy's estimate the anti-Treaty IRA at the beginning of the war, had 6,780 rifles and 12,900 men.<ref name=\"Cottrell, Peter page 22\">Cottrell, Peter ''The Irish Civil War, 1922\u201323'', London: Osprey, 2008 page 22.</ref>\n\nHowever, the Anti-Treaty IRA lacked an effective command structure, a clear strategy and sufficient arms. As well as rifles they had a handful of machine guns and many of their fighters were armed only with [[shotgun]]s or handguns. They also took a handful of [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] from British troops as they were evacuating the country. Finally, they had no artillery of any kind. As a result, they were forced to adopt a defensive stance throughout the war.\n\nBy contrast, the Free State government managed to expand its forces dramatically after the start of the war. Michael Collins and his commanders were able to build up an army that was able to overwhelm their opponents in the field. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, armoured cars, machine guns, small arms, and ammunition were of much help to pro-treaty forces. The British delivered for instance, over 27,000 rifles, 250 machine guns and eight 18 pounder artillery pieces to the pro-Treaty forces between the outbreak of the Civil War and September 1922.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green p 127</ref> The National Army amounted to 14,000 men by August 1922, was 38,000 strong by the end of 1922,<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, the Irish Civil War, p136</ref> and by the end of the war had grown to 55,000 men and 3,500 officers, far in excess of what the Irish state would need to maintain in peacetime.<ref>Niall C Harrington Kerry Landing August 1922, An Episode of the Irish Civil War, p36</ref>\n\nLike the anti-Treaty IRA, the Free State's National Army was initially rooted in the IRA that fought against the British.<ref name=\"Cottrell, Peter page 23\">Cottrell, Peter ''The Irish Civil War, 1922\u201323'', London: Osprey, 2008 page 23.</ref> Collins' most ruthless officers and men were recruited from the Dublin Active Service Unit (the elite unit of the IRA's Dublin Brigade) and from Michael Collins' Intelligence Department and assassination unit, The Squad. In the new National Army, they were known as the [[Dublin Guard]].<ref>Charles Townshend, The Republic, The Fight For Irish Independence, p394</ref> Towards the end of the war, they were implicated in some notorious atrocities against anti-treaty guerrillas in County Kerry.<ref>Tom Doyle, The Civil War in Kerry, 'summary executions and reprisal killings of republicans had been the norm in the county as early as August 1922, when the Squad cohort in the Dublin Guard returned and resorted to tried and tested methods in their war against the republicans'. p320</ref> Up to the outbreak of Civil War, it had been agreed that only men with service in the IRA could be recruited into the National Army.<ref>Kieran Glennon, From Pogrom to Civil War, Tom Glennon and the Belfast IRA 141</ref> However, once the war began, all such restrictions were lifted. A 'National Call to Arms' issued on July 7 for recruitment on a six-month basis brought in thousands of new recruits.<ref>Harrington, Kerry Landing p 67-68</ref> Many of the new army's recruits were veterans of the British Army in  [[World War I]], where they had served in [[Irish military diaspora#'Irish' named 1922 disbanded units of the British Army|disbanded Irish regiments]] of the [[British Army]]. Many other were raw recruits without any military experience. The fact that at least 50% of the other ranks had no military experience in turn led to ill-discipline becoming a major problem.<ref>Cottrell, Peter ''The Irish Civil War, 1922\u201323'', London: Osprey, 2008 pages 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nA major problem for the National Army was a shortage of experienced officers.<ref name=\"Cottrell, Peter page 23\"/> At least 20% of the National Army's officers had previously served as officers in the British Army while 50% of the rank and file of the National Army had served in the British Army in World War I.<ref name=\"Cottrell, Peter page 23\"/> Former British Army officers were also recruited for their technical expertise. A number of the senior Free State commanders, such as [[Emmet Dalton]], [[John T. Prout]], and [[W.R.E. Murphy]], had seen service as officers in World War One, Dalton and Murphy in the British Army and Prout in the US Army. The Republicans made much use of this fact in their propaganda \u2014 claiming that the Free State was only a proxy force for Britain itself. However, in fact, the majority of Free State soldiers were raw recruits without military experience in either World War I or the Irish War of Independence. There were also a significant number of former members of the British Armed Forces on the Republican side including such senior figures as [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]], David Robinson and [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]].<ref>Harrington, Kerry Landing p37-38</ref>\n\n===The Free State takes major towns===\n[[File:Armoured Car, Passage West, Cork (6652701421).jpg|thumb|A National Army [[Peerless Armoured Car]] in Passage West, August 1922]]\n{{Main|Irish Free State offensive}}\nWith Dublin in pro-treaty hands, conflict spread throughout the country. The war started with the anti-treaty forces holding [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] as part of a self-styled [[Munster Republic]]. However, since the anti-treaty side were not equipped to wage conventional war, Liam Lynch was unable to take advantage of the Republicans' initial advantage in numbers and territory held. He hoped simply to hold the Munster Republic long enough to force Britain to re-negotiate the treaty.<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Harrington | first = Niall C. | title = Kerry Landing | publisher = Anvil Books | year = 1992 | location = Tralee | isbn = 0-947962-70-0 | page = 193 }}</ref>\n\nThe large towns in Ireland were all relatively easily taken by the Free State in August 1922. Michael Collins, Richard Mulcahy and [[Eoin O'Duffy]] planned a nationwide Free State offensive, dispatching columns overland to take Limerick in the west and Waterford in the south-east and seaborne forces to take counties Cork and [[County Kerry|Kerry]] in the south and [[County Mayo|Mayo]] in the west.<ref>Hopkinson, Green Against Green, p160-161</ref><ref name=\"Niall Harrington 1922, p130-131\">Niall Harrington, Kerry Landing August 1922, p130-131</ref> In the south, landings occurred at [[Union Hall, County Cork|Union Hall]] in Co. Cork and [[Fenit]], the port of [[Tralee]], in Co. Kerry. Limerick fell on 20 July, Waterford on the same day and Cork city on 10 August after a Free State force landed by sea at [[Passage West]]. Another seaborne expedition to [[County Mayo|Mayo]] in the west secured government control over that part of the country. While in some places the Republicans had put up determined resistance, nowhere were they able to defeat regular forces armed with artillery and armour. The only real conventional battle during the Free State offensive, the [[Battle of Killmallock]], was fought when Free State troops advanced south from Limerick.<ref>John Borgonovo, The Battle for Cork, p108-109</ref><ref name=\"Niall Harrington 1922, p130-131\"/>\n\n===Guerrilla war===\n{{Main|Guerrilla phase of the Irish Civil War}}\n\nGovernment victories in the major towns inaugurated a period of [[guerrilla warfare]]. After the fall of Cork, Liam Lynch ordered Anti-Treaty IRA units to disperse and form flying columns as they had when fighting the British. They held out in areas such as the western part of counties Cork and Kerry in the south, [[county Wexford]] in the east and counties [[County Sligo|Sligo]] and [[County Mayo|Mayo]] in the west. Sporadic fighting also took place around [[Dundalk]], where [[Frank Aiken]] and the [[Fourth Northern Division of the Irish Republican Army]] were based, and Dublin, where small-scale but regular attacks were mounted on Free State troops.\n\nAugust and September 1922 saw widespread attacks on Free State forces in the territories that they had occupied in the July\u2013August offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on them. [[Commander-in-Chief]] [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] was killed in an ambush by anti-treaty Republicans at B\u00e9al na mBl\u00e1th, near his home in [[County Cork]], in August 1922.<ref name=\"fn_1\">In the 1996 film ''[[Michael Collins (film)|Michael Collins]]'', \u00c9amon de Valera meets the killer of Michael Collins prior to the assassination. However, although de Valera was in the area at the time, he is not thought to have ordered the assassination.</ref> Collins' death increased the bitterness of the Free State leadership towards the Republicans and probably contributed to the subsequent descent of the conflict into a cycle of atrocities and reprisals. Arthur Griffith, the Free State president, had also died of a brain haemorrhage ten days before, leaving the Free State government in the hands of [[W. T. Cosgrave]] and the Free State army under the command of General [[Richard Mulcahy]]. For a brief period, with rising casualties among its troops and its two principal leaders dead, it looked as if the Free State might collapse.\n\nHowever, as winter set in, the republicans found it increasingly difficult to sustain their campaign, and casualty rates among National Army troops dropped rapidly. For instance, in County Sligo, 54 people died in the conflict, of whom all but eight had been killed by the end of September.<ref>Michael Farry, ''The Aftermath of Revolution: Sligo 1921\u201323''</ref>\n\nIn the autumn and winter of 1922, Free State forces broke up many of the larger Republican guerrilla units \u2013 in Sligo, Meath, and Connemara in the west, for example, and in much of Dublin city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/duleekmonument/meathhistory19221958.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808224831/http://www.freewebs.com/duleekmonument/meathhistory19221958.htm |archivedate= 8 August 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curragh.info/articles/executions.htm|title=Civil War Executions|work=curragh.info}}</ref> Elsewhere, Anti-Treaty units were forced by lack of supplies and safe-houses to disperse into smaller groups, typically of nine to ten men. Despite these successes for the National Army, it took eight more months of intermittent warfare before the war was brought to an end.\n\nBy late 1922 and early 1923, the Anti-Treaty guerrillas' campaign had been reduced largely to acts of sabotage and destruction of public infrastructure such as roads and railways.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 199</ref> It was also in this period that the Anti-Treaty IRA began [[Destruction of country houses in the Irish revolutionary period|burning the homes]] of Free State Senators and of many of the Anglo-Irish landed class.\n\nIn October 1922, \u00c9amon de Valera and the anti-treaty [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TDs]] (Members of Parliament) set up their own \"Republican government\" in opposition to the Free State. However, by then the anti-treaty side held no significant territory and de Valera's government had no authority over the population.\n\n===Atrocities and executions===\n[[File:Ballyseedy monument.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the Republican soldiers executed by Free State forces at [[Ballyseedy]], [[County Kerry]], designed by [[Yann Goulet]]]]\n{{Main|Executions during the Irish Civil War}}\nOn 27 September 1922, three months after the outbreak of war, the Free State's Provisional Government put before the D\u00e1il an Army Emergency Powers Resolution proposing legislation for setting up military tribunals, transferring most of the Free State's judicial powers over Irish citizens accused of anti-government activities to the Army Council. By instituting martial law, the first democratically elected Free State had in effect suspended most, if not all civil rights of the Irish population for the duration of the conflict. The legislation, commonly referred to as the [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|Public Safety Bill]], empowered military tribunals with the ability to impose life imprisonment, as well as the death penalty, for a variety of offences. By allowing appointed courts martial to execute any Irish citizen found in possession of firearms or ammunition, the Free State prevented Republican sympathizers from storing any arms or ammunition that could be used by Republican forces; possession of even a single sporting or civilian firearm or round of ammunition could result in execution by firing squad. Offences included attacks on state policy or military forces, donning army or police uniforms, publication of \"seditious publications\", and membership in the Republican Army.\n\nThe final phase of the Civil War degenerated into a series of atrocities that left a lasting legacy of bitterness in Irish politics. The Free State began executing Republican prisoners on 17 November 1922, when five IRA men were shot by firing squad. They were followed on 24 November by the execution of acclaimed author and treaty negotiator [[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]. In all, the Free State sanctioned 77 official executions of anti-treaty prisoners during the Civil War. The Anti-Treaty IRA in reprisal assassinated [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[Sean Hales|Se\u00e1n Hales]].\n\nOn 7 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four prominent Republicans (one from each [[Provinces of Ireland|province]]), who had been held since the first week of the war\u2014[[Rory O'Connor (Irish republican)|Rory O'Connor]], [[Liam Mellows]], [[Richard Barrett (Irish republican)|Richard Barrett]] and [[Joe McKelvey]] \u2014 were executed in revenge for the killing of Hales. In addition, Free State troops, particularly in [[County Kerry]], where the guerrilla campaign was most bitter, began the [[summary execution]] of captured anti-treaty fighters. The most notorious example of this occurred at Ballyseedy, where nine Republican prisoners were tied to a [[land mine|landmine]], which was detonated, killing eight and only leaving one, [[Stephen Fuller]], who was blown clear by the blast, to escape.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 241</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickmulc.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Mulcahy]] \u2013 the Free State General who instituted the policy of executions of Republican prisoners in reprisal for the murder of elected representatives]]\nThe number of \"unauthorised\" executions of Republican prisoners during the war has been put as high as 153.<ref>Todd Andrews, ''Dublin Made Me'', p. 269</ref> Among the Republican reprisals were the assassination of Kevin O'Higgins' father and WT Cosgrave's uncle in February 1923.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 191</ref>\n\nThe Anti-Treaty IRA were unable to maintain an effective guerrilla campaign, given the gradual loss of support. The [[Catholic Church]] also supported the Free State, deeming it the lawful government of the country, denouncing the Anti-Treaty IRA and refusing to administer the [[Sacrament]]s to anti-treaty fighters. On 10 October 1922, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland issued a formal statement, describing the anti-treaty campaign as:\n\n{{quote|[A] system of murder and assassination of the National forces without any legitimate authority... the guerrilla warfare now being carried on [by] the Irregulars is without moral sanction and therefore the killing of National soldiers is murder before God, the seizing of public and private property is robbery, the breaking of roads, bridges and railways is criminal. All who in contravention of this teaching, participate in such crimes are guilty of grievous sins and may not be absolved in [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] nor admitted to the [[Holy Communion]] if they persist in such evil courses.<ref>[[Tim Pat Coogan]], ''De Valera'', p. 344</ref>}}\n\nChurchmen were appalled by the ruthlessness and cruelty. The Church's support for the Free State aroused bitter hostility among some republicans. Although the Catholic Church in independent Ireland has often been seen as a triumphalist Church, a recent study has found that it felt deeply insecure after these events.<ref>{{cite book|last=McMahon|first=Deirdre|title=''The Politician \u2013 A Reassessment''|series=Studies|page=346|editor=Noel Barber S.J.|date=Winter 1998|volume=87|id=348}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\nBy early 1923, the offensive capability of the Anti-Treaty IRA had been seriously eroded and when, in February 1923, the Republican leader [[Liam Deasy]] was captured by Free State forces, he called on the republicans to end their campaign and reach an accommodation with the Free State. The State's executions of Anti-Treaty prisoners, 34 of whom were shot in January 1923, also took its toll on the Republicans' morale.\n\nIn addition, the National Army's operations in the field were slowly but steadily breaking up the remaining Republican concentrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~150/page46.html|title=Phoenix Publishing|work=eircom.net}}</ref><ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', pp. 235\u20136</ref>\n\nMarch and April 1923 saw this progressive dismemberment of the Republican forces continue with the capture and sometimes killing of guerrilla columns.<ref>Tom Doyle, ''The Civil War in Kerry'', p. 300</ref> A National Army report of 11 April stated, \"Events of the last few days point to the beginning of the end as a far as the irregular campaign is concerned\".<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. ???</ref><!--  Commented out: [[File:Aiken.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Aiken]], Anti-Treaty IRA leader who called an end to their campaign in May 1923, effectively ending the civil war]] -->\n\nAs the conflict petered out into a ''de facto'' victory for the pro-treaty side, de Valera asked the IRA leadership to call a ceasefire, but they refused. The Anti-Treaty IRA executive met on 26 March in [[County Tipperary]] to discuss the war's future. [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] proposed a motion to end the war, but it was defeated by 6 votes to 5. \u00c9amon de Valera was allowed to attend, after some debate, but was given no voting rights.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 237</ref>\n\n[[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]], the Republican leader, was killed in a skirmish in the [[Knockmealdown Mountains]] in County Tipperary on 10 April. The National Army had extracted information from Republican prisoners in Dublin that the IRA Executive was in the area and as well as killing Lynch, they also captured senior Anti-Treaty IRA officers [[Dan Breen]], [[Todd Andrews]], [[Se\u00e1n Gaynor]] and [[Frank Barrett (IRA)|Frank Barrett]] in the operation.\n\nIt is often suggested that the death of Lynch allowed the more pragmatic [[Frank Aiken]], who took over as IRA Chief of Staff, to call a halt to what seemed a futile struggle. Aiken's accession to IRA leadership was followed on 30 April by the declaration of a [[ceasefire]] on behalf of the anti-treaty forces. On 24 May 1923, Aiken followed this with an order to IRA volunteers to dump arms rather than surrender them or continue a fight that they were incapable of winning.\n\n==Aftermath of the ceasefire==\n\u00c9amon de Valera supported the order, issuing a statement to Anti-Treaty fighters on 24 May:\n\n{{quote|Soldiers of the Republic.

Many, but not all of these people, had supported the Crown forces during the War of Independence. This support was often largely moral, but sometimes it took the form of actively assisting the British in the conflict. Such attacks should have ended with the [[Truce of 11 July 1921]], but they continued after the truce and escalated during the Civil War.

As their forces abandoned their fixed positions in July\u2013August 1922, the Republicans burned many of the administrative buildings and businesses that they had been occupying. In addition, their subsequent guerrilla campaign caused much destruction and the economy of the Free State suffered a hard blow in the earliest days of its existence as a result. The material damage caused by the war to property came to over \u00a330 million. Particularly damaging to the Free State's economy was the systematic destruction of railway infrastructure and roads by the Republicans. In addition, the cost to the Free State of waging the war came to another \u00a317 million. By September 1923, Deputy Hogan estimated the cost at \u00a350 million.<ref>[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0005/D.0005.192309190009.html D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 5 \u2013 19 September 1923 \u2013 The adjournment \u2013 position of anti-treaty deputies<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607140928/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0005/D.0005.192309190009.html |date=7 June 2011 }}</ref> The new State ended 1923 with a budget deficit of over \u00a34 million.<ref>Hopkinson, ''Green Against Green'', p. 273</ref> This weakened financial situation meant that the new state could not pay its share of Imperial debt under the treaty.

Further, the state undertook to pay for damage caused to property between the truce of July 1921 and the end of the Civil War; [[W. T.

Collins and Sir [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]] signed an agreement to end it on 30 March 1922,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sarasmichaelcollinssite.com/mcccagreement.htm|title=Craig-Collins Agreement|work=sarasmichaelcollinssite.com}}</ref> but, despite this, Collins covertly supplied arms to the Northern IRA until a week before his death in August 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/why-the-big-fellow-has-little-to-teach-political-parties-in-modern-ireland-2307165.html|title=Why 'The Big Fellow' has little to teach political parties in modern Ireland|work=Independent.ie}}</ref> Because of the Irish Civil War, Northern Ireland was able to consolidate its existence and the partition of Ireland was confirmed for the foreseeable future. The continuing war also confirmed the northern Unionists' existing prejudices against the ethos of all shades of nationalism. This might have led to open hostilities between North and South had the Irish Civil War not broken out. Indeed, the [[Ulster Special Constabulary]] (the \"B-Specials\") that had been established in 1920 (on the [[Partition of Ireland|foundation of Northern Ireland]]) was expanded in 1922 rather than being demobilised.\n\nIn the event, it was only well after their defeat in the Civil War that anti-treaty Irish Republicans seriously considered whether to take armed action against British rule in Northern Ireland (the first serious suggestion to do this came in the late 1930s). The northern units of the IRA largely supported the Free State side in the Civil War because of Collins's policies, and over 500 of them joined the new Free State's National Army.\n\nThe cost of the war and the budget deficit it caused was a difficulty for the new Free State and affected the [[Irish Boundary Commission|Boundary Commission]] negotiations of 1925, which were to determine the border with Northern Ireland. The Free State agreed to waive its claim to predominantly Nationalist areas in Northern Ireland and in return its agreed share of the Imperial debt under the 1921 Treaty was not paid.<ref name=\"fn_4\">Calton Younger, ''Ireland's Civil War'' (Frederick Muller, 1968), p. 516.</ref><ref name=\"fn_5\">[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0013/D.0013.192512070003.html D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 13 \u2013 7 December 1925] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607082625/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0013/D.0013.192512070003.html |date=7 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:WTCosgrave2.jpg|thumb|left|[[W. T. Cosgrave]]]]\nIn 1926, having failed to persuade the majority of the Anti-Treaty IRA or the anti-treaty party of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] to accept the new status quo as a basis for an evolving Republic, a large faction led by de Valera and Aiken left to resume constitutional politics and to found the [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] party. Whereas Fianna F\u00e1il was to become the dominant party in Irish politics, Sinn F\u00e9in became a small, isolated political party. The IRA, then much more numerous and influential than Sinn F\u00e9in, remained associated with Fianna F\u00e1il (though not directly) until banned by de Valera in 1935.\n\nIn 1927, Fianna F\u00e1il members took the Oath of Allegiance and entered the D\u00e1il, effectively recognising the legitimacy of the Free State.<ref>M.E. Collins ''Ireland 1868\u20131966'', p. 333</ref> The Free State was already moving towards independence by this point. Under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], the British Parliament gave up its right to legislate for members of the British Commonwealth.<ref>Collins, p. 338</ref> When elected to power in 1932, Fianna F\u00e1il under de Valera set about dismantling what they considered to be objectionable features of the treaty, abolishing the Oath of Allegiance, removing the power of the Office of [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor General]] (British representative in Ireland) and abolishing the [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senate]], which was dominated by former Unionists and pro-treaty Nationalists.<ref>John Coakley, Michael Gallagher, ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'' (1999) {{ISBN|0-415-22194-3}} pp.73\u20134</ref> In 1937, they passed a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]], which made a [[President of Ireland|President]] the head of state, did not mention any allegiance to the British monarch, and which included a territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The following year, Britain returned without conditions the seaports that it had kept under the terms of the treaty.<ref>Coakley, Gallagher, ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'', p. 75</ref> When the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, the Free State was able to demonstrate its independence by [[The Emergency (Ireland)|remaining neutral]] throughout the war, although Dublin did to some extent tacitly support the Allies.<ref name=robertcole>{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Robert|title=Propaganda, Censorship And Irish Neutrality in the Second World War|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748622771|pages=Preface ix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wu_bOQiXGs4C&pg=PR9&lpg=PR9&dq=%22the+alliance+may+have+scored+at+least+a+small+victory%22&source=bl&ots=Nn4VLLwTML&sig=lh0BABcaLykefOkycOax_sXxs4c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FpU6UPXZMZSxhAeJhIHoAw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20alliance%20may%20have%20scored%20at%20least%20a%20small%20victory%22&f=false}}</ref> Finally, in 1948, a coalition government, containing elements of both sides in the Civil War (pro-treaty [[Fine Gael]] and anti-treaty [[Clann na Poblachta]]) left the [[British Commonwealth]] and renamed the Free State the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>Collins, ''Ireland'', p. 391</ref> By the 1950s, the issues over which the Civil War had been fought were largely settled.\n\n===Legacy===\nAs with most civil wars, the internecine conflict left a bitter legacy, which continues to influence Irish politics to this day. The two largest political parties in the republic through most of its history (until the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 Irish General Election]]) were [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], the descendants respectively of the anti-treaty and pro-treaty forces of 1922. Until the 1970s, almost all of Ireland's prominent politicians were veterans of the Civil War, a fact which poisoned the relationship between Ireland's two biggest parties. Examples of Civil War veterans include: Republicans \u00c9amon de Valera, Frank Aiken, [[Todd Andrews]], and [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]]; and Free State supporters [[W. T. Cosgrave]], Richard Mulcahy and [[Kevin O'Higgins]].<ref name=\"fn_2\">Se\u00e1n Lemass's brother Noel, a captain in the Anti-Treaty IRA, was abducted and shot by Free State forces in July 1923, two months after the war had ended. His body was dumped in the [[Wicklow Mountains]], near Glencree, where it was found in October 1923. The spot where his body was found is marked by a memorial.</ref><ref name=\"fn_3\">O'Higgins was the Minister for Economic Affairs in the Free State government and was hated by Republicans for having been in favour of the execution of prisoners during the Civil War. His elderly father was killed by republicans during the war. O'Higgins himself was assassinated on his way to [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in 1927 by Anti-Treaty IRA members. His killing precipitated a government clampdown on the IRA and forced Fianna F\u00e1il to take the Oath of Allegiance in order to contest elections. (Collins, ''Ireland'', p. 333)</ref> Moreover, many of these men's sons and daughters also became politicians, meaning that the personal wounds of the civil war were felt over three generations. In the 1930s, after Fianna F\u00e1il took power for the first time, it looked possible for a while that the Civil War might break out again between the [[Irish Republican Army (1922-1969)|IRA]] and the pro-Free State [[Blueshirts]]. Fortunately, this crisis was averted, and by the 1950s violence was no longer prominent in politics in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nHowever, the breakaway IRA continued (and continues in various forms) to exist. It was not until 1948 that the IRA renounced military attacks on the forces of the southern Irish state when it became the [[Republic of Ireland]]. After this point, the organisation dedicated itself primarily to the end of British rule in Northern Ireland. The [[IRA Army Council]] still makes claim to be the legitimate Provisional Government of the Irish Republic declared in 1918 and annulled by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.<ref>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) 'Green Book' (Book I and II), http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira_green_book.htm</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Free State Intelligence Department \u2013 Oriel House]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Calton Younger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrWGAAAAIAAJ&q=Ireland%27s+Civil+War&dq=Ireland%27s+Civil+War&pgis=1 ''Ireland's Civil War''] : Frederick Muller : London : 1968\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=MTm0HAAACAAJ&dq=Irish+Claims+Compensation+Association ''A record of some mansions and houses destroyed 1922\u201323''] The Irish Claims Compensation Association : 1924\n* Ernie O'Malley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=R6lnAAAAMAAJ&q=The+Singing+Flame&dq=The+Singing+Flame&pgis=1 ''The Singing Flame''] : Dublin : 1978 : : {{ISBN|978-0-900068-40-9}}\n* M.E.

It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].\n\nInternet Explorer was criticised by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] for its limited support for [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] which is promoted by [[W3C]].<ref name=\"TBLcrit\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26646919/\n| title=Creator of Web spots a flaw in Internet Explorer\n| publisher=msnbc.msn.com\n| last=Svensson|first=Peter\n| date=September 10, 2008\n| accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Non-standard extensions===\nInternet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a \"[[quirks mode]]\" to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.\n\nInternet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers. These include the innerHTML property, which provides access to the HTML string within an element;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response, and may be used to perform [[AJAX]]; and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.\n\nMicrosoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behaviour' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviours (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] format, one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, which IE did not support until version 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php |title=SVG Support Tables  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=codedread.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nOther non-standard behaviours include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |work= |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}</ref> and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular [[JScript.Encode]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cbfz3598(VS.85).aspx |title=Using Script Encoder |author= |date=May 12, 2005 |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}</ref> Support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx |title=Font Embedding for the Web |author= |date= |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Favicon===\nSupport for [[favicon]]s was first added in [[Internet Explorer 5]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Add a Shortcut Icon to a Web Page|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537656(VS.85).aspx|work=[[MSDN]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}</ref> Internet Explorer supports favicons in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], static [[GIF]] and [[ICO (file format)|native Windows icon]] formats.

Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer. [[Pop-up blocking]] and [[tabbed browsing]] were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].\n\n===Cache===\n{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}\n\nInternet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as [[Index.dat]]. Multiple [[Index.dat]] files exist which index different content\u2014visited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx | title = A bit about WinInet's Index.dat | publisher = [[MSDN]] blogs | accessdate = March 7, 2008 | author = Windows Core Networking Team}}</ref>\n\nPrior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.\n\nCaching has been improved in IE9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements.aspx|title=Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements|publisher=|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Group Policy===\n{{Main|Group Policy}}\nInternet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]].  Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behaviour and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one \"tab process\".]]\nInternet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology.

Rather, <tt>MSHTML.dll</tt> exposes an API that permits a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for [[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 4]] support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime (not supported in [[Windows RT]]) that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.\n\n[[Internet Explorer 8]] introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie.aspx | title = IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE | accessdate = March 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Extensibility==\n{{See also|Component Object Model|Browser Helper Object}}\n\nInternet Explorer exposes a set of [[Component Object Model]] (COM) interfaces that allows [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ons]] to extend the functionality of the browser.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and content extensibility. Browser extensibility involves adding context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose that feature in the user interface. Content extensibility adds support for non-native content formats.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> It allows Internet Explorer to handle new [[file format]]s and new [[network protocol|protocols]], e.g. [[WebM]] or [[SPDY]].<ref name=\"architecture\" /> In addition, web pages can integrate [[software widget|widgets]] known as [[ActiveX]] controls which run on Windows only but have vast potentials to extend the content capabilities; [[Adobe Flash Player]] and [[Microsoft Silverlight]] are examples.<ref name=\"architecture\" /> Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site.\n\nSince malicious add-ons can compromise the security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a \"No Add-Ons\" mode. [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Application isolation|Starting with Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated from the rest of the system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&nbsp;\u2013 Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser. Windows 8 and [[Windows RT]] introduce a [[Metro-style app|Metro-style version]] of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/australian-technology/a-look-at-internet-explorer-10-on-windows-rt/|title = A look at Internet Explorer 10 on Windows RT|date = January 20, 2013|accessdate = |website = [[TechRepublic]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|last = McSherry|first = Tony}}</ref> In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInternet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside a computer program or create [[Internet Explorer shell]]s.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n==Security==\n{{See also|Browser security}}\nInternet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.\n\nInternet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of [[Microsoft Windows]] to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.\n\nInternet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.\n\nIn [[Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restricted\u2014it cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.\n\nPatches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through [[Windows Update#Automatic Updates|Automatic Updates]]. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency patch was released to fix a potential security risk which \"could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords\". Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that \"0.02% of internet sites\" were affected by the flaw. A fix for the issue was released the following day with the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, on Microsoft Windows Update. <ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=December 16, 2008 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=December 16, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a report by Accuvant, funded by Google, rated the security (based on sandboxing) of Internet Explorer worse than [[Google Chrome]] but better than [[Mozilla Firefox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/09/chrome_ie_firefox_security_bakeoff|title=Chrome is the most secured browser \u2013 new study|publisher=The Register|first=Dan|last=Goodin|date=December 9, 2011|accessdate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Accuvant Study Finds Chrome is Most Secure Browser|url=http://www.esecurityplanet.com/browser-security/accuvant-study-finds-chrome-is-most-secure-browser.html|date=December 13, 2011|publisher=eSecurity Planet|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> \n\nA more recent browser security white paper comparing [[Google Chrome]], [[Microsoft Edge]], and [[Internet Explorer 11]] by X41 D-Sec in 2017 came to similar conclusions, also based on sandboxing and support of legacy web technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://browser-security.x41-dsec.de/X41-Browser-Security-White-Paper.pdf|title=Browser Security White Paper|publisher=X41-Dsec GmbH|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Security vulnerabilities===\n{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Security and vulnerabilities}}\nInternet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:<!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --> much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a \"[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]\". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an [[ActiveX]] security alert.\n\nA number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but [[ActiveX]]-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/The-Lame-Blame-of-ActiveX/\n|title=The Lame Blame of ActiveX\n|date=April 14, 2005\n|accessdate=April 7, 2006\n|work = Security\u2014Opinions\n|publisher=eWeek\n|last=Seltzer\n|first=Larry\n}}</ref> In 2006, new techniques using automated testing found more than a hundred vulnerabilities in standard Microsoft ActiveX components.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/11403\n|title=ActiveX security faces storm before calm\n|date=July 31, 2006\n|accessdate=July 11, 2009\n|work =\n|publisher=Security Focus\n|last=Lemos\n|first=Robert\n}}</ref> Security features introduced in Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.\n\nInternet Explorer in 2008, had a number of published security vulnerabilities.

browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]\n[[File:Internet-explorer-usage-data.svg|thumb|left|300px|Historical market share of Internet Explorer]]\nThe adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release in 1997, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996, to about 40% in 1998, and over 80% in 2000. This made Microsoft the winner in the infamous '[[first browser war]]' against [[Netscape]]. [[Netscape Navigator]] was the dominant browser during 1995 and until 1997, but rapidly lost share to IE starting in 1998, and eventually slipped behind in 1999. The integration of IE with Windows led to a lawsuit by [[AOL]], Netscape's owner, accusing Microsoft of unfair competition. The infamous case was eventually won by AOL but by then it was too late, as Internet Explorer had already become the dominant browser.\n\nInternet Explorer peaked during 2002 and 2003, with about 95% share. Its first notable competitor after beating Netscape was [[Firefox]] from [[Mozilla]], which itself was an offshoot from Netscape.\n\nFirefox 1.0 had surpassed [[Internet Explorer 5]] in early 2005, with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&qpmr=40&qpdt=1&qpct=3&qptimeframe=M&qpsp=74 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nApproximate usage over time based on various usage share counters averaged for the year overall, or for the fourth quarter, or for the last month in the year depending on availability of reference.<ref name=\"nashare\">{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/ |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}</ref><ref name=zdnetearly>Borland, John.

Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of [[Internet Explorer shell]]s, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.\n\n==Removal==\n{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}\nWhile a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.\n\nThe idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the ''[[United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001)|United States v. Microsoft Corp.]]'' case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability. Indeed, programs that depend on libraries installed by IE, including Windows help and support system, fail to function without IE. Before [[Windows Vista]], it was not possible to run [[Windows Update]] without IE because the service used [[ActiveX]] technology, which no other web browser supports.\n\n==Impersonation by malware==\nThe popularity of Internet Explorer has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. On January 28, 2011, a fake Internet Explorer browser calling itself \"Internet Explorer \u2013 Emergency Mode\" appeared. It closely resembles the real Internet Explorer, but has fewer buttons and no search bar. If a user launches any other browser such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] or the real Internet Explorer, this browser will pop-up instead. It also displays a fake error message, claiming that the computer is infected with malware and Internet Explorer has entered Emergency Mode. It blocks access to legitimate sites such as [[Google]] if the user tries to access them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.im-infected.com/hijacker/internet-explorer-emergency-mode.html |title=IE

Therefore, to reduce the number of chips required, it included features such as [[clock generator]], [[interrupt controller]], timers, [[wait state]] generator, [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels, and external [[chip select]] lines.\nWhile the N80188 was compatible with the 8087 numerics co-processor, the 80C188 was not. It didn't have the ESC control codes integrated.\n\nThe initial clock rate of the 80188 was 6&nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]], but due to more hardware available for the [[microcode]] to use, especially for address calculation, many individual instructions ran faster than on an 8086 at the same clock frequency. For instance, the common ''register+immediate''{{efn|In fact, all variants, including ''reg+reg'' and ''reg+reg+immediate'' were faster.}} [[addressing mode]] was significantly faster than on the 8086, especially when a memory location was both (one of the) operand(s) and the destination. Multiply and divide also showed great improvement, being several times as fast as on the original 8086 and multi-bit shifts were done almost four times as quickly as in the 8086.\n\n===End of life===\nAlong with hundreds of other processor models, Intel discontinued the 80188 processor 30 March 2006, after a life of about 24 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf|title=Product Change Notification 106013 - 01|date=May 2, 2006|website=Intel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009060120/http://developer.intel.com/design/pcn/Processors/D0106013.pdf|archive-date=October 9, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cpu-collection.de/?tn=1&l0=cl&l1=80186/188 Intel 80186/80188 images and descriptions at cpu-collection.de]\n* [http://www.datasheetarchive.com/search.php?q=80188 Scan of the Intel 80188 data book] at datasheetarchive.com\n{{Intel processors|discontinued}}\n{{Intel controllers}}\n\n[[Category:Intel microcontrollers]]\n[[Category:Intel x86 microprocessors|80186]]\n[[es:Intel 80186 y 80188]]", "sha1": "7fiu4xykborsxr90fs7xwlo96i0rjdw"}}, {"title": "IEEE 802.2", "ns": "0", "id": "15222", "revision": {"id": "857596528", "parentid": "845372048", "timestamp": "2018-09-01T18:58:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Matthiaspaul", "id": "13467261"}, "comment": "fixed capitalization", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''IEEE 802.2''' is the original name of the '''ISO/IEC 8802-2''' standard which defines [[logical link control]] (LLC) as the upper portion of the [[data link layer]] of the [[OSI Model]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = IEEE Standard for Information technology\u2014Telecommunications and information exchange between systems\u2014Local and metropolitan area networks\u2014Specific requirements | volume = Part 2: Logical Link Control | isbn = 1-55937-959-6 | publisher = The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers | place = New York | date = May 7, 2008}}</ref> The original standard developed by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) in collaboration with the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) was adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in 1998, but it still remains an integral part of the family of [[IEEE 802]] [[technical standard|standards]] for [[Local area network|local]] and [[Metropolitan area network|metropolitan]] networks.\n\nLLC is a software component that provides a uniform interface to the user of the data link service, usually the [[network layer]]. LLC may offer three types of services:\n* Unacknowledged [[connectionless communication|connectionless mode]] services (mandatory)\n* [[connection-oriented communication|Connection mode]] services (optional)\n* Acknowledged [[connectionless communication|connectionless mode]] services (optional)\n\nConversely, the LLC uses the services of the [[media access control]] (MAC), which is dependent on the specific transmission medium ([[Ethernet]], [[Token Ring]], [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]], [[802.11]], etc.). Using LLC is compulsory for all [[IEEE 802]] networks with the exception of [[Ethernet]].  It is also used in [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface]] (FDDI) which is not part of the [[IEEE 802]] family.\n\nThe IEEE 802.2 sublayer adds some control information to the message created by the upper layer and passed to the LLC for transmission to another node on the same data link.  The resulting packet is generally referred to as ''LLC [[protocol data unit]] (PDU)'' and the additional information added by the LLC sublayer is the ''LLC HEADER''. The LLC Header consist of ''DSAP'' (''Destination [[Service Access Point]]''), ''SSAP''  (''Source [[Service Access Point]]'') and the ''Control'' field.\n\nThe two 8-bit fields DSAP and SSAP allow to multiplex various upper layer protocols above LLC. However, many protocols use the [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) extension which allows using [[EtherType]] values to specify the protocol being transported atop IEEE 802.2. It also allows vendors to define their own protocol value spaces.\n\nThe 8 or 16 bit [[HDLC]]-style Control field serves to distinguish communication mode, to specify a specific operation and to facilitate connection control and [[flow control (data)|flow control]] (in connection mode) or [[acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgements]] (in acknowledged connectionless mode).\n\n==Operational modes==\nIEEE 802.2 provides two [[connectionless mode transmission|connectionless]] and one connection-oriented operational modes:\n* '''Type 1''' is an unacknowledged connectionless mode for a [[datagram]] service. It allows for sending frames\n** to a single destination ([[Point-to-point (network topology)|point-to-point]] or [[unicast]] transfer),\n** to multiple destinations on the same network ([[multicast]]),\n** or to all stations of the network ([[broadcast]]).\nThe use of multicasts and broadcasts reduce network traffic when the same information needs to be propagated to all stations of the network.  However the Type 1 service provides no guarantees regarding the order of the received frames compared to the order in which they have been sent; the sender does not even get an acknowledgment that the frames have been received.\n* '''Type 2''' is a [[connection-oriented]] operational mode. Sequence numbering ensures that the frames received are guaranteed to be in the order they have been sent, and no frames are lost.\n* '''Type 3''' is an acknowledged [[connectionless mode transmission|connectionless]] service. It supports point-to-point communication only.\n\nEach device conforming the IEEE 802.2 standard must support service type 1. Each network node is assigned an '''LLC Class''' according to which service types it supports:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"| LLC<br/>Class\n!colspan=\"3\"| Supported Service Types\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n!style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| I\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| II\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| III\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n||\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| IV\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| X\n|}\n\n==LLC header==\nAny 802.2 LLC PDU has the following format:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"|802.2 LLC Header\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Information\n|-\n!DSAP address\n!SSAP address\n!Control\n|-\n|8 bits\n|8 bits\n|8 or 16 bits\n|multiple of 8 bits\n|}\n\nWhen [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) extension is used, it is located at the start of the Information field:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\"|802.2 LLC Header\n!colspan=\"2\"|SNAP extension\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Upper layer data\n|-\n!DSAP\n!SSAP\n!Control\n!OUI\n!Protocol ID\n|-\n|8 bits\n|8 bits\n|8 or 16 bits\n|24 bits\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 bits\n|multiple of 8 bits\n|}\n\nThe 802.2 header includes two eight-bit address fields, called '''[[service access point]]s''' (SAP) or collectively LSAP in the OSI terminology:\n*SSAP (Source SAP) is an 8-bit long field that represents the logical address of the network layer entity that has created the message. \n* DSAP (Destination SAP) is an 8-bit long field that represents the logical addresses of the network layer entity intended to receive the message.\n\n===LSAP values===\nAlthough the LSAP fields are 8 bits long, the low-order bit is reserved for special purposes, leaving only 128 values available for most purposes.\n\nThe low-order bit of the DSAP indicates whether it contains an individual or a group address:\n* if the low-order bit is 0, the remaining 7 bits of the DSAP specify an individual address, which refers to a single local service access point (LSAP) to which the packet should be delivered. and\n* if the low-order bit is 1, the remaining 7 bits of the DSAP specify a group address, which refers to a group of LSAPs to which the packet should be delivered.\n\nThe low-order bit of the SSAP indicates whether the packet is a command or response packet:\n* if it's 0, the packet is a command packet, and\n* if it's 1, the packet is a response packet.\nThe remaining 7 bits of the SSAP specify the LSAP (always an individual address) from which the packet was transmitted.\n\nLSAP numbers are globally assigned by the IEEE to uniquely identify well established international standards.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Individual LSAP addresses\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| Value\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Meaning\n|-\n!

Other protocols may use the [[Subnetwork Access Protocol]] (SNAP) with IEEE 802.2 which is indicated by the hexadecimal value 0xAA (or 0xAB, if the source of a response) in SSAP and DSAP.  The SNAP extension allows using [[EtherType]] values or private protocol ID spaces in all [[IEEE 802]] networks. It can be used both in datagram and in connection-oriented network services.\n\n[[Ethernet]] ([[IEEE 802.3]]) networks are an exception; the IEEE 802.3x-1997 standard explicitly allowed using of the [[Ethernet II framing]], where the 16-bit field after the MAC addresses does not carry the length of the frame followed by the IEEE 802.2 LLC header, but the [[EtherType]] value followed by the upper layer data. With this framing only datagram services are supported on the [[data link layer]].\n\n=== IPv4, IPX, and 802.2 LLC ===\n\nAlthough [[IPv4]] has been assigned an LSAP value of 6 (0x6) and [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]] has been assigned an LSAP value of 152 (0x98), IPv4 is almost never directly encapsulated in 802.2 LLC frames without SNAP headers. Instead, the [[Internet standard]] RFC 1042 is usually used for encapsulating IPv4 traffic in 802.2 LLC frames with SNAP headers on [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] and on [[IEEE 802]] networks other than [[Ethernet]].  Ethernet networks typically use [[Ethernet II]] framing with [[EtherType]] 0x800 for IP and 0x806 for ARP.<ref>{{Citation | title = LKML | date = 2011-07-27 | url = https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/7/27/169}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Internetwork Packet Exchange|IPX]] protocol used by Novell [[NetWare]] networks supports an additional [[Ethernet]] frame type, [[Ethernet frame#Novell raw IEEE 802.3|802.3 raw]], ultimately supporting four frame types on Ethernet (802.3 raw, [[Ethernet frame#IEEE 802.2 LLC|802.2 LLC]], [[Ethernet frame#IEEE 802.2 SNAP|802.2 SNAP]], and [[Ethernet frame#Ethernet II|Ethernet II]]) and two frame types on [[Fiber Distributed Data Interface|FDDI]] and other (non-Ethernet) IEEE 802 networks (802.2 LLC and 802.2 SNAP).\n\nIt is possible to use diverse framings on a single network. It is possible to do it even for the same upper layer protocol, but in such a case the nodes using unlike framings cannot directly communicate with each other.\n\n===Control Field===\nFollowing the destination and source SAP fields is a [[HDLC#Control Field|control field]].  IEEE 802.2 was conceptually derived from [[HDLC]], and has the same three types of [[Protocol data unit|PDU]]s:\n* Unnumbered format PDUs, or '''U-format''' PDUs, with an 8-bit control field, which are intended for connectionless applications;\n* Information transfer format PDUs, or '''I-format''' PDUs, with a 16-bit control and sequence numbering field, which are intended to be used in connection-oriented applications;\n* Supervisory format PDUs, or '''S-format''' PDUs, with a 16-bit control field, which are intended to be used for supervisory functions at the LLC (Logical Link Control) layer.\n\nTo carry data in the most-often used unacknowledged connectionless mode the U-format is used. It is identified by the value '11' in lower two bits of the single-byte control field.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |64em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Citation | url = http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/802.2.html | publisher = IEEE | title = 802.2 | edition = online}}.\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 802.2}}\n[[Category:IEEE 802|IEEE 802.02]]\n[[Category:Link protocols]]\n[[Category:Logical link control]]", "sha1": "4tul7axzumc6qthbqg8sgxtepk52x6w"}}, {"title": "Invertebrate", "ns": "0", "id": "15223", "revision": {"id": "857397284", "parentid": "853916156", "timestamp": "2018-08-31T12:37:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Doceddi", "id": "1061578"}, "comment": "/* Etymology */Tried to simplify and make whole sentences.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-vand|small=yes}}\n[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|The common fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', has been used extensively for research.]]\n\n'''Invertebrates''' are [[animal]]s that neither possess nor develop a [[vertebral column]] (commonly known as a ''backbone'' or ''spine''), derived from the [[notochord]].

According to this understanding, invertebrates do not possess a skeleton of bone, either internal or external. They include hugely varied [[body plan]]s. Many have fluid-filled, hydrostatic skeletons, like [[jellyfish]] or worms. Others have hard [[exoskeleton]]s, outer shells like those of [[insect]]s and [[crustacean]]s. The most familiar invertebrates include the [[Protozoa]], [[Porifera]], [[Coelenterata]], [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nematoda]], [[Annelida]], [[Echinodermata]], [[Mollusca]] and [[Arthropoda]].

The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites [[tortoise]]s, [[snail]]s and [[sponge]]s. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the [[Porifera]], invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior.\n\n=== Morphology and symmetry ===\nThe [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit some form of [[Symmetry in biology|symmetry]], whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A minority, however, exhibit no symmetry. One example of asymmetric invertebrates includes all [[gastropod]] species. This is easily seen in [[snail]]s and [[sea snail]]s, which have helical shells. [[Slug]]s appear externally symmetrical, but their [[pneumostome]] (breathing hole) is located on the right side. Other gastropods develop external asymmetry, such as [[Glaucus atlanticus]] that develops asymmetrical [[cerata]] as they mature. The origin of gastropod asymmetry is a subject of scientific debate.<ref name=\"gastropod development\">{{cite journal| author=Louise R.

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was appointed to the position of \"Curator of Insecta and Vermes\" at the [[Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in 1793, both coined the term \"invertebrate\" to describe such animals, and divided the original two groups into ten, by splitting Arachnida and Crustacea from the Linnean Insecta, and Mollusca, Annelida, [[Barnacle|Cirripedia]], [[Radiata]], [[Coelenterata]] and [[Infusoria]] from the Linnean Vermes. They are now classified into over 30 [[phylum|phyla]], from simple organisms such as [[sea sponge]]s and [[flatworm]]s to complex animals such as arthropods and molluscs.\n\n==== Significance of the group ====\nInvertebrates are animals  ''without'' a vertebral column. This has led to the conclusion that ''in''vertebrates are a group that deviates from the normal, vertebrates. This has been said to be because researchers in the past, such as Lamarck, viewed vertebrates as a \"standard\": in Lamarck's theory of evolution, he believed that characteristics acquired through the evolutionary process involved not only survival, but also progression toward a \"higher form\", to which humans and vertebrates were closer than invertebrates were. Although goal-directed evolution has been abandoned, the distinction of invertebrates and vertebrates persists to this day, even though the grouping has been noted to be \"hardly natural or even very sharp.\" Another reason cited for this continued distinction is that Lamarck created a precedent through his classifications which is now difficult to escape from. It is also possible that some humans believe that, they themselves being vertebrates, the group deserves more attention than invertebrates.<ref name=rskbarnes>{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Richard Stephen Kent|title=The Invertebrates: A Synthesis|isbn=978-0-632-04761-1|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2001|page=3}}</ref> In any event, in the 1968 edition of ''Invertebrate Zoology'', it is noted that \"division of the Animal Kingdom into vertebrates and invertebrates is artificial and reflects human bias in favor of man's own relatives.\" The book also points out that the group lumps a vast number of species together, so that no one characteristic describes all invertebrates. In addition, some species included are only remotely related to one another, with some more related to vertebrates than other invertebrates (see [[Paraphyly]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Robert D.|year=1968|title=Invertebrate Zoology|edition=2nd|publisher=W.B.

His father, a peasant with a small farm, Ivar Jonsson, died in 1826. The younger Ivar was brought up to farmwork, but he assiduously cultivated all his leisure in reading.<ref name=Gosse4/> An early interest of his was [[botany]].<ref name=nie>{{harvnb|Gilman|Peck|Colby|1905|p=4}}</ref>  When he was eighteen, he opened an elementary school in his native parish. In 1833 he entered the household of [[Hans Conrad Thoresen]], the husband of the eminent writer [[Magdalene Thoresen]], in [[Her\u00f8y, M\u00f8re og Romsdal|Her\u00f8y]] (then Her\u00f8), and there he picked up the elements of [[Latin language|Latin]]. Gradually, and by dint of infinite patience and concentration, the young peasant mastered many languages, and began the scientific study of their structure.<ref name=Gosse4>{{harvnb|Gosse|1911|p=4}}</ref> Ivar single-handedly created a new language for Norway to become the \"literary\" language.<ref name=Colliers>{{harvnb|Haugen|1997|p=4}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Uthuslien Aasen 1891.jpg|thumb|Ivar Aasen (1891)]]\nAbout 1846 he had freed himself from all the burden of manual labour, and could occupy his thoughts with the dialect of his native district, Sunnm\u00f8re; his first publication was a small collection of [[folk song]]s in the Sunnm\u00f8re dialect (1843). His remarkable abilities now attracted general attention, and he was helped to continue his studies undisturbed. His ''Grammar of the Norwegian Dialects'' ({{lang-da|Det Norske Folkesprogs Grammatik}}, 1848) was the result of much labour, and of journeys taken to every part of the country.  Aasen's famous ''Dictionary of the Norwegian Dialects'' ({{lang-da|Ordbog over det Norske Folkesprog}}) appeared in its original form in 1850, and from this publication dates all the wide cultivation of the popular language in Norwegian, since Aasen really did no less than construct, out of the different materials at his disposal, a popular language or definite ''folke-maal'' (people's language) for Norway. By 1853, he had created the norm for utilizing his new language, which he called [[Nynorsk|Landsmaal]], meaning country language.<ref name=Colliers/> With certain modifications, the most important of which were introduced later by Aasen himself,<ref name=Gosse4/> but also through a latter [[Norwegian language struggle|policy]] aiming to merge this Norwegian language with Dano-Norwegian, this language has become ''[[Nynorsk]]'' (\"New Norwegian\"), the second of Norway's two official languages (the other being ''[[Bokm\u00e5l]]'', the Dano-Norwegian descendant of the [[Danish language]] used in Norway in Aasen's time). An unofficial variety of Norwegian more close to Aasen's language is still found in [[H\u00f8gnorsk]] (\"High Norwegian\"). Today, some consider Nynorsk on equal footing with bokm\u00e5l, as bokm\u00e5l tends to be used more in radio and television and most newspapers, whereas New Norse (Nynorsk) is used equally in government<ref name=kat>{{harvnb|Katzner|2002|p=78}}</ref> work as well as approximately 17% of schools.<ref name=Hau1>{{harvnb|Haugen|2009|p=126}}</ref> Although it is not as common as its brother language, it needs to be looked upon as a viable language, as a large minority of Norwegians use it as their primary language including many scholars and authors.<ref name=Hau1/>  New Norse is both a written and spoken language.<ref name=hau>{{harvnb|Haugen|2009|p=125}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:VFG IvarAasen01.JPG|thumb|left| Tomb of Ivar Aasen at V\u00e5r Frelsers gravlund, Oslo]]\nAasen composed poems and plays in the composite dialect to show how it should be used; one of these dramas, ''The Heir'' (1855), was frequently acted, and may be considered as the pioneer of all the abundant dialect-literature of the last half-century of the 1800s, from [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Vinje]] to [[Arne Garborg|Garborg]]. In 1856, he published ''Norske Ordsprog'', a treatise on Norwegian proverbs. Aasen continuously enlarged and improved his grammars and his dictionary. He lived very quietly in lodgings in [[Oslo]] (then Christiania), surrounded by his books and shrinking from publicity, but his name grew into wide political favour as his ideas about the language of the peasants became more and more the watch-word of the popular party.<ref name=Gosse5>{{harvnb|Gosse|1911|p=5}}</ref> In 1864, he published his definitive grammar of Nynorsk and in 1873 he published the definitive dictionary.<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\nQuite early in his career, in 1842, he had begun to receive a grant to enable him to give his entire attention to his philological investigations; and the [[Storting]] (Norwegian [[parliament]]), conscious of the national importance of his work, treated him in this respect with more and more generosity as he advanced in years. He continued his investigations to the last, but it may be said that, after the 1873 edition of his ''Dictionary'' (with a new title:<ref name=nie/> {{lang-da|Norsk Ordbog}}), he added but little to his stores. Aasen holds perhaps an isolated place in literary history as the one man who has invented, or at least selected and constructed, a language which has pleased so many thousands of his countrymen that they have accepted it for their schools, their sermons and their songs.

Multiple wars have been fought over the issue, the first one immediately upon independence and partition in 1947 itself. To stave off a Pakistani and tribal invasion, [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] with India. Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part. All modern Indian political parties support the return of the entirety of Kashmir to India, and all official maps of India show the entire [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state (including parts under Pakistani or Chinese administration after 1947) as an integral part of India.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|Greater Indonesia}}\n[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|[[Western New Guinea]] was annexed by Indonesia in 1969]]\nIndonesia claimed all territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], and previously viewed British plans to group the [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] into a new independent federation of [[Malaysia]] as a threat to its objective to create a united state called [[Greater Indonesia]].

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. It should be noted that [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States has until now not recognized Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem and maintained its embassy in Tel Aviv. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. Since 1995, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and by May 2018 the embassy will have officially moved to Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref> \n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and because that area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land. Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.\n\n===Korea===\n{{main|Korean reunification}}\n\nSince their founding, both Korean states have disputed the legitimacy of the other. [[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an \"entity occupying the Korean territory\".\n\n[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]]. However the body is purely symbolic and largely tasked with dealing with Northern defectors; if reunification were to actually occur the Committee would be dissolved and new administrators appointed by the [[Ministry of Unification]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/03/18/south-koreas-governors-in-theory-for-north-korea/|title=South Korea's Governors-in-Theory for North Korea|date=March 18, 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther territories sometimes disputed to belong to Korea are [[Korean nationalism#Manchuria and Gando Disputes|Manchuria and Gando]].\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nPakistan has from its inception sought to have the territory of Kashmir incorporated into it.

This territory of {{Convert|159500|km2|abbr=on}} is the subject of a long-running boundary dispute inherited from the colonial powers and complicated by the independence of Guyana in 1966. The status of the territory is subject to the Treaty of Geneva, which was signed by the United Kingdom, Venezuela and British Guiana governments on February 17, 1966. This treaty stipulates that the parties will agree to find a practical, peaceful and satisfactory solution to the dispute.<ref name=Geneva>{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20561/volume-561-I-8192-English.pdf|title=Agreement to resolve the controversy over the frontier between Venezuela and British Guiana (Treaty of Geneva, 1966) |publisher= [[United Nations]]}}</ref>\n\n==Other irredentism==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Former Yugoslavia====\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome of the most violent irredentist conflicts of recent times in [[Europe]] flared up as a consequence of the break-up of the former [[Yugoslavia]]n federal state in the early 1990s.{{dubious|date=October 2011}}{{clarify|date=October 2011}} The conflict erupted further south with the ethnic Albanian majority in [[Kosovo]] seeking to switch allegiance to the adjoining state of [[Albania]].<ref>See [[Naomi Chazan]] 1991, ''Irredentism and international politics''</ref>\n\n====Albania====\n{{main|Albanian nationalism|Greater Albania}}\n[[File:AlbaniansOutsideAlbania.png|thumb|Distribution of [[Albanians]] in the Balkans]]\nGreater Albania<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/csrc/document-listings/balkan/07(11)MD.pdf|title=404 Error Page|website=www.da.mod.uk}}</ref> or ''Ethnic Albania'' as called by the Albanian nationalists themselves,<ref name=\"Bogdani2007\">{{Cite book|title=Albania and the European Union: the tumultuous journey towards integration |last=Bogdani |first=Mirela |authorlink= |author2=John Loughlin |year=2007 |publisher=IB Taurus |location= |isbn= 978-1-84511-308-7|page=230 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&pg=PA230&dq=ethnic+albania&cd=4#v=onepage&q=ethnic%20albania |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref> is an irredentist concept of lands outside the borders of [[Albania]] which are considered part of a greater national homeland by most Albanians,<ref name=Balkan-Insight>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/survey-greater-albania-remains-popular Poll Reveals Support for 'Greater Albania'], Balkan Insight, 17 Nov 2010</ref> based on claims on the present-day or historical presence of Albanian populations in those areas.

Under this theory France's eastern border would extend to the Rhine river and would require the annexation of Belgium, Luxembourg, 27,264&nbsp;km\u00b2 of German territory on the left bank of the Rhine river, and 10,545&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Dutch territory south of Waal and Merwede rivers. If implemented today France would increase its territory by 70,923&nbsp;km\u00b2 and increase its population by 25,170,400.\n\n====Germany====\n{{main|German Question|Pan-Germanism|Anschluss|Munich Agreement}}\n\nDuring the debate of what was then called the [[German Question]] (''die deutsche Frage'') in the 19th century prior to the [[unification of Germany]] (1871), the term ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'' \"Greater Germany\" referred to a possible German nation consisting of the states that later comprised the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria]]. The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent and the [[Anschluss]], which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n[[File:Territorial Expansion of Greece from 1832\u20131947.gif|thumb|Territorial evolution of modern Greece]]\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Hungary in 1941 with territories annexed in 1938-1941.png|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Ireland====\n[[File:Ireland-Capitals.PNG|thumb|left|Political map of Ireland, showing the state of Ireland and Northern Ireland]]\n{{main|United Ireland|Partition of Ireland|Irish republican legitimism}}\nThe [[Irish Free State]] achieved independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. The [[Constitution of Ireland]] adopted in 1937 provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed. The amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n{{main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Similar to the Nazis' stab-in-the-back myth, Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia), Libya, Much of Egypt, Tunisia, Kenya and Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, the Spanish island of Majorca and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====Republic of Macedonia====\n{{main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. The United Macedonia concept aims to unify the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] in the [[Balkans]] (which they claim as their homeland and which they assert was wrongfully divided under the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] in 1913), into a single state under Macedonian domination, with the [[Greece|Greek]] city of [[Thessaloniki]] (''Solun'' in the [[Slavic languages]]) as its capital.<ref name=\"Times\">Greek Macedonia \"not a problem\", ''The Times'' (London), August 5, 1957</ref><ref>{{YouTube|t2GMihoOmF8|A large assembly of people during the inauguration of the Statue of Alexander the Great in Skopje}}, {{YouTube|Kh25jfXxY2w|the players of the national basketball team of the Republic of Macedonia during the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania}}, {{YouTube|97ucJP97Sto|and a little girl}}, singing a nationalistic tune called Izlezi Mom\u010de (\u0418\u0437\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435, \"Get out boy\").

The [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]], which was the Norwegian territories at its maximum extent, included [[Iceland]], the settleable areas of [[Greenland]], the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Shetland]] among others. Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark. In 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]], [[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]]. In 1921, Polish troops crossed the [[Curzon Line]], the border between ethnic Polish and ethnic Ukrainian and Belorussian territories, and [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|seized large Ukrainian and Belorussian territories]], and also [[\u017beligowski's Mutiny|seized 7 percent of Lithuania's territory in 1920]]. These territories were re-annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1939 under the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop pact]], and include major cities, like [[Lviv]] (Ukraine), [[Vilnius]] (the capital of Lithuania), and [[Hrodna]] (Belarus). Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of a Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy. It turned out that almost 15% of the population of Poland (4.3\u20134.6 million people) declared that they had either been born in the Kresy, or had a parent or a grandparent who came from that region. Numerous treasures of Polish culture remain and there are numerous Kresy-oriented organizations. There are Polish sports clubs ([[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w (2009)|Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], [[FK Polonia Vilnius]]), newspapers ([[Gazeta Lwowska]], [[Kurier Wile\u0144ski]]), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), numerous theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] forcing almost complete Serbian population to leave their centuries-old homeland, while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]]. There has since been calls by Bosnian Serb politicians for the [[Proposed secession of Republika Srpska|secession of Republika Srpska]], and possible unification with Serbia.\n\nAfter the [[Kosovo War]] (1998\u201399), Kosovo became a [[UNSCR 1244|UN protectorate]], still ''de jure'' part of Serbia. The Albanian-majority Kosovo assembly unilaterally declared the independence of Kosovo in 2008, and [[Political status of Kosovo|its status is since disputed]].\n\n====Spain====\n{{further|Spanish irredentism|Spanish nationalism|Disputed status of Gibraltar}}\n\nSpain maintains a claim on [[Gibraltar]], a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] near the southernmost tip of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which has been British since the 18th Century.\n\nGibraltar was [[Capture of Gibraltar|captured in 1704]], during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131714). The [[Kingdom of Spain]] formally ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713, under [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]] of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Spain's territorial claim was formally reasserted by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in the 1960s and has been continued by successive [[Government of Spain|Spanish governments]]. In 2002 an agreement in principle on joint sovereignty over [[Gibraltar]] between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain was decisively rejected in a [[Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 2002|referendum]]. The British Government now refuses to discuss sovereignty without the consent of the Gibraltarians.<ref name=\"Answer to Q257 at the FAC hearing\">{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmfaff/147/8032602.htm |title=Answer to Q257 at the FAC hearing |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\n===Western Asia===\n\n====Caucasus====\n{{main|Armenian nationalism|Azerbaijani nationalism|Armenian Genocide|United Armenia}}\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\n\nIrredentism is acute in the Caucasus region.

Japan also claims the [[South Korea]]n-administered [[Liancourt Rocks dispute|Liancourt Rocks]], which are known as Takeshima in Japan and have been claimed since the end of the Second World War.\n\n====Korea====\nThe 1909 [[Gando Convention]] addressed a territory dispute between China and [[Joseon Korea]] in China's favour. Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz. [[Dandong]] and [[Liaoning]].

These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Scholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with \"the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh\".\n\n====India====\n{{Main|Indian nationalism|Greater India|Akhand Bharat}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nThe call for creation of ''Akhanda Bharata'' or ''Akhand Hindustan'' has on occasion been raised by some [[India]]n right wing [[Hindutva]]di cultural and political organisations, such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=\"Ferguson\"/><ref name=\"Majumder\"/><ref name=\"Martensson\"/><ref name=\"Suda1953\">{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath & Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindustan.}}</ref> The name of one organisation sharing this goal, the [[Akhand Hindustan Morcha]], bears the term in its name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hindu Political Parties|date=30 May 2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781157374923}}</ref> Other major Indian non-sectarian political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]], maintain a position against the [[partition of India]] on religious grounds and do not subscribe to a call for Akhand Bharat.\n\n====Nepal====\n{{Main|Greater Nepal|Sino-Nepalese War|Nepalese\u2013Tibetan War}}\n\n====Pakistan====\n{{Main|Pakistani nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Africa===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to occupy much of [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n====Somalia====\n{{main|Greater Somalia}}\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n===North America===\n\n====Mexico====\n{{See also|Reconquista (Mexico)}}\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1845\u201348), Mexico ceded claims to what is now the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Southwestern United States]] to the United States (see [[Mexican Cession]]).

The related [[Yupik languages]] are spoken in western and southern Alaska and in the far east of Russia, but are severely endangered in Russia today and spoken only in a few villages on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]]. The [[Inuit]] live primarily in three countries: Greenland, Canada (specifically in the [[Nunatsiavut]] region of Labrador, the [[Nunavik]] region of Quebec, [[Nunavut]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]), and the United States (specifically the coast of Alaska).\n\nThe total population of Inuit speaking their traditional languages is difficult to assess with precision, since most counts rely on self-reported census data that may not accurately reflect usage or competence. Greenland census estimates place the number of speakers of varieties of Inuit there at roughly 50,000, while Canadian estimates are at roughly 35,000. These two countries count the bulk of speakers of Inuit language variants, although about 7,500 Alaskans<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/elr/natlang.html |title=Indigenous Languages Spoken in the United States (by Language) |publisher=yourdictionary.com |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> speak varieties of Inuit out of a population of over 13,000 Inuit.\n\nThe Inuit languages have a few hundred speakers in Russia. In addition, an estimated 7,000 [[Greenlandic people in Denmark|Greenlandic Inuit live in European Denmark]], the largest group outside Greenland, Canada and Alaska. Thus, the global population of speakers of varieties of Inuit is on the order of nearly 100,000 people.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe traditional language of the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible from one end of the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not think of it as a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a [[dialect continuum]]. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.\n\nAs a result, Inuit in different places use different words for its own variants and for the entire group of languages, and this ambiguity has been carried into other languages, creating a great deal of confusion over what labels should be applied to it.\n\nIn Greenland the official form of Inuit language, and the official language of the state, is called ''Kalaallisut''. In other languages, it is often called ''[[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]'' or some cognate term. The Eskimo languages of Alaska are called ''[[Inupiaq language|Inupiatun]]'', but the variants of the [[Seward Peninsula]] are distinguished from the other Alaskan variants by calling them ''Qawiaraq'', or for some dialects, ''[[Bering Strait]] Inupiatun''.\n\nIn Canada, the word ''[[Inuktitut]]'' is routinely used to refer to all Canadian variants of the Inuit traditional language, and it is under that name that it is recognised as one of the official languages of [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]]. However, one of the variants of western Nunavut is called ''[[Inuinnaqtun]]'' to distinguish itself from the dialects of eastern Canada, while the variants of the Northwest Territories are sometimes called ''[[Inuvialuktun]]'' and have in the past sometimes been called ''Inuktun''. In those dialects, the name is sometimes rendered as ''Inuktitun'' to reflect dialectal differences in pronunciation. The Inuit language of [[Quebec]] is called ''[[Inuttitut]]'' by its speakers, and often by other people, but this is a minor variation in pronunciation. In [[Labrador]], the language is called ''Inuttut'' or, often in official documents, by the more descriptive name ''Labradorimiutut''. Furthermore, Canadians \u2013 both Inuit and non-Inuit \u2013 sometimes use the word ''Inuktitut'' to refer to ''all'' Inuit language variants, including those of Alaska and Greenland.\n\nThe phrase ''\"Inuit language\"'' is largely limited to professional discourse, since in each area, there is one or more conventional terms that cover all the local variants; or it is used as a descriptive term in publications where readers can't necessarily be expected to know the locally used words.\n\nAlthough many people refer to the Inuit language as ''Eskimo language'', this is a broad term that also includes the [[Yupik languages]], and is in addition strongly discouraged in Canada and diminishing in usage elsewhere. See the article on ''[[Eskimo]]'' for more information on this word.\n\n==Classification and history==\nThe language of the Inuit is an [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut language]]. It is fairly closely related to the Yupik languages and more remotely to the [[Aleut language]]. These cousin languages are all spoken in Western [[Alaska]] and Eastern [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]], Russia. It is not discernibly related to other [[indigenous languages of the Americas]] or northeast Asia, although some have proposed that it is related to the [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and the [[Sami languages]] in the proposed \"[[Uralo-Siberian languages|Uralo-Siberian]]\" grouping, or even [[Indo-European languages]] as part of the hypothetical [[Nostratic languages|\"Nostratic\"]] superphylum. Some consider it a [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian language]], although that is more a geographic than a linguistic grouping.\n\nEarly forms of the Inuit language were spoken by the [[Thule people]], who overran the [[Dorset culture]] that had previously occupied Arctic America at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium]]. By 1300, the Inuit and their language had reached western Greenland, and finally east Greenland roughly at the same time the [[Norse colonization of North America#Norse Greenland|Viking colonies in southern Greenland]] disappeared. It is generally believed that it was during this centuries-long eastward migration that the Inuit language became distinct from the Yupik languages spoken in Western Alaska and Chukotka.\n\nUntil 1902, a possible enclave of the Dorset, the ''[[Sadlermiut]]'' (in modern [[Inuktitut]] spelling ''Sallirmiut''), existed on [[Southampton Island]]. Almost nothing is known about their language, but the few eyewitness accounts tell of them speaking a \"strange dialect\". This suggests that they also spoke an Eskimo\u2013Aleut language, but one quite distinct from the forms spoken in Canada today.\n\nThe Yupik and Inuit languages are very similar syntactically and morphologically. Their common origin can be seen in a number of cognates:\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" width=\"70%\"\n! English !! Central Yupik !! I\u00f1upiatun !! North Baffin Inuktitut !!

Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of [[Igloolik]] versus the dialect of [[Iqaluit]], for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels that try to synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme is not the only one used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.\n\nIn addition to the territories listed below, some 7,000 Greenlandic speakers are reported to live in mainland [[Denmark]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal |title=Inuktitut, Greenlandic: A language of Greenland |publisher=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> and according to the 2001 census roughly 200 self-reported Inuktitut native speakers regularly live in parts of [[Canada]] which are outside traditional Inuit lands.\n\n===Alaska===\n{{details|Inupiaq language}}\n\nOf the roughly 13,000 Alaskan [[I\u00f1upiat]], as few as 3000 may still be able to speak the I\u00f1upiaq, with most of them over the age of 40.<ref name=\"Inupiaq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/langs/i.html |title=Alaska Native Languages: Inupiaq |publisher=University of Alaska Fairbanks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424091828/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/langs/i.html |archivedate=2006-04-24 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> Alaskan Inupiat speak four distinct dialects:\n\n*'''Qawiaraq''' is spoken on the southern side of the [[Seward Peninsula]] and the [[Norton Sound]] area. In the past it was spoken in Chukotka, particularly [[Diomede Islands|Big Diomede island]], but appears to have vanished in Russian areas through assimilation into Yupik, [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] and Russian-speaking communities. It is radically different in phonology from other Inuit language variants.\n*The '''Bering Strait''' dialect of Qawiaraq, which is considered to be separate by some.{{Who|date=October 2009}}\n*'''Inupiatun''' (North Slope I\u00f1upiaq) is spoken on the [[Alaska North Slope]] and in the [[Kotzebue Sound]] area.\n*The variants of the Kotzebue Sound area and the northwest of Alaska, called '''Malimiutun''' or '''Malimiut Inupiatun'''.<ref name=\"Inupiaq\"/>\n\n===Canada===\n{{details|Inuktitut}}\n\nThe Inuit languages are an official language in the [[Northwest Territories]], and the official and dominant language of [[Nunavut]]; it enjoys a high level of official support in [[Nunavik]], a semi-autonomous portion of [[Quebec]]; and is still spoken in some parts of [[Labrador]]. Generally, Canadians refer to all dialects spoken in Canada as ''[[Inuktitut]]'', but the terms ''[[Inuvialuktun]]'', ''[[Inuinnaqtun]]'', and ''[[Inuttut]]'' (also called ''Nunatsiavummiutut'' or ''Labradorimiutut'') have some currency in referring to the variants of specific areas.\n\n===Greenland===\n{{details|Greenlandic language}}\n\n[[Greenland]] counts approximately 50,000 speakers of the Inuit languages, of whom over 90% speak west Greenlandic dialects at home.\n*'''Kalaallisut''', or in English '''[[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]]''', is the name given to the standard dialect and official language of Greenland. This standard national language has been taught to all Greenlanders since schools were established, regardless of their native dialect. It reflects almost exclusively the language of western Greenland and has borrowed a great deal of vocabulary from Danish, while Canadian and Alaskan Inuit languages have tended to take vocabulary from English or sometimes French and Russian. It is written using the Latin script. The dialect of the [[Upernavik]] area in northwest Greenland is somewhat different in phonology from the standard dialect.\n   \n*'''Tunumiit oraasiat''', the [[Tunumiit dialect]], (or '''Tunumiisut''' in Greenlandic, often '''East Greenlandic''' in other languages), is the dialect of eastern Greenland. It differs sharply from other Inuit language variants and has roughly 3000 speakers according to Ethnologue.<ref name=\"Greenlandic\">{{cite web|title=Greenlandic|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kal|website=Ethnologue}}</ref>\n*'''[[Inuktun]]''' (Or '''Avanersuarmiutut''' in Greenlandic) is the dialect of the area around [[Qaanaaq]] in northern Greenland. It is sometimes called the '''Thule''' dialect or '''North Greenlandic'''. This area is the northernmost settlement area of the Inuit and has a relatively small number of speakers. It is reputed to be fairly close to the [[North Baffin dialect]], since a group of migratory Inuit from [[Baffin Island]] settled in the area during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It counts under 1000 speakers according to Ethnologue.<ref name=\"Greenlandic\"/>\n\nGreenlandic was strongly supported by the Danish Christian mission (conducted by the Danish state church) in Greenland. Several  major dictionaries were created, beginning with Poul Egedes's Dictionarium Gr\u00f6nlandico-danico-latinum (1750) and culminating with Samuel Kleinschmidt's (1871) \"Den gr\u00f8nlandske ordbog\" (Transl. \"The Greenlandic Dictionary\") that contained a Greenlandic grammatical system that has formed the basis of modern Greenlandic grammar. Together with the fact that until 1925 Danish was not taught in the public schools, these policies had the consequence that Greenlandic has always and continues to enjoy a very strong position in Greenland, both as a spoken as well as written language.\n\n==Phonology and phonetics==\n{{Main|Inuit phonology}}\n\nEastern Canadian Inuit language variants have fifteen [[consonant]]s and three [[vowel]]s (which can be long or short).\n\nConsonants are arranged with five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], [[palatal consonant|palatal]], [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]]; and three [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]: voiceless [[stop consonant|stops]], voiced [[continuant]]s, and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], as well as two additional sounds\u2014voiceless [[Fricative consonant|fricative]]s. The Alaskan dialects have an additional manner of articulation, the ''[[retroflex consonant|retroflex]]'', which was present in proto-Inuit language. Retroflexes have disappeared in all the Canadian and Greenlandic dialects. In Natsilingmiutut, the [[voiced palatal stop]] {{IPA|/\u025f/}} derives from a former retroflex.\n\nAlmost all Inuit language variants have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels. The only exceptions are at the extreme edges of the Inuit world: parts of Greenland, and in western Alaska.\n\n==Morphology and syntax==\n{{For|a more detailed description specific to Nunavut Inuktitut|Inuit grammar}}\n\nThe Inuit language, like other Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages, has a very rich morphological system, in which a succession of different [[morpheme]]s are added to root words (like verb endings in European languages) to indicate things that, in languages like English, would require several words to express. (See also: [[Agglutinative language]] and [[Polysynthetic language]]) All Inuit language words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed. The language has hundreds of distinct suffixes, in some dialects as many as 700. Fortunately for learners, the language has a highly regular morphology. Although the rules are sometimes very complicated, they do not have exceptions in the sense that English and other [[Indo-European languages]] do.\n\nThis system makes words very long, and potentially unique. For example, in central [[Nunavut]] [[Inuktitut]]:\n\n:'''Tusaatsiarunnanngittualuujunga.'''\n:''I cannot hear very well.''\n\nThis long word is composed of a root word ''tusaa-'' \"to hear\" followed by five suffixes:\n\n:{|\n!-tsiaq-\n|\"well\"\n|-\n!-junnaq-\n|\"be able to\"\n|-\n!-nngit-\n|\"not\"\n|-\n!-tualuu-\n|\"very much\"\n|-\n!-junga\n|1st pers. singular present indicative non-specific\n|}\n\nThis sort of word construction is pervasive in the Inuit languages and makes it very unlike English. In one large Canadian corpus \u2013 the ''Nunavut [[Hansard]]'' \u2013 92% of all words appear only once, in contrast to a small percentage in most English corpora of similar size. This makes the application of [[Zipf's law]] quite difficult in the Inuit language. Furthermore, the notion of a [[part of speech]] can be somewhat complicated in the Inuit languages. Fully inflected verbs can be interpreted as nouns. The word '''ilisaijuq''' can be interpreted as a fully inflected verb: \"he studies\", but can also be interpreted as a noun: \"student\". That said, the meaning is probably obvious to a fluent speaker, when put in context.\n\nThe morphology and syntax of the Inuit languages vary to some degree between dialects, and the article ''[[Inuit grammar]]'' describes primarily central Nunavut dialects, but the basic principles will generally apply to all of them and to some degree to [[Yupik languages]] as well.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n===Toponymy and names===\nBoth the names of places and people tend to be highly prosaic when translated. ''[[Iqaluit]]'', for example, is simply the plural of the noun ''iqaluk'' \"fish\" (\"Arctic char\", \"salmon\" or \"trout\" depending on dialect<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?resultsId=1349313947885ri |title=iqaluk |work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>). ''[[Igloolik]]'' (''Iglulik'') means ''place with houses'', a word that could be interpreted as simply ''town''; ''[[Inuvik]]'' is ''place of people''; ''[[Baffin Island]]'', ''Qikiqtaaluk'' in Inuktitut, translates approximately to \"big island\".\n\nAlthough practically all Inuit have legal names based on southern naming traditions, at home and among themselves they still use native naming traditions. There too, names tend to consist of highly prosaic words. The Inuit traditionally believed that by adopting the name of a dead person or a class of things, they could take some of their characteristics or powers, and enjoy a part of their identity. (This is why they were always very willing to accept European names: they believed that this made them equal to the Europeans.){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nCommon native names in Canada include \"Ujarak\" (rock), \"Nuvuk\" (headland), \"Nasak\" (hat, or hood), \"Tupiq\" or \"Tupeq\" in Kalaallisut (tent), and \"Qajaq\" ([[kayak]]). Inuit also use animal names, traditionally believing that by using those names, they took on some of the characteristics of that animal: \"Nanuq\" or \"Nanoq\" in Kalaallisut (polar-bear), \"Uqalik\" or \"Ukaleq\" in Kalaallisut (Arctic hare), and \"Tiriaq\" or \"Teriaq\" in Kalaallisut (ermine) are favourites. In other cases, Inuit are named after dead people or people in traditional tales, by naming them after anatomical traits those people are believed to have had. Examples include \"Itigaituk\" (has no feet), \"Anana\" or \"Anaana\" (mother), \"Piujuq\" (beautiful) and \"Tulimak\" (rib). Inuit may have any number of names, given by parents and other community members.\n\n===Disc numbers and Project Surname===\nIn the 1920s, changes in lifestyle and serious epidemics like [[tuberculosis]] made the [[government of Canada]] interested in tracking the Inuit of Canada's Arctic. Traditionally Inuit names reflect what is important in Inuit culture: environment, landscape, seascape, family, animals, birds, spirits. However these traditional names were difficult for non-Inuit to parse. Also, the agglutinative nature of Inuit language meant that names seemed long and were difficult for southern bureaucrats and missionaries to pronounce.\n\nThus, in the 1940s, the Inuit were given [[disc numbers]], recorded on a special leather ID tag, like a [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tag]]. They were required to keep the tag with them always. (Some tags are now so old and worn that the number is polished out.) The numbers were assigned with a letter prefix that indicated location (E = east), community, and then the order in which the census-taker saw the individual. In some ways this state renaming was abetted by the churches and missionaries, who viewed the traditional names and their calls to power as related to [[shamanism]] and [[paganism]].\n\nThey encouraged people to take Christian names. So a young woman who was known to her relatives as \"Lutaaq, Pilitaq, Palluq, or Inusiq\" and had been baptised as \"Annie\" was under this system to become [[Ann Meekitjuk Hanson|Annie E7-121]].<ref name=\"Annie\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nunavut.com/nunavut99/english/name.html |title=What's in a name? |author=Ann Meekitjuk Hanson |publisher=nunavut.com |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> People adopted the number-names, their family members' numbers, etc., and learned all the region codes (like knowing a telephone area code).\n\nUntil Inuit began studying in the south, many did not know that numbers were not normal parts of Christian and English naming systems. Then in 1969, the government started Project Surname,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tradition-orale.ca/english/project-surname-102.html |title=Project Surname: Listening to Our Past |publisher=Francophone Association of Nunavut |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> headed by [[Abe Okpik]], to replace number-names with [[patrilineal]] \"family surnames\". But contemporary Inuit carvers and graphic artists still use their disk number<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.katilvik.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=30 |title=Glossary |publisher=katilvik.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726192723/http://www.katilvik.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5&Itemid=30 |archivedate=2008-07-26 |date=August 20, 2004 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> as their signature on their works of art.\n\n===Words for snow===\n{{details|Eskimo words for snow}}\n\nA popular belief exists that the Inuit have an unusually large number of words for [[snow]]. This is not accurate, and results from a misunderstanding of the nature of polysynthetic languages. In fact, the Inuit have only a few base roots for snow: 'qanniq-' ('qanik-' in some dialects), which is used most often like the verb ''to snow'', and 'aput', which means ''snow'' as a substance. Parts of speech work very differently in the Inuit language than in English, so these definitions are somewhat misleading.\n\nThe Inuit languages can form very long words by adding more and more descriptive affixes to words. Those affixes may modify the syntactic and semantic properties of the base word, or may add qualifiers to it in much the same way that English uses adjectives or prepositional phrases to qualify nouns (e.g. \"falling snow\", \"blowing snow\", \"snow on the ground\", \"snow drift\", etc.)\n\nThe \"fact\" that there are many Inuit words for snow has been put forward so often that it has become a journalistic clich\u00e9.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_great_Eskimo_vocabulary_hoax_and_oth.html?id=Tahaz-0F6zMC |title=The Great Eskimo Vocabulary Hoax and Other Irreverent Essays on the Study of Language |author=Geoffrey K.

The characters with the dots represent long vowels: in the Latin transcription, the vowel would be doubled.]]\nMost Inuktitut in Nunavut and Nunavik is written using a script called [[Inuktitut syllabics]], based on [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]]. The western part of Nunavut and the [[Northwest Territories]] use [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] usually identified as [[Inuinnaqtun]]. In [[Alaska]], two other Latin alphabets are used. [[Nunatsiavut]] uses an alphabet devised by German-speaking [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries, which included the letter [[Kra (letter)|''kra'']]. Greenland's Latin alphabet was originally much like the one used in Nunatsiavut, but underwent a spelling reform in 1973 to bring the orthography in line with changes in pronunciation and better reflect the phonemic inventory of the language.\n\n===Canadian syllabics===\n{{details|Inuktitut syllabics}}\n\nInuktitut syllabics, used in Canada, is based on [[Cree syllabics]], which was devised by the missionary [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] based on [[Devanagari]] a [[Brahmi script]]. The present form of Canadian Inuktitut syllabics was adopted by the [[Inuit Cultural Institute]] in Canada in the 1970s. The Inuit in Alaska, the [[Inuvialuit]], [[Inuinnaqtun]] speakers, and Inuit in [[Greenland]] and [[Labrador]] use Latin alphabets.\n\nThough presented in syllabic form, syllabics is not a true [[syllabary]], but an [[abugida]], since syllables starting with the same consonant are written with graphically similar letters.\n\nAll of the characters needed for Inuktitut syllabics are available in the [[Unicode]] character repertoire, in the blocks [[Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (Unicode block)|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Duncan Pryde]]\n* [[Inuit Sign Language]]\n* [[Yupik languages]]\n* [[Inupiaq language]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Alia, Valerie (1994) ''Names, Numbers and Northern policy: Inuit, Project Surname and the Politics of Identity''.

He states that he then left for India and arrived at the Indus river on 12 September 1333; however, although he does not specify exact dates, the description of his complex itinerary and the clues in the text to the chronology suggest that this journey to India lasted around three years.

The full title of the manuscript may be translated as ''A Gift to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling'' ({{lang|ar|\u062a\u062d\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0638\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0639\u062c\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0641\u0627\u0631}}, ''Tu\u1e25fat an-Nu\u1e93\u1e93\u0101r f\u012b Ghar\u0101\u02beib al-Am\u1e63\u0101r wa \u02bfAj\u0101\u02beib al-Asf\u0101r'').<ref name=\"M-S p. ix\"/>{{efn|Dunn gives the clunkier translation ''A Gift to the Observers Concerning the Curiosities of the Cities and the Marvels Encountered in Travels''.<ref>p. 310</ref>}} However, it is often simply referred to as ''The{{nbs}}Travels'' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0644\u0629}}, ''Rihla''),<ref name=\"9\u201310 Vol. 1\"/> in reference to a [[rihla|standard form of Arabic literature]].\n\nThere is no indication that Ibn Battuta made any notes or had any journal during his twenty-nine years of travelling.{{efn|Though he mentions being robbed of some notes<ref name=Picador>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=141}}</ref>}} When he came to dictate an account of his experiences he had to rely on memory and manuscripts produced by earlier travellers. Ibn Juzayy did not acknowledge his sources and presented some of the earlier descriptions as Ibn Battuta's own observations. When describing Damascus, Mecca, Medina and some other places in the Middle East, he clearly copied passages from the account by the [[Andalusia]]n [[Ibn Jubayr]] which had been written more than 150 years earlier.<ref>{{Harvnb |Dunn|2005|pp=313\u2013314}}; {{harvnb|Mattock|1981}}</ref> Similarly, most of Ibn Juzayy's descriptions of places in Palestine were copied from an account by the 13th-century traveller [[Mohammed al-Abdari al-Hihi|Muhammad al-Abdari]].<ref>{{Harvnb |Dunn|2005|pp=63\u201364}}; {{Harvnb|Elad|1987}}</ref>\n\n[[Oriental studies|Scholars]] do not believe that Ibn Battuta visited all the places he described and argue that in order to provide a comprehensive description of places in the Muslim world, he relied on hearsay evidence and made use of accounts by earlier travellers.

It was first defined in 1988 in the [[CCITT]] red book.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=CCITT Red Book|date=May 1986|volume= 4|issue= 3|pages = 320\u201325 | issn= 0733-8716|doi= 10.1109/JSAC.1986.1146333| title= CCITT Recommendations on the ISDN: A Review | last1 = Decina| first1= M |last2= Scace| first2= E}}</ref>  Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the [[Plain old telephone service|classic telephone system]]. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as [[Basic Rate Interface]] (BRI), [[Primary Rate Interface]] (PRI), [[Narrowband ISDN]] (N-ISDN), and [[Broadband ISDN]] (B-ISDN).\n\nISDN is a [[Circuit switching|circuit-switched]] [[telephone network]] system, which also provides access to [[packet switched network]]s, designed to allow digital transmission of voice and [[data]] over ordinary [[Twisted pair|telephone copper wires]], resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can provide. It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64 [[kilobit]]/s. In some countries, ISDN found major market application for [[Internet access]], in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128 kbit/s [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] in both upstream and downstream directions. [[Channel bonding]] can achieve a greater data rate; typically the ISDN B-channels of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded.\n\nISDN is employed as the network, data-link and physical layers in the context of the [[OSI model]]. In common use, ISDN is often limited to usage to [[Q.931]] and related protocols, which are a set of [[Signalling (telecommunications)|signaling protocol]]s establishing and breaking circuit-switched connections, and for advanced [[calling feature]]s for the user. They were introduced in 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 =Aaron |first1 =R | last2 = Wyndrum | first2 = R |title= Future trends |journal= IEEE Communications Magazine |date=March 1986 | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 38\u201343 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/35/23852/01093028.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2007 | publisher = [[AT&T Bell Laboratories]] |doi= 10.1109/MCOM.1986.1093028}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[videoconference]], ISDN provides simultaneous voice, video, and text transmission between individual desktop videoconferencing systems and group (room) videoconferencing systems.\n\n==ISDN elements==\n''Integrated services'' refers to ISDN's ability to deliver at minimum two simultaneous connections, in any combination of data, voice, [[Videotelephony|video]], and [[fax]], over a [[local loop|single line]]. Multiple devices can be attached to the line, and used as needed. That means an ISDN line can take care of most people's complete communications needs (apart from [[broadband Internet access]] and entertainment [[television]]) at a much higher transmission rate, without forcing the purchase of multiple analog phone lines. It also refers to integrated switching and transmission<ref>{{Cite journal |title= Pragmatic Introduction of Digital Switching and Transmission in Existing Networks | first1= G | last1 = Robin | first2= S | last2 = Treves |journal= IEEE Transactions on Communications |date= July 1979 |volume=27 |doi=10.1109/TCOM.1979.1094494 |issue= 7 |page = 1071}}</ref> in that [[telephone switch]]ing and [[carrier wave]] transmission are integrated rather than separate as in earlier technology.\n\n==Basic Rate Interface==\n{{Main article |Basic Rate Interface}}\nThe entry level interface to ISDN is the Basic Rate Interface (BRI), a 128 [[kilobits per second|kbit/s]] service delivered over a pair of standard telephone copper wires.<ref name=\"Talkers 2013-03-28\"/> The 144 kbit/s payload rate is broken down into two 64 kbit/s [[bearer channel]]s ('B' channels) and one 16 kbit/s signaling channel ('D' channel or data channel). This is sometimes referred to as 2B+D.<ref name=\"SW Bell ISDN\">{{cite web|title=What is ISDN?|url=http://public.swbell.net/ISDN/overview.html|publisher=Southwestern Bell|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe interface specifies the following network interfaces:\n* The ''[[U interface]]'' is a two-wire interface between the exchange and a ''network terminating unit'', which is usually the [[demarcation point]] in non-North American networks.\n* The ''[[T interface]]'' is a serial interface between a computing device and a ''[[terminal adapter]]'', which is the digital equivalent of a modem.\n* The ''[[S interface]]'' is a four-wire bus that ISDN consumer devices plug into; the S & T reference points are commonly implemented as a single interface labeled 'S/T' on a [[Network termination 1]] (NT1).\n* The ''[[R interface]]'' defines the point between a non-ISDN device and a terminal adapter (TA) which provides translation to and from such a device.\n\nBRI-ISDN is very popular in Europe but is much less common in North America. It is also common in Japan&nbsp;\u2014 where it is known as INS64.<ref name=\"Wisegeek BRI\">{{cite web|title=What Is Basic Rate Interface?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-basic-rate-interface.htm|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"ISDN SwitchType\">{{cite web|title=ISDN\\SwitchType|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff541725%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=April 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Primary Rate Interface==\n{{Main article|Primary Rate Interface}}\nThe other ISDN access available is the Primary Rate Interface (PRI), which is carried over an [[E-carrier|E1]] (2048 kbit/s) in most parts of the world. An E1 is 30 'B' channels of 64 kbit/s, one 'D' channel of 64 kbit/s and a timing and alarm channel of 64 kbit/s. This is often referred to as 30B+2D.<ref>{{cite book | first = John C. | last = Bellamy | title = Digital Telephony | edition = 3 | publisher = Wiley Interscience | date = 2000 | isbn = 0-471-34571-7| page = 496}}</ref>\n \nIn North America PRI service is delivered on one or more [[T-carrier|T1 carriers]] (often referred to as 23B+D) of 1544 kbit/s (24 channels). A PRI has 23 'B' channels and 1 'D' channel for signalling (Japan uses a circuit called a J1, which is similar to a T1). Inter-changeably but incorrectly, a PRI is referred to as T1 because it uses the T1 carrier format. A true T1 (commonly called \"Analog T1\" to avoid confusion) uses 24 channels of 64 kbit/s of [[in-band signaling]]. Each channel uses 56 kb for data and voice and 8 kb for signaling and messaging. PRI uses out of band signaling which provides the 23 B channels with clear 64 kb for voice and data and one 64 kb 'D' channel for signaling and messaging. In North America, [[Non-Facility Associated Signalling]] allows two or more PRIs to be controlled by a single [[D channel]], and is sometimes called \"23B+D + n*24B\". D-channel backup allows for a second D channel in case the primary fails. NFAS is commonly used on a [[Digital Signal 3|T3]].\n\nPRI-ISDN is popular throughout the world, especially for connecting [[private branch exchange]]s to [[PSTN|the public network]].\n\nEven though many network professionals use the term \"ISDN\" to refer to the lower-bandwidth BRI circuit, in North America BRI is relatively uncommon whilst PRI circuits serving PBXs are commonplace.\n\n==Bearer channel==\nThe bearer channel (B) is a standard 64 kbit/s voice channel of 8 bits sampled at 8&nbsp;kHz with [[G.711]] encoding. B-channels can also be used to carry data, since they are nothing more than digital channels.\n\nEach one of these channels is known as a [[DS0]].\n\nMost B channels can carry a 64{{nbsp}}kbit/s signal, but some were limited to 56K because they traveled over [[robbed-bit signaling|RBS]] lines. This was commonplace in the 20th century, but has since become less so.\n\n==Signaling channel==\nThe signaling channel (D) uses [[Q.931]] for [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] with the other side of the link.\n\n==X.25==\n[[X.25]] can be carried over the B or D channels of a BRI line, and over the B channels of a PRI line. X.25 over the D channel is used at many point-of-sale (credit card) terminals because it eliminates the modem setup, and because it connects to the central system over a B channel, thereby eliminating the need for modems and making much better use of the central system's telephone lines.\n\n[[X.25]] was also part of an ISDN protocol called \"Always On/Dynamic ISDN\", or AO/DI. This allowed a user to have a constant multi-link PPP connection to the internet over X.25 on the D channel, and brought up one or two B channels as needed.\n\n==Frame Relay==\nIn theory, [[Frame Relay]] can operate over the D channel of BRIs and PRIs, but it is seldom, if ever, used.\n\n==Consumer and industry perspectives==\nThere is a second viewpoint: that of the telephone industry, where ISDN is a core technology. A [[telephone network]] can be thought of as a collection of wires strung between switching systems. The common electrical specification for the signals on these wires is [[Digital Signal 1|T1]] or [[E-carrier|E1]]. Between telephone company switches, the signaling is performed via [[Signaling System No 7|SS7]]. Normally, a PBX is connected via a T1 with [[robbed bit signaling]] to indicate on-hook or off-hook conditions and [[Multi-frequency|MF]] and [[Dual-tone multi-frequency|DTMF]] tones to encode the destination number. ISDN is much better because messages can be sent much more quickly than by trying to [[encoder|encode]] numbers as long (100 [[Millisecond|ms]] per digit) tone sequences. This results in faster call setup times. Also, a greater number of features are available and fraud is reduced.\n\nISDN is also used as a smart-network technology intended to add new services to the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) by giving users direct access to end-to-end circuit-switched digital services and as a backup or failsafe circuit solution for critical use data circuits.\n\n===ISDN and broadcast industry===\nISDN is used heavily by the broadcast industry as a reliable way of switching low-latency, high-quality, long-distance audio circuits. In conjunction with an appropriate [[codec]] using MPEG or various manufacturers' proprietary algorithms, an ISDN BRI can be used to send stereo bi-directional audio coded at 128 kbit/s with 20&nbsp;Hz&nbsp;\u2013 20&nbsp;kHz audio bandwidth, although commonly the [[G.722]] algorithm is used with a single 64 kbit/s B channel to send much lower latency mono audio at the expense of audio quality. Where very high quality audio is required multiple ISDN BRIs can be used in parallel to provide a higher bandwidth circuit switched connection. [[BBC Radio 3]] commonly makes use of three ISDN BRIs to carry 320 kbit/s audio stream for live outside broadcasts. ISDN BRI services are used to link remote studios, sports grounds and [[Remote broadcast|outside broadcasts]] into the main [[Recording studio|broadcast studio]]. ISDN via satellite is used by field reporters around the world. It is also common to use ISDN for the return audio links to remote satellite broadcast vehicles.\n\nIn many countries, such as the UK and Australia, ISDN has displaced the older technology of equalised analogue landlines, with these circuits being phased out by telecommunications providers.

Its only remaining advantage is that, while ADSL has a functional distance limitation and can use [[ADSL loop extender]]s, BRI has a greater limit and can use repeaters. As such, BRI may be acceptable for customers who are too remote for ADSL. Widespread use of BRI is further stymied by some small North American [[Competitive local exchange carrier|CLEC]]s such as [[CenturyTel]] having given up on it and not providing Internet access using it.<ref>{{Citation | publisher = CenturyTel | title = Internet Access service offerings | quote = You may not obtain Internet services over ISDN lines (BRI or PRI), dedicated circuits or special service circuits | contribution = Disclaimer | url = http://www.centurytel.com/Pages/Disclaimers/internetDisclaimer.jsp}}.</ref> However, AT&T in most states (especially the former SBC/SWB territory) will still install an ISDN BRI line anywhere a normal analog line can be placed and the monthly charge is roughly $55.\n\nISDN-BRI is currently primarily used in industries with specialized and very specific needs.

This is very expensive, and is being replaced by IP-based conferencing, but where cost concern is less of an issue than predictable quality and where a [[Quality of service|QoS]]-enabled IP does not exist, BRI is the preferred choice.\n\nMost modern non-[[VoIP]] PBXs use ISDN-PRI circuits. These are connected via [[T-carrier|T1 lines]] with the central office switch, replacing older analog two-way and [[direct inward dialing]] (DID) trunks. PRI is capable of delivering [[Calling Line Identification]] (CLID) in both directions so that the telephone number of an extension, rather than a company's main number, can be sent. It is still commonly used in [[recording studio]]s, when a [[voice-over]] actor is in one studio (possibly [[telecommuting]] from home), but the director and producer are in a studio at another location.<ref name=\"Talkers 2013-03-28\"/> The ISDN protocol delivers channelized, not-over-the-Internet service, powerful call setup and routing features, faster setup and tear down, superior audio fidelity as compared to [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] (plain old telephone service), lower delay and, at higher densities, lower cost.\n\nIn 2013, [[Verizon]] announced it would no longer take orders for ISDN service in the [[Northeastern United States]].<ref name=\"Talkers 2013-03-28\">{{cite web|title=Verizon: No Longer Taking Orders for ISDN Service in Northeast Starting May 18|url=http://www.talkers.com/2013/03/28/verizon-no-longer-taking-orders-for-isdn-service-in-northeast-starting-may-18/|work=Talkers|accessdate=April 6, 2013|date=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Australia ====\n[[Telstra]] provides the business customer with the ISDN services.

Until April 2006, they also offered services named [[BT Highway|Home Highway and Business Highway]], which were BRI ISDN-based services that offered integrated analogue connectivity as well as ISDN. Later versions of the Highway products also included built-in [[universal serial bus|USB]] sockets for direct computer access. Home Highway was bought by many home users, usually for Internet connection, although not as fast as ADSL, because it was available before ADSL and in places where ADSL does not reach.\n\nIn early 2015, BT announced their intention to retire the UK's ISDN infrastructure by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|title=BT Group plc Q3 2014/15 Results|url=https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1051301|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n====France====\n[[France Telecom]] offers ISDN services under their product name Numeris (2 B+D), of which a professional Duo and home Itoo version is available. ISDN is generally known as RNIS in France and has widespread availability. The introduction of ADSL is reducing ISDN use{{when|date=April 2013}} for data transfer and Internet access, although it is still common in more rural and outlying areas, and for applications such as [[Private branch exchange|business voice]] and [[Point of sale|point-of-sale terminals]].\n\n====Germany====\n[[File:DBP 1988 1368 ISDN.jpg|thumb|German stamp]]\nIn [[Germany]], ISDN was very popular with an installed base of 25 million channels (29% of all subscriber lines in Germany as of 2003 and 20% of all ISDN channels worldwide). Due to the success of ISDN, the number of installed analog lines was decreasing. [[Deutsche Telekom]] (DTAG) offered both BRI and PRI. Competing phone companies often offered ISDN only and no analog lines. However, these operators generally offered free hardware that also allows the use of POTS equipment, such as NTBAs{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | \"Network Termination for ISDN Basic Access\", little boxes that bridge the two-wire UK0 line to the four-wire S0 bus.<ref>{{Citation | title = Wikipedia | contribution = [[:de:Network Termination for ISDN Basic rate Access|Network Termination for ISDN Basic rate Access]] | language = German | publisher = Wikimedia}}.</ref>}} with integrated [[terminal adapter]]s. Because of the widespread availability of ADSL services, ISDN was primarily used for voice and fax traffic.\n\nUntil 2007 ISDN (BRI) and [[ADSL]]/[[VDSL]] were often bundled on the same line, mainly because the combination of ADSL with an analog line had no cost advantage over a combined ISDN-ADSL line. This advantage diminished when vendors of ISDN technology stopped manufacturing it and spare parts became hard to come by. Since then phone companies started introducing cheaper ADSL-only products using [[VoIP]] for telephony.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Neuhetzki|first1=Thorsten|title=Arcor will ab Sommer Fernsehen per Internet anbieten|url=http://www.teltarif.de/arch/2007/kw04/s24629.html|website=teltarif.de|accessdate=7 May 2016|date=24 Jan 2007|quote=Arcor setzt im Endkundenbereich auf NGN}}</ref>\n\nSince the introduction of [[VDSL2]] using outdoor [[MSAN]]s, ISDN has become obsolete.

''B channels'' are used for data (which may include voice), and ''D channels'' are intended for signaling and control (but can also be used for data).\n\nThere are two ISDN implementations. Basic Rate Interface (BRI), also called basic rate access (BRA)&nbsp;\u2014 consists of two B channels, each with bandwidth of 64 [[kbit/s]], and one D channel with a bandwidth of 16 kbit/s. Together these three channels can be designated as 2B+D. Primary Rate Interface (PRI), also called primary rate access (PRA) in Europe&nbsp;\u2014 contains a greater number of B channels and a D channel with a bandwidth of 64 kbit/s. The number of B channels for PRI varies according to the nation: in North America and Japan it is 23B+1D, with an aggregate bit rate of 1.544 [[Mbit/s]] ([[Digital Signal 1|T1]]); in Europe, India and Australia it is 30B+2D, with an aggregate bit rate of 2.048 Mbit/s ([[E-carrier|E1]]). [[Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network]] (BISDN) is another ISDN implementation and it is able to manage different types of services at the same time. It is primarily used within [[network backbone]]s and employs [[asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]].\n\nAnother alternative ISDN configuration can be used in which the B channels of an ISDN BRI line are [[Channel bonding|bonded]] to provide a total duplex bandwidth of 128 kbit/s. This precludes use of the line for voice calls while the internet connection is in use. The B channels of several BRIs can be bonded, a typical use is a 384K videoconferencing channel.\n\nUsing [[B8ZS|bipolar with eight-zero substitution]] encoding technique, call data is transmitted over the data (B) channels, with the signaling (D) channels used for call setup and management. Once a call is set up, there is a simple 64 kbit/s synchronous bidirectional data channel (actually implemented as two simplex channels, one in each direction) between the end parties, lasting until the call is terminated. There can be as many calls as there are bearer channels, to the same or different end-points. Bearer channels may also be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] into what may be considered single, higher-bandwidth channels via a process called B channel BONDING, or via use of Multi-Link PPP \"bundling\" or by using an H0, H11, or H12 channel on a PRI.\n\nThe D channel can also be used for sending and receiving [[X.25]] data packets, and connection to X.25 packet network, this is specified in [[X.31]]. In practice, X.31 was only commercially implemented in the UK, France, Japan and Germany.\n\n==Reference points==\nA set of ''reference points'' are defined in the [[ISDN]] [[International standard|standard]] to refer to certain points between the [[Telephone company|telco]] and the end user ISDN equipment.\n*[[R interface|R]]&nbsp;\u2013 defines the point between a non-ISDN terminal equipment 2 (TE2) device and a ''[[terminal adapter]]'' (TA) which provides translation to and from such a device\n*[[S interface|S]]&nbsp;\u2013 defines the point between the ISDN terminal equipment 1 (TE1) or TA and a ''Network Termination Type 2'' ([[Network termination 2|NT2]]) device\n*[[T-interface|T]]&nbsp;\u2013 defines the point between the NT2 and [[network termination 1]] (NT1) devices.\n\nMost NT-1 devices can perform the functions of the NT2 as well, and so the S and T reference points are generally collapsed into the S/T reference point.\n\nIn North America, the NT1 device is considered [[customer premises equipment]] (CPE) and must be maintained by the customer, thus, the U interface is provided to the customer. In other locations, the NT1 device is maintained by the telco, and the S/T interface is provided to the customer. In India, service providers provide U interface and an NT1 may be supplied by Service provider as part of service offering.\n\n==Types of communications==\nAmong the kinds of data that can be moved over the 64 kbit/s channels are [[Pulse code modulation|pulse-code modulated]] voice calls, providing access to the traditional voice [[PSTN]]. This information can be passed between the network and the user end-point at call set-up time. In North America, ISDN is now used mostly as an alternative to analog connections, most commonly for Internet access. Some of the services envisioned as being delivered over ISDN are now delivered over the Internet instead. In Europe, and in Germany in particular, ISDN has been successfully marketed as a phone with features, as opposed to a POTS phone with few or no features. Meanwhile, features that were first available with ISDN (such as [[Three-Way Calling]], [[Call Forwarding]], [[Caller ID]], etc.) are now commonly available for ordinary analog phones as well, eliminating this advantage of ISDN. Another advantage of ISDN was the possibility of multiple simultaneous calls (one call per B channel), e.g. for big families, but with the increased popularity and reduced prices of mobile telephony this has become less interesting as well, making ISDN unappealing to the private customer. However, ISDN is typically more reliable than POTS, and has a significantly faster call setup time compared with POTS, and IP connections over ISDN typically have some 30\u201335ms round trip time, as opposed to 120\u2013180ms (both measured with otherwise unused lines) over 56k or V.34/V.92 modems, making ISDN more reliable and more efficient for telecommuters.\n\nWhere an analog connection requires a [[modem]], an ISDN connection requires a [[terminal adapter]] (TA). The function of an ISDN terminal adapter is often delivered in the form of a PC card with an S/T interface, and single-chip solutions seem to exist, considering the plethora of combined ISDN- and [[ADSL]]-[[Router (computing)|router]]s.\n\nISDN is commonly used in [[radio broadcasting]]. Since ISDN provides a high quality connection this assists in delivering good quality audio for transmission in radio. Most radio studios are equipped with ISDN lines as their main form of communication with other studios or standard phone lines. Equipment made by companies such as Telos/Omnia (the popular Zephyr codec), Comrex, Tieline and others are used regularly by radio broadcasters. Almost all live sports broadcasts on radio are backhauled to their main studios via ISDN connections.\n\n==Sample call==\nThe following is an example of a Primary Rate (PRI) ISDN call showing the [[Q.921]]/[[Link Access Procedures, D channel|LAPD]] and the [[Q.931]]/Network message intermixed (i.e. exactly what was exchanged on the D-channel). The call is originating from the switch where the trace was taken and goes out to some other switch, possibly an end-office '''[[Local exchange carrier|LEC]]''', who terminates the call.\n\nThe first line format is &lt;time&gt; &lt;D-channel&gt; &lt;Transmitted/Received&gt; &lt;LAPD/ISDN message ID&gt;. If the message is an ISDN level message, then a decoding of the message is attempted showing the various Information Elements that make up the message. All ISDN messages are tagged with an ID number relative to the switch that started the call (local/remote).

It is an epigenetic process that involves [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone methylation]] without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established (\"imprinted\") in the [[germline]] (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell divisions in the [[somatic cell]]s of an organism.<ref name=\"Wood and Oakey 2006\" />\n\nAppropriate imprinting of certain genes is important for normal development. Human diseases involving genomic imprinting include [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader\u2013Willi syndrome]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn [[ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] organisms (like humans), the somatic cells possess two copies of the [[genome]], one inherited from the father and one from the mother. Each [[autosomal]] gene is therefore represented by two copies, or alleles, with one copy inherited from each parent at [[fertilisation|fertilization]]. For the vast majority of autosomal genes, expression occurs from both alleles simultaneously. In mammals, however, a small proportion (<1%) of genes are imprinted, meaning that gene expression occurs from only one allele <ref name=\"Wilkinson 2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilkinson LS, Davies W, Isles AR | title = Genomic imprinting effects on brain development and function | journal = Nature Reviews.

However, in 2004, experimental manipulation by Japanese researchers of a paternal methylation imprint controlling the ''[[Insulin-like growth factor 2|Igf2]]'' gene led to the birth of a mouse (named [[Kaguya (mouse)|Kaguya]]) with two maternal sets of chromosomes, though it is not a true parthenogenone since cells from two different female mice were used.

It must be possible to erase and re-establish imprints through each generation so that genes that are imprinted in an adult may still be expressed in that adult's offspring. (For example, the maternal genes that control insulin production will be imprinted in a male but will be expressed in any of the male's offspring that inherit these genes.) The nature of imprinting must therefore be [[epigenetic]] rather than DNA sequence dependent. In [[germline]] cells the imprint is erased and then re-established according to the [[sex]] of the individual, i.e. in the developing sperm (during [[spermatogenesis]]), a paternal imprint is established, whereas in developing oocytes ([[oogenesis]]), a maternal imprint is established.

In both plants and mammals there are two major mechanisms that are involved in establishing the imprint; these are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone]] modifications.\n\nRecently, a new study<ref name=\"Court and Tayama 2014\" /> has suggested a novel inheritable imprinting mechanism in humans that would be specific of [[placenta]]l tissue and that is independent of DNA methylation (the main and classical mechanism for genomic imprinting). Among the hypothetical explanations for this exclusively human phenomenon, two possible mechanisms have been proposed: either a histone modification that confers imprinting at novel placental-specific imprinted ''loci'' or, alternatively, a recruitment of [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMTs]] to these loci by a specific and unknown [[transcription factor]] that would be expressed during early trophoblast differentiation.\n\n===Regulation===\nThe grouping of imprinted genes within clusters allows them to share common regulatory elements, such as non-coding [[RNA]]s and [[differentially methylated regions (DMRs)]]. When these regulatory elements control the imprinting of one or more genes, they are known as imprinting control regions (ICR). The expression of [[non-coding RNA]]s, such as ''Air'' on mouse chromosome 17 and [[KCNQ1OT1]] on human chromosome 11p15.5, have been shown to be essential for the imprinting of genes in their corresponding regions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancini-Dinardo D, Steele SJ, Levorse JM, Ingram RS, Tilghman SM | title = Elongation of the Kcnq1ot1 transcript is required for genomic imprinting of neighboring genes | journal = Genes & Development | volume = 20 | issue = 10 | pages = 1268\u201382 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16702402 | pmc = 1472902 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1416906 }}</ref>\n\nDifferentially methylated regions are generally segments of DNA rich in [[cytosine]] and [[guanine]] nucleotides, with the cytosine nucleotides methylated on one copy but not on the other.

ICANN has been the subject of criticism as a result of its handling of RegisterFly, and the harm caused to thousands of clients as a result of what has been termed ICANN's \"laissez faire attitude toward customer allegations of fraud\".<ref name=\"TheRegisterICANNCriticism1\"/>\n\nOn May 23, 2008, ICANN issued enforcement notices against ten accredited registrars and announced this through a press release entitled \"'Worst Spam Offenders' Notified by ICANN, Compliance system working to correct Whois and other issues.\"<ref name=\"icann1\"/> This was largely in response to a report issued by [[KnujOn]], called \"The 10 Worst Registrars\" in terms of spam advertised junk product sites and compliance failure.<ref name=\"knujon\"/> The mention of the word \"[[Spam (electronic)|spam]]\" in the title of the ICANN memo is somewhat misleading since ICANN does not address issues of spam or email abuse. Website content and usage are not within ICANN's mandate. However, the KnujOn report details how various registrars have not complied with their contractual obligations under the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA).<ref name=\"icann2\"/> The main point of the KnujOn research was to demonstrate the relationships between compliance failure, illicit product traffic, and spam. The report demonstrated that out of 900 ICANN accredited registrars, fewer than 20 held 90% of the web domains advertised in spam. These same registrars were also most frequently cited by KnujOn as failing to resolve complaints made through the Whois Data Problem Reporting System (WDPRS).\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the ICANN Board started a [[.events|new process of TLD naming policy]] to take a \"significant step forward on the introduction of new generic top-level domains.\" This program envisions the availability of many new or already proposed domains, as well a new application and implementation process.<ref name=\"32nd International Public ICANN Meeting\"/>\n\nOn October 1, 2008, ICANN issued breach notices against Joker and Beijing Innovative Linkage Technology Ltd.<ref name=\"icann3\"/> after further researching reports and complaints issued by KnujOn. These notices gave the registrars 15 days to fix their Whois investigation efforts.\n\nIn 2010, ICANN approved a major review of its policies with respect to [[accountability]], transparency, and public participation by the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=\"icann4\"/> This external review was an assistance of the work of ICANN's Accountability and Transparency Review team.<ref name=\"icann5\"/>\n\nOn February 3, 2011, ICANN announced that it had distributed the last batch of its remaining IPv4 addresses to the world's five Regional Internet Registries, the organizations that manage IP addresses in different regions.

As a result, the At-Large constituency and direct election of board members by the global Internet community were soon abandoned.<ref name=\"participation\"/>\n\nICANN [[List of ICANN meetings|holds periodic public meetings]] rotated between continents for the purpose of encouraging global participation in its processes. Resolutions of the ICANN Board, preliminary reports, and minutes of the meetings, are published on the ICANN website, sometimes in real time. However, there are criticisms from ICANN constituencies including the Noncommercial Users Constituency (NCUC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gnso.icann.org/about/stakeholders-constituencies/ncsg/ncuc|title=Non-Commercial Users \u2013 Generic Names Supporting Organization|website=gnso.icann.org}}</ref> and the [[At-Large Advisory Committee]] (ALAC) that there is not enough [[Freedom of information legislation|public disclosure]] and that too many discussions and decisions take place out of sight of the public.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nDuring the early 2000s, there had been speculation that the United Nations might assume control of ICANN,<ref name=\"U.N. Summit to Focus on Internet\"/> followed by a negative reaction from the U.S. government<ref name=\"2005-07-us\"/> and worries about a division of the Internet.<ref name=\"Power grab could split the net\"/> The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] in Tunisia during November 2005 agreed not to get involved in the day-to-day and technical operations of ICANN. However it also agreed to establish an international [[Internet Governance Forum]], with a consultative role on the future governance of the Internet. ICANN's Government Advisory Committee is currently established to provide advice to ICANN regarding public policy issues and has participation by many of the world's governments.<ref name=\"icann_gac\"/>\n\nSome have attempted to argue that ICANN was never given the authority to decide policy, e.g., choose new TLDs or exclude other interested parties who refuse to pay ICANN's US$185,000 fee, but was to be a technical caretaker. Critics{{who|date=February 2011}} suggest that ICANN should not be allowed to impose business rules on market participants, and that all TLDs should be added on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis and the market should be the arbiter of who succeeds and who does not.{{citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Activities==\n\n===Uniform Domain-Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP)===\nOne task that ICANN was asked to do was to address the issue of domain name ownership resolution for [[generic top-level domain]]s (gTLDs). ICANN's attempt at such a policy was drafted in close cooperation with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), and the result has now become known as the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP). This policy essentially attempts to provide a mechanism for rapid, cheap and reasonable resolution of domain name conflicts, avoiding the traditional court system for disputes by allowing cases to be brought to one of a set of bodies that arbitrate domain name disputes. According to ICANN policy, a domain registrant must agree to be bound by the UDRP\u2014they cannot get a domain name without agreeing to this.\n\nExamination of the UDRP decision patterns has caused some<ref name=\"vjolt\"/> to conclude that compulsory domain name arbitration is less likely to give a fair hearing to domain name owners asserting defenses under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and other laws, compared to the federal courts of appeal in particular.\n\n===Proposed elimination of public DNS whois===\nIn 2013, the initial report of ICANN's Expert Working Group has recommended that the present form of [[Whois]], a utility that allows anyone to know who has registered a domain name on the Internet, should be \"abandoned\". It recommends it be replaced with a system that keeps most registration information secret (or \"gated\") from most Internet users, and only discloses information for \"permissible purposes\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Initial Report from the Expert Working Group on gTLD Directory Services: A Next Generation Registration Directory Service|url=https://www.icann.org/en/groups/other/gtld-directory-services/initial-report-24jun13-en.pdf|publisher=ICANN Expert Working Group|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin|title=Whois \"killer\" is a recipe for a clusterfuck|url=http://domainincite.com/16855-whois-killer-is-a-recipe-for-a-clusterfuck|accessdate=June 21, 2014|publisher=Domain Incite|date=June 13, 2014}}</ref> ICANN's list of permissible purposes includes domain name research, domain name sale and purchase, regulatory enforcement, personal data protection, legal actions, and abuse mitigation.<ref>[http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ Intellectual Property Solutions & Legal Support Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054828/http://www.cpaglobal.com/newlegalreview/5558/icann_earmarks_domains_record_ |date=September 21, 2013 }}.

A mathematically rigorous convergence analysis of an iterative method is usually performed; however, [[heuristic]]-based iterative methods are also common. \n\nIn contrast, '''direct methods''' attempt to solve the problem by a finite  sequence of operations. In the absence of [[rounding error]]s, direct methods would deliver an exact solution (like solving a linear system of equations <math>A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}</math> by [[Gaussian elimination]]). Iterative methods are often the only choice for [[nonlinear equation]]s. However, iterative methods are often useful even for linear problems involving a large number of variables (sometimes of the order of millions), where direct methods would be prohibitively expensive (and in some cases impossible) even with the best available computing power.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jcp.2015.09.040|title=Recycling Krylov subspaces for CFD applications and a new hybrid recycling solver|year=2015|last1=Amritkar|first1=Amit|last2=de Sturler|first2=Eric|last3=\u015awirydowicz|first3=Katarzyna|last4=Tafti|first4=Danesh|last5=Ahuja|first5=Kapil|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=303|page=222|arxiv=1501.03358|bibcode=2015JCoPh.303..222A}}</ref>\n\n==Attractive fixed points==\nIf an equation can be put into the form ''f''(''x'') = ''x'', and a solution '''x''' is an attractive [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the function ''f'', then one may begin with a point ''x''<sub>1</sub> in the [[basin of attraction]] of '''x''', and let ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''f''(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) for ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1, and the sequence {''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1</sub> will converge to the solution '''x'''. Here ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is the ''n''th approximation or iteration of ''x'' and ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> is the next or ''n'' + 1 iteration of ''x''.  Alternately, superscripts in parentheses are often used in numerical methods, so as not to interfere with subscripts with other meanings.  (For example, ''x''<sup>(''n''+1)</sup> = ''f''(''x''<sup>(''n'')</sup>).) If the function ''f'' is [[continuously differentiable]], a sufficient condition for convergence is that the [[spectral radius]] of the derivative is strictly bounded by one in a neighborhood of the fixed point.  If this condition holds at the fixed point, then a sufficiently small neighborhood (basin of attraction) must exist.\n\n==Linear systems==\nIn the case of a [[system of linear equations]], the two main classes of iterative methods are the '''stationary iterative methods''', and the more general [[Krylov subspace]] methods.\n\n===Stationary iterative methods===\n==== Introduction ====\nStationary iterative methods solve a linear system with an [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]] approximating the original one; and based on a measurement of the error in the result ([[Residual (numerical analysis)|the residual]]), form a \"correction equation\" for which this process is repeated. While these methods are simple to derive, implement, and analyze, convergence is only guaranteed for a limited class of matrices. \n\n====Definition====\nAn ''iterative method'' is defined by\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{x}^{k+1} := \\Psi (  \\mathbf{x}^k ) \\,, \\quad k\\geq0\n</math>\nand for a given linear system <math> A\\mathbf x= \\mathbf b </math> with exact solution <math> \\mathbf{x}^* </math> the ''error'' by\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{e}^k := \\mathbf{x}^k - \\mathbf{x}^* \\,, \\quad k\\geq0\\,.\n</math>\nAn iterative method is called ''linear'' if there exists a matrix <math> C \\in \\R^{n\\times x} </math> s.t.\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{e}^{k+1} = C  \\mathbf{e}^k   \\quad \\forall \\, k\\geq0\n</math>\nand this matrix is called ''iteration matrix''.\nAn iterative method with a given iteration matrix <math> C </math> is called ''convergent'' if the following holds\n:<math>\n  \\lim_{k\\rightarrow \\infty} C^k=0\\,.\n</math>\n\nAn important theorem states that for a given iterative method and its iteration matrix <math> C </math> it is convergent if and only if its [[spectral radius]] <math> \\rho(C) </math>  is smaller than unity, i.e.\n:<math>\n  \\rho(C) < 1 \\,.\n</math>\n\nThe basic iterative methods work by a splitting up the matrix <math> A </math> into\n:<math>\n  A = M - N\n</math>\nand here the matrix <math> M </math> should be easily [[Invertible matrix|invertible]].\nThe iterative methods are now defined as\n:<math>\n  M \\mathbf{x}^{k+1} = N \\mathbf{x}^k + b \\,, \\quad k\\geq0\\,.\n</math>\nFrom this follows that the iteration matrix is given by\n:<math>\n  C = I - M^{-1}A = M^{-1}N\\,.\n</math>\n\n====Examples====\n\nBasic examples of stationary iterative methods use a splitting of the matrix <math> A </math> such as\n:<math>\n  A = D-L-U\\,,\\quad D := \\text{diag}( (a_{ii})_i)\n</math>\nwhere <math> D </math> is only the diagonal part of <math> A </math>, and <math> L </math> is the strict lower [[Triangular_matrix|triangular part]] of <math> A </math>.\nRespectively, <math> U </math> is the upper triangular part of <math> A </math>.\n* [[Modified Richardson iteration|Richardson method]]: <math> M:=\\frac{1}{\\omega} I \\quad (\\omega \\neq 0) </math>\n* [[Jacobi method]]: <math> M:=D </math>\n* [[Jacobi_method#Weighted_Jacobi_method|Damped Jacobi method]]: <math> M:=\\frac{1}{\\omega}D \\quad (\\omega \\neq 0) </math>\n* [[Gauss\u2013Seidel method]]: <math> M:=D-L </math>\n* [[Successive over-relaxation|Successive over-relaxation method]] (SOR): <math> M:=\\frac{1}{\\omega}D-L \\quad (\\omega \\neq 0) </math>\n* [[Symmetric successive over-relaxation]] (SSOR): <math> M := \\frac{1}{\\omega (2-\\omega)} (D-\\omega L) D^{-1} (D-\\omega U) \n\\quad (\\omega \\neq \\{0,2\\}) </math>\nLinear stationary iterative methods are also called [[Relaxation (iterative method)|relaxation methods]].\n\n===Krylov subspace methods===\n[[Krylov subspace]] methods work by forming a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the sequence of successive matrix powers times the initial residual (the '''Krylov sequence'''). \nThe approximations to the solution are then formed by minimizing the residual over the subspace formed. \nThe prototypical method in this class is the [[conjugate gradient method]] (CG) which assumes that the system matrix <math> A </math> is [[Symmetric_matrix|symmetric]] [[Positive-definite_matrix|positive-definite]].\nFor symmetric (and possibly indefinite) <math> A </math> one works with the [[minimal residual method]] (MINRES).\nIn the case of not even symmetric matrices methods, such as the [[generalized minimal residual method]] (GMRES) and the [[biconjugate gradient method]] (BiCG), have been derived.\n\n===Convergence of Krylov subspace methods===\nSince these methods form a basis, it is evident that the method converges in ''N'' iterations, where ''N'' is the system size. However, in the presence of rounding errors this statement does not hold; moreover, in practice ''N'' can be very large, and the iterative process reaches sufficient accuracy already far earlier. The analysis of these methods is hard, depending on a complicated function of the [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of the operator.\n\n===Preconditioners===\nThe approximating operator that appears in stationary iterative methods can also be incorporated in [[Krylov subspace methods]] such as [[GMRES]] (alternatively, [[preconditioning|preconditioned]] Krylov methods can be considered as accelerations of stationary iterative methods), where they become transformations of the original operator to a presumably better conditioned one. The construction of preconditioners is a large research area.\n\n===History===\nProbably the first iterative method for solving a linear system appeared in a letter of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] to a student of his.  He proposed solving a 4-by-4 system of equations by repeatedly solving the component in which the residual was the largest. \n\nThe theory of stationary iterative methods was solidly established with the work of [[D.M. Young]] starting in the 1950s. The Conjugate Gradient method was also invented in the 1950s, with independent developments by [[Cornelius Lanczos]], [[Magnus Hestenes]] and [[Eduard Stiefel]], but its nature and applicability were misunderstood at the time. Only in the 1970s was it realized that conjugacy based methods work very well for [[partial differential equation]]s, especially the elliptic type.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Matrix splitting]]\n* [[Non-linear least squares]]\n* [[Root-finding algorithm]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Iterative methods}}\n*[http://www.netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/Templates.html Templates for the Solution of Linear Systems]\n*[http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/books.html Y.

An international agreement to create it, the ''Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court'', was made at the [[Second Hague Conference]] in 1907 but never came into force.\n\nThe capturing of  [[Prize (law)|prizes]] (enemy equipment, vehicles, and especially ships) during wartime is a tradition that goes back as far as organized warfare itself. The International Prize Court was to hear [[appellate court|appeals]] from national courts concerning prize cases. Even as a draft, the convention was innovative for the time, in being both the first ever treaty for a truly international court (as opposed to a mere [[arbitral tribunal]]), and in providing individuals with [[locus standi|access to the court]], going against the prevailing doctrines of [[international law]] at the time, according to which only states had rights and duties under international law. The Convention was opposed, particularly by elements within the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], as a violation of [[national sovereignty]].\n\nThe 1907 convention was modified by the ''Additional Protocol to the Convention Relative to the Creation of an International Prize Court'', done at the Hague on October 18, 1910. The protocol was an attempt to resolve some concerns expressed by the United States at the court, which felt it to be in violation of [[United States Constitution|its constitutional]] provision that provides for the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] being the final judicial authority. However, neither the convention nor the subsequent protocol ever entered into force, since only [[Nicaragua]] ratified the agreements. As a result, the court never came into existence.\n\nA number of ideas from the International Prize Court proposal can be seen in present day international courts, such as its provision for judges ''ad hoc'', later adopted in the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the subsequent [[International Court of Justice]].\n\n==References==\n;Primary:\n* {{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/1907k.htm|title=Hague Convention XIII -Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War: 18 October 1907, 36 Stat. 2415, 1 Bevans 723, 205 Consol.

In this context, imams may lead [[Worship#Islam|Islamic worship]] services, serve as community leaders, and provide religious guidance. \n\nFor [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Muslim]]s, the imam has a more central meaning and role in Islam through the concept of [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|imamah]]; the term is only applicable to those members of ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'', the house of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], designated as [[The Fourteen Infallible|infallibles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=30}}</ref>\n\n==Sunni imams==\n{{main|Imam khatib (Sunni Islam)}}\nThe Sunni branch of Islam does not have imams in the same sense as the [[Shi'a]], an important distinction often overlooked by those outside of the Islamic faith. In everyday terms, the imam for Sunni Muslims is the one who leads Islamic formal ([[Fard]]) prayers, even in locations besides the mosque, whenever prayers are done in a group of two or more with one person leading (imam) and the others following by copying his ritual actions of worship. Friday sermon is most often given by an appointed imam. All mosques have an imam to lead the ([[Worship|congregational]]) prayers, even though it may sometimes just be a member from the gathered congregation rather than an officially appointed salaried person. The position of [[women as imams]] is controversial. The person that should be chosen, according to [[Hadith]], is one who has most knowledge of the [[Quran]] and Sunnah (prophetic tradition) and is of good character; the age being post-puberty.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe term is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam, often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni [[madhhab]]s, or schools of [[fiqh|jurisprudence (''fiqh'')]]. It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to [[Hadith]] or it may refer to the heads of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]]'s family in their generational times.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe following table shows the considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n\n|'''[[Madhhab]] (Schools of Jurisprudence)'''\n|'''[[Aqidah]] (Schools of Theology)'''\n|'''Science of [[Hadith]]'''\n|-\n|[[Abu Hanifa an-Nu'man|Imam Abu Hanifa]]\n|[[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] ([[Athari]])\n|[[Imam Bukhari]]\n|-\n|[[Malik ibn Anas|Imam Malik]]\n|Imam [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari|al-Ashari]] ([[Ash'ari]])\n|[[Imam Abu Dawood]]\n|-\n|[[Abu 'Abd Allah ash-Shafi'i|Imam Shafi'i]]\n|Imam [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] ([[Maturidi]])\n|[[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]]\n|-\n|[[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]\n|[[Wasil ibn Ata]] ([[Mu'tazili]])\n|[[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]\n|}\n\n'''The Position of Imams In Turkey'''\n\nImams are appointed by the state to work at mosques and they are required to be graduates of an [[\u0130mam Hatip school|\u0130mam Hatip high school]] or have a university degree in Theology. This is an official position regulated by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/en/home|title=Presidency of Religious Affairs|website=www.diyanet.gov.tr}}</ref> in Turkey and only males are appointed to this position while female officials under the same state organisation work as preachers and Qur'an course tutors, religious services experts. These officials are supposed to belong to the [[Hanafi school]] of the Sunni sect.\n\nA central figure in an Islamic movement is also called as an Imam like the Imam Nabhawi in Syria and [[Ahmad Raza Khan]] in India and Pakistan is also called as the Imam of Sunni Muslims.\n\n==Shi'a imams==\n{{Main|Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|The Twelve Imams}}\n\nIn the Shi'a context, an imam is not only presented as the man of God ''par excellence'', but as participating fully in the names, attributes, and acts that theology usually reserves for God alone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Amir-Moezzi|first1=Ali|title=Spirituality and Islam.|date=2008|publisher=Tauris|location=London|isbn=9781845117382|page=103}}</ref> Imams have a meaning more central to belief, referring to leaders of the community. [[Twelver]] and [[Ismaili]] Shi'a believe that these imams are chosen by God to be perfect examples for the faithful and to lead all humanity in all aspects of life.

the other is [[visual flight rules]] (VFR).\n\nThe U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s (FAA) ''Instrument Flying Handbook'' defines IFR as: \"Rules and regulations established by the FAA to govern flight under conditions in which flight by outside visual reference is not safe.

It is possible and fairly straightforward, in relatively clear weather conditions, to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation, nearby buildings and terrain features for navigation, and other aircraft to maintain separation. This is known as operating the aircraft under VFR, and is the most common mode of operation for small aircraft. However, it is safe to fly VFR only when these outside references can be clearly seen from a sufficient distance; when flying through or above clouds, or in fog, rain, dust or similar low-level weather conditions, these references can be obscured. Thus, cloud ceiling and flight visibility are the most important variables for safe operations during all phases of flight.<ref name='NASA/CR-2000-210288'> {{cite book\n | last1 = Keel\n | first1 = Byron\n | last2 = Stancil\n | first2 = Charles\n | last3 = Eckert\n | first3 = Clifford\n | last4 = Brown\n | first4 = Susan\n | title = Aviation Weather Information Requirements Study\n | chapter = Aviation Weather Information Requirements Recommendations\n | work = Aviation Safety Program\n | publisher = NASA Langley Research Center\n | date = June 2000\n | location = Hampton, Virginia\n | pages = 40\u201341\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.32.1842\n }}\n</ref>  The minimum weather conditions for ceiling and visibility for VFR flights are defined in FAR Part 91.155, and vary depending on the type of [[airspace]] in which the aircraft is operating, and on whether the flight is conducted during daytime or nighttime.

VFR pilots ''may'' use cockpit instruments as secondary aids to navigation and orientation, but are not required to; the view outside of the aircraft is the primary source for keeping the aircraft straight and level (orientation), flying to the intended destination [[pilotage|(navigation)]], and not hitting anything (separation).<ref name='flying_rc'>{{cite journal\n | title = Getting an Instrument Rating\n | journal = Flying Magazine\n | date = 2006-11-11\n | first = Richard\n | last = Collins\n | volume = 133\n | issue = 11\n | pages = 68\n | url = http://www.flyingmag.com/pilot-technique/instrument-flight-rules/getting-instrument-rating?page=0,0\n | accessdate = 2010-11-27}}\n</ref>\n\nVisual flight rules are generally simpler than instrument flight rules, and require significantly less training and practice.

IFR permits an aircraft to operate in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC), which is essentially any weather condition less than VMC but in which aircraft can still operate safely. Use of instrument flight rules is also required when flying in \"Class A\" airspace regardless of weather conditions. Class A airspace extends from 18,000 feet above mean sea level to flight level 600 (60,000 feet [[pressure altitude]]) above the contiguous 48 United States and overlying the waters within 12 miles thereof.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFAR.nsf/0/D32C5D905064AF1286257BE80061CDC5?OpenDocument |title=FAR Part 71 Sec. 71.33 |access-date=24 Aug 2015}}</ref> Flight in Class A airspace requires pilots and aircraft to be instrument equipped and rated and to be operating under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In many countries commercial airliners and their pilots must operate under IFR as the majority of flights enter Class A airspace; however, aircraft operating as commercial airliners must operate under IFR even if the flight plan does not take the craft into Class A airspace, such as with smaller regional flights.<ref>Federal Aviation Regulations Title 14, Chapter I, Subchapter E, [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bbf147e9365fd8eeb50e73177f8c1bd8&node=sp14.2.71.a&rgn=div6 \u00a771.31], [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=bbf147e9365fd8eeb50e73177f8c1bd8&node=sp14.2.71.a&rgn=div6 \u00a771.33]</ref> Procedures and training are significantly more complex compared to VFR instruction, as a pilot must demonstrate competency in conducting an entire [[Cross-country flying|cross-country flight]] solely by reference to instruments.\n\nInstrument pilots must meticulously evaluate weather, create a very detailed flight plan based around specific instrument departure, en route, and arrival procedures, and dispatch the flight.<ref name='flying_rc'/><ref name='flying_rg'>{{cite journal\n | title = IFR Flight Prep: A Whole New Game\n | journal = Flying Magazine\n | date = 2010-04-30\n | first = Robert\n | last = Goyer\n | volume = 137\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 56\n | url = http://www.flyingmag.com/pilot-technique/instrument-flight-rules/ifr-flight-prep-whole-new-game\n | accessdate = 2010-11-27}}\n</ref>\n\n==Separation and clearance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\n\nThe distance by which an aircraft avoids obstacles or other aircraft is termed ''separation''. The most important concept of IFR flying is that separation is maintained regardless of weather conditions. In [[controlled airspace]], [[air traffic control]] (ATC) separates IFR aircraft from obstacles and other aircraft using a flight ''clearance'' based on route, time, distance, speed, and altitude. ATC monitors IFR flights on [[radar]], or through aircraft position reports in areas where radar coverage is not available. Aircraft position reports are sent as voice radio transmissions. In the United States, a flight operating under IFR is required to provide position reports unless ATC advises a pilot that the plane is in radar contact.  The pilot must resume position reports after ATC advises that radar contact has been lost, or that radar services are terminated.\n\nIFR flights in controlled airspace require an ATC ''clearance'' for each part of the flight. A clearance always specifies a ''clearance limit'', which is the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance. In addition, a clearance typically provides a heading or route to follow, altitude, and communication parameters, such as frequencies and [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] codes.\n\nIn uncontrolled airspace, ATC clearances are unavailable.  In some states a form of separation is provided to certain aircraft in uncontrolled airspace as far as is practical (often known under ICAO as an advisory service in class G airspace), but separation is not mandated nor widely provided.\n\nDespite the protection offered by flight in controlled airspace under IFR, the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the aircraft rests with the pilot in command, who can refuse clearances.\n\n==Weather==\n[[File:IFR on top.jpg|thumb|IFR flying with clouds below]]\nIt is essential to differentiate between flight plan type (VFR or IFR) and weather conditions (VMC or IMC).  While current and forecast weather may be a factor in deciding which type of flight plan to file, weather conditions themselves do not affect one's filed flight plan. For example, an IFR flight that encounters [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC) en route does not automatically change to a VFR flight, and the flight must still follow all IFR procedures regardless of weather conditions. In the US, weather conditions are forecast broadly as VFR, MVFR (Marginal Visual Flight Rules), IFR, or LIFR (Low Instrument Flight Rules).<ref>[http://www.aviationweather.gov/adds/metars/description/page_no/4 Aviation Weather Center - METARs Help Page (4 of 5)] National Weather Center. Retrieved 29 January 2015</ref>\n\nThe main purpose of IFR is the safe operation of aircraft in [[instrument meteorological conditions]] (IMC). The weather is considered to be MVFR or IMC when it does not meet the minimum requirements for [[visual meteorological conditions]] (VMC).  To operate safely in IMC (\"actual instrument conditions\"), a pilot controls the aircraft relying on [[flight instruments]] and ATC provides separation.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCloy |first=John |title=Safety Pilot in IMC |work=IFR magazine |url=http://www.ifr-magazine.com/safety_pilot.html |accessdate=2009-05-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905150824/http://www.ifr-magazine.com/safety_pilot.html |archivedate=5 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nIt is important not to confuse IFR with IMC. A significant amount of IFR flying is conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Anytime a flight is operating in VMC and in a volume of airspace in which VFR traffic can operate, the crew is responsible for seeing and avoiding VFR traffic; however, because the flight is conducted under Instrument Flight Rules, ATC still provides separation services from other IFR traffic, and can in many cases also advise the crew of the location of VFR traffic near the flight path.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAlthough dangerous and illegal, a certain amount of VFR flying is conducted in IMC.  A scenario is a VFR pilot taking off in VMC conditions, but encountering deteriorating visibility while en route. Continued VFR flight into IMC can lead to [[spatial disorientation]] of the pilot which is the cause of a significant number of general aviation crashes. VFR flight into IMC is distinct from \"VFR-on-top\", an IFR procedure in which the aircraft operates in VMC using a hybrid of VFR and IFR rules, and \"VFR over the top\", a VFR procedure in which the aircraft takes off and lands in VMC but flies above an intervening area of IMC. Also possible in many countries is \"Special VFR\" flight, where an aircraft is explicitly granted permission to operate VFR within the controlled airspace of an airport in conditions technically less than VMC; the pilot asserts they have the necessary visibility to fly despite the weather, must stay in contact with ATC, and cannot leave controlled airspace while still below VMC minimums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring flight under IFR, there are no visibility requirements, so flying through clouds (or other conditions where there is zero visibility outside the aircraft) is legal and safe. However, there are still minimum weather conditions that must be present in order for the aircraft to take off or to land; these vary according to the kind of operation, the type of navigation aids available, the location and height of terrain and obstructions in the vicinity of the airport, equipment on the aircraft, and the qualifications of the crew. For example, [[Reno-Tahoe International Airport]] (KRNO) in a mountainous region has significantly different [[instrument approach]]es for aircraft landing on the same runway surface, but from opposite directions.  Aircraft approaching from the north must make visual contact with the airport at a higher altitude than when approaching from the south because of rapidly rising terrain south of the airport.<ref>See KRNO [[approach plate]]s for \"LOC RWY 16R\", \"ILS RWY 16R\", and \"ILS or LOC/DME RWY 34L\".</ref> This higher altitude allows a flight crew to clear the obstacle if a landing is aborted. In general, each specific instrument approach specifies the minimum weather conditions to permit landing.\n\nAlthough large airliners, and increasingly, smaller aircraft, carry their own [[terrain awareness and warning system]] (TAWS),<ref name=\"skybrary.aero\">[http://www.skybrary.aero/bookshelf/books/2328.pdf \"Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems\u2014TAWS\"]. Skybrary. Retrieved 11 July 2014</ref> these are primarily backup systems providing a last layer of defense if a sequence of errors or omissions causes a dangerous situation.<ref name=\"skybrary.aero\"/>\n\n==Navigation==\nBecause IFR flights often take place without visual reference to the ground, a means of navigation other than looking outside the window is required.  A number of [[navaids|navigational aids]] are available to pilots, including ground-based systems such as [[Distance Measuring Equipment|DME]]/[[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]s and [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]s as well as the satellite-based [[Global Positioning System|GPS/GNSS]] system.  Air traffic control may assist in navigation by assigning pilots specific headings (\"radar vectors\").  The majority of IFR navigation is given by ground- and satellite-based systems, while radar vectors are usually reserved by ATC for sequencing aircraft for a busy approach or transitioning aircraft from takeoff to cruise, among other things.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Autopilot===\n[[Autopilot]] allows automatic piloting.\n\nModern [[flight management system]]s have evolved to allow a crew to plan a flight as to route and altitude and to specific time of arrival at specific locations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} This capability is used in several trial projects experimenting with ''four-dimensional'' approach clearances for commercial aircraft, with time as the fourth dimension.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} These clearances allow ATC to optimize the arrival of aircraft at major airports, which increases airport capacity and uses less fuel providing monetary and environmental benefits to airlines and the public.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n* [[Required navigation performance]] (RNP)\n* [[ADS-B]]\n\n==Procedures==\n{{Main|Instrument approach|Flight procedure}}\nSpecific procedures allow IFR aircraft to transition safely through every stage of flight.  These procedures specify how an IFR pilot should respond, even in the event of a complete radio failure, and loss of communications with ATC, including the expected aircraft course and altitude.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDepartures are described in an IFR clearance issued by ATC prior to takeoff. The departure clearance may contain an assigned heading, one or more waypoints, and an initial altitude to fly. The clearance can also specify a [[departure procedure]] (DP) or [[standard instrument departure]] (SID) that should be followed unless \"NO DP\" is specified in the notes section of the filed flight plan.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nHere is an example of an IFR clearance for a Cessna aircraft traveling from Palo Alto airport (KPAO) to Stockton airport (KSCK).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \"Cessna 21756, cleared to Stockton Airport via turn right heading zero-six-zero within one mile of the airport. Radar vectors San Jose, then as filed. Maintain three thousand expect five thousand five minutes after departure. Departure frequency is one two one decimal three. Squawk four two six three.\"\n|}\n\nDetailed explanation:\n\n;\"Cessna 21756\": Verifies that only this specific aircraft is cleared.\n\n;\"cleared to Stockton Airport\": '''Clearance Limit''': the farthest destination the aircraft is allowed to go under IFR (in most cases it is the destination airport).\n\n;\"via turn right heading zero-six-zero within one mile of the airport.\": The pilot is expected to execute the right turn to 060\u00b0 magnetic heading without further ATC prompting within one mile of the departure airport.\n\n;\"Radar vectors San Jose\": The departure controller will provide directional guidance to the San Jose VOR.\n\n;\"Then as filed.\": After arriving at the San Jose VOR, the pilot will likely resume navigation without ATC prompts along the airways and intersections that were filed in their flight plan.\n\n;\"Maintain three thousand ...\": After takeoff, climb to an indicated altitude of 3000 feet above sea level.\n\n;\"... expect five thousand five minutes after departure.\": The next altitude assignment is probably going to be 5000 feet above sea level.  However, pilots must follow actual ATC altitude assignments throughout the flight.  This portion of the clearance provides a backup if communications are lost, allowing the flight to continue and climb to 5000 feet.\n\n;\"Departure frequency is one two one decimal three.\": After the aircraft is airborne and the tower controller tells the pilot to \"contact departure\", pilots are to contact the departure controller on this communication frequency.\n\n;\"Squawk four two six three.\": The pilot should set the aircraft's transponder code to 4263 so that ATC can positively identify the flight on radar.\n\nThe clearance scheme, used by ATC, can be easily remembered using the acronym\n;\"CRAFT\":'''C'''learance Limit - '''R'''oute - '''A'''ltitudes - '''F'''requencies - '''T'''ransponder (Squawk)\n\nEn route flight is described by IFR charts showing navigation aids, fixes, and standard routes called ''[[Airway (aviation)|airways]]''. Aircraft with appropriate navigational equipment such as GPS, are also often cleared for a ''direct-to'' routing, where only the destination, or a few navigational waypoints are used to describe the route that the flight will follow. ATC will assign altitudes in its initial clearance or amendments thereto, and navigational charts indicate minimum safe altitudes for airways.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe approach portion of an IFR flight may begin with a [[standard terminal arrival route]] (STAR), describing common routes to fly to arrive at an [[initial approach fix]] (IAF) from which an [[instrument approach]] commences. \nAn instrument approach terminates either by the pilot acquiring sufficient visual reference to proceed to the runway, or with a [[missed approach]] because the required visual reference is not seen in time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Qualifications==\n\n===Pilot===\nTo fly under IFR, a pilot must have an [[instrument rating]] and must be ''current'' (meet recency of experience requirements).\nIn the United States, to file and fly under IFR, a pilot must be instrument-rated and, within the preceding six months, have flown six [[instrument approach]]es, as well as [[holding (aviation)|holding]] procedures and course interception and tracking with [[navaid]]s. Flight under IFR beyond six months after meeting these requirements is not permitted; however, currency may be reestablished within the next six months by completing the requirements above.

He was previously the [[List of governors of Herat|Governor]] of [[Herat Province]]. He is widely known as a [[warlord]] because of his rise to power during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]<ref name=in.news /> when he controlled a large sized [[mujahideen]] force, mainly his fellow [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] from western Afghanistan. He is a key member of the political party [[Jamiat-e Islami]] and was a member of the now defunct [[United National Front (Afghanistan)|United National Front]] party.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Early years and rise to power==\nKhan was born in or about 1946 in the [[Shindand District]] of [[Herat Province]] in Afghanistan. His family are [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] from the Chahar-Mahal neighbourhood of Shindand.\n\nIn early 1979 Ismail Khan was a [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] in the [[Afghan National Army]] based in the western city of Herat. In early March of that year, there was a protest in front of the Communist governor's palace against the arrests and assassinations being carried out in the countryside. The governor's troops opened fire on the demonstrators, who proceeded to storm the palace and hunt down Soviet advisers. The Herat garrison mutinied and joined the revolt, with Ismail Khan and other officers distributing all available weapons to the insurgents. Hundreds of civil workers and people not dressed in traditional Muslim clothes were murdered. A garrison of Soviet advisors was overtaken and all of its inhabitants: Soviet advisors along with their wives and children were massacred. The mob put severed heads of the victims on sticks and paraded them through the city of Herat. The government led by [[Nur Mohammed Taraki]] responded, pulverizing the city using Soviet supplied bombers and killing an estimated 24,000 citizens in less than a week.<ref name=\"Johnson\">''Ismail Khan, Herat, and Iranian Influence'' by Thomas H. Johnson, Strategic Insights, Volume III, Issue 7 (July 2004)[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA485209]</ref> This event marked the opening salvo of the rebellion which led to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan]] in December 1979. Ismail Khan escaped to the countryside where he began to assemble a local rebel force.<ref>Coll, Steve. ''Ghost Wars''. pg 40. 2004, Penguin Books.</ref>\n\nDuring the ensuing war, he became the leader of the western command of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]'s [[Jamiat-e-Islami]], political party associated with neighboring [[Pakistan]]'s [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]]. With [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], he was one of the most respected mujahideen leaders.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> In 1992, two years after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the mujahideen captured Herat and Ismail Khan became [[list of governors of Herat|Governor]].\n\n===Escaping to Iran===\nIn 1995, he successfully defended his province against the [[Taliban]], in cooperation with defense minister Ahmad Shah Massoud. Khan even tried to attack the Taliban stronghold of [[Kandahar]], but was repulsed. Later in September, an ally of the Jamiat, [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] changed sides, and attacked Herat. Ismail Khan was forced to flee to neighboring [[Iran]] with 8,000 men and the Taliban took over Herat Province.\n\nTwo years later, while organizing opposition to the Taliban in Faryab area, he was betrayed and captured by [[Abdul Majid Rouzi]] who had defected to the Taliban along with [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]], then one of Dostum's deputies.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Then in March 1999 he escaped from Kandahar prison. During the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. intervention]] in Afghanistan, he fought against the Taliban within the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan ([[Northern Alliance]]) and thus regained his position as Governor of Herat after they were victorious in December 2001.\n\n==Karzai administration and return to Afghanistan==\n\nAfter returning to Herat, Ismail Khan quickly consolidated his control over the region.  He took over control of the city from the local [[ulema]] and quickly established control over the trade route between Herat and Iran, a large source of revenue.<ref>Johnson, C. & Leslie, J. \"Afghanistan: The Mirage of Peace\", New York: Zed Books, 2008. p47-69, 180.</ref>  As [[Emir]] of Herat, Ismail Khan exercised great autonomy, providing social welfare for Heratis, expanding his power into neighbouring provinces, and maintaining direct international contacts.<ref>Johnson, C. & Leslie, J. \"Afghanistan: The Mirage of Peace\", New York: Zed Books, 2008. p180.</ref>  Although hated by the educated in Herat and often accused of human rights abuses, Ismail Khan's regime provided security, paid government employees, and made investments in public services.<ref>Johnson, C. & Leslie, J. \"Afghanistan: The Mirage of Peace\", New York: Zed Books, 2008. p69.</ref>  However, during his tenure as governor, Ismail Khan was accused of ruling his province like a private fiefdom, leading to increasing tensions with the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]]. In particular, he refused to pass on to the government the revenues gained from custom taxes on goods from Iran and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\nOn 13 August 2003, President Karzai removed Governor Ismail Khan from his command of the [[4th Corps (Afghanistan)|4th Corps]]. This was announced as part of a programme removing the ability of officials to hold both civilian and military posts.\n\nIsmail Khan was ultimately removed from power in March 2004 due to pressure by neighbouring warlords and the central Afghan government.  Various sources have presented different versions of the story, and the exact dynamics cannot be known with certainty. What is known is that Ismail Khan found himself at odds with a few regional commanders who, although theoretically his subordinates, attempted to remove him from power. Ismail Khan claims that these efforts began with a botched assassination attempt. Afterwards, these commanders moved their forces near Herat. Ismail Khan, unpopular with the Herati military class, was slow to mobilise his forces, perhaps waiting for the threat to Herat to become existential as a means to motivate his forces. However, the conflict was stopped with the intervention of [[International Security Assistance Force]] forces and soldiers of the [[Afghan National Army]], freezing the conflict in its tracks.  Ismail Khan's forces even fought skirmishes with the Afghan National Army, in which his son, [[Mirwais Sadiq]] was killed.  Because Ismail Khan was contained by the Afghan National Army, the warlords who opposed him were quickly able to occupy strategic locations unopposed. Ismail Khan was forced to give up his governorship and to go to Kabul, where he served in [[Hamid Karzai]]'s cabinet as the Minister of Energy.<ref name=\"Giustozzi\">Giustozzi, A. \"Empires of Mud: Wars and Warlords in Afghanistan\", London: Hurst & Co., 2009. p259.</ref>\n\nIn 2005 Ismail Khan became the [[Ministry of Water and Energy (Afghanistan)|Minister of Water and Energy]].\n\nIn late 2012, the Government of Afghanistan accused Ismail Khan of illegally distributing weapons to his supporters.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/world/asia/ismail-khan-powerful-afghan-stokes-concern-in-kabul.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0 |title=Afghan Warlord\u2019s Call to Arms Rattles Officials |date=November 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |author=GRAHAM BOWLEY}}</ref> About 40 members of the country's [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|Parliament]] requested Ismail Khan to answer their queries.

This is the [[lightness|brightest]] color indigo that can be approximated on a computer screen; it is a color located between the (primary) blue and the color [[Violet (color)#Electric violet|violet]] of the RGB color wheel.\n\nThe web color ''blue violet'' or ''deep indigo'' is a tone of indigo brighter than pigment indigo, but not as bright as electric indigo.\n\nThe color ''pigment indigo'' is equivalent to the web color indigo and approximates the color indigo that is usually reproduced in pigments and colored pencils.\n\nThe color of indigo dye is a different color from either spectrum indigo or pigment indigo. This is the actual color of the dye. A vat full of this dye is a darker color, approximating the web color [[midnight blue]].\n\nBelow are displayed these four major tones of indigo.\n\n=== Electric indigo ===\n{{infobox color\n| title=Electric Indigo|textcolor=white\n| hex=6F00FF\n| r=111|g= 0|b=255\n| c= 57|m=100|y= 0|k= 0\n| h=266|s=100|v=100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.forret.com/tools/color.asp?RGB=#6F00FF|title=RGB Color converter \u2013 toolstudio|first=Peter|last=Forret|website=web.forret.com}}</ref>\n|source=[http://desktoppub.about.com/od/choosingcolors/f/What-Color-Is-Indigo.htm]}}\n\n\"Electric indigo\" is brighter than the pigment indigo reproduced below.

Its hue is closer to violet than to indigo dye for which the color is named. Pigment indigo can be obtained by mixing 55% pigment cyan with about 45% pigment [[magenta]].\n\nCompare the subtractive colors to the additive colors in the two primary color charts in the article on [[primary colors]] to see the distinction between electric colors as reproducible from light on a computer screen (additive colors) and the pigment colors reproducible with pigments (subtractive colors); the additive colors are significantly brighter because they are produced from light instead of pigment.\n\nWeb color indigo represents the way the color indigo was always reproduced in pigments, paints, or colored [[pencil]]s in the 1950s. By the 1970s, because of the advent of [[psychedelic art]], artists became used to brighter pigments, and pigments called \"bright indigo\" or \"bright blue-violet\" that are the pigment equivalent of the electric indigo reproduced in the section above became available in artists' pigments and colored pencils.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Tropical indigo ===\n{{infobox color|title=Tropical Indigo\n|hex=9683EC\n|textcolor=white\n|r=150\n|g=131\n|b=236\n|c=48\n|m=51\n|y=0\n|k=0\n|h=251\n|s=44\n|v=93\n|source=Gallego and Sanz<ref>Gallego, Rosa; Sanz, Juan Carlos (2005).

Each member's quota also determines its relative voting power. Thus, financial contributions from member governments are linked to voting power in the organisation.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\nThis system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organisation: wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules.<ref name=\"chorev\"/> Since decision making at the IMF reflects each member's relative economic position in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the IMF have more influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the IMF focuses on redistribution.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\n===Inflexibility of voting power===\nQuotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed necessary by the Board of Governors. IMF voting shares are relatively inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-represented as their voting power lags behind.<ref name=\"Explaining Change\" /> Currently, reforming the representation of [[developing countries]] within the IMF has been suggested.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" /> These countries' economies represent a large portion of the global economic system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision making process through the nature of the quota system. [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues, \"There is a need to provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries, which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since 1944, when the IMF was created.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Stiglitz and Members of a UN Commission on Financial Experts|first=Joseph E.|title=The Stiglitz Report: Reforming the International Monetary and Financial Systems in the Wake of the Global Crisis|year=2010|publisher=The New Press|location=New York}}</ref> In 2008, a number of quota reforms were passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and developing countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Factsheet: IMF Quotas|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/quotas.htm|work=About the IMF|publisher=The International Monetary Fund}}</ref>\n\n===Overcoming borrower/creditor divide===\nThe IMF's membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide the financial resources while others use these resources. Both [[developed country]] \"creditors\" and [[developing country]] \"borrowers\" are members of the IMF. The developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into IMF loan agreements; they are the creditors. Conversely, the developing countries use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. Thus, tension is created around governance issues because these two groups, creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests.<ref name=\"Political Economy of IMF voting\" />\n\nThe criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota system institutionalises borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain reassurance that the loans will be repaid.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kafka|first=Alejandre|title=Some IMF Problems after the Committee of Twenty|work=International Financial Policy: Essays in honour of Jaques J.

The new Framework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the subsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil.<ref>[https://www.imf.org/external/np/acc/2004/eng/032304.pdf inf.org: \"INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND \u2013 Review of Exceptional Access Policy\"], 23 March 2004</ref> Its purpose was to place some sensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support governments with debt problem\u2014especially in emerging markets\u2014and thereby move away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets.  The reform was closely related to, and put in place nearly simultaneously with, the actions of several emerging market countries to place [[collective action clause]]s in their bond contracts.\n\nIn 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in an unsustainable and political situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://economicsone.com/2014/03/25/why-the-imfs-exceptional-access-framework-is-so-important/|title=Why the IMF's Exceptional Access Framework is So Important|first=John|last=Taylor|date=26 March 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=taywsj>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303519404579352883092156074|title=WSJ|publisher=|via=online.wsj.com}}</ref>\n\nThe topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April 2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and Policy Framework\".<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize and Jamaica.

(and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with high probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an operation involving debt reduction ...

The development of the World Bank, the IMF [[International financial institutions#Regional development banks|regional development banks]] such as the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and multilateral trade institutions such as the WTO signals a move away from the dominance of the state as the exclusive unit of analysis in international affairs. Globalization has thus been transformative in terms of a reconceptualising of [[state sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCorquodale|first=Robert|author2=Richard Fairbrother|title=Globalization and Human Rights|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|date=August 1999|volume=21|issue=3|pages=735\u2013766|doi=10.1353/hrq.1999.0041}}</ref>\n\nFollowing United States President [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration's aggressive financial [[deregulation]] campaign in the 1990s, globalisation leaders overturned longstanding restrictions by governments that limited foreign ownership of their banks, deregulated currency exchange, and eliminated restrictions on how quickly money could be withdrawn by foreign investors.<ref name=\"People Before Profit\" />\n\nFund report in May 2015, the world's governments indirectly subsidise fossil fuel companies with $5.3tn (\u00a33.4tn) a year.

The [[Group of 24]] (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Then LDCs found themselves with payments deficits due to adverse changes in their [[terms of trade]], with the Fund prescribing stabilisation programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.\n* Some IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that [[deflationary]] effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.\n* Lastly is the suggestion that the IMF's policies lack a clear economic rationale. Its policy foundations were theoretical and unclear because of differing opinions and departmental rivalries whilst dealing with countries with widely varying economic circumstances.\n\nODI conclusions were that the IMF's very nature of promoting market-oriented approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF could serve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international bankers. The ODI conceded that the IMF was insensitive to political aspirations of LDCs, while its policy conditions were inflexible.<ref>{{cite web|title=The IMF and the Third World |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5379&title=imf-ldcs |work=ODI briefing paper |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |accessdate=6 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107124156/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5379&title=imf-ldcs |archivedate=7 January 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nArgentina, which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its compliance to policy proposals by the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001,<ref>''Memoria del Saqueo'', [[Fernando Ezequiel Solanas]], documentary film, 2003 (Language: Spanish; Subtitles: English) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH6_i8zuffs&feature=PlayList&p=8B60CF40AEF6BBDA&index=0&playnext=1 YouTube.com]</ref> which some believe to have been caused by IMF-induced budget restrictions\u2014which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security\u2014and privatisation of strategically vital national resources.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/twr137b.htm |title=Economic debacle in Argentina: The IMF strikes again |publisher=Twnside.org.sg |accessdate=30 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303033200/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/twr137b.htm |archivedate=3 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly.<ref>Stephen Webb, \"Argentina: Hardening the Provincial Budget Constraint\", in Rodden, Eskeland, and Litvack (eds.), ''Fiscal Decentralization and the Challenge of [[Hard Budget]] Constraints'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]], 2003).</ref> The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic problems.

Ecuador, for example, had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its [[rainforest]]s, though paradoxically this need was cited in the IMF argument to provide support to Ecuador.

It was originally adopted by the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]] (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication|SWIFT]] as the formal registrar. Initially developed to facilitate payments within the [[European Union]], it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in the other parts of the world, mainly in the [[Middle East]] and in the [[Caribbean]]. As of February 2016, 69 countries were using the IBAN numbering system.<ref name=IBANRegistry/>\n\nThe IBAN consists of up to 34 alphanumeric characters comprising: a country code; two [[check digit]]s; and a number that includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. The check digits enable a check of the bank account number to confirm its integrity before submitting a transaction.\n\n==Background==\nBefore IBAN, differing national standards for bank account identification (i.e. bank, branch, routing codes, and account number) were confusing for some users. This often led to necessary routing information being missing from payments. Routing information as specified by [[ISO 9362]] (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.<ref name=Overview_CY>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.centralbank.gov.cy/media/pdf/IBANMANUAL_EN.pdf\n|title = Handbook for the Standardisation and Application of Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) and International Bank Account Number (IBAN) in Cyprus\n|date = September 2003\n|at = Introduction\n|publisher = Central Bank of Cyprus\n|accessdate = 7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, to overcome these difficulties, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published ISO 13616:1997.<ref name=ISO136161997>{{cite web\n|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=21228\n|title = Banking and related financial services -- International Bank Account Number (IBAN)\n|publisher = International Organisation for Standardisation\n|date = 24 July 2003\n|accessdate = 11 August 2012}}</ref> This proposal had a degree of flexibility, which the [[European Committee for Banking Standards]] (ECBS) believed would make it unworkable, and they produced a \"slimmed down\" version of the standard which, amongst other things, permitted only upper-case letters and required that the IBAN for each country have a fixed length.<ref name=SIG203/> ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003.<ref name=ISO136161997/> The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts.

SWIFT also acts as the registration authority for the SWIFT system, which is used by most countries that have not adopted IBAN. A major difference between the two systems is that under SWIFT there is no requirement that BBANs used within a country be of a pre-defined length.\n\nThe BBAN must be of a fixed length for the country and comprise [[case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] alphanumeric characters. It includes the domestic bank account number, branch identifier, and potential routing information. Each country can have a different national routing/account numbering system, up to a maximum of 30 alphanumeric characters.\n\n===Check digits===\nThe check digits enable the sending bank (or its customer) to perform a [[Sanity testing|sanity check]] of the routing destination and account number from a single string of data at the time of data entry.<ref name=SIG203>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.pruefziffernberechnung.de/Originaldokumente/IBAN/SIG203A3FV_181200.pdf\n|title = IBAN Standard Implementation Guidelines \u2013 SIG203 V4\n|date = December 2000\n|at = 9.3 Ordering customer\n|quote = \"IBANs make validation possible for telebanking, FEDI\"\n|accessdate = 8 August 2012\n|publisher = European Committee for Banking Standards}}</ref> This check is guaranteed to detect any instances where a single character has been omitted, duplicated, mistyped or where two characters have been transposed. Thus routing and account number errors are virtually eliminated.<ref name=ValidationFeatures/>\n\n==Processing==\n{{contradict|date=June 2016|about=the range of check digits. This section implies 00 to 96, the section below says 02 to 98.}}\nOne of the design aims of the IBAN was to enable as much validation as possible to be done at the point of data entry.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title = Handbook for the Standardisation and Application of Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) and International Bank Account Number (IBAN) in Cyprus\n|url = http://www.centralbank.gov.cy/media/pdf/IBANMANUAL_EN.pdf\n|date = September 2003\n|at = Section 4 \u2013 Advantages\n|quote = \"Reduction of human errors\"\n|publisher = Central Bank of Cyprus\n|accessdate = 7 August 2012}}</ref> In particular, the computer program that accepts an IBAN will be able to validate:\n\n* Country code\n* Number of characters in the IBAN correspond to the number specified for the country code\n* BBAN format specified for the country code\n* Account number, bank code and country code combination is compatible with the check digits\n\nThe check digits are calculated using MOD-97-10 as per [[ISO 7064|ISO/IEC 7064:2003]]<ref name=ValidationFeatures>{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=31531 | title = ISO/IEC 7064:2003 \u2013 Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Check character systems | publisher = International Organization for Standardization | accessdate = 31 January 2010 }}</ref> (abbreviated to ''mod-97'' in this article), which specifies a set of check character systems capable of protecting strings against errors which occur when people copy or key data. In particular, the standard states that the following can be detected:\n\n* All single substitution errors (the substitution of a single character for another, for example <tt>4234</tt> for <tt>1234</tt>)\n* All or nearly all single (local) transposition errors (the transposition of two single characters, either adjacent or with one character between them, for example <tt>12354</tt> or <tt>12543</tt> for <tt>12345</tt>)\n* All or nearly all shift errors (shifts of the whole string to the left or right)\n* High proportion of double substitution errors (two separate single substitution errors in the same string, for example <tt>7234587</tt> for <tt>1234567</tt>)\n* High proportion of all other errors\n\nThe underlying rules for IBANs is that the account-servicing financial institution should issue an IBAN, as there are a number of areas where different IBANs could be generated from the same account and branch numbers that would satisfy the generic IBAN validation rules. In particular cases where <tt>00</tt> is a valid check digit, <tt>97</tt> will not be a valid check digit, likewise, if <tt>01</tt> is a valid check digit, <tt>98</tt> will not be a valid check digit, similarly with <tt>02</tt> and <tt>99</tt>.\n\nThe [[UN CEFACT TBG5]] has published a free IBAN validation service in 32 languages for all 57 countries{{update inline|date=October 2016}} that have adopted the IBAN standard.<ref name = IBANValidation>{{cite web\n|title = International Bank Account Number (IBAN) \u2013 IBAN online check\n|publisher = UN/CEFACT United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business\n|date = 23 April 2012\n|accessdate = 7 August 2012\n|url = http://www.tbg5-finance.org/?ibancheck.shtml}}</ref> They have also published the Javascript [[source code]] of the verification algorithm.<ref name = IBANJava>{{cite web\n|title = International Bank Account Number (IBAN) \u2013 Basic information\n|publisher = UN/CEFACT United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business\n|date = 23 April 2012\n|accessdate = 7 August 2012\n|url = http://www.tbg5-finance.org/ibandocs.shtml}}</ref>\n\nAn English language IBAN checker for [[European Committee for Banking Standards|ECBS]] member country bank accounts is available on its website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecbs.org/iban-checker.htm |title=Iban Checker |publisher=ecbs.org|work=European Banking Resources |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Algorithms===\n{{anchor|algorithms}}\n\n====Validating the IBAN====\nAn IBAN is validated by converting it into an [[integer]] and performing a basic ''mod-97'' operation (as described in [[ISO 7064]]) on it. If the IBAN is valid, the remainder equals 1.<ref group='Note'>In equations, the remainder of ''A'' divided by ''B'' is denoted {{nowrap|''A'' mod ''B'' or}} {{nowrap|''A'' (mod ''B'')}}, {{nowrap|e.g., 2 {{=}} 14 mod 12 .}} See [[Modular arithmetic#Remainders|Remainders]].</ref> The algorithm of IBAN validation is as follows:<ref name=ECBS/>\n\n# Check that the total IBAN length is correct as per the country. If not, the IBAN is invalid\n# Move the four initial characters to the end of the string\n# Replace each letter in the string with two digits, thereby expanding the string, where A = 10, B = 11, ..., Z = 35\n# Interpret the string as a decimal integer and compute the remainder of that number on division by 97\n\nIf the remainder is 1, the check digit test is passed and the IBAN might be valid.\n\nExample (fictitious United Kingdom bank, sort code 12-34-56, account number 98765432):\n\n:{|\n|\u2022 IBAN: ||||align=\"right\"|<span style=\"color:red\">GB</span><span style=\"color:blue\">82</span> <span style=\"color:green\">WEST</span> 1234 5698 7654 32||\n|-\n|\u2022 Rearrange: ||||align=\"right\"|<span style=\"color:green\"> W E S T</span>12345698765432<span style=\"color:red\"> G B</span><span style=\"color:blue\">82</span>||\n|-\n|\u2022 Convert to integer: ||||align=\"right\"|<span style=\"color:green\">32142829</span>12345698765432<span style=\"color:red\">1611</span><span style=\"color:blue\">82</span>||\n|-\n|\u2022 Compute remainder: ||||align=\"right\"|<span style=\"color:green\">32142829</span>12345698765432<span style=\"color:red\">1611</span><span style=\"color:blue\">82</span>|| mod 97 = 1\n|}\n\n====Generating IBAN check digits====\n\nAccording to the [[European Committee for Banking Standards|ECBS]] \"generation of the IBAN shall be the exclusive responsibility of the bank/branch servicing the account\".<ref name=ECBS/> The ECBS document replicates part of the ISO/IEC 7064:2003 standard as a method for generating check digits in the range 02 to 98. Check digits in the ranges 00 to 96, 01 to 97, and 03 to 99 will also provide validation of an IBAN, but the standard is silent as to whether or not these ranges may be used.\n\nThe preferred algorithm is:<ref name=ECBS/>\n\n# Check that the total IBAN length is correct as per the country. If not, the IBAN is invalid.\n# Replace the two check digits by 00 (e.g., GB00 for the UK).\n# Move the four initial characters to the end of the string.\n# Replace the letters in the string with digits, expanding the string as necessary, such that A or a = 10, B or b = 11, and Z or z = 35. Each alphabetic character is therefore replaced by 2 digits<!-- The range is 1 to 97, not 0 to 96, which is what generates the remainder of 1 above. -->\n# Convert the string to an integer (i.e. ignore leading zeroes).\n# Calculate ''mod-97'' of the new number, which results in the remainder.\n# Subtract the remainder from 98, and use the result for the two check digits. If the result is a single digit number, pad it with a leading 0 to make a two-digit number.\n\n====Modulo operation on IBAN====\nAny computer [[programming language]] or [[application software|software package]] that is used to compute ''D'' mod ''97'' directly must have the ability to handle [[integer]]s of more than 30 digits. In practice, this can only be done by software that either supports [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]] or that can handle 220 bit (unsigned) integers,<ref group=Note>The maximum length of ''D'' in (decimal) digits for the fully generic IBAN with 34 alphanumeric digits (two of which, the check digits, can, however, only be numeric) is {{nowrap|(34 \u2212 2) \u00d7 2 + 2 \u00d7 1 {{=}} 66}}. 2<sup>220</sup> is equal to 1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>66</sup>, from which it can be inferred that 220 bit unsigned integers can accommodate all unsigned integers of 66 digits. This is provided in [[C data types|C]] by a <code>long long long int</code> on a typical modern computer with 32-bit <code>int</code>s.</ref> features that are often not standard. If the application software in use does not provide the ability to handle integers of this size, the [[modulo operation]] can be performed in a piece-wise manner (as is the case with the [[UN CEFACT TBG5]] Javascript program).\n\nPiece-wise calculation {{nowrap|''D'' mod ''97''}} can be done in many ways. One such way is as follows:<ref name='UKPayAdmin2007'>{{cite web\n |url = http://www.ukpayments.org.uk/files/standards/standard_48_iban_june_2007.pdf\n |title = Standard 48 \u2013 Format of the IBAN issued in the UK (International Bank Account Number)\n |publisher = UK Payments Administration\n |date = June 2016\n |accessdate = 20 August 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n# Starting from the leftmost digit of ''D'', construct a number using the first 9 digits and call it ''N''.<ref group=Note>2<sup>31</sup> is approximately equal to {{nowrap|2.1 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup>}}, making it possible for any 9-digit integer to be handled using 32 bit integer arithmetic</ref>\n# Calculate ''N'' mod ''97''.\n# Construct a new 9-digit ''N'' by concatenating above result (step 2) with the next 7 digits of ''D''.

The European Parliament mandated that a [[bank charge]] needs to be the same amount for domestic credit transfers as for cross-border credit transfers regulated in decision 2560/2001 (updated in 924/2009).<ref name=\"924-2009\" /> This regulation took effect in 2003. Only payments in euro up to \u20ac12,500 to a bank account designated by its IBAN were covered by the regulation.\n\nThe Euro Payments regulation has been the foundation for the decision to create a [[Single Euro Payments Area]] (SEPA). The [[European Central Bank]] has created the [[TARGET2]] interbank network that unifies the technical infrastructure of the 26 central banks of the European Union (although Sweden and the UK have opted out). SEPA is a self-regulatory initiative by the banking sector of Europe as represented in the [[European Payments Council]] (EPC). The European Union made the scheme mandatory through the [[Payment Services Directive]] published in 2007. Since January 2008, all countries must support SEPA credit transfer, and SEPA direct debit must be supported since November 2009. The regulation on SEPA payments increases the charge cap (same price for domestic payments as for cross-border payments) to \u20ac50,000.\n\nWith a further decision of the European Parliament, the IBAN scheme for bank accounts fully replaced the domestic numbering schemes from 31 December 2012.<ref name=\"dowjones2010\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dowjones.de/site/2010/12/frist-f%C3%BCr-umstieg-auf-sepa-produkte-deutscher-widerstand-programmiert.html | title = Frist f\u00fcr Umstieg auf SEPA-Produkte: Dt Widerstand programmiert | language = German | trans-title = Deadline for migration to SEPA products: Dt programmed resistance | publisher = Dow Jones Deutschland | date = 14 December 2010 | accessdate = 18 December 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101217080334/http://www.dowjones.de/site/2010/12/frist-f%C3%BCr-umstieg-auf-sepa-produkte-deutscher-widerstand-programmiert.html | archivedate = 17 December 2010 | df =  }}</ref> On 16 December 2010, the European Commission published proposed regulations that will make IBAN support mandatory for domestic credit transfer by 2013 and for domestic direct debit by 2014 (with a 12 and 24 months transition period respectively).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010PC0775:EN:NOT | title = Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euros and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 | date = 16 December 2010 | publisher = the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union | accessdate = 17 January 2011 }}</ref> Some countries have already replaced their traditional bank account scheme by IBAN.

If it is a constant for the country concerned, this will be stated in the Comments column. This happens where the BBAN has its own check digits that use the same algorithm as the IBAN check digits\n* The BBAN format column shows the format of the BBAN part of an IBAN in terms of upper case alpha characters (A\u2013Z) denoted by \"a\", numeric characters (0\u20139) denoted by \"n\" and mixed case alphanumeric characters (a\u2013z, A\u2013Z, 0\u20139) denoted by \"c\". For example, the Bulgarian BBAN (4a,6n,8c) consists of 4 alpha characters, followed by 6 numeric characters, then by 8 mixed-case alpha-numeric characters\n* Descriptions in the ''Comments'' field have been standardised with country specific names in brackets. The format of the various fields can be deduced from the BBAN field\n*Countries that are planning to introduce the IBAN are shown in ''italics'' with the planned date of introduction in '''bold'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Printed on paper the IBAN is often difficult to read. Therefore, it is popular to group the IBAN with four symbols. However, for electronic documents (e.g. PDF invoice) the copy and paste of grouped IBAN can result in errors with online banking forms. Only a few {{CitationNeeded|date=January 2016}} user friendly bank institutes allow and detect the copy and paste of both grouped and ungrouped IBAN.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Bank card number]]\n* [[Bank regulation]]\n* [[ABA routing transit number]]\n* [[Routing number (Canada)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|IBAN}}\n* [https://www.swift.com/sites/default/files/resources/swift_standards_ibanregistry.pdf Official ISO 13616 Registry] Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=41031 ISO 13616-1:2007] International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\n* [http://www.sbp.org.pk/psd/2012/C2.htm IBAN Implementation Guidelines] State Bank of Pakistan, 15 May 2012\n* [http://www.centralbank.gov.cy/media/pdf/IBANMANUAL_EN.pdf ''Handbook of the Standardization and Application of BBAN and IBAN in Cyprus''] Central Bank of Cyprus\n* [https://github.com/stvkoch/ISO7064-Mod-97-10 ''Check digits (or characters) are a 'checksum' on a number to help prevent manual typing errors. in PHP''] Check digits (or characters) are a 'checksum' on a number to help prevent manual typing errors. in PHP\n\n{{Audiovisual works|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{Bank codes and identification}}\n\n[[Category:Banking terms]]\n[[Category:Financial regulation]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n[[Category:Bank codes]]\n[[Category:Checksum algorithms]]", "sha1": "8tvqtlvdc0t04xt2sd8so56c5qszt2j"}}, {"title": "Infinitive", "ns": "0", "id": "15254", "revision": {"id": "866544136", "parentid": "866544126", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T00:13:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/47.150.248.234|47.150.248.234]] to version by BD2412.

(3528114) (Bot)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Infinitive''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|inf}}''') is a [[grammar|grammatical]] term referring to certain [[verb]] forms existing in many languages, most often used as [[non-finite verb]]s. As with many linguistic concepts, there is not a single definition applicable to all languages. The word is derived from [[Late Latin]] ''[modus] infinitivus'', a derivative of ''infinitus'' meaning \"unlimited\".\n\nIn traditional descriptions of [[English language|English]], the infinitive is the basic [[dictionary form]] of a verb when used non-finitely, with or without the [[grammatical particle|particle]] ''to''. Thus ''to go'' is an infinitive, as is ''go'' in a sentence like \"I must go there\" (but not in \"I go there\", where it is a [[finite verb]]). The form without ''to'' is called the '''bare infinitive''', and the form with ''to'' is called the '''full infinitive''' or '''''to''-infinitive'''.\n\nIn many other languages the infinitive is a single word, often with a characteristic [[inflection|inflective]] ending, like ''morir'' (\"(to) die\") in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''manger'' (\"(to) eat\") in [[French grammar|French]], ''portare'' (\"(to) carry\") in [[Latin verb|Latin]], ''lieben'' (\"(to) love\") in [[German grammar|German]], etc. However, some languages have no infinitive forms. Many [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], and some languages in [[languages of Africa|Africa]] and [[indigenous Australian languages|Australia]] do not have direct equivalents to infinitives or [[verbal noun]]s. Instead, they use [[balancing and deranking|finite verb forms in ordinary clauses]] or various special constructions.\n\nBeing a verb, an infinitive may take [[object (grammar)|object]]s and other complements and modifiers to form a [[verb phrase]] (called an '''infinitive phrase'''). Like other non-finite verb forms (like [[participle]]s, [[converb]]s, [[gerund]]s and [[gerundive]]s), infinitives do not generally have an expressed [[subject (grammar)|subject]]; thus an infinitive verb phrase also constitutes a complete [[non-finite clause]], called an '''infinitive (infinitival) clause'''. Such phrases or clauses may play a variety of roles within sentences, often being [[noun]]s (for example being the subject of a sentence or being a complement of another verb), and sometimes being [[adverb]]s or other types of modifier. Many verb forms known as infinitives differ from [[gerund]]s (verbal nouns) in that they do not inflect for [[Grammatical case|case]] or occur in [[adpositional phrase]]s. Instead, infinitives often originate in earlier inflectional forms of verbal nouns.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://cc.oulu.fi/~jylikosk/filer/defining.pdf |title=Defining non-finites: action nominals, converbs and infinitives.|first=Jussi|last=Ylikoski|date=2003|journal=SKY Journal of Linguistics|volume=16|pages=185\u2013237}}</ref> Unlike finite verbs, infinitives are not usually inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical person|person]], etc. either, although some degree of inflection sometimes occurs; for example Latin has distinct [[grammatical voice|active and passive]] infinitives.\n\n==Phrases and clauses==\nAn ''infinitive phrase'' is a [[verb phrase]] constructed with the verb in infinitive form. This consists of the verb together with its [[object (grammar)|object]]s and other [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s and [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s. Some examples of infinitive phrases in English are given below \u2013 these may be based on either the full infinitive (introduced by the [[grammatical particle|particle]] ''to'') or the bare infinitive (without the particle ''to'').\n*(to) sleep\n*(to) write ten letters\n*(to) go to the store for a pound of sugar\n\nInfinitive phrases often have an implied [[grammatical subject]] making them effectively [[clause]]s rather than phrases. Such ''infinitive clauses'' or ''infinitival clauses'', are one of several kinds of [[non-finite clause]]. They can play various grammatical roles like a [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]] of a larger clause or sentence; for example it may form a [[noun phrase]] or [[adverb]]. Infinitival clauses may be embedded within each other in complex ways, like in the sentence:\n*I want to tell you that Brett Favre is going to get married.\nHere the infinitival clause ''to get married'' is contained within the finite [[dependent clause]] ''that Brett Favre is going to get married''; this in turn is contained within another infinitival clause, which is contained in the finite [[independent clause]] (the whole sentence).\n\nThe grammatical structure of an infinitival clause may differ from that of a corresponding finite clause. For example, in [[German grammar|German]], the infinitive form of the verb usually goes to the end of its clause, whereas a finite verb (in an independent clause) typically comes in [[V2 word order|second position]].\n\n==Clauses with subject in the accusative case==\nFollowing certain verbs or prepositions, infinitives commonly ''do'' have an expressed subject, e.g.,  \n*I want '''them to eat their dinner'''.\n*For '''him to fail now''' would be a disappointment.\nAs these examples illustrate, the subject of the infinitive is in the [[oblique case|objective]] case (them, him) in contrast to the [[nominative case]] that would be used with a finite verb, e.g., \"They ate their dinner.\" \nSuch [[accusative and infinitive]] constructions are present in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]], as well as many modern languages.  The unusual case for the subject of an infinitive is an example of [[exceptional case-marking]], where the infinitive clause's role being an object of a verb or preposition (want, for) overpowers the pronoun's subjective role within the clause.\n\n==Marking for tense, aspect and voice {{anchor|Perfect}}==\nIn some languages, infinitives may be marked for [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] like [[grammatical voice|voice]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and to some extent [[grammatical tense|tense]]. This may be done by [[inflection]], like with the Latin perfect and passive infinitives, or by [[periphrasis]] (with the use of [[auxiliary verb]]s), like with the Latin future infinitives or the English perfect and progressive infinitives.\n\nLatin has present, perfect and future infinitives, with active and [[passive voice|passive]] forms of each. For details see {{slink|Latin conjugation|Infinitives}}.\n\nEnglish has infinitive constructions that are marked (periphrastically) for aspect: [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (continuous), or a combination of the two ([[perfect progressive]]). These can also be marked for [[English passive voice|passive voice]] (as can the plain infinitive):\n*''(to) eat'' (plain infinitive, active)\n*''(to) be eaten'' (passive)\n*''(to) have eaten'' (perfect active) \n*''(to) have been eaten'' (perfect passive) \n*''(to) be eating'' (progressive active) \n*''(to) be being eaten'' (progressive passive) \n*''(to) have been eating'' (perfect progressive active) \n*''(to) have been being eaten'' (perfect progressive passive, not often used)\nFurther constructions can be made with other auxiliary-like expressions, like ''(to) be [[going to]] eat'' or ''(to) be [[about to]] eat'', which have future meaning. For more examples of the above types of construction, see {{slink|Uses of English verb forms|Perfect and progressive non-finite constructions}}.\n\nPerfect infinitives are also found in other European languages that have [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] forms with auxiliaries similarly to English. For example, ''avoir mang\u00e9'' means \"(to) have eaten\" in French.\n\n==English==\n{{see also|English verbs}}\nRegarding [[English grammar|English]], the term \"infinitive\" is traditionally applied to the unmarked form of the verb (the [[English verbs#Base form|\"plain form\"]]) when it forms a [[non-finite verb]], whether or not introduced by the [[grammatical particle|particle]] ''to''. Hence ''sit'' and ''to sit'', as used in the following sentences, would each be considered an infinitive:\n* I can '''sit''' here all day.\n* I want '''to sit''' on the other chair.\n\nThe form without ''to'' is called the ''bare infinitive''; the form introduced by ''to'' is called the ''full infinitive'' or ''to-infinitive''.\n\nThe other non-finite verb forms in English are the [[gerund]] or present [[participle]] (the ''-ing'' form), and the [[past participle]] \u2013 these are not considered infinitives. Moreover, the unmarked form of the verb is not considered an infinitive when it is forms a [[finite verb]]: like a present [[indicative mood|indicative]] (\"I ''sit'' every day\"), [[English subjunctive|subjunctive]] (\"I suggest that he ''sit''\"), or [[imperative mood|imperative]] (\"''Sit'' down!\"). (For some [[English irregular verbs|irregular verbs]] the form of the infinitive coincides additionally with that of the past tense and/or past participle, like in the case of ''put''.)\n\nCertain [[auxiliary verb]]s are [[defective verb|defective]] in that they do not have infinitives (or any other non-finite forms). This applies to the [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] (''can'', ''must'', etc.), as well as certain related auxiliaries like the ''had'' of ''[[had better]]'' and the ''used'' of ''[[used to]]''. ([[Periphrasis|Periphrases]] can be employed instead in some cases, like ''(to) be able to'' for ''can'', and ''(to) have to'' for ''must''.) It also applies to the auxiliary ''do'', like used in questions, negatives and emphasis like described under [[do-support|''do''-support]]. (Infinitives are [[English grammar#Negation|negated]] by simply preceding them with ''not''. Of course the verb ''do'' when forming a main verb can appear in the infinitive.) However, the auxiliary verbs ''have'' (used to form the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]]) and ''be'' (used to form the [[passive voice]] and [[continuous aspect]]) both commonly appear in the infinitive: \"I should '''have''' finished by now\"; \"It's thought '''to have''' been a burial site\"; \"Let him '''be''' released\"; \"I hope '''to be''' working tomorrow.\"\n\n[[Rodney Huddleston|Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]]'s ''Cambridge Grammar of the English Language'' (2002) does not use the notion of the \"infinitive\" (\"there is no form in the English verb paradigm called 'the infinitive'\"), only that of the ''infinitival [[clause (grammar)|clause]]'', noting that English uses the same form of the verb, the ''plain form'', in infinitival clauses that it uses in imperative and present-subjunctive clauses.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey K.|authorlink2=Geoffrey K. Pullum|title=A Student's Introduction to English Grammar|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge UP|isbn=9780521848374|page=204}}</ref>\n\nA matter of controversy among [[prescriptive grammar]]ians and style writers has been the appropriateness of separating the two words of the ''to''-infinitive (as in \"I expect ''to'' happily ''sit'' here\"). For details of this, see [[split infinitive]]. Opposing [[linguistics|linguistic]] theories typically do not consider the ''to''-infinitive a distinct [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], instead regarding the scope of the particle ''to'' to cover an entire verb phrase; thus, ''to buy a car'' is parsed like ''<nowiki>to [buy [a car]]</nowiki>'', rather not like ''<nowiki>[to buy] [a car]</nowiki>''.\n\n===Uses of the infinitive===\nThe bare infinitive and the ''to''-infinitive have a variety of uses in English. The two forms are mostly in [[complementary distribution]] \u2013 certain contexts call for one, and certain contexts for the other; they are not normally interchangeable, except in occasional instances like after the verb ''help'', where either can be used.\n\nThe main uses of infinitives (or infinitive phrases) are like follows:\n*As [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s of other verbs. The bare infinitive form is a complement of the [[do-support|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'', most [[English modal verbs|modal auxiliary verbs]], verbs of perception like ''see'', ''watch'' and ''hear'' (after a direct object), and the verbs of permission or causation ''make'', ''bid'', ''let'', and ''have'' (also after a direct object). The ''to''-infinitive is used after many intransitive verbs like ''want'', ''aim'', ''like'', ''fail'', etc., and like a second complement after a direct object in the case of verbs like ''want'', ''convince'', ''aim'', etc.\n*In various particular expressions, like ''[[had better]]'' and ''[[would rather]]'' (with bare infinitive), ''in order to'', ''as if to'', ''[[am to]]/is to/are to''. \n*As a noun phrase, expressing its action or state in an abstract, general way, forming the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a clause or a [[predicative expression]]: \"'''To err''' is human\"; \"'''To know''' me is '''to love me'''\". The bare infinitive can be used in such sentences like \"What you should do is '''make''' a list.\" A common construction with the ''to''-infinitive involves a [[dummy pronoun]] subject (''it''), with the infinitive phrase placed after the predicate: \"It was nice '''to meet''' you.\"\n*[[Adverb]]ially, to express purpose, intent or result \u2013 the ''to''-infinitive can have the meaning of \"in order to...\" (I closed the door (in order) to block out any noise).\n*As a modifier of a noun or adjective. This may relate to the meaning of the noun or adjective (\"a request '''to see''' someone\"; \"keen '''to get''' on\"), or it may form a type of [[English relative clauses#Nonfinite relative clauses|non-finite relative clause]], like in \"the man '''to save''' us\"; \"the method '''to use'''\"; \"nice '''to listen''' to\".\n*In [[ellipsis (linguistics)|elliptical]] questions (direct or indirect): \"I don't know where '''to go'''.\"  After ''why'' the bare infinitive is used: \"Why '''reveal''' it?\"\n\nThe infinitive is also the usual [[dictionary form]] or citation form of a verb. The form listed in dictionaries is the bare infinitive, although the ''to''-infinitive is often used in referring to verbs or in defining other verbs: \"The word 'amble' means 'to walk slowly'\"; \"How do we conjugate the verb ''to go''?\"\n\nFor further detail and examples of the uses of infinitives in English, see [[Uses of English verb forms#Bare infinitive|Bare infinitive]] and [[Uses of English verb forms#To-infinitive|''To''-infinitive]] in the article on uses of English verb forms.\n\n== Other Germanic languages ==\nThe original [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] [[Suffix#Inflectional suffixes|ending]] of the infinitive was ''-an'', with verbs derived from other words ending in ''-jan'' or ''-janan''.\n\nIn [[German language|German]] it is ''-en'' (\"sagen\"), with ''-eln'' or ''-ern'' endings on a few words based on -l or -r roots (\"segeln\", \"\u00e4ndern\").  The use of ''[[wikt:zu#Particle|zu]]'' with infinitives is similar to English ''to'', but is less frequent than in English. German infinitives can form nouns, often expressing abstractions of the action, in which case they are of neuter gender: ''das Essen'' means ''the eating'', but also ''the food''.\n\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]] infinitives also end in ''-en'' (''zeggen'' \u2014 ''to say''), sometimes used with ''te'' similar to English ''to'', e.g., \"Het is niet moeilijk te begrijpen\" \u2192 \"It is not hard to understand.\" The few verbs with stems ending in ''-a'' have infinitives in -n (''gaan'' \u2014 ''to go'', ''slaan'' \u2014 ''to hit''). [[Afrikaans]] has lost the distinction between the infinitive and present forms of verbs, with the exception of the verbs \"wees\" (to be), which admits the present form \"is\", and the verb \"h\u00ea\" (to have), whose present form is \"het\".\n\nIn North Germanic languages the final ''-n'' was lost from the infinitive as early as 500\u2013540 AD, reducing the suffix to ''-a''. Later it has been further reduced to ''-e'' in Danish and some Norwegian dialects (including the written majority language [[bokm\u00e5l]]). In the majority of Eastern Norwegian dialects and a few bordering Western Swedish dialects the reduction to ''-e'' was only partial, leaving some infinitives in ''-a'' and others in ''-e'' (\u00e5 laga vs. \u00e5 kaste). In northern parts of Norway the infinitive suffix is completely lost (\u00e5 lag\u2019 vs. \u00e5 kast\u2019) or only the ''-a'' is kept (\u00e5 laga vs. \u00e5 kast\u2019). The infinitives of these languages are inflected for passive voice through the addition of ''-s'' or ''-st'' to the active form. This suffix appearance in Old Norse was a contraction of ''mik'' (\u201cme\u201d, forming ''-mk'') or ''sik'' (reflexive pronoun, forming ''-sk'') and was originally expressing reflexive actions: (hann) ''kallar'' (\u201c(he) calls\u201d) + ''-sik'' (\u201chimself\u201d) > (hann) ''kallask'' (\u201c(he) calls himself\u201d). The suffixes ''-mk'' and ''-sk'' later merged to ''-s'', which evolved to ''-st'' in the western dialects. The loss or reduction of ''-a'' in active voice in Norwegian did not occur in the passive forms (''-ast'', ''-as''), except for some dialects that have ''-es''. The other North Germanic languages have the same vowel in both forms.\n\n== Latin and Romance languages ==\nThe formation of the infinitive in the [[Romance languages]] reflects that in their ancestor, [[Latin]], almost all verbs had an infinitive ending with ''-re'' (preceded by one of various thematic vowels). For example, in [[Italian language|Italian]] infinitives end in ''-are'', ''-ere'', ''-rre'' (rare), or ''-ire'' (which is still identical to the Latin forms), and in ''-arsi'', ''-ersi'', ''-rsi'', ''-irsi'' for the reflexive forms. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], infinitives end in ''-ar'', ''-er'', or ''-ir'', while similarly in [[French language|French]] they typically end in ''-re'', ''-er'', ''oir'', and ''-ir''. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], both short and long-form infinitives exist; the so-called \"long infinitives\" end in ''-are, -ere, -ire'' and in modern speech are used exclusively as verbal nouns. Verbs that cannot be converted into the [[noun|nominal]] long infinitive are very rare<ref>{{citation |url=http://ebooks.unibuc.ro/filologie/dindelegan/2.pdf |editor-last=Pan\u0103 Dindelegan |editor-first=Gabriela |chapter=Aspecte ale substantiviz\u0103rii \u00een rom\u00e2na actual\u0103. Forme de manifestare a substantiviz\u0103rii adjectivului|first=Gabriela|last=Pan\u0103 Dindelegan |language=Romanian |title=Aspecte ale dinamicii limbii rom\u00e2ne actuale II |place=Bucharest|publisher=University of Bucharest |isbn=973-575-825-3|date=2004}}</ref>). The \"short infinitives\" used in verbal contexts (e.g., after an auxiliary verb) have the endings ''-a'',''-ea'', ''-e'', and ''-i'' (basically removing the ending in \"-re\"). In Romanian, the infinitive is usually replaced by a clause containing the conjunction ''s\u0103'' plus the subjunctive mood. The only verb that is modal in common modern Romanian is the verb ''a putea'', to be able to. However, in popular speech the infinitive after ''a putea'' is also increasingly replaced by the subjunctive.\n\nIn all Romance languages, infinitives can also form nouns.\n\nLatin infinitives challenged several of the generalizations about infinitives. They did inflect for [[Grammatical voice|voice]] (''amare'', \"to love\", ''amari'', to be loved) and for tense (''amare'', \"to love\", ''amavisse'', \"to have loved\"), and allowed for an overt expression of the subject (''video Socratem currere'', \"I see Socrates running\"). See {{slink|Latin conjugation|Infinitives}}.\n\nRomance languages inherited from Latin the possibility of an overt expression of the subject (as in Italian ''vedo Socrate correre''). Moreover, the \"'''inflected infinitive'''\" (or \"personal infinitive\") found in Portuguese and [[Galician language|Galician]] inflects for person and number. These, alongside Sardinian, are the only [[Indo-European languages]] that allow infinitives to take person and number endings. This helps to make infinitive clauses very common in these languages; for example, the English finite clause ''in order that you/she/we have...'' would be translated to Portuguese like ''para ter'''es'''/ela ter/ter'''mos'''...'' (Portuguese is a [[null-subject language]]). The Portuguese personal infinitive has no proper tenses, only aspects (imperfect and perfect), but tenses can be expressed using [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] structures. For instance, ''even though you sing/have sung/are going to sing'' could be translated to ''apesar de cantares/teres cantado/ires cantar''.\n\nOther Romance languages (including Spanish, Romanian, Catalan, and some Italian dialects) allow uninflected infinitives to combine with overt nominative subjects. For example, Spanish ''al abrir '''yo''' los ojos'' (\"when I opened my eyes\") or ''sin '''yo''' saberlo'' (\"without my knowing about it\").<ref>{{cite thesis |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4097236/Teza-doctorala-despre-infinitiv-in-limbile-romanice |title=Pragmatic Causation in the Rise of the Romance Prepositional Infinitive: A statistically-based study with special reference to Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian|first=Kim|last=Schulte|date=2004|pages=153-70|type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |isbn=978-3-03911-327-9 |title=Prepositional Infinitives in Romance: A Usage-based Approach to Syntactic  Change |series=Studies in Historical Linguistics |volume=3 |first=Kim|last=Schulte|date=2007|pages=73\u201384|place=Berne/Oxford|publisher=Peter Lang}}</ref>\n\n==Hellenic languages==\n\n===Ancient Greek===\n{{main|infinitive (Ancient Greek)}}\nIn [[Ancient Greek]] the infinitive has four tenses (present, future, aorist, perfect) and three voices (active, middle, passive).

To see this, consider the [[ancient Greek]] ''\u1f10\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd'' \u201cI want to write\u201d. In [[modern Greek]] this become ''\u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03c9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9'' \u201cI want <u>that</u> I write\u201d. In modern Greek, the infinitive has thus changed form and function and is used mainly in the formation of periphrastic tense forms and not with an article or alone. Instead of the Ancient Greek infinitive system ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9'', Modern Greek uses only the form ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9'', a development of the ancient Greek aorist infinitive ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b1\u03b9''. This form is also invariable. The modern Greek infinitive has only two forms according to voice: for example, ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9'' for the active voice and ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6(\u03c4)\u03b5\u03af'' for the passive voice (coming from the ancient passive aorist infinitive ''\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9'').\n\n== Balto-Slavic languages ==\n\nThe infinitive in [[Russian language|Russian]] usually ends in ''-t\u2019'' (\u0442\u044c) preceded by a [[thematic vowel]], or ''-ti'' (\u0442\u0438), if not preceded by one; some verbs have a stem ending in a consonant and change the ''t'' to ''\u010d\u2019'', like ''*mogt\u2019 \u2192 mo\u010d\u2019'' (*\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0442\u044c \u2192 \u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c) \"can\". Some other [[Balto-Slavic languages]] have the infinitive typically ending in, for example, ''-\u0107'' (sometimes ''-c'') in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''-t\u2019'' in [[Slovak language|Slovak]], ''-t'' (formerly ''-ti'') in [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] (with a handful ending in -s on the latter), ''-ty'' (-\u0442\u0438) in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], -\u0446\u044c (''-ts''') in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. Lithuanian infinitives end in -''ti'', [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] end on -''ti'' or -''\u010di'', and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] on -''ti'' or -''\u0107i''.\n\n[[Serbian language|Serbian]] officially retains infinitives -''ti'' or -''\u0107i'', but is more flexible than the other slavic languages in breaking the infinitive through a clause. The infinitive nevertheless remains the dictionary form. \n\n[[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] have lost the infinitive altogether except in a handful of frozen expressions where it is the same as the 3rd person singular aorist form. Almost all expressions where an infinitive may be used in Bulgarian are [[Balkan_sprachbund#Avoidance_or_loss_of_infinitive|listed here]]; neverthess in all cases a subordinate clause is the more usual form. For that reason, the present first-person singular conjugation is the dictionary form in Bulgarian, while Macedonian uses the third person singular form of the verb in present tense.\n\n== Hebrew ==\n\n[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has ''two'' infinitives, the infinitive absolute and the infinitive construct. The infinitive construct is used after prepositions and is inflected with pronominal endings to indicate its subject or object: ''bikht\u014dbh hass\u014dph\u0113r'' \"when the scribe wrote\", ''ahare lekht\u014d'' \"after his going\". When the infinitive construct is preceded by {{Hebrew|\u05dc}} (''l\u0259-'', ''li-'', ''l\u0101-'', ''lo-'') \"to\", it has a similar meaning to the English ''to''-infinitive, and this is its most frequent use in Modern Hebrew. The infinitive absolute is used for verb focus and emphasis, like in {{Hebrew|\u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea}} ''m\u014dth y\u0101m\u016bth'' (literally \"a dying he will die\"; figuratively, \"he shall indeed/surely die\").<ref>{{cite book |first=Scott N.|last=Callaham|title=Modality and the Biblical Hebrew Infinitive Absolute|series=Abhandlungen f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes|volume=71 |isbn=978-3-447-06158-2|place=Wiesbaden|publisher=Harrassowitz|date=2010}}</ref> This usage is commonplace in the Bible, but in Modern Hebrew it is restricted to high-flown literary works.\n\nNote, however, that the ''to''-infinitive of Hebrew is not the [[lemma (morphology)|dictionary form]]; that is the third person singular perfect form.\n\n== Finnish ==\n{{main article|Finnish verb conjugation}}\nThe Finnish grammatical tradition includes many non-finite forms that are generally labeled as (numbered) infinitives although many of these are functionally [[converb]]s. To form the so-called first infinitive, the strong form of the root (without [[consonant gradation]] or epenthetic 'e') is used, and these changes occur:\n# the root is suffixed with ''-ta/-t\u00e4'' according to [[vowel harmony]]\n# consonant elision takes place if applicable, e.g., ''juoks+ta'' \u2192 ''juosta''\n# assimilation of clusters violating sonority hierarchy if applicable, e.g., ''nuol+ta'' \u2192 ''nuolla'', ''sur+ta'' \u2192 ''surra''\n# 't' weakens to 'd' after diphthongs, e.g., ''juo+ta'' \u2192 ''juoda''\n# 't' elides if intervocalic, e.g., ''kirjoitta+ta'' \u2192 ''kirjoittaa''\n\nAs such, it is inconvenient for dictionary use, because the imperative would be closer to the root word. Nevertheless, dictionaries use the first infinitive.\n\nThere are also four other infinitives, plus a \"long\" form of the first:\n* The long first infinitive is ''-kse-'' and must have a personal suffix appended to it. It has the general meaning of \"in order to [do something], e.g., ''kirjoittaakseni'' \"in order for me to write [something]\".\n* The second infinitive is formed by replacing the final ''-a/-\u00e4'' of the first infinitive with ''e''. It can take the inessive and instructive cases to create forms like ''kirjoittaessa'' \"while writing\".\n* The third infinitive is formed by adding ''-ma'' to the first infinitive, which alone creates an \"agent\" form: ''kirjoita-'' becomes ''kirjoittama''. The third infinitive is technically a noun (denoting the act of performing some verb), so case suffixes identical to those attached to ordinary Finnish nouns allow for other expressions using the third infinitive, e.g., ''kirjoittamalla'' \"by writing\".\n** A personal suffix can then be added to this form to indicate the ''agent participle'', such that ''kirjoittamani kirja'' = \"The book that I wrote.\"\n* The fourth infinitive adds ''-minen'' to the first to form a noun that has the connotation of \"the process of [doing something]\", e.g., ''kirjoittaminen'' \"[the process of] writing\". It, too, can be inflected like other Finnish nouns that end in ''-nen''.\n* The fifth infinitive adds ''-maisilla-'' to the first, and like the long first infinitive, must take a possessive suffix. It has to do with being \"about to [do something]\" and may also imply that the act was cut off or interrupted, e.g., ''kirjoittamaisillasi'' \"you were about to write [but something interrupted you]\". This form is more commonly replaced by the third infinitive in adessive case, usually also with a possessive suffix (thus ''kirjoittamallasi'').\nNote that all of these must change to reflect vowel harmony, so the fifth infinitive (with a third-person suffix) of ''hyp\u00e4t\u00e4'' \"jump\" is ''hypp\u00e4\u00e4m\u00e4isill\u00e4\u00e4n'' \"he was about to jump\", not ''*hypp\u00e4\u00e4maisillaan''.\n\n== Seri ==\n\nThe [[Seri language]] of northwestern Mexico has infinitival forms used in two constructions (with the verb meaning 'want' and with the verb meaning 'be able'). The infinitive is formed by adding a prefix to the stem: either ''iha-'' {{IPA|[i\u0294a-]}} (plus a vowel change of certain vowel-initial stems) if the complement clause is [[transitive verb|transitive]], or ''ica-'' {{IPA|[ika-]}} (and no vowel change) if the complement clause is [[intransitive verb|intransitive]]. The infinitive shows agreement in number with the controlling subject. Examples are: ''icatax ihmiimzo'' 'I want to go', where ''icatax'' is the singular infinitive of the verb 'go' (singular root is ''-atax''), and ''icalx hamiimcajc'' 'we want to go', where ''icalx'' is the plural infinitive. Examples of the transitive infinitive: ''ihaho'' 'to see it/him/her/them' (root ''-aho''), and ''ihacta'' 'to look at it/him/her/them' (root ''-oocta'').\n\n== Translation to languages without an infinitive ==\n\nIn languages without an infinitive, the infinitive is translated either as a ''that''-clause or as a [[verbal noun]]. For example, in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] the sentence \"I want to write a book\" is translated as either ''ur\u012bdu an aktuba kit\u0101ban'' (lit. \"I want that I write a book\", with a verb in the [[subjunctive mood]]) or ''ur\u012bdu kit\u0101bata kit\u0101bin'' (lit. \"I want the writing of a book\", with the ''masdar'' or verbal noun), and in [[Arabic language|Levantine Colloquial Arabic]] ''biddi aktub kit\u0101b'' (subordinate clause with verb in subjunctive).\n\nEven in languages that have infinitives, similar constructions are sometimes necessary where English would allow the infinitive. For example, in French the sentence \"I want you to come\" translates to ''Je veux que vous veniez'' (lit. \"I want that you come\", with ''come'' being in the subjunctive mood).  However, \"I want to come\" is simply ''Je veux venir'', using the infinitive, just as in English. In Russian, sentences such as \"I want you to leave\" do not use an infinitive. Rather, they use the conjunction \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \"in order to/so that\" with the past tense form (most probably remnant of subjunctive) of the verb: ''\u042f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0432\u044b \u0443\u0448\u043b\u0438'' (literally, \"I want so that you left\").\n\n== See also ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n*[[Auxiliary verb]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Gerund]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n*[[Split infinitive]]\n*[[Verbal noun]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n{{lexical categories|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Parts of speech]]\n[[Category:Syntactic entities]]\n[[Category:Verb types]]", "sha1": "tuhclz5e9g9fskwu7vd95b2thuqxhea"}}, {"title": "Intellectual Property law", "ns": "0", "id": "15255", "redirect": {"title": "Intellectual property"}, "revision": {"id": "835812626", "parentid": "835545265", "timestamp": "2018-04-10T22:34:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[Intellectual property]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Intellectual property]]", "sha1": "2f7i8yxy910yd8c5lvl4e9t0a6bl00s"}}, {"title": "Immaculate Conception", "ns": "0", "id": "15256", "revision": {"id": "865418582", "parentid": "865381034", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T20:37:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lipsio", "id": "11388421"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Fixed an erroneous repetition of a word.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n{{redirect-multi|3|Immaculata|Immacolata|Mary Immaculate}}\n{{Infobox saint\n|name=Immaculate Conception of Mary\n|feast_day=December 8 (Roman Rite)<br>December 9 (Byzantine Rite)\n|venerated_in={{plainlist|\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n* Some [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]es\n* [[Anglican Communion]]}}\n|image=Murillo immaculate conception.jpg\n|imagesize=250px\n|caption=''La Pur\u00edsima Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n''<br />by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]], 1678, now in [[Museo del Prado]], Spain.''\n|approval=Pope Pius IX\n|attributes=crescent moon, halo of twelve stars, blue robe, [[putti]], serpent underfoot, [[Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary|Assumption into heaven]]\n|patronage={{plainlist|\n* [[Brazil]]\n* [[Korea]]\n* [[Macau]]\n* [[Nicaragua]]\n* [[Paraguay]]\n* [[Philippines]]\n* [[Portugal]]\n* [[Spain]]\n* [[United States]]\n* [[Uruguay]]}}\n}}\nThe '''Immaculate Conception''' is the [[Human fertilization|conception]] of the [[Virgin Mary]] free from [[original sin]] by virtue of the merits of her son [[Jesus Christ]].

Beginning with St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism).  St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ''prokathartheisa'' (prepurified). Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.<ref>Patrologia Graeca 36: 326B 41-42; idem, 36: 633C 7-8</ref> Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.<ref>Brian Daley, \"Gregory of Nazianzus\", ''The Early Christian Church Fathers'', New York (2006), pp. 115-118.</ref> Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \"Conception of St. Ann\" (i.e., of the ''Theotokos'' in her womb) was becoming popular. After this period, the \"purification\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas<ref>Nicolas Cabasilas (\u20201371?). ''Hom\u00e9lies sur la Nativit\u00e9, L'Annonciation et la Dormition de la Sainte Vierge'', ed. M. Jugie (Patrologia Orientalis 19), Turnhout 1990, pp. 456-512 (ch. 10, lines 1-8): \"If there are some of the holy doctors who say that the Virgin is 'prepurified (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9)' by the Spirit, then it is yet necessary to think that 'purification (\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd)' (i.e. an addition of graces) is intended by these authors, and these [doctors] say that this is the way the angels are 'purified', with respect to whom there is nothing knavish.\"</ref> and Joseph Bryennius).<ref>Joseph Bryennius, ''\u0399\u1f60\u03c3\u1fc6\u03c6 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0392\u03c1\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03b5\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1'', vol. 3, ed.

It is also agreed that \"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\".<ref name=Holweck/> But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \"in every respect holy\", \"in all things unstained\", \"super-innocent\", and \"singularly holy\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \"the earth before it was accursed\". The well-known words of St. [[Augustine]] (d. 430) may be cited: \"As regards the mother of God,\" he says, \"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \"of every sort\" (''omni ex parte'').<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nAlthough the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians,<ref>Brian Reynolds, Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods, vol. 1 (NY: New City Press, 2012), 348-353.</ref> it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East. Although hymnographers and scholars, like the Emperor Justinian I, were accustomed to call Mary \"prepurified\" in their poetic and credal statements, the first point of departure for more fully commenting on Nazianzen's meaning occurs in Sophronius of Jerusalem.<ref>Sophronios of Jerusalem, In Sanctissimae Deiparae Annuntiationem (Patrologia Graeca 87.3:3248A 24): \"\u039f\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b7\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u1f10\u03ba\u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03ce\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.\" N.B., \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 ''oudeis kata se prokekathartai'' was rendered in Latin as ''nemo, sicut tu, purificante gratia praeoccupatus est''.</ref> In other places Sophronius explains that the Theotokos was already immaculate, when she was \"purified\" at the Annunciation and goes so far as to note that John the Baptist is literally \"holier than all 'Men' born of woman\" since Mary's surpassing holiness signifies that she was holier than even John after his sanctification in utero.<ref>Sophronios of Jerusalem, In Sanctissimae Deiparae Annuntiationem (Patrologia Graeca, 87.3: 3273D 43): \"\u03a0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f05\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c3\u1f72, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u1f00\u03bc\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd.\"; idem, Encomium in S.

John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them\". This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan.<ref>\"The air, the fiery ether, the sky would have been made holy by the ascent of her spirit, as earth was sanctified by the deposition of her body. Even water had its share in the blessing: for she was washed in pure water, which did not so much cleanse her as it was itself consecrated.\" See John Damascene, ''On the Holy and Glorious Dormition and Transformation of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God and Ever-Virgin by Our Holy Father John, Monk of Damascus and Son of Mansour''. Homily 2, in ''On the Dormition of Mary: Early Patristic Homilies'', tr. B. Daley (Crestwood, NY :1998), 215.</ref> The Damascene's hymnongraphy and ''De fide Orthodoxa'' explicitly use Mary's \"pre-purification\" as a key to understanding her absolute holiness and unsullied human nature. In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \"all pure seed\" of Joachim and the womb \"wider than heaven\" of St. Ann.<ref>Christiaan Kappes, ''The Immaculate Conception: Why Thomas Aquinas Denied, While John Duns Scotus, Gregory Palamas, and Mark Eugenicus Professed the Absolute Immaculate Existence of Mary'' (Bedford, MA: Academy of the Immaculate, 2014), pp. 39-61</ref>\n\n===Medieval dispute about the doctrine===\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless. It is doubtful, however, whether he was using the term \"conception\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?\" and stronger expressions follow, showing that he is speaking of the mother and not of the child.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nSaint [[Thomas Aquinas]] refused to concede the Immaculate Conception, on the ground that, unless the Blessed Virgin had at one time or other been one of the sinful, she could not justly be said to have been redeemed by Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=summa+theologica+volume&hl=en&ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSaint [[Bonaventure]] (d. 1274), second only to Saint Thomas in his influence on the Christian schools of his age, hesitated to accept it for a similar reason.<ref name=EB1911/> He believed that Mary was completely free from sin, but that she was not given this grace at the instant of her conception.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/faith/Teachings/marya2.htm|title=Mary's Immaculate Conception|publisher=}}</ref>{{full citationcitation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe celebrated [[John Duns Scotus]] (d. 1308), a [[Friar Minor]] like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, that from a rational point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, as to say that she first contracted it and then was delivered.<ref name=EB1911/> Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it was the result of a more perfect redemption granted her because of her special role in salvation history.<ref>''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi'' by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pages 896\u2013898</ref>\n\nThe arguments of Scotus, combined with a better acquaintance with the language of the early Fathers, gradually prevailed in the schools of the Western Church. In 1387 the university of Paris strongly condemned the opposite view.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nScotus's arguments remained controversial, however, particularly among the Dominicans, who were willing enough to celebrate Mary's ''sanctificatio'' (being made free from sin) but, following the Dominican Thomas Aquinas' arguments, continued to insist that her sanctification could not have occurred until after her conception.<ref name=Holweck/>\n\nPopular opinion remained firmly behind the celebration of Mary's conception. In 1439, the [[Council of Basel]], which is not reckoned an [[ecumenical council]], stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith. By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position.<ref name=Holweck/><ref name=Schroedel/>\n\nThe papal bull defining the dogma, ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' (1854), mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:15}} as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him. It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary's \"wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence\" \"in that ark of Noah, which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven, by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended, and on whose top the Lord himself leaned;<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|28:12}}</ref> in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides, which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:2}}</ref> in that impregnable tower before the enemy, from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong;<ref>{{bibleverse||Song|4:4}}</ref> in that garden enclosed on all sides, which cannot be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots;<ref>{{bibleverse||Song|4:12}}</ref> in that resplendent city of God, which has its foundations on the holy mountains;<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalm|87:1}}</ref> in that most august temple of God, which, radiant with divine splendours, is full of the glory of God;<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:1-4}}</ref> and in very many other biblical types of this kind.\"\n\nThe bull recounts that the Fathers interpreted the angel's address to Mary, \"highly favoured one\" or \"full of grace\",<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|1:28}}</ref> as indicating that \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction\"; they \"frequently compare her to Eve while yet a virgin, while yet innocence, while yet incorrupt, while not yet deceived by the deadly snares of the most treacherous serpent\".\n\n===Definition of the dogma===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876.

To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The 14th and 15th centuries were the highpoint of these depictions.  Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171</ref> \n\nThe 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R.

The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.<ref>''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3-9</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nFile:Piero di Cosimo 057.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo|di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

The British-Irish Council is the expression of a relationship that at the origin of the Anglo-Irish process in 1981 was sometimes given the name Iona, islands of the North Atlantic, and sometimes Council of the Isles, with its evocation of the Lords of the Isles of the 14th and 15th centuries who spanned the North Channel.

The IntelDX4 was an OEM-only product, but the DX4 Overdrive could be purchased at a retail store.\n\nThe IntelDX4 microprocessor is mostly [[Pin-compatibility|pin-compatible]] with the [[80486]], but requires a lower 3.3&nbsp;V supply.  Normal 80486 and DX2 processors use a 5&nbsp;V supply; plugging a DX4 into an unmodified socket will destroy it. Motherboards lacking support for the 3.3&nbsp;V CPUs can sometimes make use of them using a voltage regulator (VRM) that fits between the socket and the CPU.\n\n==S-specs==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It has been held since 1995. It is intended for fairly short games, as judges are only allowed to spend two hours playing a game before deciding how many points to award it. The competition has been described as the \"[[Super Bowl]]\" of interactive fiction.<ref name=\"wsj-20051115\"/>\n\n== Organization ==\nThe competition is organized by ''Stephen Granade''.<ref name=\"wiredfilm-20060817\"/> Although the first competition had separate sections for [[Inform]] and [[TADS]] games, subsequent competitions have not been divided into sections and are open to games produced by any method, provided that the software used to play the game is freely available. Anyone can judge the games, and anyone can donate a prize. Almost always, there are enough prizes donated that anyone who enters will get one. Entries are required to be released as [[freeware]] or [[public domain]], reflecting the general non-profit ethos of the IF community.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn addition to the main competition, the entries take part in the Miss Congeniality contest, where the participating authors vote for three games (not including their own). This was started in 1998 to distribute that year's surplus prizes; this additional contest has remained unchanged since then, even without the original reason for its existence.\n\nIn 2016, operation of the competition was taken over by the [https://iftechfoundation.org/ Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation].<ref name=\"gamasutra-20160630\"/><ref name=\"rockpapershotgun-20161207\"/><ref name=\"rockpapershotgun-20170703\"/>\n\nThe competition differs from the [[XYZZY Awards]], as authors must specifically submit games to the Interactive Fiction Competition, but all games released in the past year are eligible for the XYZZY Awards. Many games win awards in both competitions.\n\n== Winners ==\nThe following is a list of first place winners to date:\n*'''2017:''' ''The Wizard Sniffer'' by Buster Hudson\n*'''2016:''' ''Detectiveland'' by [[Robin Johnson]]\n*'''2015:''' ''Brain Guzzlers from Beyond!'' by Steph Cherrywell\n*'''2014:''' ''Hunger Daemon'' by Sean M.

the activity of obtaining [[information system]] resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.  Searches can be based on [[full-text search|full-text]] or other content-based indexing. Information retrieval is the science of searching for information in a document, searching for documents themselves, and also searching for [[metadata]] that describe data, and for databases of texts, images or sounds.\n\nAutomated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called [[information overload]]. An IR systems is a software that provide access to books, journals and other documents, stores them and manages the document. [[Web search engine]]s are the most visible [[Information retrieval applications|IR applications]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nAn information retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In information retrieval a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevancy]].\n\nAn object is an entity that is represented by information in a content collection or [[database]]. User queries are matched against the database information. However, as opposed to classical SQL queries of a database, in information retrieval the results returned may or may not match the query, so results are typically ranked. This ranking of results is a key difference of information retrieval searching compared to database searching.<ref>Jansen, B. J. and Rieh, S. (2010) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_theoretical_constructs.pdf The Seventeen Theoretical Constructs of Information Searching and Information Retrieval].

Often the documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates or [[metadata]].\n\nMost IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database matches the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.<ref name=\"Frakes1992\">{{cite book |last=Frakes |first=William B.|last2=Baeza-Yates|first2=Ricardo |title=Information Retrieval Data Structures & Algorithms |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc. |year=1992 |isbn=0-13-463837-9 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928060217/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13742235/Information-Retrieval-Data-Structures-Algorithms-William-B-Frakes |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Rquote|right|there is ... a machine called the Univac ... whereby letters and figures are coded as a pattern of magnetic spots on a long steel tape.

Automated information retrieval systems were introduced in the 1950s: one even featured in the 1957 romantic comedy, [[Desk Set]]. In the 1960s, the first large information retrieval research group was formed by [[Gerard Salton]] at Cornell. By the 1970s several different retrieval techniques had been shown to perform well on small [[text corpora]] such as the Cranfield collection (several thousand documents).<ref name=\"Singhal2001\" /> Large-scale retrieval systems, such as the Lockheed Dialog system, came into use early in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1992, the US Department of Defense along with the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), cosponsored the [[Text Retrieval Conference]] (TREC) as part of the TIPSTER text program. The aim of this was to look into the information retrieval community by supplying the infrastructure that was needed for evaluation of text retrieval methodologies on a very large text collection. This catalyzed research on methods that [[scalability|scale]] to huge corpora. The introduction of [[web search engine]]s has boosted the need for very large scale retrieval systems even further.\n\n== Model types ==\n[[File:Information-Retrieval-Models.png|thumb|500px|Categorization of IR-models (translated from [[:de:Informationsr\u00fcckgewinnung#Klassifikation von Modellen zur Repr\u00e4sentation nat\u00fcrlichsprachlicher Dokumente|German entry]], original source [http://www.logos-verlag.de/cgi-bin/engbuchmid?isbn=0514&lng=eng&id= Dominik Kuropka]).]]\nFor effectively retrieving relevant documents by IR strategies, the documents are typically transformed into a suitable representation. Each retrieval strategy incorporates a specific model for its document representation purposes. The picture on the right illustrates the relationship of some common models. In the picture, the models are categorized according to two dimensions: the mathematical basis and the properties of the model.\n\n=== First dimension: mathematical basis ===\n* ''Set-theoretic'' models represent documents as [[Set (mathematics)|set]]s of words or phrases. Similarities are usually derived from set-theoretic operations on those sets. Common models are:\n** [[Standard Boolean model]]\n** [[Extended Boolean model]]\n** [[Fuzzy retrieval]]\n* ''Algebraic models'' represent documents and queries usually as vectors, matrices, or tuples. The similarity of the query vector and document vector is represented as a scalar value.\n** [[Vector space model]]\n** [[Generalized vector space model]]\n** [[Topic-based vector space model|(Enhanced) Topic-based Vector Space Model]]\n** [[Extended Boolean model]]\n** [[Latent semantic indexing]] a.k.a. [[latent semantic analysis]]\n* ''Probabilistic models'' treat the process of document retrieval as a probabilistic inference. Similarities are computed as probabilities that a document is relevant for a given query. Probabilistic theorems like the [[Bayes' theorem]] are often used in these models.\n** [[Binary Independence Model]]\n** [[Probabilistic relevance model]] on which is based the [[Probabilistic relevance model (BM25)|okapi (BM25)]] relevance function\n** [[Uncertain inference]]\n** [[Language model]]s\n** [[Divergence-from-randomness model]]\n** [[Latent Dirichlet allocation]]\n* ''Feature-based retrieval models'' view documents as vectors of values of ''feature functions'' (or just ''features'') and seek the best way to combine these features into a single relevance score, typically by [[learning to rank]] methods. Feature functions are arbitrary functions of document and query, and as such can easily incorporate almost any other retrieval model as just another feature.\n\n=== Second dimension: properties of the model ===\n* ''Models without term-interdependencies'' treat different terms/words as independent. This fact is usually represented in vector space models by the [[orthogonality]] assumption of term vectors or in probabilistic models by an [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independency]] assumption for term variables.\n* ''Models with immanent term interdependencies'' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms. However the degree of the interdependency between two terms is defined by the model itself. It is usually directly or indirectly derived (e.g. by [[dimension reduction|dimensional reduction]]) from the [[co-occurrence]] of those terms in the whole set of documents.\n* ''Models with transcendent term interdependencies'' allow a representation of interdependencies between terms, but they do not allege how the interdependency between two terms is defined. They rely an external source for the degree of interdependency between two terms. (For example, a human or sophisticated algorithms.)\n\n== Performance and correctness measures ==\n{{main|Evaluation measures (information retrieval)}}\nThe evaluation of an information retrieval system' is the process of assessing how well a system meets the information needs of its users. In general, measurement considers a collection of documents to be searched and a search query. Traditional evaluation metrics, designed for [[Standard Boolean model|Boolean retrieval]]{{huh|date=June 2018}} or top-k retrieval, include [[precision and recall]]. All measures assume a [[ground truth]] notion of relevancy: every document is known to be either relevant or non-relevant to a particular query. In practice, queries may be [[ill-posed]] and there may be different shades of relevancy.\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* Before the '''1900s'''\n*: '''1801''': [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] invents the [[Jacquard loom]], the first machine to use punched cards to control a sequence of operations.\n*: '''1880s''': [[Herman Hollerith]] invents an electro-mechanical data tabulator using punch cards as a machine readable medium.\n*: '''1890''' Hollerith [[Punched cards|cards]], [[keypunch]]es and [[Tabulating machine|tabulators]] used to process the [[1890 US Census]] data.\n* '''1920s-1930s'''\n*: [[Emanuel Goldberg]] submits patents for his \"Statistical Machine\u201d a document search engine that used photoelectric cells and pattern recognition to search the metadata on rolls of microfilmed documents.\n* '''1940s\u20131950s'''\n*: '''late 1940s''': The US military confronted problems of indexing and retrieval of wartime scientific research documents captured from Germans.\n*:: '''1945''': [[Vannevar Bush]]'s ''[[As We May Think]]'' appeared in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''.\n*:: '''1947''': [[Hans Peter Luhn]] (research engineer at IBM since 1941) began work on a mechanized punch card-based system for searching chemical compounds.\n*: '''1950s''': Growing concern in the US for a \"science gap\" with the USSR motivated, encouraged funding and provided a backdrop for mechanized literature searching systems ([[Allen Kent]] ''et al.'') and the invention of citation indexing ([[Eugene Garfield]]).\n*: '''1950''': The term \"information retrieval\" was coined by [[Calvin Mooers]].<ref>Mooers, Calvin N.; ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034570591;view=1up;seq=3 The Theory of Digital Handling of Non-numerical Information and its Implications to Machine Economics]'' (Zator Technical Bulletin No. 48), cited in {{cite journal|last1=Fairthorne|first1=R.

The Tribunal established the legal framework for its operations by adopting the rules of procedure and evidence, as well as its rules of detention and directive for the assignment of defense counsel. Together these rules established a legal aid system for the Tribunal. As the ICTY is part of the United Nations and as it was the first ''international'' court for ''criminal'' justice, the development of a juridical infrastructure was considered quite a challenge. However after the first year the first ICTY judges had drafted and adopted all the rules for court proceedings.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Rachel S.

The ICTY hired now many staff members. By July 1994 there were sufficient staff members in the office of the prosecutor to begin field investigations and by November 1994 the first indictment was presented and confirmed. In 1995, the entire staff numbered more than 200 persons and came from all over the world. Moreover, some governments assigned their legally trained people to the ICTY.\n\n=== Operation ===\n[[File:ICTY.JPG|thumb|The Tribunal building in The Hague|250px]]\nIn 1994 the first indictment was issued against the Bosnian-Serb concentration camp commander Dragan Nikoli\u0107. This was followed on 13 February 1995 by two indictments comprising 21 individuals which were issued against a group of 21 Bosnian-Serbs charged with committing atrocities against Muslim and Croat civilian prisoners. While the war in the former Yugoslavia was still raging, the ICTY prosecutors showed that an international court was viable. However, no accused was arrested.<ref>Pronk, E. ''The ICTY and the people from the former Yugoslavia \u2013 a reserved relationship.''<!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nThe court confirmed eight indictments against 46 individuals and issued arrest warrants. Bosnian Serb indictee [[Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107]] became the subject of the Tribunal's first trial. Tadi\u0107 was arrested by German police in [[Munich]] in 1994 for his alleged actions in the Prijedor region in Bosnia-Herzegovina (especially his actions in the Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm detention camps).

In addition to Du\u0161ko Tadic, by June 1996 the tribunal had [[Tihomir Bla\u0161ki\u0107]], [[Dra\u017een Erdemovi\u0107]], [http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/index.php?id=6112 Zejnil Delali\u0107], [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mucic/cis/en/cis_mucic_al_en.pdf Zdravko Muci\u0107], [http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mucic/cis/en/cis_mucic_al_en.pdf Esad Land\u017eo] and [[Hazim Deli\u0107]] in custody.

The ICTY would also conduct and complete all appeal proceedings for which the notice of appeal against the judgement or sentence was filed before 1 July 2013.

[[Rectangle|Rectangular]] paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} has the unique property that, when cut or folded in half midway between its shorter sides, each half has the same {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio and half the [[area]] of the whole sheet before it was divided. Equivalently, if one lays two same-sized sheets paper with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} side-by-side along their longer side, they form a larger rectangle with the aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} and double the area of each individual sheet.\n\nThe ISO system of paper sizes exploit these properties of the {{sqrt|2}} aspect ratio. In each series of sizes (for example, series A), the largest size is numbered 0 (for example, A0), and each successive size (for example, A1, A2, etc.) has half the area of the preceding sheet and can be cut by halving the length of the preceding size sheet. The new measurement is rounded down to the nearest millimetre.  A folded [[brochure]] can be made by using a sheet of the next larger size (for example, an A4 sheet is folded in half to make a brochure with size A5 pages. An office [[photocopier]] or printer can be designed to reduce a page from A4 to A5 or to enlarge a page from A4 to A3. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down to fit one A4 sheet without excess empty paper.\n\nThis system also simplifies calculating the weight of paper. Under [[ISO 536]], paper's [[grammage]] is defined as a sheet's weight in [[gram]]s (g) per area in [[square metre]]s (abbreviated g/m<sup>2</sup> or gsm).<ref name=\"ISO 536\">{{Cite web\n|author=International Organization for Standardization |author-link=International Organization for Standardization\n|title=ISO 536:2012(en): Paper and board \u2014 Determination of grammage\n|edition=3 |at=\u00a7&nbsp; 3.1 note 1.\n|work=ISO Browsing Platform\n|date=2012}}</ref> Since an A0 sheet has an area of 1&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, its weight in grams is the same as its grammage. One can derive the grammage of other sizes by [[Division  (mathematics)|arithmetic division]] in g/m<sup>2</sup>. A standard A4 sheet made from 80&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup> paper weighs 5&nbsp;g, as it is {{sfrac|1|16}} (four halvings, ignoring rounding) of an A0 page. Thus the weight, and the associated postage rate, can be easily approximated by counting the number of sheets used.\n\nISO 216 and its related standards were first published between 1975 and 1995:\n* ISO 216:2007, defining the A and B series of paper sizes\n* ISO 269:1985, defining the C series for envelopes\n* ISO 217:2013, defining the RA and SRA series of raw (\"untrimmed\") paper sizes\n\n==A series==\n\nPaper in the A series format has an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} (\u2248 1.414, when ignoring rounding). A0 is defined so that it has an area of 1 [[square metre]] before rounding to the nearest millimeter. Successive paper sizes in the series (A1, A2, A3, etc.) are defined by halving the length of the preceding paper size and rounding down, so that the long side of A(''n''+1) is the same length as the short side of A''n''. Hence, each next size is roughly half of the prior size. So, an A1 page can fit 2 A2 pages inside the same area.\n\nThe most used of this series is the size A4, which is {{cvt|210|x|297|mm |sigfig=3}} and thus almost exactly {{convert|0.0625|m2|sqin}} in area. For comparison, the [[Letter (paper size)|letter]] paper size commonly used in North America ({{convert|8+1/2|x|11|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) is about 6&nbsp;mm (0.24&nbsp;in) wider and 18&nbsp;mm (0.71&nbsp;in) shorter than A4. Then, the size of A5 paper is half of A4, as 148&nbsp;x 210&nbsp;mm (5.8 x 8.3&nbsp;in).<ref>{{cite web |title= A Paper Sizes - A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9 |date= |url= https://www.papersizes.org/a-paper-sizes.htm |website= papersizes.org |accessdate= 2018-08-02 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |title= International Paper Sizes, Dimensions, Format & Standards |date= |url= https://papersize.co/ |website= PaperSize |accessdate= 2018-10-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe geometric rationale behind the [[square root of 2]] is to maintain the aspect ratio of each subsequent rectangle after cutting or folding an A-series sheet in half, perpendicular to the larger side.  Given a rectangle with a longer side, {{math|''x''}}, and a shorter side, {{math|''y''}}, ensuring that its aspect ratio, {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}, will be the same as that of a rectangle half its size, {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which means that {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sfrac|''y''|''x''/2}}}}, which reduces to {{math|1={{sfrac|''x''|''y''}} = {{sqrt|2}}}}; in other words, an aspect ratio of 1:{{sqrt|2}}.\n\nThe formula that gives the larger border of the paper size A''n'' in metres and without rounding off is the [[geometric sequence]]:\n:<math>a_n = 2^{\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{n}{2}}.</math>\nThe paper size A''n'' thus has the dimension\n:<math>a_{n} \\times a_{n + 1}</math>\nand area (before rounding)\n:<math>2^{-n}~\\mathrm{m}^2.</math>\n\nThe measurement in millimetres of the long side of A''n'' can be calculated as\n:<math>l= \\left\\lfloor\\, \\frac{1000}{\\,2^\\frac{2n - 1}{4}\\,} + 0.2 \\,\\right\\rfloor</math>\n(brackets represent the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] function).\n\n==B series==\nThe B series is defined in the standard as follows: \"A subsidiary series of sizes is obtained by placing the [[Geometric mean|geometrical means]] between adjacent sizes of the A series in sequence.\" The use of the geometric mean  makes each step in size: B0, A0, B1, A1, B2 &hellip;  smaller than the previous one by the same factor. As with the A series, the lengths of the B series have the ratio {{sqrt|2}}, and folding one in half (and rounding down to the nearest millimeter) gives the next in the series. The shorter side of B0 is exactly 1 metre.\n\nThe measurement in millimetres of the long side of B''n'' can be calculated as\n:<math>l= \\left\\lfloor\\, \\frac{1000}{\\,2^\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\,} + 0.2 \\,\\right\\rfloor.</math>\n\nThere is also an incompatible Japanese B series which the [[Japanese Industrial Standard|JIS]] defines to have 1.5 times the area of the corresponding JIS A series (which is identical to the ISO A series).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paper-sizes.com/uncommon-paper-sizes/japanese-b-series-paper-size|title=Japanese B Series Paper Size|accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref> Thus, the lengths of JIS B series paper are {{sqrt|1.5}} \u2248 1.22 times those of A-series paper. By comparison, the lengths of ISO B series paper are {{sqrt|2|4}} \u2248 1.19 times those of A-series paper.\n\n==C series==\nThe C series formats are  geometric means between the B series and A series formats with the same number (e.g., C2 is the geometric mean between B2 and A2). The width to height ratio is {{sqrt|2}} as in the A and B series. The C series formats are used mainly for [[envelope]]s. An A4 page will fit into a C4 envelope. C series envelopes follow the same ratio principle as the A series pages. For example, if an A4 page is folded in half so that it is A5 in size, it will fit into a C5 envelope (which will be the same size as a C4 envelope folded in half). The lengths of ISO C series paper are therefore {{sqrt|2|8}} \u2248 1.09 times those of A-series paper.\n\nA, B, and C paper fit together as part of a [[geometric progression]], with ratio of successive side lengths of {{sqrt|2|8}}, though there is no size half-way between B''n'' and A(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1): A4, C4, B4, \"D4\", A3, \u2026; there is such a D-series in the [[Paper size#Swedish extensions|Swedish extensions]] to the system.\n\nThe measurement in millimetres of the long side of C''n'' can be calculated as\n:<math>l= \\left\\lfloor\\, \\frac{1000}{\\,2^\\frac{4n - 3}{8}\\,} + 0.2 \\,\\right\\rfloor.</math>\n\n==Tolerances==\nThe tolerances specified in the standard are:\n* [[\u00b1]]1.5&nbsp;mm for dimensions up to 150&nbsp;mm,\n* \u00b12.0&nbsp;mm for dimensions in the range 150 to 600&nbsp;mm, and\n* \u00b13.0&nbsp;mm for dimensions above 600&nbsp;mm.\n\nThese are related to comparison between series A, B and C.\n\n==Application==\n\nThe ISO 216 formats are organized around the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}}; two sheets next to each other together have the same ratio, sideways.  In scaled photocopying, for example, two A4 sheets reduced to A5 size fit exactly onto one A4 sheet, and an A4 sheet in magnified size onto an A3 sheet; in each case, there is neither waste nor want.\n\nThe principal countries not generally using the ISO paper sizes are the United States and Canada, which use the [[Paper size#Loose sizes|Letter, Legal and Executive system]].  Although they have also officially adopted the ISO 216 paper format, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, the Philippines, and Chile also use mostly U.S. paper sizes.\n\n[[Rectangle|Rectangular]] sheets of paper with the ratio 1:{{sqrt|2}} are popular in [[paper folding]], such as [[mathematics of paper folding|origami]], where they are sometimes called \"A4 rectangles\" or \"silver rectangles\".<ref name=\"Lister\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishorigami.info/academic/lister/a4.php|title=The A4 rectangle|last=Lister|first=David|work=The Lister List|publisher=British Origami Society|location=England|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>  In other contexts, the term \"silver rectangle\" can also refer to a rectangle in the proportion 1:(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}), known as the [[silver ratio]].\n\n==Matching technical pen widths==\nAn important adjunct to the ISO paper sizes, particularly the A series, are the technical drawing line widths specified in [[ISO 128]], and the matching technical pen widths of 0.13, 0.18, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.40, and 2.0&nbsp;mm, as specified in [[:de:ISO 9175-1|ISO 9175-1]]. Color codes are assigned to each size to facilitate easy recognition by the drafter. These sizes increase by a factor of {{sqrt|2}}, so that particular pens can be used on particular sizes of paper, and then the next smaller or larger size can be used to continue the drawing after it has been reduced or enlarged, respectively. For example, a continuous thick line on A0 size paper shall be drawn with a 0.7&nbsp;mm pen, the same line on A1 paper shall be drawn with a 0.5&nbsp;mm pen, and finally on A2, A3, or A4 paper it shall be drawn with a 0.35&nbsp;mm pen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html|title=International standard paper sizes|last1=Kuhn|first1=Markus|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Technical_drawing_pen_sizes|title=Technical drawing pen sizes|website=Designing Buildings Wiki|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrication.com/drafting/lines.html|title=Pen Sizes and Line Types|last1=Bell|first1=Steven|website=Metrication.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left\"| Linewidth (mm)\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.13\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.18\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.25\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.35\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.50\n|width=\"8%\"| 0.70\n|width=\"8%\"| 1.0\n|width=\"8%\"| 1.4\n|width=\"8%\"| 2.0\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left\"| Color\n| Violet\n| Red\n| White\n| Yellow\n| Brown\n| Blue\n| Orange\n| Green\n| Gray\n|}\n\nThe earlier [[DIN 6775]] standard upon which ISO 9175-1 is based also specified a term and symbol for easy identification of pens and drawing templates compatible with the standard, called [[:fr:micronorm|Micronorm]], which may still be found on some technical drafting equipment.\n\n==See also==\n* [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]]\n* [[Envelope sizes#International standard sizes|International standard envelope sizes]]\n* [[ISO 128]] (relating to technical drawing)\n* [[Letter (paper size)]]\n* [[Paper density]]\n* [[Paper size]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|DIN EN ISO 216}}\n* [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html International standard paper sizes]: ISO 216 details and [[Design rationale|rationale]]\n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36631 ISO 216 at iso.org]\n\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iso 216}}\n[[Category:ISO standards|#00216]]\n[[Category:Stationery]]\n[[Category:Metrication]]\n[[Category:Technical specifications]]", "sha1": "1msy52a2ipv3r66wkhgayptjaw7svze"}}, {"title": "ISO 3864", "ns": "0", "id": "15276", "revision": {"id": "834537342", "parentid": "833934408", "timestamp": "2018-04-06T07:06:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Orenburg1", "id": "10248457"}, "minor": "", "comment": "sp", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 3864''' specifies [[international standard]]s for [[safety symbol]]s.

open [[standards organization]], which develops and promotes voluntary [[Internet standard]]s, in particular the standards that comprise the [[Internet protocol suite]] (TCP/IP).<ref name=\"ripe-ietf\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ripe.net/participate/internet-governance/internet-technical-community/ietf|title=Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)|website=[[RIPE Network Coordination Centre]]|date=August 10, 2012|access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref> It has no formal membership or membership requirements. All participants and managers are volunteers, though their work is usually funded by their employers or sponsors. \n\nThe IETF started out as an activity supported by the [[U.S. federal government]], but since 1993 it has operated as a standards development function under the auspices of the [[Internet Society]], an international membership-based non-profit organization.\n\n==Organization==\nThe IETF is organized into a large number of [[working group]]s and [[Birds of a feather (computing)|informal discussion groups]] (BoFs, or Birds of a Feather), each dealing with a specific topic and operates in a bottom-up task creation mode, largely driven by these working groups.<ref name=Bradner-January1999/> Each working group has an appointed chairperson (or sometimes several co-chairs), along with a charter that describes its focus, and what and when it is expected to produce. It is open to all who want to participate, and holds discussions on an open [[Electronic mailing list|mailing list]] or at IETF meetings, where the entry fee in July 2014 was USD $650 per person.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.ietf.org/meeting/register.html|title=Register for the Next IETF Meeting|publisher=IETF|accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref>. Midst 2018 the fees are: early bird $700, late payment $875, student $150 and a one day pass for $375.\n\n[[Rough consensus]] is the primary basis for decision making. There are no formal voting procedures. Because the majority of the IETF's work is done via mailing lists, meeting attendance is not required for contributors. Each working group is intended to complete work on its topic and then disband. In some cases, the WG will instead have its charter updated to take on new tasks as appropriate.<ref name=Bradner-January1999/>\n\nThe working groups are organized into areas by subject matter. Current areas are Applications, General, Internet, Operations and Management, Real-time Applications and Infrastructure, Routing, Security, and Transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=//datatracker.ietf.org/wg/|title=Active IETF Working Groups|publisher=IETF|accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref> Each area is overseen by an ''area director'' (AD), with most areas having two co-ADs. The ADs are responsible for appointing working group chairs. The area directors, together with the IETF Chair, form the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] (IESG), which is responsible for the overall operation of the IETF. \n\nThe IETF is overseen by the [[Internet Architecture Board]] (IAB), which oversees its external relationships, and relations with the [[RFC Editor]].<ref>\"Charter of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)\", RFC 2850, B. Carpenter, May 2000. Retrieved 21 July 2014.</ref> The IAB is also jointly responsible for the [[IETF Administrative Oversight Committee]] (IAOC), which oversees the [[IETF Administrative Support Activity]] (IASA), which provides logistical, etc. support for the IETF. The IAB also manages the [[Internet Research Task Force]] (IRTF), with which the IETF has a number of cross-group relations.\n\nA Nominating Committee (NomCom) of ten randomly chosen volunteers who participate regularly at meetings is vested with the power to appoint, reappoint, and remove members of the IESG, IAB, IASA, and the IAOC.<ref>[https://www.ietf.org/nomcom/ \"IETF NomCom\"], IETF. Retrieved 21 July 2014.</ref> To date, no one has been removed by a NomCom, although several people have resigned their positions, requiring replacements.\n\nIn 1993 the IETF changed from an activity supported by the U.S. government to an independent, international activity associated with the [[Internet Society]], an international membership-based non-profit organization.<ref name=IETFandInternetSociety>[http://www.internetsociety.org/internet/what-internet/history-internet/ietf-and-internet-society \"IETF and the Internet Society\"], Vint Cerf, Internet Society, 18 July 1995. Retrieved 21 July 2014.</ref> Because the IETF itself does not have members, nor is it an organization ''per se'', the Internet Society provides the financial and legal framework for the activities of the IETF and its sister bodies (IAB, IRTF, \u2026). IETF activities are funded by meeting fees, meeting sponsors and by the Internet Society via its organizational membership and the proceeds of the [[Public Interest Registry]].<ref>[http://pir.org/about-us/history/ \"History\"], Your Public Internet Registry.

Retrieved 21 July 2014.</ref>\n\n==Meetings==\nThe first IETF meeting was attended by 21 U.S.-government-funded researchers on 16 January 1986. It was a continuation of the work of the earlier GADS Task Force. Representatives from non-governmental entities were invited to attend starting with the fourth IETF meeting in October 1986. Since that time all IETF meetings have been open to the public.<ref name=Bradner-January1999>[http://oreilly.com/openbook/opensources/book/ietf.html \"Internet Engineering Task Force\"], Scott Bradner, ''Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution'', O'Reilly, 1st Edition, January 1999, {{ISBN|1-56592-582-3}}. Retrieved 21 July 2014.</ref>\n\nInitially, the IETF met quarterly, but from 1991, it has been meeting three times a year. The initial meetings were very small, with fewer than 35 people in attendance at each of the first five meetings. The maximum attendance during the first 13 meetings was only 120 attendees. This occurred at the 12th meeting held during January 1989. These meetings have grown in both participation and scope a great deal since the early 1990s; it had a maximum attendance of 2,810 at the December 2000 IETF held in San Diego, CA. Attendance declined with industry restructuring during the early 2000s, and is currently around 1,200.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.ietf.org/meeting/past.html |title=Past Meetings |publisher=IETF |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=Bradner-January1999/>\n\nThe location for IETF meetings vary greatly. A list of past and future meeting locations can be found on the IETF meetings page.<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.ietf.org/meeting/ |title=IETF Meetings |publisher=IETF |date= |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref> The IETF strives to hold its meetings near where most of the IETF volunteers are located. For many years, the goal was three meetings a year, with two in North America and one in either Europe or Asia, alternating between them every other year. The current goal is to hold three meetings in North America, two in Europe and one in Asia during a two-year period. However, corporate sponsorship of the meetings is also an important factor and the schedule has been modified from time to time in order to decrease operational costs.\n\nThe IETF also organizes [[hackathon]]s during the IETF meetings. The focus is on implementing code that will improve standards in terms of quality and interoperability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ietf.org/hackathon/|title=IETF Hackathon|website=www.ietf.org|access-date=2017-10-23}}</ref>.\n\n==Operations==\nThe details of IETF operations have changed considerably as the organization has grown, but the basic mechanism remains publication of proposed specifications, development based on the proposals, review and independent testing by participants, and republication as a revised proposal, a draft proposal, or eventually as an Internet Standard. IETF standards are developed in an open, all-inclusive process in which any interested individual can participate. All IETF documents are freely available over the Internet and can be reproduced at will. Multiple, working, useful, interoperable implementations are the chief requirement before an IETF proposed specification can become a standard.<ref name=Bradner-January1999/> Most specifications are focused on single protocols rather than tightly interlocked systems. This has allowed the protocols to be used in many different systems, and its standards are routinely re-used by bodies which create full-fledged architectures (e.g. [[3GPP]] [[IP Multimedia Subsystem|IMS]]).\n\nBecause it relies on volunteers and uses \"[[Rough consensus|rough consensus and running code]]\" as its touchstone, results can be slow whenever the number of volunteers is either too small to make progress, or so large as to make consensus difficult, or when volunteers lack the necessary expertise. For protocols like [[SMTP]], which is used to transport e-mail for a user community in the many hundreds of millions, there is also considerable resistance to any change that is not fully backwards compatible, except for [[IPv6]]. Work within the IETF on ways to improve the speed of the standards-making process is ongoing but, because the number of volunteers with opinions on it is very great, consensus on improvements has been slow to develop.\n\nThe IETF cooperates with the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]], [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]], and other standards bodies.<ref name=IETFandInternetSociety/>\n\nStatistics are available that show who the top contributors by RFC publication are.<ref>[http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/ \"IETF document statistics (all documents)\"], Jari Arkko.

The powerful emissions of these devices can create [[electromagnetic interference]] and disrupt [[radio communication]] using the same [[frequency]], so these devices  were limited to certain bands of frequencies. In general, communications equipment operating in these bands must tolerate any interference generated by [[ISM applications]], and users have no regulatory protection from ISM device operation.\n\nDespite the intent of the original allocations, in recent years the fastest-growing uses of these bands have been for short-range, low power [[wireless communication]]s systems, since these bands can be used without a government license, as is required for transmitters on other frequencies.  [[Cordless phone]]s, [[Bluetooth]] devices, [[near field communication]] (NFC) devices, [[garage door opener]]s, [[baby monitor]]s and [[Wireless network|wireless computer networks]] ([[WiFi]]) all use the ISM frequencies, although these low power emitters are not considered ISM.\n\n==ISM bands==\nThe ISM bands are defined by the [[ITU Radio Regulations]] (article 5) in footnotes 5.138, 5.150, and 5.280 of the [[Radio Regulations]]. Individual countries' use of the bands designated in these sections may differ due to variations in national radio regulations.  Because communication devices using the ISM bands must tolerate any interference from ISM equipment, unlicensed operations are typically permitted to use these bands, since unlicensed operation typically needs to be tolerant of interference from other devices anyway.  The ISM bands share allocations with unlicensed and licensed operations; however, due to the high likelihood of harmful interference, licensed use of the bands is typically low.  In the United States, uses of the ISM bands are governed by Part 18 of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules, while [[Part 15 (FCC rules)|Part 15]] contains the rules for unlicensed communication devices, even those that share ISM frequencies. In Europe, the [[ETSI]] is responsible for regulating the use of [[Short Range Devices]], some of which operate in ISM bands.\n\n=== Frequency allocation ===\nThe allocation of radio frequencies is provided according to ''Article 5'' of the ITU Radio Regulations (edition 2012).<ref>''ITU Radio Regulations, CHAPTER II \u2013 Frequencies, ARTICLE 5 Frequency allocations, Section IV \u2013 Table of Frequency Allocations''</ref>\n\nIn order to improve harmonisation in spectrum utilisation, the majority of service-allocations stipulated in this document were incorporated in national Tables of Frequency Allocations and Utilisations which is within the responsibility of the appropriate national administration.

There was therefore some point in attempting to reach world agreement on this subject.\"\n\nRadio frequencies in the ISM bands have been used for communication purposes, although such devices may experience interference from non-communication sources. In the United States, as early as 1958 Class D [[Citizens Band]], a Part 95 service, was allocated to frequencies that are also allocated to ISM. [1]\n\nIn the U.S., the FCC first made unlicensed [[spread spectrum]] available in the ISM bands in rules adopted on May 9, 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marcus-spectrum.com/documents/81413RO.txt |format=TXT |title=Authorization of Spread Spectrum Systems Under Parts 15 and 90 of the FCC Rules and Regulations |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |date=June 18, 1985 |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314063902/http://www.marcus-spectrum.com/documents/81413RO.txt |archivedate=March 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMany other countries later developed similar regulations, enabling use of this technology. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The FCC action was proposed by Michael Marcus of the FCC staff in 1980 and the subsequent regulatory action took five more years. It was part of a broader proposal to allow civil use of spread spectrum technology and was opposed at the time by mainstream equipment manufacturers and many radio system operators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.gmu.edu/UnlicensedWireless.php  |title=The Genesis of Unlicensed Wireless Policy |publisher=George Mason University|date=April 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-20}}\n</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe original ISM specifications envisioned that the bands would be used primarily for noncommunication purposes, such as heating.  The bands are still widely used for these purposes.  For many people, the most commonly encountered ISM device is the home [[microwave oven]] operating at 2.45&nbsp;GHz which uses microwaves to cook food.  Industrial heating is another big application area; such as [[induction heating]], microwave heat treating, plastic softening, and [[plastic welding#High frequency welding|plastic welding]] processes.  In medical settings, shortwave and microwave [[diathermy]] machines use radio waves in the ISM bands to apply deep heating to the body for relaxation and healing.  More recently [[hyperthermia therapy]] uses microwaves to heat tissue to kill cancer cells.  \n\nHowever, as detailed below, the increasing congestion of the radio spectrum, the increasing sophistication of [[microelectronics]], and the attraction of unlicensed use, has in recent decades led to an explosion of uses of these bands for short range communication systems for [[wireless device]]s, which are now by far the largest uses of these bands.  These are sometimes called \"non ISM\" uses since they do not fall under the originally envisioned \"industrial\", \"scientific\", and \"medical\" application areas.   One of the largest applications has been [[wireless networking]] ([[WiFi]]). The [[IEEE 802.11]] wireless networking protocols, the standards on which almost all wireless systems are based, use the ISM bands.   Virtually all [[laptop]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[printer (computer)|computer printers]] and [[cellphone]]s now have 802.11 [[wireless modem]]s using the 2.4 and 5.7&nbsp;GHz ISM bands. [[Bluetooth]] is another networking technology using the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band, which can be problematic given the probability of interference. <ref name=\"Why does Bluetooth still suck?\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-bluetooth-sucks-bad-problems-issues-disconnects-2018-2 |title=Why does Bluetooth still suck? |last=Eizikowitz |first=Grant |date=2018-03-05 |website=Business Insider |access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref>  [[Near field communication]] devices such as [[proximity card]]s and [[contactless smart card]]s use the lower frequency 13 and 27&nbsp;MHz ISM bands.  Other short range devices using the ISM bands are: [[wireless microphone]]s, [[baby monitor]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, wireless [[doorbell]]s, [[keyless entry system]]s for vehicles, [[radio control]] channels for [[unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] (drones), wireless [[surveillance]] systems, [[radio frequency identification|RFID]] systems for merchandise, and [[animal tracking|wild animal tracking]] systems.   \n\nSome [[electrodeless lamp]] designs are ISM devices, which use RF emissions to [[excited state|excite]] [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent tubes]].  [[Sulfur lamp]]s are commercially available [[plasma lamp]]s, which use a 2.45&nbsp;GHz [[magnetron]] to heat sulfur into a brightly glowing [[Plasma physics|plasma]].\n\nLong-distance [[wireless power]] systems have been proposed and experimented with which would use high-power transmitters and [[rectenna]]s, in lieu of [[overhead power line|overhead transmission lines]] and [[undergrounding|underground cables]], to send power to remote locations. [[NASA]] has studied using [[microwave power transmission]] on 2.45&nbsp;GHz to send energy collected by [[space-based solar power|solar power satellites]] back to the ground.\n\nAlso in space applications, a [[Helicon Double Layer Thruster|Helicon Double Layer]] [[ion thruster]] is a prototype spacecraft propulsion engine which uses a 13.56&nbsp;MHz transmission to break down and heat gas into plasma.\n\n==Non-ISM uses==\nIn recent years ISM bands have also been shared with (non-ISM) license-free error-tolerant communications applications such as [[wireless sensor network]]s in the 915&nbsp;MHz and 2.450&nbsp;GHz bands, as well as [[wireless LAN]]s and [[Cordless telephone|cordless phone]]s in the 915&nbsp;MHz, 2.450&nbsp;GHz, and 5.800&nbsp;GHz bands. Because unlicensed devices are required to be tolerant of ISM emissions in these bands, unlicensed low power users are generally able to operate in these bands without causing problems for ISM users. ISM equipment does not necessarily include a radio receiver in the ISM band (e.g. a microwave oven does not have a receiver).\n\nIn the United States, according to 47 CFR Part 15.5, low power communication devices must accept interference from licensed users of that frequency band, and the Part 15 device must not cause interference to licensed users. Note that the 915&nbsp;MHz band should not be used in countries outside [[International Telecommunication Union region|Region 2]], except those that specifically allow it, such as Australia and Israel, especially those that use the [[GSM frequency bands#GSM-900, GSM-1800 and EGSM/EGSM-900|GSM-900]] band for cellphones.  The ISM bands are also widely used for [[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) applications with the most commonly used band being the 13.56&nbsp;MHz band used by systems compliant with [[ISO/IEC 14443]] including those used by [[biometric passport]]s and [[contactless smart card]]s.\n\nIn Europe, the use of the ISM band is covered by [[Short Range Device]] regulations issued by [[European Commission]], based on technical recommendations by [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] and  standards by [[ETSI]]. In most of Europe, [[LPD433]] band is allowed for license-free voice communication in addition to [[PMR446]].\n\n[[Wireless LAN]] devices use wavebands as follows:\n* [[Bluetooth]] 2450&nbsp;MHz band<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=8U86p2igDhsC&pg=PA397&lpg=PA397&dq=Bluetooth+2450+MHz+band+falls+under+WPAN&source=bl&ots=fOuqn2PKDE&sig=IIqg8uHuMcAFpxj7DgmB65XdOl0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3stCTjYbYAhUJYo8KHYXZC4sQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=Bluetooth%202450%20MHz%20band%20falls%20under%20WPAN&f=false|title=International Conference on Emerging Trends in Electronic and Photonic Devices and Systems (ELECTRO-2009), December 22-24, 2009|last=Chakrabarti|first=P.|date=2009|publisher=Macmillan Publishers India|isbn=9780230328518|language=en}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} falls under [[Wireless personal area network|WPAN]]\n* [[HIPERLAN]] 5800&nbsp;MHz band\n* [[IEEE 802.11]]/[[Wi-Fi]] 2450&nbsp;MHz and 5800&nbsp;MHz bands\n\n[[IEEE 802.15.4]], [[ZigBee]] and other personal area networks may use the {{nowrap|915 MHz}} and {{nowrap|2450 MHz}} ISM bands because of frequency sharing between different allocations.\n\nWireless LANs and cordless phones can also use bands other than those shared with ISM, but such uses require approval on a country by country basis.

[[Ultra-wideband]] LANs require more spectrum than the ISM bands can provide, so the relevant standards such as [[IEEE 802.15.4a]] are designed to make use of spectrum outside the ISM bands.

Thompson|last2=Gardner |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Gardner |date=1998 |isbn=978-0312185480}}</ref>  The study of series is a major part of [[calculus]] and its generalization, [[mathematical analysis]]. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical by mathematicians and [[philosopher]]s. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch the tortoise. \n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is [[number]]s, [[function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the <math>a_i</math> one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like \n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the set to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the ''sum'' of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the ''{{math|''n''}}th partial sums'' of the series. That is, \n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is ''convergent'' or ''summable'', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the ''sum of the series''. Otherwise, the series is said to be ''divergent''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\Bbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\Bbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes \n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nMathematicians extend the idiom discussed earlier to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, when we talk about a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>\n\nwe are talking, in fact, just about the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nBut since these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111\u2026 can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 &times; 0.111&hellip; = 0.999&hellip; = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).

The convergence depends on how well <math>\\pi</math> can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet).

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[linear function|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the vector space of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence {1, 1, 1, ...} has series {1, 2, 3, 4, ...} as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main article|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\nis said to '''converge absolutely''' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main article|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + &middot;&middot;&middot; + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim &lambda;<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;&minus; ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n==Convergence tests==\n{{Main article|Convergence tests}}\n* ''[[n-th term test]]'': If lim<sub>''n''\u2192\u221e</sub> ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;\u2260 0 then the series diverges.\n*Comparison test 1 (see [[Direct comparison test]]): If \u2211''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp; is an [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] series such that |''a<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;|&nbsp;\u2264 ''C''&nbsp;|''b<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;| for some number ''C''&thinsp; and for sufficiently large ''n''&nbsp;, then \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>''&thinsp; converges absolutely as well.

The converse is in general not true.\n*For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main article|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main article|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main article|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main article|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].

Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main article|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|&pi;]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge. But they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main article|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in Banach spaces===\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&nbsp;\u2265 1, the set <math> A_n = \\{ i \\in I \\,:\\, a_i > 1/n \\}</math> is finite, because\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 n \\, \\textrm{card}(A_n) \\le \\sum_{i\\in A_n} a_i  \\le \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i < \\infty.</math>\n\nIf ''I''&thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&nbsp;= {''i''<sub>0</sub>, ''i''<sub>1</sub>,...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a_{i_k},</math>\n\nprovided the value \u221e is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\n====Abelian topological groups====\nLet ''a''&nbsp;: ''I'' \u2192 ''X'', where ''I''&thinsp; is any set and ''X''&thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I''.  Note that ''F''&thinsp; is a [[directed set]] [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit\n\n:<math> S = \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\lim \\Bigl\\{\\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A\\in F\\Bigr\\}</math>\n\nif it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>S - \\sum_{i \\in A} a_i \\in V, \\quad A \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nBecause ''F''&thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1\u20134 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540642411 |pages=261\u2013270}}</ref><ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780121734503 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFor every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; such that ''V''&nbsp;&minus; ''V''&nbsp;\u2282 ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is: for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.

Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', ''i.e.'', for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.

An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.  The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its [[state (computer science)|state]], and executing a [[Function (programming)|function]] called an ''[[interrupt handler]]'' (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event.  This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes, the processor resumes normal activities.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch10.pdf\n | title = ''Linux Device Drivers'', Third Edition, Chapter 10.

For example, pressing a key on the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] or moving the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] triggers hardware interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position.  Unlike the software type (described below), hardware interrupts are [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous]] and can occur in the middle of instruction execution, requiring additional care in programming.  The act of initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an [[interrupt request]] (IRQ).\n\nA '''software interrupt''' is caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] in the [[instruction set]] which causes an interrupt when it is executed.  The former is often called a ''[[Trap (computing)|trap]]'' or ''[[exception handling|exception]]'' and is used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself.  For example, a divide-by-zero exception will be thrown if the processor's [[arithmetic logic unit]] is commanded to divide a number by zero as this instruction is an error and impossible. The operating system will catch this exception, and can decide what to do about it: usually aborting the process and displaying an error message. Software interrupt instructions can function similarly to [[subroutine call]]s and are used for a variety of purposes, such as to request services from [[device driver]]s, like interrupts sent to and from a [[disk controller]] to request reading or writing of data to and from the disk.\n\nEach interrupt has its own interrupt handler.  The number of hardware interrupts is limited by the number of interrupt request (IRQ) lines to the processor, but there may be hundreds of different software interrupts.  Interrupts are a commonly used technique for [[computer multitasking]], especially in [[real-time computing]].  Such a system is said to be interrupt-driven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sltf.com/articles/pein/pein9505.htm |title=Basics of Interrupts |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>\n\nInterrupts are similar to [[Signal (IPC)|signals]], the difference being that signals are used for [[inter-process communication]] (IPC), mediated by the kernel (possibly via system calls) and handled by processes, while interrupts are mediated by the processor and handled by the [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]]. The kernel may pass an interrupt as a signal to the process that caused it (typical examples are [[SIGSEGV]], [[SIGBUS]], [[SIGILL]] and [[SIGFPE]]).\n\n== Overview ==\nHardware interrupts were introduced as an optimization, eliminating unproductive waiting time in [[Polling (computer science)|polling loops]], waiting for external events. The first system to use this approach was the [[DYSEAC]], completed in 1954, although earlier systems provided [[Trap (computing)|error trap]] functions.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Edgar F.|last=Codd|authorlink=Edgar F. Codd|title=Multiprogramming|journal=Advances in Computers|volume=3|pages=82}}</ref> Interrupts may be implemented in hardware as a distinct system with control lines, or they may be integrated into the memory subsystem.\n\nIf implemented in hardware, an interrupt controller circuit such as the IBM PC's [[Programmable Interrupt Controller]] (PIC) may be connected between the interrupting device and the processor's interrupt pin to [[multiplexing|multiplex]] several sources of interrupt onto the one or two CPU lines typically available. If implemented as part of the [[memory controller]], interrupts are mapped into the system's memory [[address space]].<!-- Expand on how memory mapped interrupts work. e.g. PowerPC -->\n\nInterrupts can be categorized into these different types:\n* ''Maskable interrupt'' ([[Interrupt request|IRQ]]): a hardware interrupt that may be ignored by setting a bit in an [[interrupt mask register]]'s (IMR) bit-mask.\n* ''[[Non-maskable interrupt]]'' (NMI): a hardware interrupt that lacks an associated bit-mask, so that it can never be ignored.  NMIs are used for the highest priority tasks such as timers, especially [[watchdog timer]]s.\n* ''[[Inter-processor interrupt]]'' (IPI): a special case of interrupt that is generated by one processor to interrupt another processor in a [[multiprocessor]] system.\n* ''Software interrupt'': an interrupt generated within a processor by executing an instruction. Software interrupts are often used to implement [[system call]]s because they result in a subroutine call with a [[Ring (computer security)|CPU ring level]] change.\n* ''Spurious interrupt'': a hardware interrupt that is unwanted. They are typically generated by system conditions such as [[electrical interference]] on an interrupt line or through incorrectly designed hardware.\n\nProcessors typically have an internal ''interrupt mask'' which allows software to ignore all external hardware interrupts while it is set. Setting or clearing this mask may be faster than accessing an interrupt mask register (IMR) in a PIC or disabling interrupts in the device itself. In some cases, such as the [[x86]] architecture, disabling and enabling interrupts on the processor itself act as a [[memory barrier]]; however, it may actually be slower.\n\nAn interrupt that leaves the machine in a well-defined state is called a ''precise interrupt''. Such an interrupt has four properties:\n* [[Program counter|The Program Counter (PC)]] is saved in a known place.\n* All instructions before the one pointed to by the PC have fully executed.\n* No instruction beyond the one pointed to by the PC has been executed, or any such instructions are undone before handling the interrupt.\n* The execution state of the instruction pointed to by the PC is known.\n\nAn interrupt that does not meet these requirements is called an ''imprecise interrupt''.\n\nThe phenomenon where the overall system performance is severely hindered by excessive amounts of processing time spent handling interrupts is called an [[interrupt storm]].\n\n== {{Anchor|MECHANISMS}}Types of interrupts ==\n\n=== Level-triggered ===\nA ''level-triggered interrupt'' is an interrupt signaled by maintaining the interrupt line at a high or low [[logic level]]. A device wishing to signal a level-triggered interrupt drives the [[interrupt request]] line to its active level (high or low), and then holds it at that level until it is serviced.  It ceases asserting the line when the CPU commands it to or otherwise handles the condition that caused it to signal the interrupt.\n\nTypically, the processor samples the interrupt input at predefined times during each bus cycle such as state T2 for the [[Z80]] microprocessor. If the interrupt isn't active when the processor samples it, the CPU doesn't see it. One possible use for this type of interrupt is to minimize spurious signals from a noisy interrupt line: a spurious pulse will often be so short that it is not noticed.\n\nMultiple devices may share a level-triggered interrupt line if they are designed to.  The interrupt line must have a pull-down or [[pull-up resistor]] so that when not actively driven it settles to its inactive state.  Devices actively assert the line to indicate an outstanding interrupt, but let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt.  The line is then in its asserted state when any (one or more than one) of the sharing devices is signalling an outstanding interrupt.\n\nLevel-triggered interrupt is favored by some because it is easy to share the [[interrupt request]] line without losing the interrupts, when multiple shared devices interrupt at the same time.  Upon detecting assertion of the interrupt line, the CPU must search through the devices sharing the [[interrupt request]] line until one who triggered the interrupt is detected.  After servicing this device, the CPU may recheck the interrupt line status to determine whether any other devices also need service.  If the line is now de-asserted, the CPU avoids checking the remaining devices on the line.  Since some devices interrupt more frequently than others, and other device interrupts are particularly expensive, a careful ordering of device checks is employed to increase efficiency. The original [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] standard mandated level-triggered interrupts because of this advantage of sharing interrupts. \n\nThere are also serious problems with sharing level-triggered interrupts.  As long as any device on the line has an outstanding request for service the line remains asserted, so it is not possible to detect a change in the status of any other device.  Deferring servicing a low-priority device is not an option, because this would prevent detection of service requests from higher-priority devices.  If there is a device on the line that the CPU does not know how to service, then any interrupt from that device permanently blocks all interrupts from the other devices.\n\n===Edge-triggered===\nAn ''edge-triggered interrupt'' is an interrupt signalled by a [[signal edge|level transition]] on the interrupt line, either a falling edge (high to low) or  a rising edge (low to high). A device, wishing to signal an interrupt, drives a pulse onto the line and then releases the line to its inactive state. If the pulse is too short to be detected by [[polled I/O]] then special hardware may be required to detect the edge.\n\nMultiple devices may share an edge-triggered interrupt line if they are designed to.  The interrupt line must have a pull-down or pull-up resistor so that when not actively driven it settles to one particular state. Devices signal an interrupt by briefly driving the line to its non-default state, and let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt. This type of connection is also referred to as [[open collector]]. The line then carries all the pulses generated by all the devices. (This is analogous to the [[pull cord]] on some buses and trolleys that any passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop.) However, interrupt pulses from different devices may merge if they occur close in time. To avoid losing interrupts the CPU must trigger on the trailing edge of the pulse (e.g. the rising edge if the line is pulled up and driven low).  After detecting an interrupt the CPU must check all the devices for service requirements.\n\nEdge-triggered interrupts do not suffer the problems that level-triggered interrupts have with sharing.  Service of a low-priority device can be postponed arbitrarily, and interrupts will continue to be received from the high-priority devices that are being serviced. If there is a device that the CPU does not know how to service, it may cause a spurious interrupt, or even periodic spurious interrupts, but it does not interfere with the interrupt signalling of the other devices. However, it is fairly easy for an edge triggered interrupt to be missed - for example if interrupts have to be masked for a period - and unless there is some type of hardware latch that records the event it is impossible to recover. Such problems caused many \"lockups\" in early computer hardware because the processor did not know it was expected to do something. More modern hardware often has one or more interrupt status registers that latch the interrupt requests; well written edge-driven interrupt software often checks such registers to ensure events are not missed.\n\nThe elderly [[Industry Standard Architecture]] (ISA) bus uses edge-triggered interrupts, but does not mandate that devices be able to share them. The [[parallel port]] also uses edge-triggered interrupts. Many older devices assume that they have exclusive use of their interrupt line, making it electrically unsafe to share them. However, ISA motherboards include pull-up resistors on the IRQ lines, so well-behaved devices share ISA interrupts just fine.\n\n===Triggering===\nThere are 3 ways multiple devices \"sharing the same line\" can be raised.  First is by exclusive conduction (switching) or exclusive connection (to pins).  Next is by bus (all connected to same line listening): cards on a bus must know when they are to talk and not talk (ie, the ISA bus).  Talking can be triggered two ways: by accumulation latch or by logic gate.  Logic gates expect a continual data flow which is monitored for key signals.  Accumulators only trigger when the remote side excites the gate beyond a threshold, thus no negotiated speed is required.  Each has its speed versus distance advantages.  A trigger, generally, is the method in which excitation is detected: rising edge, falling edge, threshold ([[oscilloscope]] can trigger upon a wide variety of shapes and conditions).\n\nTriggering for software interrupts must be built into the softwares (both in OS and app).  A 'C' app has a trigger table (a table of functions) in its header, which both the app and OS know of and use appropriately that is not related to hardware.  However do not confuse this with hardware interrupts which signal the CPU (the CPU enacts software from a table of functions, similarly to software interrupts).\n\n===Hybrid===\nSome systems use a hybrid of level-triggered and edge-triggered signalling. The hardware not only looks for an edge, but it also verifies that the interrupt signal stays active for a certain period of time.\n\nA common use of a hybrid interrupt is for the NMI (non-maskable interrupt) input. Because NMIs generally signal major \u2013 or even catastrophic \u2013 system events, a good implementation of this signal tries to ensure that the interrupt is valid by verifying that it remains active for a period of time. This 2-step approach helps to eliminate false interrupts from affecting the system.\n\n===Message-signaled===<!-- This section is linked from [[Interrupt]] -->\n{{main|Message Signaled Interrupts}}\n\nA ''message-signalled interrupt'' does not use a physical interrupt line.  Instead, a device signals its request for service by sending a short message over some communications medium, typically a [[computer bus]]. The message might be of a type reserved for interrupts, or it might be of some pre-existing type such as a memory write.\n\nMessage-signalled interrupts behave very much like edge-triggered interrupts, in that the interrupt is a momentary signal rather than a continuous condition.  Interrupt-handling software treats the two in much the same manner. Typically, multiple pending message-signalled interrupts with the same message (the same virtual interrupt line) are allowed to merge, just as closely spaced edge-triggered interrupts can merge.\n\nMessage-signalled [[interrupt vector]]s can be shared, to the extent that the underlying communication medium can be shared. No additional effort is required.\n\nBecause the identity of the interrupt is indicated by a pattern of data bits, not requiring a separate physical conductor, many more distinct interrupts can be efficiently handled.  This reduces the need for sharing. Interrupt messages can also be passed over a serial bus, not requiring any additional lines.\n\n[[PCI Express]], a serial computer bus, uses [[Message Signaled Interrupts|message-signalled interrupts]] exclusively.\n\n===Doorbell===\nIn a [[push button]] analogy applied to [[computer systems]], the term ''doorbell'' or ''doorbell interrupt'' is often used to describe a mechanism whereby a [[software]] system can signal or notify a [[computer hardware]] device that there is some work to be done.  Typically, the software system will place data in some well-known and mutually agreed upon memory location(s), and \"ring the doorbell\" by writing to a different memory location.  This different memory location is often called the doorbell region, and there may even be multiple doorbells serving different purposes in this region. It is this act of writing to the doorbell region of memory that \"rings the bell\" and notifies the hardware device that the data are ready and waiting.  The hardware device would now know that the data are valid and can be acted upon.  It would typically write the data to a  [[hard disk drive]], or send them over a [[Computer network|network]], or [[encrypt]] them, etc. \n\nThe term ''doorbell interrupt'' is usually a [[misnomer]].  Its similar to an interrupt, because it causes some work to be done by the device; however, the doorbell region is sometimes implemented as a [[Polling (computer science)|polled]] region, sometimes the doorbell region writes through to physical device [[Hardware register|registers]], and sometimes the doorbell region is hardwired directly to physical device registers. When either writing through or directly to physical device registers, this may cause a real interrupt to occur at the device's central processor unit ([[CPU]]), if it has one.\n\nDoorbell interrupts can be compared to [[Message Signaled Interrupts]], as they have some similarities.\n\n==Difficulty with sharing interrupt lines==\nMultiple devices sharing an interrupt line (of any triggering style) all act as spurious interrupt sources with respect to each other.  With many devices on one line the workload in servicing interrupts grows in proportion to the square of the number of devices.  It is therefore preferred to spread devices evenly across the available interrupt lines.  Shortage of interrupt lines is a problem in older system designs where the interrupt lines are distinct physical conductors.  Message-signalled interrupts, where the interrupt line is virtual, are favored in new system architectures (such as [[PCI Express]]) and relieve this problem to a considerable extent.\n\nSome devices with a poorly designed programming interface provide no way to determine whether they have requested service. They may lock up or otherwise misbehave if serviced when they do not want it.  Such devices cannot tolerate spurious interrupts, and so also cannot tolerate sharing an interrupt line. [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] cards, due to often cheap design and construction, are notorious for this problem.  Such devices are becoming much rarer, as [[hardware logic]] becomes cheaper and new system architectures mandate shareable interrupts.\n\n== {{Anchor|AFFINITY|RPS|RFS}}Performance issues ==\nInterrupts provide low overhead and good [[Interrupt latency|latency]] at low load, but degrade significantly at high interrupt rate unless care is taken to prevent several pathologies. These are various forms of [[livelock]]s, when the system spends all of its time processing interrupts to the exclusion of other required tasks. Under extreme conditions, a large number of interrupts (like very high network traffic) may completely stall the system. To avoid such problems, an [[operating system]] must schedule network interrupt handling as carefully as it schedules process execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263335 |title=Eliminating receive livelock in an interrupt-driven kernel |doi=10.1145/263326.263335 |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>\n\nWith multi-core processors, additional performance improvements in interrupt handling can be achieved through [[receive-side scaling]] (RSS) when [[multiqueue NIC]]s are used.  Such NICs provide multiple receive [[Queue (abstract data type)|queues]] associated to separate interrupts; by routing each of those interrupts to different cores, processing of the interrupt requests triggered by the network traffic received by a single NIC can be distributed among multiple cores.  Distribution of the interrupts among cores can be performed automatically by the operating system, or the routing of interrupts (usually referred to as ''IRQ affinity'') can be manually configured.<ref name=\"linux-net-scaling\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/scaling.txt\n | title = Documentation/networking/scaling.txt\n | work = Linux kernel documentation\n | date = May 9, 2014 | accessdate = November 16, 2014\n | author1 = Tom Herbert | author2 = Willem de Bruijn\n | publisher = [[kernel.org]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.intel.com/content/dam/doc/datasheet/82574l-gbe-controller-datasheet.pdf\n | title = Intel 82574 Gigabit Ethernet Controller Family Datasheet\n | date = June 2014 | accessdate = November 16, 2014\n | publisher = [[Intel]] | format = PDF\n | page = 1\n}}</ref>\n\nA purely software-based implementation of the receiving traffic distribution, known as ''receive packet steering'' (RPS), distributes received traffic among cores later in the data path, as part of the [[interrupt handler]] functionality.  Advantages of RPS over RSS include no requirements for specific hardware, more advanced traffic distribution filters, and reduced rate of interrupts produced by a NIC.  As a downside, RPS increases the rate of [[inter-processor interrupt]]s (IPIs).  ''Receive flow steering'' (RFS) takes the software-based approach further by accounting for [[application locality]]; further performance improvements are achieved by processing interrupt requests by the same cores on which particular network packets will be consumed by the targeted application.<ref name=\"linux-net-scaling\" /><ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://lwn.net/Articles/362339/\n | title = Receive packet steering\n | date = November 17, 2009 | accessdate = November 16, 2014\n | author = Jonathan Corbet | publisher = [[LWN.net]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://lwn.net/Articles/382428/\n | title = Receive flow steering\n | date = April 7, 2010 | accessdate = November 16, 2014\n | author = Jake Edge | publisher = [[LWN.net]]\n}}</ref>\n\n== Typical uses ==\nTypical uses of interrupts include the following: system timers, disk I/O, power-off signals, and [[Exception handling|traps]]. Other interrupts exist to transfer data bytes using [[UART]]s or [[Ethernet]]; sense key-presses; control motors; or anything else the equipment must do.\n\nAnother typical use is to generate periodic interrupts by dividing the output of a crystal oscillator and having an interrupt handler count the interrupts in order for a processor to keep time. These periodic interrupts are often used by the OS's task [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] to reschedule the priorities of running [[process (computing)|processes]]. Some older computers generated periodic interrupts from the [[power line frequency]] because it was controlled by the utilities to eliminate long-term drift of electric clocks.\n\nFor example, a disk interrupt signals the completion of a data transfer from or to the disk peripheral; a process waiting to read or write a file starts up again.  As another example, a power-off interrupt predicts or requests a loss of power, allowing the computer equipment to perform an orderly shut-down.  Also, interrupts are used in [[typeahead]] features for buffering events like [[keystrokes]].\n\nInterrupts are used to allow emulation of instructions which are unimplemented on certain models in a computer line.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thusoo|first1=Shalesh, et. al.|title=Patent US 5632028 A|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5632028|website=Google Patents|accessdate=Aug 13, 2017}}</ref> For example [[floating point]] instructions may be implemented in hardware on some systems and emulated on lower-cost systems.

[[Lunisolar calendar]]s may require intercalations of both days and months.\n\n== Solar calendars ==\n{{further|Intercalary month (Egypt)}}\nThe solar or [[tropical year]] does not have a whole number of days (it is about 365.24 days), but a [[calendar year]] must have a whole number of days. The most common way to reconcile the two is to vary the number of days in the calendar year.\n\nIn solar calendars, this is done by adding to a [[common year]] of 365 days, an extra day (\"leap day\" or \"intercalary day\") about every four years, causing a [[leap year]] to have 366 days ([[Julian calendar|Julian]], [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Indian national calendar]]s).\n\nThe [[Decree of Canopus]], which was issued by the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] in 239 BCE, decreed a solar leap day system; an Egyptian leap year was not adopted until 25 BC, when the Roman Emperor [[Augustus]] successfully instituted a reformed [[Coptic calendar|Alexandrian calendar]].\n\nIn the [[Julian calendar]], as well as in the [[Gregorian calendar]], which improved upon it, intercalation is done by adding an extra day to February in each leap year. In the Julian calendar this was done every four years. In the Gregorian, years divisible by 100 but not 400 were exempted in order to improve accuracy. Thus, 2000 was a leap year; 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.\n\nEpagomenal<ref>From \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, ''epagomenos'' (present participle passive of \u1f10\u03c0\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, ''epagein'' \"to bring in\") + -al</ref> days are days within a solar calendar that are outside any regular month. Usually five epagomenal days are included within every year ([[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]], [[Coptic calendar|Coptic]], [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopian]], Mayan [[Haab']] and [[French Republican Calendar]]s), but a sixth epagomenal day is intercalated every four years in some (Coptic, Ethiopian and French Republican calendars).\n\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar]] includes enough epagomenal days (usually 4 or 5) before the last month ({{lang|ar|\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0621}}, ''\u02bfal\u0101\u02be'') to ensure that the following year starts on the [[March equinox]]. These are known as the [[Ayy\u00e1m-i-H\u00e1]].\n\n== Lunisolar calendars ==\nThe solar year does not have a whole number of [[lunar month]]s (it is about 12.37 [[lunation]]s), so a lunisolar calendar must have a variable number of [[month]]s in a year. Regular years have 12 months, but embolismic years insert a 13th \"intercalary\" or '''\"leap\"''' or '''\"embolismic\" month''' every second or third year (see [[blue moon]]). Whether to insert an intercalary month in a given year may be determined using regular cycles such as the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]] ([[Hebrew calendar]] and in the [[Computus|determination of Easter]]) or using calculations of lunar phases ([[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunisolar]] and [[Chinese calendar]]s). The [[Buddhist calendar]] adds both an intercalary day and month on a usually regular cycle. The Jewish year is arranged according to a luni-solar system.\n\n== Islamic calendars ==\n{{main|Nasi'}}\nThe [[tabular Islamic calendar]] usually has 12 lunar months that alternate between 30 and 29 days every year, but an intercalary day is added to the last month of the year 11 times within a 30-year cycle.

Huntington describes these other historical inks:\n[[File:Oak galls and iron(II) sulfate - California State Archives.jpg|200px|thumb|Oak galls and iron(II) sulfate .]]\n<blockquote>About 1,600 years ago, a popular ink recipe was created. The recipe was used for centuries. Iron salts, such as ferrous sulfate (made by treating iron with sulfuric acid), were mixed with tannin from [[gall]]nuts (they grow on trees) and a thickener. When first put to paper, this ink is bluish-black. Over time it fades to a dull brown.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Scribes in [[medieval]] [[Europe]] (about AD 800 to 1500) wrote principally on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]]. One 12th century ink recipe called for hawthorn branches to be cut in the spring and left to dry. Then the bark was pounded from the branches and soaked in water for eight days. The water was boiled until it thickened and turned black. Wine was added during boiling. The ink was poured into special bags and hung in the sun. Once dried, the mixture was mixed with wine and iron salt over a fire to make the final ink.<ref>\"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0921/p18s02-hfks.html Think ink!]\", ''Christian Science Monitor'', September 21, 2004</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe reservoir pen, which may have been the first [[fountain pen]], dates back to 953, when [[Al Muizz|Ma'\u0101d al-Mu'izz]], the [[caliph]] of [[Egypt]], demanded a pen that would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen that held ink in a reservoir.<ref>CE Bosworth, ''A Mediaeval Islamic Prototype of the Fountain Pen?'' Journal of Semitic Studies, 26(2):229\u2013234, 1981</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, a new type of ink had to be developed in Europe for the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. According to Martyn Lyons in his book ''Books: A Living History'', Gutenberg\u2019s dye was indelible, oil-based, and made from the soot of lamps (lamp-black) mixed with varnish and egg white.<ref>Lyons, M. (2011). Books: A living history Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.</ref> Two types of ink were prevalent at the time: the Greek and Roman writing ink (soot, glue, and water) and the 12th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate, gall, gum, and water.<ref>Many recipes for [[iron gall ink]]s are featured in A booke of secrets: shewing diuers waies to make and prepare all sorts of inke... tr. out of Dutch into Englishe by W.P. [i.e. William Philip], London, 1596.</ref> Neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs. Eventually an oily, [[varnish]]-like ink made of soot, [[turpentine]], and walnut oil was created specifically for the printing press.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Tintenstrich-detail 2.jpg|thumb|Magnified line drawn by a [[fountain pen]].]]\n\nInk formulas vary, but commonly involve two components:\n* Colorants\n* Vehicles (binders)\n\nInks generally fall into four classes:<ref name=\"kipphan130-144\">{{Citation|last = Kipphan|first = Helmut|title = Handbook of print media: technologies and production methods|publisher = Springer|year = 2001|edition = Illustrated|pages = 130\u2013144|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VrdqBRgSKasC|isbn = 3-540-67326-1}}</ref>\n* Aqueous\n* Liquid\n* Paste\n* Powder\n\n===Colorants===\nPigment inks are used more frequently than dyes because they are more color-fast, but they are also more expensive, less consistent in color, and have less of a [[Gamut|color range]] than dyes.<ref name=\"kipphan130-144\" />\n\n====Pigments====\n{{Main|Pigment}}\nPigments are solid, opaque particles suspended in ink to provide color.<ref name=\"kipphan130-144\" /> Pigment molecules typically link together in [[crystal]]line structures that are 0.1\u20132 [[Micrometre|\u00b5m]] in size and comprise 5\u201330 percent of the ink volume.<ref name=\"kipphan130-144\" /> Qualities such as [[hue]], [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]], and [[Lightness (color)|lightness]] vary depending on the source and type of pigment.\n\n====Dyes====\n{{main|Dye}}Dye-based inks are generally much stronger than pigment-based inks and can produce much more color of a given density per unit of mass. However, because dyes are dissolved in the liquid phase, they have a tendency to soak into paper, making the ink less efficient and potentially allowing the ink to bleed at the edges of an image.\n\nTo circumvent this problem, dye-based inks are made with solvents that dry rapidly or are used with quick-drying methods of printing, such as blowing hot air on the fresh print. Other methods include harder paper [[sizing]] and more specialized paper coatings. The latter is particularly suited to inks used in non-industrial settings (which must conform to tighter toxicity and emission controls), such as [[inkjet printer]] inks. Another technique involves coating the paper with a charged coating. If the dye has the opposite charge, it is attracted to and retained by this coating, while the solvent soaks into the paper. [[Cellulose]], the wood-derived material most paper is made of, is naturally charged, and so a compound that complexes with both the dye and the paper's surface aids retention at the surface. Such a compound is commonly used in ink-jet printing inks.\n\nAn additional advantage of dye-based ink systems is that the dye [[molecule]]s can interact with other ink ingredients, potentially allowing greater benefit as compared to pigmented inks from [[optical brightener]]s and color-enhancing agents designed to increase the intensity and appearance of dyes.\n\nA more recent development in dye-based inks are dyes that react with cellulose to permanently color the paper. Such inks are not affected by water, alcohol, and other solvents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As such, their use is recommended to prevent frauds that involve removing signatures, such as [[check washing]]. This kind of ink is most commonly found in gel inks and in certain [[fountain pen inks]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==Health and environmental aspects==\n{{See also|Environmental issues with paper}}\n{{Medical citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}\nThere is a misconception that ink is non-toxic even if swallowed. Once ingested, ink can be hazardous to one's health. Certain inks, such as those used in digital printers, and even those found in a common pen can be harmful. Though ink does not easily cause death, repeated skin contact or ingestion can cause effects such as severe headaches, skin irritation, or nervous system damage.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} These effects can be caused by solvents, or by pigment ingredients such as [[p-Anisidine|''p''-Anisidine]], which helps create some inks' color and shine.\n\nThree main environmental issues with ink are:\n* [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|Heavy metals]] [[File:Eisengallustinte selbstgemacht schriftbild.jpg|200px|thumb|\"Wikipedia\" written with self-made iron gall ink]]\n* Non-renewable oils\n* [[Volatile organic compound]]s\n\nSome regulatory bodies have set standards for the amount of heavy metals in ink.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070508062911/http://cpima.org/HeavyMetals.pdf Canadian Printing Ink Manufacturers' Association]</ref> There is a trend toward [[vegetable oil]]s rather than [[petroleum oil]]s in recent years in response to a demand for better [[sustainability|environmental sustainability]] performance.\n\nInk uses up non-renewable oils and metals, which have a negative impact on the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tenrandomfacts.com/ink/|title=Ink \u2013 Ten Random Facts|date=2013-07-15|newspaper=Ten Random Facts|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n===Carbon===\n[[File:Inkstick.jpg|right|thumb|Chinese [[inkstick]]; carbon-based and made from [[soot]] and [[animal glue]].]]\nCarbon inks were commonly made from lampblack or soot and a binding agent such as [[gum arabic]] or [[animal glue]]. The binding agent keeps carbon particles in suspension and adhered to paper. Carbon particles do not fade over time even when bleached or when in sunlight. One benefit is that carbon ink does not harm paper. Over time, the ink is chemically stable and therefore does not threaten the paper's strength. Despite these benefits, carbon ink is not ideal for permanence and ease of preservation. Carbon ink tends to smudge in humid environments and can be washed off surfaces. The best method of preserving a document written in carbon ink is to store it in a dry environment (Barrow 1972).\n\nRecently, carbon inks made from carbon nanotubes have been successfully created. They are similar in composition to traditional inks in that they use a polymer to suspend the carbon nanotubes. These inks can be used in inkjet printers and produce electrically conductive patterns.<ref>{{Citation|last=Simmons|first=Trevor|year=2007|title=Large Area-Aligned Arrays from Direct Deposition of Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes|journal=J.

However, iron gall ink is corrosive and damages paper over time (Waters 1940). Items containing this ink can become brittle and the writing fades to brown. The original scores of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] are threatened by the destructive properties of iron gall ink. The majority of his works are held by the German State Library, and about 25% of those are in advanced stages of decay (American Libraries 2000). The rate at which the writing fades is based on several factors, such as proportions of ink ingredients, amount deposited on the paper, and paper composition (Barrow 1972:16). Corrosion is caused by acid catalysed hydrolysis and iron(II)-catalysed oxidation of cellulose (Rouchon-Quillet 2004:389).\n\nTreatment is a controversial subject. No treatment undoes damage already caused by acidic ink. Deterioration can only be stopped or slowed. Some{{who|date=March 2011}} think it best not to treat the item at all for fear of the consequences. Others believe that non-aqueous procedures are the best solution. Yet others think an aqueous procedure may preserve items written with iron gall ink. Aqueous treatments include distilled water at different temperatures, calcium hydroxide, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, and calcium phytate. There are many possible side effects from these treatments. There can be mechanical damage, which further weakens the paper. Paper color or ink color may change, and ink may bleed. Other consequences of aqueous treatment are a change of ink texture or formation of plaque on the surface of the ink (Reibland & de Groot 1999).\n\nIron gall inks require storage in a stable environment, because fluctuating [[relative humidity]] increases the rate that formic acid, acetic acid, and furan derivatives form in the material the ink was used on. Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst to cellulose hydrolysis, and iron (II) sulfate acts as a catalyst to cellulose oxidation. These chemical reactions physically weaken the paper, causing [[Brittle Books Program|brittleness]].<ref>Henk J.

Life as we know it might not exist if things were different, but a different sort of life might exist in its place. A number of critics also suggest that many of the stated variables appear to be interconnected and that calculations made by mathematicians and physicists suggest that the emergence of a universe similar to ours is quite probable.<ref>[[#Huchingson 1993|Feinberg & Shapiro 1993]], \"A Puddlian Fable\", pp. 220\u2013221</ref>\n\n===Intelligent designer===\n{{Main|Intelligent designer}}\n\nThe contemporary intelligent design movement formulates its arguments in [[secular]] terms and intentionally avoids identifying the intelligent agent (or agents) they posit. Although they do not state that God is the designer, the designer is often implicitly hypothesized to have intervened in a way that only a god could intervene. Dembski, in ''[[The Design Inference]]'' (1998), speculates that an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture could fulfill these requirements. ''Of Pandas and People'' proposes that [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] illustrates an appeal to intelligent design in science. In 2000, philosopher of science [[Robert T. Pennock]] suggested the [[Ra\u00eblian beliefs and practices|Ra\u00eblian]] [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] religion as a real-life example of an extraterrestrial intelligent designer view that \"make[s] many of the same bad arguments against evolutionary theory as creationists\".<ref>[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 229\u2013229, 233\u2013242</ref> The authoritative description of intelligent design,<ref name=\"DI-topquestions\" /> however, explicitly states that the ''Universe'' displays features of having been designed. Acknowledging the [[paradox]], Dembski concludes that \"no intelligent agent who is strictly physical could have presided over the origin of the universe or the origin of life.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.org/a/119 |title=The Act of Creation: Bridging Transcendence and Immanence |last=Dembski |first=William A. |date=August 10, 1998 |website=Center for Science and Culture |publisher=Discovery Institute |location=Seattle |accessdate=2014-02-28}} \"Presented at Millstatt Forum, Strasbourg, France, 10 August 1998.\"</ref> The leading proponents have made statements to their supporters that they believe the designer to be the Christian God, to the exclusion of all other religions.<ref name=\"dembski_logos\" />\n\nBeyond the debate over whether intelligent design is scientific, a number of critics argue that existing evidence makes the design hypothesis appear unlikely, irrespective of its status in the world of science. For example, [[Jerry Coyne]] asks why a designer would \"give us a pathway for making [[vitamin C]], but then destroy it by disabling one of its enzymes\" (see [[pseudogene]]) and why a designer would not \"stock oceanic islands with reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and freshwater fish, despite the suitability of such islands for these species\". Coyne also points to the fact that \"the flora and fauna on those islands resemble that of the nearest mainland, even when the environments are very different\" as evidence that species were not placed there by a designer.<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\">{{cite magazine |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=August 22, 2005 |title=The Case Against Intelligent Design: The Faith That Dare Not Speak Its Name |url=http://www.edge.org/conversation/the-case-against-intelligent-design |magazine=[[The New Republic]] |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref> Previously, in ''Darwin's Black Box'', Behe had argued that we are simply incapable of understanding the designer's motives, so such questions cannot be answered definitively. Odd designs could, for example, \"...have been placed there by the designer for a reason\u2014for artistic reasons, for variety, to show off, for some as-yet-undetected practical purpose, or for some unguessable reason\u2014or they might not.\"<ref name=\"odd_design\">[[#Behe 1996|Behe 1996]], p. 221</ref> Coyne responds that in light of the evidence, \"either life resulted not from intelligent design, but from evolution; or the intelligent designer is a cosmic prankster who designed everything to make it look as though it had evolved.\"<ref name=\"CoyneTNR\" />\n\nIntelligent design proponents such as [[Paul Nelson (creationist)|Paul Nelson]] avoid the [[Argument from poor design|problem of poor design in nature]] by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design. Behe cites Paley as his inspiration, but he differs from Paley's expectation of a perfect Creation and proposes that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can. Behe suggests that, like a parent not wanting to spoil a child with extravagant toys, the designer can have multiple motives for not giving priority to excellence in engineering. He says that \"Another problem with the argument from imperfection is that it critically depends on a psychoanalysis of the unidentified designer. Yet the reasons that a designer would or would not do anything are virtually impossible to know unless the designer tells you specifically what those reasons are.\"<ref name=\"odd_design\" /> This reliance on inexplicable motives of the designer makes intelligent design scientifically untestable. Retired [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] law professor, author and intelligent design advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]] puts forward a core definition that the designer creates for a purpose, giving the example that in his view [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] was created to punish immorality and [[HIV/AIDS denialism|is not caused by HIV]], but such motives cannot be tested by scientific methods.<ref name=\"Pennock 245\">[[#Pennock 1999|Pennock 1999]], pp. 245\u2013249, 265, 296\u2013300</ref>\n\nAsserting the need for a designer of complexity also raises the question \"What designed the designer?\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/philosop/empty.htm |title=Intelligent Design: The Glass is Empty |last=Simanek |first=Donald E. |date=February 2006 |website=Donald Simanek's Pages |publisher=[[Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania]] |location=Lock Haven, PA |accessdate=2012-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714082248/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/philosop/empty.htm |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}</ref> Intelligent design proponents say that the question is irrelevant to or outside the scope of intelligent design.<ref group=\"n\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ideacenter.org/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1147 |title=FAQ: Who designed the designer? |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |website=[[Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center]] |publisher=Casey Luskin; IDEA Center |location=Seattle |type=Short answer |accessdate=2014-02-28 |quote=One need not fully understand the origin or identity of the designer to determine that an object was designed.

Michael Behe's highly successful ''Darwin's Black Box'' followed Johnson's work. We are building on this momentum, broadening the wedge with a positive scientific alternative to materialistic scientific theories, which has come to be called the theory of intelligent design (ID).

That stands on its own. [...] Intelligent design, as it is understood by the proponents that we are discussing today, does involve a supernatural creator, and that is my objection. And I am objecting to it as they have defined it, as Professor Johnson has defined intelligent design, and as Dr. Dembski has defined intelligent design. And both of those are basically religious. They involve the supernatural.}} \u2014 Barbara Forrest, 2005, testifying in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial.</ref> She writes that the leading proponents of intelligent design are closely allied with the ultra-conservative [[Christian Reconstructionism]] movement. She lists connections of (current and former) Discovery Institute Fellows Phillip E. Johnson, Charles B. Thaxton, Michael Behe, [[Richard Weikart]], Jonathan Wells and [[Francis J. Beckwith]] to leading Christian Reconstructionist organizations, and the extent of the funding provided the Institute by [[Howard Ahmanson, Jr.]], a leading figure in the Reconstructionist movement.<ref name=\"ForrestMay2007Paper\" />\n\n===Reaction from other creationist groups===\nNot all creationist organizations have embraced the intelligent design movement. According to Thomas Dixon, \"Religious leaders have come out against ID too. An open letter affirming the compatibility of Christian faith and the teaching of evolution, first produced in response to controversies in Wisconsin in 2004, has now been signed by over ten thousand clergy from different Christian denominations across America. In 2006, the director of the [[Vatican Observatory]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] astronomer [[George Coyne]], condemned ID as a kind of 'crude creationism' which reduced God to a mere engineer.\"<ref>[[#Dixon 2008|Dixon 2008]], p. 82</ref> [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]] of [[Reasons to Believe]], a proponent of [[Old Earth creationism]], believes that the efforts of intelligent design proponents to divorce the concept from Biblical Christianity make its hypothesis too vague. In 2002, he wrote: \"Winning the argument for design without identifying the designer yields, at best, a sketchy origins model. Such a model makes little if any positive impact on the community of scientists and other scholars. [...] ...the time is right for a direct approach, a single leap into the origins fray. Introducing a biblically based, scientifically verifiable creation model represents such a leap.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Ross |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Ross (creationist) |date=July 2002 |title=More Than Intelligent Design |url=http://www.reasons.org/articles/more-than-intelligent-design |magazine=Facts for Faith |location=Glendora, Calif. |publisher=[[Reasons to Believe]] |issue=10 |oclc=52894856 |accessdate=2014-02-28}}</ref>\n\nLikewise, two of the most prominent YEC organizations in the world have attempted to distinguish their views from those of the intelligent design movement. [[Henry M. Morris]] of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) wrote, in 1999, that ID, \"even if well-meaning and effectively articulated, will not work! It has often been tried in the past and has failed, and it will fail today. The reason it won't work is because it is not the Biblical method.\" According to Morris: \"The evidence of intelligent design ... must be either followed by or accompanied by a sound presentation of true Biblical creationism if it is to be meaningful and lasting.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

Intelligent design professes to offer an answer that does not need to be defined or explained, the intelligent agent, designer. By asserting a conclusion that cannot be accounted for scientifically, ''the designer'', intelligent design cannot be sustained by any further explanation, and objections raised to those who accept intelligent design make little headway. Thus intelligent design is not a provisional assessment of data, which can change when new information is discovered. Once it is claimed that a conclusion that need not be accounted for has been established, there is simply no possibility of future correction. The idea of the progressive growth of scientific ideas is required to explain previous data and any previously unexplainable data.</ref><ref group=\"n\">{{cite web |url=http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf |title=Nobel Laureates Initiative |date=September 9, 2005 |publisher=The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity |type=Letter |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051007161950/http://media.ljworld.com/pdf/2005/09/15/nobel_letter.pdf |archivedate=October 7, 2005 |accessdate=2014-02-28}} The September 2005 statement by 38 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureates]] stated that: \"...intelligent design is fundamentally unscientific; it cannot be tested as scientific theory because its central conclusion is based on belief in the intervention of a supernatural agent.\"</ref><ref group=\"n\">{{cite web |url=http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/intelligent.html |title=Intelligent Design is not Science: Scientists and teachers speak out |date=October 2005 |website=Faculty of Science |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |location=Sydney |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614003243/http://www.science.unsw.edu.au/news/2005/intelligent.html |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |accessdate=2009-01-09}} The October 2005 statement, by a coalition representing more than 70,000 Australian scientists and science teachers said: \"intelligent design is not science\" and \"urge all Australian governments and educators not to permit the teaching or promulgation of ID as science.\"</ref>\n\nIntelligent design proponents seek to change this fundamental basis of science<ref name=\"Forrest2000\">{{cite journal |last=Forrest |first=Barbara |date=Fall\u2013Winter 2000 |title=Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism: Clarifying the Connection |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html |journal=[[Philo (journal)|Philo]] |location=Amherst, N.Y. |publisher=Center for Inquiry |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201329 |issn=1098-3570 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |doi=10.5840/philo20003213}}</ref> by eliminating \"methodological naturalism\" from science<ref>[[#Johnson 1995|Johnson 1995]]. <nowiki>Johnson positions himself as a \"theistic realist\" against \"methodological naturalism\".</nowiki></ref> and replacing it with what the leader of the intelligent design movement, Phillip E.

The characteristics of intelligence are assumed by intelligent design proponents to be observable without specifying what the criteria for the measurement of intelligence should be. Critics say that the design detection methods proposed by intelligent design proponents are radically different from conventional design detection, undermining the key elements that make it possible as legitimate science. Intelligent design proponents, they say, are proposing both searching for a designer without knowing anything about that designer's abilities, parameters, or intentions (which scientists do know when searching for the results of human intelligence), as well as denying the very distinction between natural/artificial design that allows scientists to compare complex designed artifacts against the background of the sorts of complexity found in nature.<ref group=\"n\">{{cite court\n|litigants=Kitzmiller v.

Scott]], along with [[Glenn Branch]] and other critics, has argued that many points raised by intelligent design proponents are [[Argument from ignorance|arguments from ignorance]].\nIn the argument from ignorance, a lack of evidence for one view is erroneously argued to constitute proof of the correctness of another view. Scott and Branch say that intelligent design is an argument from ignorance because it relies on a lack of knowledge for its conclusion: lacking a natural explanation for certain specific aspects of evolution, we assume intelligent cause. They contend most scientists would reply that the unexplained is not unexplainable, and that \"we don't know yet\" is a more appropriate response than invoking a cause outside science. Particularly, Michael Behe's demands for ever more detailed explanations of the historical evolution of molecular systems seem to assume a false dichotomy, where either evolution or design is the proper explanation, and any perceived failure of evolution becomes a victory for design. Scott and Branch also contend that the supposedly novel contributions proposed by intelligent design proponents have not served as the basis for any productive scientific research.<ref name=\"Scott and Branch\">{{cite web\n|url=http://ncse.com/creationism/general/intelligent-design-not-accepted-by-most-scientists |title='Intelligent Design' Not Accepted by Most Scientists |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=August 12, 2002\n|origyear=Reprinted with permission from ''School Board News'', August 13, 2002 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |type=Blog |accessdate=2009-11-18}}</ref>\n\nIn his conclusion to the Kitzmiller trial, Judge John E.

Arkansas]]'' (1982) trial, which found it was \"contrived dualism\", the false premise of a \"two model approach\". Behe's argument of irreducible complexity puts forward negative arguments against evolution but does not make any positive scientific case for intelligent design.

The breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial.

Their aim has been to expose more students to articles and videos produced by advocates of intelligent design that criticise evolution. They have been presented as supporting \"[[academic freedom]]\", on the supposition that teachers, students, and college professors face intimidation and retaliation when discussing scientific criticisms of evolution, and therefore require protection. Critics of the legislation have pointed out that there are no credible scientific critiques of evolution, and an investigation in [[Florida]] of allegations of intimidation and retaliation found no evidence that it had occurred. The vast majority of the bills have been unsuccessful, with the one exception being Louisiana's [[Louisiana Science Education Act]], which was enacted in 2008.\n\nIn April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K\u201012 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as \"Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.\" However, these worldviews as well as others \"that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, Calif. |accessdate=2010-08-09}}</ref>\n\n==Status outside the United States==\n\n===Europe===\nIn June 2007, the [[Council of Europe]]'s Committee on Culture, Science and Education issued a report, ''The dangers of creationism in education'', which states \"Creationism in any of its forms, such as 'intelligent design', is not based on facts, does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes.\"<ref name=\"EDOC11297\">{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11678&Language=EN |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=June 8, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |type=Report |id=Doc. 11297 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309011447/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11678&Language=EN |archive-date=2013-03-09 }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&Language=EN |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=September 17, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |type=Report |id=Doc. 11375 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307233347/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&Language=en |archivedate=March 7, 2013 |df= }}\n*{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/main.asp?link=/documents/adoptedtext/ta07/eres1580.htm |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=October 4, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |type=Resolution |id=Resolution 1580 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307163155/http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=%2FDocuments%2FAdoptedText%2Fta07%2FERES1580.htm |archivedate=March 7, 2014 |df= }}</ref> In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism, it described intelligent design as \"anti-science\" and involving \"blatant scientific fraud\" and \"intellectual deception\" that \"blurs the nature, objectives and limits of science\" and links it and other forms of creationism to [[denialism]].

The exception is the beta-4 subunit, which has a cytoplasmic domain of 1,088 amino acids, one of the largest of any membrane protein. Outside the cell membrane, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains lie close together along a length of about 23&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]; the final 5&nbsp;nm [[N-terminus|N-termini]] of each chain forms a [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand-binding]] region for the ECM. They have been compared to [[lobster]] claws, although they don't actually \"pinch\" their ligand, they  chemically interact with it at the insides of the \"tips\" of their \"pinchers\".\n\nThe [[molecular mass]] of the integrin subunits can vary from 90&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|kDa]] to 160&nbsp;kDa. Beta subunits have four [[cysteine]]-rich repeated sequences. Both \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits bind several [[divalent]] [[cation]]s. The role of divalent cations in the \u03b1 subunit is unknown, but may stabilize the folds of the protein. The [[Ion|cations]] in the \u03b2 subunits are more interesting: they are directly involved in coordinating at least some of the [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that integrins bind.\n\nIntegrins can be categorized in multiple ways. For example, some \u03b1 chains have an additional structural element (or \"domain\") inserted toward the [[N-terminal]], the alpha-A domain (so called because it has a similar structure to the A-domains found in the protein [[von Willebrand factor]]; it is also termed the \u03b1-I domain). Integrins carrying this domain either bind to [[collagen]]s (e.g. integrins \u03b11 \u03b21, and \u03b12 \u03b21), or act as [[Cell\u2013cell interaction|cell-cell]] adhesion molecules (integrins of the \u03b22 family). This \u03b1-I domain is the binding site for ligands of such integrins. Those integrins that don't carry this inserted domain also have an A-domain in their ligand binding site, but ''this'' A-domain is found on the \u03b2 subunit.\n\nIn both cases, the A-domains carry up to three divalent cation binding sites. One is permanently occupied in physiological [[concentration]]s of divalent cations, and carries either a calcium or magnesium ion, the principal divalent cations in blood at median concentrations of 1.4&nbsp;mM (calcium) and 0.8&nbsp;mM (magnesium). The other two sites become occupied by cations when ligands bind\u2014at least for those ligands involving an acidic amino acid in their interaction sites. An acidic amino acid features in the integrin-interaction site of many ECM proteins, for example as part of the amino acid sequence [[Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid]] (\"RGD\" in the one-letter amino acid code).\n\n=== Structure ===\nDespite many years of effort, discovering the high-resolution structure of integrins proved to be challenging, as membrane proteins are classically difficult to purify, and as integrins are large, complex and linked to many sugar trees (\"highly [[glycosylation|glycosylated]]\"). Low-resolution images of detergent extracts of intact integrin GPIIbIIIa, obtained using electron microscopy, and even data from indirect techniques that investigate the solution properties of integrins using ultracentrifugation and light scattering, were combined with fragmentary high-resolution crystallographic or NMR data from single or paired domains of single integrin chains, and molecular models postulated for the rest of the chains.\n\nThe [[X-ray]] crystal structure obtained for the complete extracellular region of one integrin, \u03b1v\u03b23,<ref name=\"pmid11546839\"/> shows the molecule to be folded into an inverted V-shape that potentially brings the ligand-binding sites close to the cell membrane. Perhaps more importantly, the crystal structure was also obtained for the same integrin bound to a small ligand containing the RGD-sequence, the drug [[cilengitide]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith JW | title = Cilengitide Merck | journal = Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 741\u20135 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12901235 }}</ref> As detailed above, this finally revealed why divalent cations (in the A-domains) are critical for RGD-ligand binding to integrins. The interaction of such sequences with integrins is believed to be a primary switch by which ECM exerts its effects on cell behaviour.\n\nThe structure poses many questions, especially regarding ligand binding and signal transduction. The ligand binding site is directed towards the C-terminal of the integrin, the region where the molecule emerges from the cell membrane. If it emerges [[orthogonality|orthogonally]] from the membrane, the ligand binding site would apparently be obstructed, especially as integrin ligands are typically massive and well cross-linked components of the ECM. In fact, little is known about the angle that membrane proteins subtend to the plane of the membrane; this is a problem difficult to address with available technologies. The default assumption is that they emerge rather like little lollipops, but the evidence for this sweet supposition is noticeable by its absence. The integrin structure has drawn attention to this problem, which may have general implications for how membrane proteins work. It appears that the integrin transmembrane helices are tilted (see \"Activation\" below), which hints that the extracellular chains may also not be orthogonal with respect to the membrane surface.\n\nAlthough the crystal structure changed surprisingly little after binding to cilengitide, the current hypothesis is that integrin function involves changes in shape to move the ligand-binding site into a more accessible position, away from the cell surface, and this shape change also triggers intracellular signaling. There is a wide body of cell-biological and biochemical literature that supports this view. Perhaps the most convincing evidence involves the use of [[antibody|antibodies]] that only recognize integrins when they have bound to their ligands, or are activated. As the \"footprint\" that an antibody makes on its binding target is roughly a circle about 3&nbsp;nm in diameter, the resolution of this technique is low. Nevertheless, these so-called LIBS (Ligand-Induced-Binding-Sites) antibodies unequivocally show that dramatic changes in integrin shape routinely occur. However, how the changes detected with antibodies look on the structure is still unknown.\n\n=== Activation ===\n\nWhen released into the cell membrane, newly synthesized integrin dimers are speculated to be found in the same \"bent\" conformation revealed by the structural studies described above.  One school of thought claims that this bent form prevents them from interacting with their ligands, although bent forms can predominate in high-resolution EM structures of integrin bound to an ECM ligand. Therefore, at least in biochemical experiments, integrin dimers must apparently not be 'unbent' in order to prime them and allow their binding to the [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]]. In cells, the priming  is accomplished by a protein talin, which binds to the \u03b2 tail of the integrin dimer and changes its conformation.<ref name=\"pmid15157154\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Calderwood DA | title = Talin controls integrin activation | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 32 | issue = Pt3 | pages = 434\u20137 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15157154 | doi = 10.1042/BST0320434 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid10497155\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Calderwood DA, Zent R, Grant R, Rees DJ, Hynes RO, Ginsberg MH | title = The Talin head domain binds to integrin beta subunit cytoplasmic tails and regulates integrin activation | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 40 | pages = 28071\u20134 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10497155 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.40.28071 }}</ref> The \u03b1 and \u03b2 integrin chains are both class-I transmembrane proteins: they pass the plasma membrane as single transmembrane alpha-helices.

This molecule dramatically increases its binding affinity for fibrin/fibrinogen through association of platelets with  exposed collagens in the wound site. Upon association of platelets with collagen, GPIIbIIIa changes shape, allowing it to bind to fibrin and other blood components to form the clot matrix and stop blood loss.\n\n=== Attachment of cell to the ECM ===\nIntegrins couple the ECM outside a cell to the [[cytoskeleton]] (in particular, the [[microfilament]]s) inside the cell. Which ligand in the ECM the integrin can bind to is defined by which \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits the integrin is made of. Among the [[ligand]]s of integrins are [[fibronectin]], [[vitronectin]], [[collagen]], and [[laminin]]. The connection between the cell and the ECM may help the cell to endure pulling forces without being ripped out of the ECM. The ability of a cell to create this kind of bond is also of vital importance in [[ontogeny]].\n\nCell attachment to the ECM is a basic requirement to build a multicellular organism. Integrins are not simply hooks, but give the cell critical signals about the nature of its surroundings. Together with signals arising from receptors for soluble growth factors like [[Vascular endothelial growth factor|VEGF]], [[epidermal growth factor|EGF]], and many others, they enforce a cellular decision on what biological action to take, be it attachment, movement, death, or differentiation. Thus integrins lie at the heart of many cellular biological processes. The attachment of the cell takes place through formation of [[cell adhesion]] complexes, which consist of integrins and many cytoplasmic proteins, such as [[talin (protein)|talin]], [[vinculin]], [[paxillin]], and alpha-[[actinin]]. These act by regulating [[kinase]]s such as FAK ([[focal adhesion kinase]]) and [[Src kinase]] family members to phosphorylate substrates such as p130CAS thereby recruiting signaling adaptors such as [[CRK (gene)|CRK]]. These adhesion complexes attach to the actin cytoskeleton. The integrins thus serve to link two networks across the plasma membrane: the extracellular ECM and the intracellular actin filamentous system. Integrin \u03b16\u03b24 is an exception: it links to the keratin intermediate filament system in epithelial cells.<ref name=\"pmid16581764\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilhelmsen K, Litjens SH, Sonnenberg A | title = Multiple functions of the integrin alpha6beta4 in epidermal homeostasis and tumorigenesis | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 26 | issue = 8 | pages = 2877\u201386 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16581764 | pmc = 1446957 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.26.8.2877-2886.2006 }}</ref>\n\nFocal adhesions are large molecular complexes, which are generated following interaction of integrins with ECM, then their clustering.

Cells adhere to a [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] through their integrins. During movement, the cell makes new attachments to the substrate at its front and concurrently releases those at its rear. When released from the substrate, integrin molecules are taken back into the cell by [[endocytosis]]; they are transported through the cell to its front by the [[endocytic cycle]], where they are added back to the surface. In this way they are cycled for reuse, enabling the cell to make fresh attachments at its leading front. It is not yet clear whether cell migration in tissue culture is an artefact of integrin processing, or whether such integrin-dependent cell migration also occurs in living organisms.\n\n=== Signal transduction ===\nIntegrins play an important role in cell signaling by modulating the cell signaling pathways of transmembrane protein kinases such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). While the interaction between integrin and receptor tyrosine kinases originally  was thought of as uni-directional and supportive, recent studies indicate that integrins have additional, multi-faceted roles in cell signaling. \nIntegrins can regulate the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling by recruiting specific adaptors to the plasma membrane. For example, \u03b21c integrin recruits Gab1/Shp2 and presents Shp2 to IGF1R, resulting in dephosphorylation of the receptor.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goel HL, Breen M, Zhang J, Das I, Aznavoorian-Cheshire S, Greenberg NM, Elgavish A, Languino LR | title = beta1A integrin expression is required for type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor mitogenic and transforming activities and localization to focal contacts | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 65 | issue = 15 | pages = 6692\u2013700 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16061650 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-4315 }}</ref>  In a reverse direction, when a receptor tyrosine kinase is activated, integrins co-localise at focal adhesion with the receptor tyrosine kinases and their associated signaling molecules.\n\nThe repertoire of integrins expressed on a particular cell can specify the signaling pathway due to the differential binding affinity of ECM ligands for the integrins.

Integrins can assume several different well-defined shapes or \"conformational states\".

They are often described as narrow, water-filled tunnels that allow only ions of a certain size and/or charge to pass through. This characteristic is called [[selective permeability]]. The archetypal channel pore is just one or two atoms wide at its narrowest point and is selective for specific species of ion, such as [[sodium]] or [[potassium]]. However, some channels may be permeable to the passage of more than one type of ion, typically sharing a common charge: positive ([[cation]]s) or negative ([[anion]]s). Ions often move through the segments of the channel pore in single file nearly as quickly as the ions move through free solution. In many ion channels, passage through the pore is governed by a \"gate\", which may be opened or closed in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical force.\n\nIon channels are [[integral membrane protein]]s, typically formed as assemblies of several individual proteins. Such \"multi-[[protein subunit|subunit]]\" assemblies usually involve a circular arrangement of identical or [[homology (biology)|homologous]] proteins closely packed around a water-filled pore through the plane of the membrane or [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"isbn978-0-87893-741-7\">{{cite book | editor-first1 = Dale | editor-last1 = Purves | editor-first2 = George J. | editor-last2 = Augustine | editor-first3 = David | editor-last3 = Fitzpatrick | | editor-first4 = Lawrence.

Correspondingly, they assemble as [[tetramer protein|tetramer]]s to produce a functioning channel.\n*Some [[transient receptor potential channel]]s: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in [[Drosophila]] phototransduction.

This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: classical ([[TRPC]]), vanilloid receptors ([[TRPV]]), melastatin ([[TRPM]]), polycystins ([[TRPP]]), mucolipins ([[TRPML]]), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 ([[TRPA (channel)|TRPA]]).\n*Hyperpolarization-activated [[cyclic nucleotide-gated channel]]s: The opening of these channels is due to [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarization]] rather than the depolarization required for other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. These channels are also sensitive to the cyclic nucleotides [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] and [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]], which alter the voltage sensitivity of the channel\u2019s opening. These channels are permeable to the monovalent cations K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. There are 4 members of this family, all of which form tetramers of six-transmembrane \u03b1 subunits.  As these channels open under hyperpolarizing conditions, they function as [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaking]] channels in the heart, particularly the [[SA node]].\n*[[Voltage-gated proton channel]]s: Voltage-gated proton channels open with depolarization, but in a strongly pH-sensitive manner. The result is that these channels open only when the electrochemical gradient is outward, such that their opening will only allow protons to leave cells. Their function thus appears to be acid extrusion from cells. Another important function occurs in phagocytes (e.g. [[eosinophils]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]]) during the \"respiratory burst.\"  When bacteria or other microbes are engulfed by phagocytes, the enzyme [[NADPH oxidase]] assembles in the membrane and begins to produce [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) that help kill bacteria.  NADPH oxidase is electrogenic, moving electrons across the membrane, and proton channels open to allow proton flux to balance the electron movement electrically.\n\n==== Ligand-gated ====\n{{Main|Ligand-gated ion channel}}\n\nAlso known as ionotropic [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]], this group of channels open in response to specific ligand molecules binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the structure of the channel protein that ultimately leads to the opening of the channel gate and subsequent ion flux across the plasma membrane. Examples of such channels include the cation-permeable [[Acetylcholine receptor|\"nicotinic\" Acetylcholine receptor]], [[Glutamate receptors|ionotropic glutamate-gated receptors]], acid sensing ion channels ([[ASICs]]),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = ASIC and ENaC type sodium channels: conformational states and the structures of the ion selectivity filters | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 284 | issue = 4 | pages = 525\u2013545 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27580245 | doi = 10.1111/febs.13840 }}</ref> [[P2X Receptors|ATP-gated P2X receptors]], and the anion-permeable \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-gated [[GABA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]].\n\nIon channels activated by second messengers may also be categorized in this group, although [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] and second messengers are otherwise distinguished from each other.\n\n==== Other gating ====\n\nGating also includes activation and inactivation by [[second messenger]]s from the inside of the [[cell membrane]] \u2013 rather than from outside the cell, as in the case for ligands.\n\n*Some potassium channels:\n**[[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|Inward-rectifier potassium channels]]: These channels allow potassium ions to flow into the cell in an \"inwardly rectifying\" manner: potassium flows more efficiently into than out of the cell. This family is composed of 15 official and 1 unofficial members and is further subdivided into 7 subfamilies based on homology. These channels are affected by intracellular [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], PIP<sub>2</sub>, and [[G-protein]] \u03b2\u03b3 subunits. They are involved in important physiological processes such as pacemaker activity in the heart, insulin release, and potassium uptake in [[glia|glial cells]]. They contain only two transmembrane segments, corresponding to the core pore-forming segments of the K<sub>V</sub> and K<sub>Ca</sub> channels. Their \u03b1 subunits form tetramers.\n**[[Calcium-activated potassium channel]]s: This family of channels is activated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and contains 8 members.\n**[[Tandem pore domain potassium channel|Two-pore-domain potassium channels]]: This family of 15 members form what are known as [[leak channel]]s, and they display [[GHK current equation|Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz]] (open) [[rectifier|rectification]].\n*[[Light-gated ion channels|Light-gated channels]] like [[channelrhodopsin]] are directly opened by [[photon]]s.\n*[[Mechanosensitive ion channel]]s open under the influence of stretch, pressure, shear, and displacement.\n*[[Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels]]: This superfamily of channels contains two families: the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels and the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. This grouping is functional rather than evolutionary.\n**Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels: This family of channels is characterized by activation by either intracellular [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] or [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]. These channels are primarily permeable to monovalent cations such as K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. They are also permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, though it acts to close them. There are 6 members of this family, which is divided into 2 subfamilies.\n**Hyperpolarization-activated [[cyclic nucleotide-gated channels]]\n*Temperature-gated channels: Members of the [[Trp channel|transient receptor potential ion channel]] superfamily, such as [[TRPV1]] or [[TRPM8]], are opened either by hot or cold temperatures.\n\n===Classification by type of ions===\n*[[Chloride channel]]s: This superfamily of channels consists of approximately 13 members. They include ClCs, CLICs, Bestrophins and CFTRs. These channels are non-selective for small anions; however [[chloride]] is the most abundant anion, and hence they are known as chloride channels.\n*[[Potassium channel]]s\n**[[Voltage-gated potassium channel]]s e.g., Kvs, Kirs etc.\n**[[Calcium-activated potassium channel]]s e.g., BKCa or MaxiK, SK, etc.\n**[[Inward-rectifier potassium ion channel|Inward-rectifier potassium channels]]\n**[[Two P potassium channel|Two-pore-domain potassium channels]]: This family of 15 members form what is known as [[leak channel]]s, and they display [[GHK current equation|Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz]] (open) [[rectifier|rectification]].\n*[[Sodium channels]]\n** [[Voltage-gated sodium channel]]s (NaVs)\n** [[Epithelial sodium channel]]s (ENaCs)<ref name=\"2016-Hanukoglu\" >{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Hanukoglu A | title = Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) family: Phylogeny, structure-function, tissue distribution, and associated inherited diseases | journal = Gene | volume = 579 | issue = 2 | pages = 95\u2013132 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26772908 | pmc = 4756657 | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2015.12.061 }}</ref>\n*[[Calcium channel]]s (CaVs)\n*Proton channels\n**[[Voltage-gated proton channels]]\n*''Non-selective cation channels'': These non-selectively allow many types of cations, mainly Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, through the channel.\n**Most [[transient receptor potential|transient receptor potential channels]]\n\n=== Classification by cellular localization ===\n\nIon channels are also classified according to their subcellular localization. The plasma membrane accounts for around 2% of the total membrane in the cell, whereas intracellular organelles contain 98% of the cell's membrane. The major intracellular compartments are [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]], and [[mitochondria]]. On the basis of localization, ion channels are classified as:\n\n* Plasma membrane channels\n**Examples: Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv), Sodium channels (Nav), Calcium channels (Cav) and Chloride channels (ClC)\n* Intracellular channels, which are further classified into different organelles\n**[[Endoplasmic reticulum]] channels: RyR, SERCA, ORAi\n**Mitochondrial channels: mPTP, KATP, BK, IK, CLIC5, Kv7.4 at the inner membrane and VDAC and CLIC4 as outer membrane channels.\n\n=== Other classifications ===\n\nThere are other criteria for ion channel classification, including multiple pores and transient potentials.\n\nAlmost all ion channels have a single pore. However, there are also those with two pores:\n*[[Two-pore channel]]s: This two-member family is thought to form cation-selective ion channels.  They appear to contain two K<sub>V</sub>-style six-transmembrane domains, suggesting that they form a dimer in the membrane. These channels are related to [[cation channels of sperm]] and, more distantly, [[Transient receptor potential|TRP]] channels.\n\nThere are channels that are classified by the duration of the response to stimuli:\n*[[Transient receptor potential channel]]s: This group of channels, normally referred to simply as TRP channels, is named after their role in ''[[Drosophila]]'' visual phototransduction. This family, containing at least 28 members, is diverse in its mechanisms of activation. Some TRP channels remain constitutively open, while others are gated by [[Voltage-gated ion channel|voltage]], intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [[pH]], [[redox]] state, [[osmolarity]], and [[Stretch-activated ion channel|mechanical stretch]]. These channels also vary according to the ion(s) they pass, some being selective for Ca<sup>2+</sup> while others are less selective cation channels. This family is subdivided into 6 subfamilies based on homology: canonical TRP ([[TRPC]]), vanilloid receptors ([[TRPV]]), melastatin ([[TRPM]]), polycystins ([[TRPP]]), mucolipins ([[TRPML]]), and ankyrin transmembrane protein 1 ([[TRPA (channel)|TRPA]]).\n\n== Detailed structure ==\n\nChannels differ with respect to the ion they let pass (for example, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>), the ways in which they may be regulated, the number of subunits of which they are composed and other aspects of structure.<ref>{{cite book | first1 =  Carmay | last1 = Lim | first2 = Todor | last2 = Dudev | name-list-format = vanc | publisher= Springer |publication-date= 2016 |series= Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=16 |title = The Alkali Metal Ions: Their Role in Life | editor1-last = Astrid | editor1-first = Sigel | editor2-last = Helmut | editor2-first = Sigel | editor3-last = Roland | editor3-first = Sige l|chapter = Chapter 10.

An IDE normally consists of a [[source code editor]], [[build automation]] tools, and a [[debugger]]. Most modern IDEs have [[intelligent code completion]]. Some IDEs, such as [[NetBeans]] and [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], contain a [[compiler]], [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], or both; others, such as [[SharpDevelop]] and [[Lazarus (IDE)|Lazarus]], do not. The boundary between an integrated development environment and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined. Sometimes a [[version control system]], or various tools to simplify the construction of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), are integrated. Many modern IDEs also have a [[class browser]], an [[object browser]], and a [[class diagram|class hierarchy diagram]], for use in [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented software development]].\n\n== Overview ==\nIntegrated development environments are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar [[user interface]]s.  IDEs present a single program in which all development is done. This program typically provides many features for authoring, modifying, compiling, deploying and debugging software.  This contrasts with software development using unrelated tools, such as [[vi]], [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] or [[make (software)|make]].\n\nOne aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities, instead providing the same set of capabilities as a cohesive unit.  Reducing that setup time can increase developer productivity, in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating all of the individual tools.  Tighter integration of all development tasks has the potential to improve overall productivity beyond just helping with setup tasks.  For example, code can be continuously parsed while it is being edited, providing instant feedback when syntax errors are introduced. \n\nSome IDEs are dedicated to a specific [[programming language]], allowing a feature set that most closely matches the [[programming paradigm]]s of the language. However, there are many multiple-language IDEs.\n\nWhile most modern IDEs are graphical, text-based IDEs such as [[Turbo Pascal]] were in popular use before the widespread availability of windowing systems like [[Microsoft Windows]] and the [[X Window System]] (X11). They commonly use function keys or [[keyboard shortcut|hotkeys]] to execute frequently used commands or macros.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Emacs-screenshot.png|thumb|[[GNU Emacs]], an extensible editor that is commonly used as an IDE on [[Unix-like]] systems]]\n\nIDEs initially became possible when developing via a [[System console|console]] or [[Computer terminal|terminal]].  Early systems could not support one, since programs were prepared using flowcharts, entering programs with [[punched card]]s (or paper tape, etc.) before submitting them to a [[compiler]]. [[Dartmouth BASIC]] was the first language to be created with an IDE (and was also the first to be designed for use while sitting in front of a console or terminal).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Its IDE (part of the [[Dartmouth Time Sharing System]]) was command-based, and therefore did not look much like the menu-driven, graphical IDEs popular after the advent of the [[Graphical User Interface]]. However it integrated editing, file management, compilation, debugging and execution in a manner consistent with a modern IDE.\n\n[[Maestro I]] is a product from Softlab Munich and was the world's first integrated development environment<ref>[https://www.computerwoche.de/a/interaktives-programmieren-als-systems-schlager,1205421 \"Interaktives Programmieren als Systems-Schlager\"] from ''Computerwoche'' ([[German language|German]])</ref> for software. [[Maestro I]] was installed for 22,000 programmers worldwide. Until 1989, 6,000 installations existed in the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. Maestro was arguably the world leader in this field during the 1970s and 1980s. Today one of the last Maestro I can be found in the Museum of Information Technology at Arlington.\n\nOne of the first IDEs with a plug-in concept was [[Softbench]]. In 1995 ''Computerwoche'' commented that the use of an IDE was not well received by developers since it would fence in their creativity.\n\nAs of March 2015, the most popular IDEs are [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and [[Visual Studio]].<ref>[https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html Top IDE index]</ref>\n\n== Topics ==\n\n=== Syntax highlighting ===\n\nThe IDE editor usually provides [[syntax highlighting]], it can show both the structures, the language keywords and the syntax errors with visually distinct colors and font effects.<ref name=\"ide-common\"/>\n\n=== Refactoring ===\n\nAdvanced IDEs provide support for [[Source-to-source compiler#Refactoring tools|automated refactoring]].<ref name=\"ide-common\">{{cite web |title=Course CS350 Integrated Development Environments |url=https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs350/f17/Public/IDEs/index.html |website=www.cs.odu.edu |publisher=Old Dominion University |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Version control ===\n\nAn IDE is expected to provide integrated [[version control]], in order to interact with source repositories.<ref name=\"ide-common\"/>\n\n=== Debugging ===\n\nIDEs are also used for debugging, using an integrated [[debugger]], with support for setting breakpoints in the editor, visual rendering of steps, etc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Programming software and the IDE |url=https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/guides/zgmpr82/revision/1 |website=BBC Bitesize |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n   \n=== Code search ===\n\nIDEs may provide advanced support for code search: in order to find class and function declarations, usages, variable and field read/write, etc. IDEs can use different kinds of user interface for code search, for example form-based widgets<ref>{{cite web |title=Eclipse Cookbook - Searching Code |url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/eclipse-cookbook/0596007108/ch04s05.html |website=O\u2019Reilly |language=en}}</ref> and natural-language based interfaces.<ref name=\"KimmigMonperrus2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Kimmig|first1=Markus|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mezini|first3=Mira|title=Querying source code with natural language|year=2011|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00640496/document|doi=10.1109/ASE.2011.6100076}}</ref>\n\n=== Visual programming ===\n[[Visual programming]] is a usage scenario in which an IDE is generally required. Visual Basic allows users to create new applications by moving programming, building blocks, or code nodes to create flowcharts or structure diagrams that are then compiled or interpreted.  These flowcharts often are based on the [[Unified Modeling Language]].\n\nThis interface has been popularized with the [[Lego Mindstorms]] system, and is being actively pursued by a number of companies wishing to capitalize on the power of custom browsers like those found at [[Mozilla]]. [[KTechlab]] supports flowcode and is a popular opensource IDE and Simulator for developing software for microcontrollers. Visual programming is also responsible for the power of [[distributed programming]] (cf. [[LabVIEW]] and [[EICASLAB]] software).  An early visual programming system, [[Max (software)|Max]], was modeled after analog [[synthesizer]] design and has been used to develop real-time music performance software since the 1980s. Another early example was [[Prograph]], a [[dataflow programming|dataflow]]-based system originally developed for the [[Macintosh]]. The graphical programming environment \"Grape\" is used to program [[qfix robot kits]].\n\nThis approach is also used in specialist software such as [[Openlab]], where the end users want the flexibility of a full programming language, without the traditional learning curve associated with one.\n\n=== Language support ===\nSome IDEs support multiple languages, such as [[GNU Emacs]] based on [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Emacs Lisp]], and [[IntelliJ IDEA]], [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[MyEclipse]] or [[NetBeans]], all based on [[Java (programming language)|Java]], or [[MonoDevelop]], based on [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], or PlayCode.\n\nSupport for alternative languages is often provided by [[plug-in (computing)|plugins]], allowing them to be installed on the same IDE at the same time. For example, [[Flycheck]] is a modern on-the-fly syntax checking extension for [[GNU Emacs]] 24 with support for 39 languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/introduction.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310225211/http://flycheck.readthedocs.org/en/latest/manual/introduction.html |archivedate=10 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], and [[Netbeans]] have plugins for [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[GNAT]] (for example [[AdaGIDE]]), [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[PHP]], which are selected between automatically based on file extension, environment or project settings.\n\n=== Attitudes across different computing platforms ===\n[[Unix]] programmers can combine [[command-line]] [[POSIX]] tools into a complete development environment, capable of developing large programs such as the [[Linux kernel]] and its environment.<ref>\nRehman, Christopher Paul, Christopher R. Paul.\n\"The Linux Development Platform: Configuring, Using and Maintaining a Complete Programming Environment\".\n2002.\n{{ISBN|0-13-009115-4}} \n</ref> In this sense, the entire Unix system functions as an IDE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnixIsAnIde|title=UnixIsAnIde}}</ref> The free software [[GNU]] tools ([[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), [[GNU Debugger]] (gdb), and [[GNU make]]) are available on many platforms, including Windows.<ref>[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/Developing-with-Emacs.html \"Use Emacs with Microsoft Visual C++ ... use Emacs as an IDE\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704094014/http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/Developing-with-Emacs.html |date=4 July 2013 }}</ref>  The pervasive Unix philosophy of \"everything is a text stream\" enables developers who favor [[command-line]] oriented tools to use editors with support for many of the standard Unix and GNU build tools, building an IDE with programs like\n[[Emacs]]<ref>[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5765 \"Emacs: the Free Software IDE\"]</ref><ref>[http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/emacs-ide.html \"Using Emacs as a Lisp IDE\"]</ref><ref>[http://obsidianrook.com/perlnow/emacs_as_perl_ide.html \"Emacs as a Perl IDE\"]</ref>\nor [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]]. [[Data Display Debugger]] is intended to be an advanced graphical front-end for many text-based [[debugger]] standard tools.  Some programmers prefer managing [[makefile]]s and their derivatives to the similar code building tools included in a full IDE.  For example, most contributors to the [[PostgreSQL]] database use [[makefile|make]] and [[GNU Debugger|gdb]] directly to develop new features.<ref>[http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Developer_FAQ#What_development_environment_is_required_to_develop_code.3F PostgreSQL Developer FAQ]</ref>  Even when building PostgreSQL for [[Microsoft Windows]] using [[Visual C++]], [[Perl]] scripts are used as a replacement for [[makefile|make]] rather than relying on any IDE features.<ref>[http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/install-windows.html PostgreSQL Installation from Source Code on Windows]</ref> Some Linux IDEs such as [[Geany]] attempt to provide a graphical front end to traditional build operations.\n\nOn the various [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, command-line tools for development are seldom used. Accordingly, there are many commercial and non-commercial products. However, each has a different design commonly creating incompatibilities. Most major compiler vendors for Windows still provide free copies of their command-line tools, including [[Microsoft]] ([[Visual C++]], [[Platform SDK]], [[.NET Framework]] SDK, [[nmake]] utility).\n\nIDEs have always been popular on the Apple Macintosh's [[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]], dating back to [[Macintosh Programmer's Workshop]], [[Turbo Pascal]], THINK Pascal and [[THINK C]] environments of the mid-1980s.  Currently macOS programmers can choose between native IDEs like [[Xcode]] and open-source tools such as [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] and [[Netbeans]]. [[ActiveState Komodo]] is a proprietary multilanguage IDE supported on macOS.\n\nWith the advent of [[cloud computing]], some [[web integrated development environment|IDEs are available online]] and run within web browsers.\n\n== Web integrated development environment ==\n\nA '''web integrated development environment''' ('''Web IDE''' or '''WIDE'''), also known as '''cloud IDE''', is a [[Web browser|browser]] based IDE that allows for software development or web development.<ref>{{cite web |title=Web-based vs. desktop-based Tools \u2013 EclipseSource |url=http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2018/06/19/web-based-vs-desktop-based-tools/ |website=eclipsesource.com}}</ref> A web IDE can be accessed from a web browser, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer, allowing for a portable work environment. A web IDE does not usually contain all of the same features as a traditional, or desktop, IDE, although all of the basic IDE features, such as syntax highlighting, are typically present.\n\nA web IDE, like most websites, is usually composed of two pieces: a frontend and a backend. The frontend is usually written in Javascript, using [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] methods to communicate with the backend using a HTTP API, although in some cases, a browser extension or desktop application serves as the frontend and communicates with the backend without the need for a browser. The backend takes care of creating, saving, and opening files, as well as running any terminal commands if the IDE supports it. This setup allows for portability and continuity. The state of the IDE can be saved and reopened on another machine. This also allows for compiling or running programs to continue while the user is away.\n\nMany web IDEs support several programming languages, while others only support a specific language. Most web IDEs allow access to a [[Command-line interface]] (CLI) that allows the user to install or run any software that is needed for development, allowing \"full\" control over the development environment. Open source web IDEs allow for installation on local servers or machines and can be used to give the developer more control over the development environment.\n\nMost Web IDEs also include [[Collaborative real-time editor|real time collaboration]] features, allowing multiple users to simultaneously work with other developers around the world (or locally) in real time.\n\nPros:\n* Access from anywhere or any computer (with Internet access).\n* Minimal configuration needed (or only needed once).\n* Centralized workspace.\n* Easily included in a virtual development environment (such as when using a [[Vagrant (software)|Vagrant]] system).\n* No need to install a lot of software locally.\n* Allows for development from inexpensive machines, such as Chromebooks, since the testing and development occurs on a separate machine (server).\n* Can be used as a desktop IDE when setup with a [[Web server]] on the local machine.\n\nCons:\n* Must have (good) Internet access.\n* If not self hosted, possible outside security issues.\n* Possible server downtime.\n* Maintenance if self hosted\n* Most do not support smart phones or tablets well.\n\nNotable Web IDEs:\n*[[PaizaCloud Cloud IDE]]\n*[[Collaborative development environment]] (CDE)\n*[[Comparison of online source code playgrounds]]\n*[[Cloud9 IDE]]\n*[[Koding]]\n*[[PythonAnywhere]]\n*[[sourceLair]]\n*[[YouOS]]\n*[[Codeanywhere]]\n*[[Eclipse Che]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Integrated development environments}}\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Comparison of integrated development environments]]\n* [[Collaborative development environment]] (CDE)\n* [[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE)\n* [[Game integrated development environment]]\n* {{section link|Multiple document interface|IDE-style interface}} (MDI)\n* [[Rapid application development]] (RAD)\n* [[Read\u2013eval\u2013print loop|Read\u2013Eval\u2013Print Loop]] (REPL)\n* [[Web integrated development environment]] (Web IDE or WIDE)\n* [[Code analysis]] tools\n* [[Source-to-source compiler#Refactoring tools|Source code refactoring tools]]\n* Software building tools (the [[compiler]], [[linker (computing)|linker]], etc., and the [[build automation]] tool used to control them)\n* [[Version control]], also called source repository (configuration management)\n* [[Language Server Protocol]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Integrated development environments}}\n\n{{use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Integrated development environment}}\n[[Category:Integrated development environments|*]]", "sha1": "1lgdchx0plrcedkoevo3pdom5tojz4f"}}, {"title": "Integrated Drive Electronics", "ns": "0", "id": "15306", "redirect": {"title": "Parallel ATA"}, "revision": {"id": "783865792", "parentid": "689428338", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:24:24Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Parallel ATA#IDE and ATA-1]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R to section}}\n}}", "sha1": "1yc9rtdfaaxdlnh74okn7j7nyaunsli"}}, {"title": "Injection system", "ns": "0", "id": "15307", "redirect": {"title": "Fuel injection"}, "revision": {"id": "15912785", "parentid": "12323683", "timestamp": "2005-04-15T00:58:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Aaronmz", "id": "220928"}, "comment": "no useful content entered on this page since 2002;

The name ''Intellivision'' is a [[portmanteau]] of \"intelligent television\".  Development of the console began in 1977, the same year as the introduction of its main competitor, the [[Atari 2600]].<ref name=papaint_his/>  In 1984 Mattel sold the Intellivision business to a former Mattel Electronics executive and investors that would become INTV Corporation.  Games development started in 1978 and continued until 1990 when the Intellivision was discontinued. From 1980 to 1983 over 3 million Intellivision units were sold.<ref name = nyt84/><ref name=\"gamespy\"/><ref name=askhal1/><ref name=timeline/>\n\nIn 2009, video game website [[IGN]] named the Intellivision the No. 14 greatest video game console of all time.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/top-25-consoles/14.html Top 25 Videogame Consoles of All Time: Intellivision is number 14], IGN.

Mattel Electronics would become a subsidiary in 1981.<ref name=timeline/>\n\nThough not the first system to challenge [[Warner Communications]]'s [[Atari]], it was the first to pose a serious threat to the market leader. A series of advertisements featuring [[George Plimpton]] were produced that demonstrated the superiority of the Intellivision's graphics and sound to those of the [[Atari 2600]], using side-by-side game comparisons.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/>  One of the slogans of the television advertisements stated that Intellivision was \"the closest thing to the real thing\"; one example in an advertisement compared golf games. The other console's games had a blip sound and cruder graphics, while the Intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball, and graphics that suggested a more 3D look. There was also an advertisement comparing the [[Atari 2600]] to it, featuring the slogan \"I didn't know\".  In its first year, Mattel sold out its initial 175,000 production run of Intellivision \"Master Components\".  In 1981, over 1 million Intellivision consoles were sold.<ref name=csmonitor>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0524/052434.html|title=Computerized games hit profits jackpot for Mattel company|date=May 24, 1982|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sears-Tele-Games-Super-Video-Arcade-Intellivision-Console-FL.jpg|link=File:Sears-Tele-Games-Super-Video-Arcade-Intellivision-Console-FL.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Gray rectangular console with two controllers.

In Japan Intellivisions were branded by [[Bandai]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Marley|first=Scott |date=December 2016 |title=SG-1000 |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=163|pages=56\u201361|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]}}</ref> and in [[Brazil]] there were Digimed and Digiplay Intellivisions manufactured by Sharp in 1983.\n\n===Software===\n{{See also|List of Intellivision games}}\nInside every Intellivision is 4K of [[Read-only memory|ROM]] containing the Exec software.  It provides two benefits:  reusable code that can effectively make a 4K cartridge an 8K game, and a [[software framework]] for new programmers to develop games more easily and quickly.  It also allows other programmers to more easily review and continue another's project.  Under the supervision of David Rolfe (APh) and graphics supplied by [[Mattel]] artist Dave James, APh was able to quickly create the Intellivision launch title library using mostly summer students.<ref name=lives_companies>[http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html Where Are They Now?] intellivisionlives.com</ref>  The drawback is that to be flexible and handle many different types of games the Exec runs less efficiently than a dedicated program.  Intellivision games that leverage the Exec run at a 20&nbsp;Hz [[frame rate]] instead of the 60&nbsp;Hz frame rate for which the Intellivision was designed.  Using the Exec framework is optional, but almost all Intellivision games released by Mattel Electronics are 20&nbsp;Hz.  The limited [[ROM cartridge|ROM]] space also meant there was no room for computer artificial intelligence and many early games required two players.\n\nInitially, all Intellivision games were programmed by the outside firm, APh Technological Consulting,<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/> with 19 cartridges produced before Christmas 1980. Once the Intellivision project became successful, software development would be brought in-house.  Mattel formed its own software development group and began hiring programmers.  The original five members of that Intellivision team were Mike Minkoff, Rick Levine, John Sohl, [[Don Daglow]], and manager Gabriel Baum. Levine and Minkoff, a long-time Mattel Toys veteran, both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. During 1981 Mattel hired programmers as fast it could.  Early in 1982 Mattel Electronics relocated from Mattel headquarters to an unused industrial building.  Office renovation work happened as new staff moved in. To keep these programmers from being hired away by rival [[Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret. In public, the programmers were referred to collectively as the [[Blue Sky Rangers]].\n\nMost of the early games were based on traditional real-world concepts such as sports, with an emphasis on realism and depth of play within the technology of the day.  The Intellivision was not marketed as a toy; as such, games such as ''Sea Battle'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' are not made in a pick-up-and-play format which [[arcade games|arcade style]] games are.  Reading the instructions is often a prerequisite to play.  Every cartridge produced by Mattel Electronics included two plastic controller \"overlays\" to help navigate the 12 keypad buttons, although not every game made use of the keypad.  Mattel organized its games into networks: ''Major League Sports, Action, Strategy, Gaming, Children's Learning'' and later ''Space Action'', and ''Arcade''.  The network concept was dropped in 1983, as were the convenient gate-fold style boxes for storing the cartridge, instructions, and overlays.\n\nStarting in 1982 programmers looking for credit and royalties on sales began leaving both APh and Mattel Electronics.  They joined [[Activision]], [[Imagic]], and [[Atari]] to create Intellivision games for third party publishers.  Cheshire Engineering was formed by a few senior APh programmers including David Rolfe, author of the Exec, and Tom Loughry who created one of the most popular Intellivision games ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Cloudy Mountain|Advanced Dungeons and Dragons]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  Cheshire would create Intellivision games for Activision.  Third party developers Activision, Imagic, and Coleco started producing Intellivision games in 1982.  And then Atari, Parker Brothers, Sega, and Interphase followed in 1983.  The third party developers, not having legal access to Exec knowledge, often bypassed the Exec framework to create smooth 30&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz Intellivision games such as ''The Dreadnaught Factor''.  Cheaper [[Read-only memory|ROM]] prices also allowed for larger games as 8K, 12K, and then 16K cartridges became common.  The first Mattel Electronics Intellivision game to run at 60&nbsp;Hz was ''Masters of the Universe'' in 1983.<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-koenig-71a50412/</ref>  Marketing dubbed the term \"Super Graphics\" on the game's packaging and marketing.\n\nMattel Electronics' team of programmers was diverse in experience and talent, proving to be an advantage.  As competitors were often depending on licensing well known [[trademarks]] to sell video games, Mattel would have to focus on original ideas.  [[Don Daglow]] was a key early programmer at Mattel and became director of Intellivision game development.  Daglow created [[Utopia (video game)|''Utopia'']], a precursor to the [[Construction and management simulation|sim genre]] and, with Eddie Dombrower, the ground breaking sports simulation [[Intellivision World Series Baseball|''World Series Major League Baseball'']]. Daglow was also involved with the popular Intellivision games ''Tron Deadly Discs'' and ''Shark! Shark!''.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} After Mattel Electronics closed in 1984, their programmers would go on to make significant contributions to the video game industry.  Don Daglow and Eddie Dombrower went on to [[Electronic Arts]] to create [[Earl Weaver Baseball]], Don Daglow founded [[Stormfront Studios]].  Bill Fisher, Steve Roney and Mike Breen founded [[Quicksilver Software]] and David Warhol founded [[Realtime Associates]].<ref name=lives_companies/>\n\n===Keyboard Component===\n[[File:Intellivision - trojandan 14871699 - white background.jpg|thumb|Intellivision - trojandan 14871699 - white background|The ''Keyboard Component'' code-named the ''Blue Whale'' also known as the ''Intelliputer''<ref name=KC/>]]\nFrom the beginning, Intellivision's packaging and promotional materials, as well as television commercials, promised the addition of a soon-to-be-available accessory called the \"Keyboard Component\".  The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer.  The ''Master Component'' could be purchased as a stand-alone video game system and the ''Keyboard Component'' could be added, providing the computer keyboard and tape drive.  Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer, the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre-programmed software and bring \"data flow\" ([[Videotex]]) into the home.<ref name=papaint_his/>\n\nThe Keyboard Component added an 8-bit [[6502]] processor making the Intellivision a dual processor computer.  It had 16K 10-bit shared RAM that could load and execute both Intellivision [[General Instrument CP1600|CP1610]] and [[6502]] program code from tape; a large amount as typical cartridges of the day were 4K.  The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer.  Two tracks are read only for the software, and two tracks for user data.  The tape-drive was block addressed with high speed indexing.  A high resolution 40x24 monochrome text display could overlay regular Intellivision graphics.  There was an input for a microphone and two expansion ports for peripherals and [[RAM]] expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=Keyboard_Component|title=Keyboard Component - Intellivision Wiki|website=wiki.intellivision.us}}</ref>  The [[Microsoft BASIC]] programming cartridge used one of these ports.  Expanded memory cartridges could support 1000 8KB pages.  A third pass-through cartridge port was for regular Intellivision cartridges.  It uses the Intellivision's power supply.  A 40-column thermal printer was available, and a telephone [[modem]] was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition.<ref>http://www.intellivisionbrasil.com.br/docs/catalogos/1980-81_Mattel-EUA_00073240-B.pdf</ref>\n\nDavid Rolfe of APh wrote a control program for the Keyboard Component called ''PicSe'' (Picture Sequencer) specifically for the development of multimedia applications. PicSe synchronized the graphics and analog audio while concurrently saving or loading data to tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_rolfe.html|title=Good Deal Games - Classic Videogame Games INTERVIEW - David Rolfe|website=www.gooddealgames.com}}</ref>  Productivity software for home finances, personal improvement, and [[educational software|self education]] were planned.  Subject experts were consulted and their voices recorded and used in the software.\n\nThree applications using the PicSe system were released on cassette tape: \n*''Conversational French''\n*''Jack Lalanne's Physical Conditioning'' \n*''Spelling Challenge''\n\nFive [[Microsoft BASIC|BASIC]] applications were released on tape:  ''Programs written in BASIC did not have access to Intellivision graphics and would be sold at a lower price.''\n*''Family Budgeting''\n*''Geography Challenge''\n*''Crosswords I, II, and III''\n\nWhile the Keyboard Component was an ambitious piece of engineering for its time it was repeatedly delayed as the engineers tried to overcome reliability issues and reduce manufacturing costs.  In August 1979 the Intellivision Keyboard Component, in [[breadboard]] form, was successfully entered into the [[Sears]] Market Research Program.  In December 1979 Mattel had production design working units but decided on a significant internal design change to consolidate circuit boards.  In September 1980 it was test marketed in Fresno, California but without software, except for the BASIC programming cartridge.  In the fall of 1981 design changes were finally implemented and the ''Keyboard Component'' was released at $600<ref name=timeline/> in Seattle and New Orleans only.<ref name=papaint_his/>  Those that complained in writing could buy a Keyboard Component directly from Mattel.  The printer, a rebadged Alphacom Sprinter 40,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papaintellivision.com/hwKeyboard.php|title=Keyboard Component Hardware - Papa Intellivision|website=papaintellivision.com}}</ref> was only available by mail order.  However, reliability problems continued and the Keyboard Component proved to be expensive to produce.\n\nThe keyboard component's repeated delays became so notorious around Mattel headquarters that comedian [[Jay Leno]], when performing at Mattel's 1981 Christmas party, got his biggest titter of the evening with the line: \"You know what the three big lies are, don't you? 'The check is in the mail,' 'I'll still respect you in the morning,' and 'The keyboard will be out in spring.'\"<ref name=KC>{{cite web | url = http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/keyboard_tech.html | publisher = Intellivision Lives | title = Keyboard Component}}</ref>\n\nComplaints from consumers who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a \"coming soon\" personal-computer upgrade, eventually caught the attention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), who started investigating Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising. In mid-1982 the FTC ordered Mattel to pay a monthly fine (said to be $10,000) until the promised computer upgrade was in full retail distribution.<ref name=KC /> To protect themselves from the ongoing fines, the Keyboard Component was officially canceled in August 1982 and the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) module offered up in its place.  Part of Mattel's settlement with the FTC involved offering to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components from customers. Mattel provided a full refund but without a receipt paid $550 for the Keyboard Component, $60 for the BASIC cartridge, and $30 for each cassette software.<ref name=dereinte>{{cite web|url=http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/jzintv-1.0-beta3/doc/De_Re_Intellivision/dri_1.txt|title=De Re Intellivision|publisher=}}</ref>  Any customer who opted to keep theirs was required to sign a waiver with the understanding that no more software would be written for the system and absolved Mattel of any future responsibility for technical support.<ref name=lives_hw>[http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/ hardware overview] intellivisionlives.com</ref> They were also compensated with $1000 worth of Mattel Electronics products.<ref name=dereinte />\n\nWhile approximately four thousand Keyboard Components were manufactured, it is not clear how many of them actually found their way into the hands of Intellivision customers. Today, very few of them still exist.  Many of the units were dismantled for parts.  Others were used by Mattel Electronics programmers as part of their development system.  A Keyboard Component could be interfaced with an Intellivision development system in place of the hand-built Magus board [[RAM]] cartridge.  Data transfer to the Keyboard Component RAM had to be done serially and was slower compared with the Magus board parallel interface.<ref name=KC/>\n\nThe keyboard component debacle was ranked as No. 11 on ''[[GameSpy]]''{{'}}s \"25 dumbest moments in gaming\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081231052715/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archivedate = December 31, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy | title = Dumbest Moments}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment Computer System (ECS)===\n{{Main article|Entertainment Computer System}}\nIn mid-1981, Mattel's upper management was becoming concerned that the keyboard component division would never be able to produce a sellable product. As a result, Mattel Electronics set up a competing internal engineering team whose stated mission was to produce an inexpensive add-on called the \"Basic Development System\", or BDS, to be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming.\n\nThe rival BDS engineering group, who had to keep the project's real purpose a secret among themselves, fearing that if David Chandler, the head of the keyboard component team, found out about it he would use his influence to end the project, eventually came up with a much less expensive alternative. Originally dubbed the \"Lucky\", from LUCKI: Low User-Cost Keyboard Interface, it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original keyboard component. Gone, for example, was the 16K (8MB max) of RAM, the secondary CPU, and high resolution text; instead, the ECS offered a mere 2KB RAM expansion, a built-in BASIC that was marginally functional, plus a much-simplified cassette and printer interface.\n\nUltimately, this fulfilled the original promises of turning the Intellivision into a computer, making it possible to write programs and store them to tape, and interfacing with a printer well enough to allow Mattel to claim that they had delivered the promised computer upgrade and stop the FTC's mounting fines. It even offered, via an additional sound chip ([[AY-3-8910|AY-3-8917]]) inside the ECS module and an optional 49-key music synthesizer keyboard, the possibility of turning the Intellivision into a multi-voice synthesizer which could be used to play or learn music.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, the LUCKI, now renamed the Entertainment Computer System (ECS), was presented at the annual sales meeting, officially ending the ill-fated keyboard component project. A new advertising campaign was aired in time for the 1982 Christmas season, and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January 1983 [[Consumer Electronic Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas. A few months later, the ECS hit the market, and the FTC agreed to drop the $10K per day fines.\n\nBy the time the ECS made its retail debut as the Intellivision Computer Module, an internal shake-up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics' management had caused the company's focus to shift away from hardware add-ons in favor of software, and the ECS received very little in terms of furthering the marketing push. Further hardware developments, including a planned Program Expander that would have added another 16K of RAM and a more intricate, fully featured Extended-BASIC to the system, were halted.  In the end a half-dozen software titles were released for the ECS; a few more were completed but not released.\n\nThe ECS also offered four player game-play with the optional addition of two extra hand controllers.  Four player games were in development when Mattel Electronics closed in 1984.  ''World Cup Soccer'' was later completed and released in 1985 by Dextel in Europe and then INTV Corporation in North America.  The documentation does not mention it but when the ECS Computer Adapter is used, ''World Cup Soccer'' can be played with one to four players, or two players cooperatively against the computer.\n\n===Intellivoice===\n{{Main article|Intellivoice}}\n[[File:Intellivoice.jpg|link=File:Intellivoice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Brown rectangular box with a volume knob|The [[Intellivoice]] add-on]]\nIn 1982 Mattel introduced a new peripheral for the Intellivision:  the ''Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module''.  A [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] which produces speech with compatible cartridges. The Intellivoice was original in two respects: human sounding male and female voices with distinct accents, and the speech-supporting games were designed with speech being an integral part of the game-play.\n\nLike the Intellivision chip-set, the Intellivoice chip-set was developed by [[General Instrument]].  The [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256-012]] orator [[Integrated circuit|chip]] has 2KB [[Read-only memory|ROM]] inside, and is used to store the speech for numerical digits, some common words, and the phrase \"Mattel Electronics presents\".  Speech can also be processed from the Intellivoice's SP650 buffer chip,  stored and loaded from cartridge memory.  That buffer chip has its own [[Input/output|I/O]] and the Intellivoice has a 30-pin expansion port under a removable top plate.  Mattel Electronics planned to use that connector for wireless hand controllers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/voice_tech.html#systag|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivoice Module|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>\n\nMattel Electronics built a state of the art voice processing lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games.  However, the amount of speech that could be compressed into an 8K or 12K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited.  Intellivoice cartridges ''Space Spartans'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' did sell about 300,000 copies each, priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges.  However, at $79 the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a Master Component.<ref name=lives_hw/>  In August 1983 the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out.  A children's title called ''Magic Carousel'', and foreign language versions of ''Space Spartans'' were completed but shelved.   Additional games ''Woody Woodpecker'' and ''Space Shuttle'' went unfinished with the voice recordings unused.\n\nThe four titles available for the Intellivoice system, in order of their release, were:\n\n*''[[Space Spartans]]''\n*''[[B-17 Bomber (game)|B-17 Bomber]]''\n*''[[Bomb Squad (game)|Bomb Squad]]''\n*''[[Tron: Solar Sailer]]''\n\nA fifth title, ''[[Intellivision World Series Baseball|Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball]]'', developed as part of the Entertainment Computer System series, also supports the Intellivoice if both the ECS and Intellivoice are connected concurrently. Unlike the Intellivoice-specific games, however, ''World Series Major League Baseball'' is also playable without the Intellivoice module (but not without the ECS).\n\n===Intellivision II===\n[[File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=rectangular gaming console with numerical gamepads connected with short, black spirals|The Intellivision II redesign was much smaller and cheaper to manufacture than the original.]]\n\nIn the spring of 1983, Mattel introduced the ''Intellivision II''.  Not the technology upgrade that was expected but a cheaper, compact replacement to the original.  The Intellivision II was designed to be inexpensive to manufacture and service, with updated styling. It also had longer controller cords.<ref name=EGM91>{{cite magazine |title=Intellivision|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=100}}</ref> The Intellivision II was initially released without a pack-in game but was later packaged with BurgerTime in the United States and Lock'N'Chase in Canada.  In 1984 the Digiplay Intellivision II was introduced in Brazil.<ref name=brasil_historia/>  Brasil was the only country outside North America to have the redesigned Intellivision II.\n\nUsing an external AC Adapter (16.2VAC), consolidating some [[Integrated circuit|ICs]], and taking advantage of relaxed [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|emission]] standards, the Intellivision II has a significantly smaller footprint than the original. The controllers, now detachable, have a different feel with plastic rather than rubber side buttons, and a flat membrane keypad.  Users of the original Intellivision would miss the ability to find keypad buttons by the tactile feel of the original controller bubble keypad.\n\nOne functional difference was the addition of a video input to the cartridge port; added specifically to support the System Changer.  The System Changer, also released in 1983 by Mattel, is an Intellivision peripheral that plays [[Atari 2600]] cartridges through the Intellivision.  The Intellivision hand controllers can be used to play Atari 2600 games.  The System Changer also has two controller ports compatible with Atari joysticks.  The original Intellivision requires a hardware modification in order to work with the ''System Changer''; a service provided by Mattel.  Otherwise the Intellivision II was promoted to be compatible with the original.\n\nIt was discovered that a few Coleco Intellivision games did not work on the Intellivision II.  Mattel secretly changed the Intellivision's internal [[Read-only memory|ROM]] program (Exec) in an attempt to lock out 3rd party titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli2_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision II Console|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref>  A few of [[Coleco]]'s early games were affected but the 3rd party developers quickly figured out how to get around it.  Mattel's own ''Electric Company Word Fun'', however, will not run on the Intellivision II due to this change.  In an unrelated issue but also due to Exec changes, Super Pro Football experiences a minor glitch where the quarterback does not appear until after the ball is hiked. There were also some minor changes to the sound chip ([[AY-3-8910|AY-3-8914A/AY-3-8916]]) affecting sound effects in some games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=PSG|title=PSG - Intellivision Wiki|website=wiki.intellivision.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/228141-lto-flash-intellivision-flash-cartridge-information/page-53#entry3596200|title=LTO Flash! - Intellivision Flash Cartridge Information - Page 53 - Intellivision / Aquarius|publisher=}}</ref>  Programmers at Mattel discovered the audio differences and avoided the problem in future games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intellivisionaries.com/episode-28-space-spartans/|title=Episode 28: Space Spartans|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Intellivision IV===\nDave Chandler's group began designing Mattel's next generation console in 1981 codenamed ''Decade'', now referred to as the ''Intellivision IV''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli4_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision IV Console|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  It was based on the 32-bit [[MC68000]] processor and a custom designed advanced graphic interface chip.

The ''Intellivision III'' was to be an upgraded but backward compatible system; based on a similar [[General Instrument CP1600|CP1610]] processor and with an improved graphics STIC chip producing double the resolution with more sprites and colors.  The Intellivision III existed in the lab and a new EXEC was written for it but little else.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli3_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision III Console|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  It was cancelled in mid-1983.<ref name=\"mitchell19830906\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gn0hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tYoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5584%2C3561802 | title=A summer-CES report | work=Boston Phoenix | date=September 6, 1983 | accessdate=January 10, 2015 | author=Mitchell, Peter W. | pages=4}}</ref>  A [[Mattel]] document called ''Target Specification Intellivision III'' has the following.<ref>{{cite web|title=Target Specification Intellivision III|url=http://papaintellivision.com/docIntv3.php|website=Papa Intellivision}}</ref>\n\n*CPU:  CP1610-2 at 3.56 MHz (2x original CPU speed)\n** separate 16-bit data bus and address bus\n** multiplexed data/address mode for backward compatibility with existing cartridges\n*Graphics:  STIC 1B\n** tiled graphics, 20 cards by 24 rows\n*** 2-colour 16x8 pixel cards for a resolution of 320x192\n*** 4-colour 8x8 pixel cards for a resolution of 160x192\n** 40 x 24 alphanumerics\n** 16 programmable colors\n*** colour palette selectable per card\n*** 12-bit [[RGB]] definition for 4096 possible colors \n** 8 sprites per scanline \n*** reusable on different scanlines\n*** 16 pixels wide in 1 colour, 8 pixels wide in 3 colors\n*** up-to 255 lines high\n*** overlap detect of individual colors\n** fine pixel horizontal and vertical scrolling (backward compatible)\n** single data bus allows graphics rom/ram storage on cartridges\n** STIC 1 backwards compatible mode\n* RAM:  4K words, 16-bit, [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] (upgradable to 65K words)\n* five channel sound with improved frequency range (backward compatible)\n* integrated Intellivoice\n\n===Competition and market crash===\n{{See also|North American video game crash of 1983}}\n\nAccording to the company's 1982 10-K report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mattel had almost 20% of the domestic video-game market.<ref name=csmonitor/> Although the Atari 2600 had more third-party development, ''[[Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' reported after visiting the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] that \"The momentum is tremendous\". [[Activision]] and [[Imagic]] began releasing games for the Intellivision, as did hardware rival [[Coleco]]. Mattel created \"[[M Network]]\" branded games for Atari's system.<ref name=\"goodman1983spring\">{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games |page=32}}</ref> The company's advertisement budget increased to over $20 million for the year.  In its October 1982 stockholders' report [[Mattel]] announced that ''Electronics'' had, so far that year, posted a nearly $100 million profit on nearly $500 million sales; a threefold increase over October 1981.<ref name=Lives>[http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/lives.shtml \"Intellivision Lives! PC/Mac CD\"] Intellivision Productions</ref>\n\nHowever, the same report predicted a loss for the upcoming quarter.  Still hiring continued, and optimism that the investment in software and hardware development will payoff.  The ''M Network'' brand expanded to personal computers.  An office in Taiwan was opened to handle Apple II programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/computers.shtml#comments|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / M Network Computer Games|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  The original five-person Mattel game development team had grown to 110 people under new vice president Baum, while Daglow led Intellivision development and top engineer Minkoff directed all work on all other platforms.  In February 1983, Mattel Electronics opened an office in the south of France to provide European input to Intellivision games and develop games for the [[ColecoVision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Companies|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref><ref name=\"gamotek.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamotek.fr/collectionneurs/patrick-aubry/|title=Patrick Aubry, Nice Ideas - GAMOTEK|publisher=}}</ref>  At its peak Mattel Electronics employed 1800 people.<ref name = nyt84/>\n\nAmid the flurry of new hardware and software development, there was trouble for the Intellivision. New game systems ([[ColecoVision]] and [[Atari 5200]]) introduced in 1982 took advantage of falling [[RAM]] prices to offer graphics closer to arcade quality.  In 1983 the price of home computers, particular the [[Commodore 64]] came down drastically to compete with video game system sales.  The market became flooded with hardware and software, and retailers were ill-equipped to cope.  In spring 1983 hiring at Mattel Electronics came to a halt.\n\nAt the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Mattel Electronics had the opportunity to show off all their new products.  The response was underwhelming.  Amidst massive losses top management was replaced.  On July 12, 1983, Mattel Electronics President Josh Denham was replaced with outsider Mack Morris.  Morris brought in former Mattel Electronics president and marketing director Jeff Rochlis as a consultant and all projects were under review.  The Intellivision III was cancelled and then all new hardware development was stopped when 660 jobs were cut on August 4.<ref name = nyt84/>  The price of the Intellivision II (which launched at $150 earlier that year) was lowered to $69, Mattel Electronics was to be a software company.<ref name=timeline/>  However, by October 1983 ''Electronics''' losses were over $280 million and one third of the programming staff were laid off.<ref name=Lives/>  In November another third were gone, and on January 20, 1984 the remaining programming staff were laid-off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_daniel_bass.html|title=DP Interviews...|website=www.digitpress.com}}</ref>  The Taiwan and French offices continued a little while longer due to contract and legal obligations.

They continued to supply the large toy stores and sold games through direct mail order.  At first they sold the existing inventory of games and Intellivision II systems.  When the inventory of games sold out they produced more, but without the Mattel name or unnecessary licenses on the printed materials.  To lower costs, the boxes, instructions, and overlays were produced at lower quality compared to Mattel.\n\nIn France, the Mattel Electronics office found investors and became '''Nice Ideas''' in  April 1984.  They continued to work on Intellivision, Colecovision, and other computer games.  They produced Intellivision ''World Cup Soccer'' and ''Championship Tennis'', both released in 1985 by European publisher Dextel.<ref name=\"gamotek.fr\"/>\n\nIn 1985 INTV Corporation introduced the ''INTV System III'', also branded as the ''Intellivision Super Pro System'', using the same design as the original Intellivision model but in black and silver. That same year INTV Corp introduced two new games that were completed at Mattel but not released: ''Thunder Castle'' and ''World Championship Baseball''. With their early success INTV Corp decided to produce new games and in 1986 introduced ''Super Pro Football'', an update of Mattel ''NFL Football''. INTV Corp continued a relationship that Mattel had with [[Data East]] and produced all new titles such as [[Commando (video game)|''Commando'']] in 1987 and ''Body Slam Wrestling'' in 1988. Also in 1987 INTV Corp released ''[[Dig Dug]]'', purchased from [[Atari]] where the game was completed but not released in 1984. They also got into producing next generation games with the production of [[Monster Truck Rally (video game)|''Monster Truck Rally'']] for [[Nintendo NES]] in 1991, also released as ''Stadium Mud Buggies'' for Intellivision in 1989.<ref name = INTV/>\n\nLicensing agreements with Nintendo and Sega required INTV Corporation to discontinue the Intellivision in 1990.

In 2000 the ''Intellipack 3'' download was available with another four Intellivision games and emulators for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] or [[Macintosh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionlives.com/download.shtml|title=Intellivision Downloads|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>\n\nIntellivision Productions released [[Intellivision Lives!]] and [[Intellivision Rocks]] on compact disc in 1998 and 2001. These compilation CDs play the original game code through emulators for [[MS-DOS]], [[Windows 95|Windows]], and [[Macintosh]] computers.  Together they have over 100 Intellivision games including never before released ''King of the Mountain, Takeover, Robot Rubble'', ''League of Light'', and others.  Intellivision Rocks includes Intellivison [[Activision]] and [[Imagic]] games licensed from Activision.  Some games could not be included due to licensing, others simply used different titles to avoid trademarked names.  The CDs are also a resource for development history, box art, hidden features, programmer biographies, video interviews, and original commercials.<ref name=Lives/>\n\nAlso in 1997 Intellivision Productions announced they would sell development tools allowing customers to program their own Intellivision games.  They were to provide documentation, [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] compatible [[Assembly language|cross-assemblers]], and the ''Magus II'' [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] Intellivision cartridge interface.

The unit never had overheating problems, nor were loose wires or other connections encountered.\" However, Uston rated the controls and control system as \"below average\" and the worst of the consoles he tested (including [[Atari 2600]], [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]], [[Astrovision]], and [[Fairchild Channel F]]).<ref>Uston, Ken.

Because it always involves the use of power, whether military force or some subtler form, imperialism has often been considered morally reprehensible, and the term is frequently employed in international propaganda to denounce and discredit an opponent\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nIt is different from [[new imperialism]], as the term ''imperialism'' is usually applied to the colonization of the Americas between the 15th and 19th centuries, as opposed to the expansion of [[Western world|Western Powers]] and [[Japan]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, both are examples of imperialism.\n\n== Etymology and usage ==\nThe word imperialism originated from the Latin word ''[[imperium]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0060%3Aentry%3Dimperium|title=Charlton T. Lewis, An Elementary Latin Dictionary, imperium (inp-)|access-date=11 September 2016}}</ref> which means supreme power. It first became common with its current sense in [[Great Britain]], during the 1870s and was used with a negative connotation.<ref name=\"Magnusson\">{{cite book|title=Teorier om imperialism|last=Magnusson|first=Lars|year=1991|isbn=978-91-550-3830-4|location=S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje|page=19|language=Swedish}}</ref> Previously the word imperialism had been used to describe to what was perceived as [[Napoleon III]]'s attempts of obtaining political support through foreign military interventions.<ref name=\"Magnusson\"/> The term was and is mainly applied to Western (and Japanese) political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars. Some writers, such as [[Edward Said]], use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.<ref name=\"Edward Said 1994. P. 9\">Edward W. Said. Culture and Imperialism. Vintage Publishers, 1994. p. 9.</ref> This definition encompasses both nominal [[empire]]s and [[neocolonialism]].\n\n==Colonialism vs. imperialism==\n[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Imperial powers in 1898]]\n\"The word 'empire' comes from the Latin word imperium; for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be '[[sovereignty]]', or simply 'rule'\".<ref>Howe, 13</ref> The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grows from conquering land; however, cultural and economic aspects flourish through sea and trade routes.  A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\".<ref>Howe, 45</ref> Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\".<ref>Howe, 62</ref> European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the [[world systems theory]]. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of [[Geopolitics|Geo-politics]] have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\".<ref>Gilmartin, 116</ref> This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.\n\n[[File:Roubaud. Russian troops entering Tiflis in 1799.JPG|thumb|left|''Entrance of the Russian troops in Tiflis, 26 November 1799'', by [[Franz Roubaud]], 1886]]\nThe term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"[[colonialism]]\"; however, many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. [[Robert J. C. Young|Robert Young]] writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. However, colonialism still includes invasion.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907133189|title=Empire, colony, postcolony|last=Young|first=Robert,|year=2015|isbn=9781405193559|pages=54|oclc=907133189}}</ref> Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'<ref>Gilmartin, Mary \"Colonialism/Imperialism\"</ref> Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman have traditionally been excluded from discussions of colonialism, though this is beginning to change, since it is accepted that they also sent populations into the territories they ruled.<ref name=Gallaher>{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&pg=PA116 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |page=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8}}</ref>{{rp|116}} Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.{{elucidate|date=April 2013}}\n\nImperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.<ref name=\"Painter & Jeffrey\">{{cite book |last1=Painter |first1=Joe |last2=Jeffrey |first2=Alex |title=Political Geography |date=2009 |edition=2nd |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-44-624435-7 |language=en}}</ref>{{rp|107}} Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of ''an other'', if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.<ref name=\"Painter & Jeffrey\"/>{{rp|170\u201375}} The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.<ref name=\"Painter & Jeffrey\"/>{{rp|173\u201376}} Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.<ref name=\"Painter & Jeffrey\"/>{{rp|41}} Few colonies remain remote from their mother country. Thus, most will eventually establish a separate nationality or remain under complete control of their mother colony.<ref>http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hobson-imperialism-a-study</ref>\n\n== Justification ==\n\n[[Stephen Howe]], while generally hostile to empires{{cn|date=June 2018}}, has summarized the beneficial effects of the main empires:\n{{quote|At least some of the great modern empires&nbsp;\u2013  the British, French, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and even the Ottoman&nbsp;\u2013 have virtues that have been too readily forgotten.

In [[ancient China]], [[tianxia]] denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the [[Emperor]] by universal and well-defined principles of order. The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, [[tributary states]], and finally ending with the fringe \"[[barbarians]]\". Tianxia's idea of hierarchy gave [[Chinese people|Chinese]] a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace. [[J. A. Hobson]] identifies this justification on general grounds as: \"It is desirable that the earth should be peopled, governed, and developed, as far as possible, by the races which can do this work best, i.e. by the races of highest 'social efficiency'\".<ref>Hobson, J. A. \"Imperialism: a study.\" Cosimo, Inc., 2005. p. 154</ref>  Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons. [[Friedrich Ratzel]] believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed. [[Halford Mackinder]] felt that [[Great Britain]] needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.<ref>Gilmartin, Mary. \"Colonialism/Imperialism.\" Key Concepts in Political Geography.

Key Concepts in Human Geography. 24 Jan. 2015.</ref> The purportedly scientific nature of \"[[Social Darwinism]]\" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism. Under this doctrine, the French politician Jules Ferry could declare in 1883 that \"Superior races have a right, because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Imperialism|publisher=D.C.

A. \"Imperialism: a study.\" Cosimo, Inc., 2005. p. v.</ref> British imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions appears to have applied a principle now termed [[Terra nullius]] (Latin expression which stems from [[Roman law]] meaning 'empty land'). The country of [[Australia]] serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century, that was arguably premised on ''terra nullius'', as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants.\n\n===Orientalism and imaginative geography===\nImperial control, territorial and [[Cultural imperialism|cultural]], is justified through [[discourse]]s about the imperialists' understanding of different spaces.<ref name=\"Hubbard, P. 2010 p. 239\">Hubbard, P., & Kitchin, R.

According to Bassett, \"[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground. Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy\"<ref name=\"Bassett, Thomas J. 1994\"/> but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them.\n\n[[File:Siege of Belgrade (N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r) 1456.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Ottoman wars in Europe]]]]\nImperialism in ancient times is clear in the history of China and in the history of western Asia and the Mediterranean\u2014an unending succession of empires. The tyrannical empire of the Assyrians was replaced (6th\u20134th century BCE) by that of the Persians, in strong contrast to the Assyrian in its liberal treatment of subjected peoples, assuring it long duration. It eventually gave way to the imperialism of Greece. When Greek imperialism reached an apex under Alexander the Great(356\u2013323 BCE), a union of the eastern Mediterranean with western Asia was achieved. But the cosmopolis, in which all citizens of the world would live harmoniously together in equality, remained a dream of Alexander. It was partially realized when the Romans built their empire from Britain to Egypt.\n\n[[Cultural imperialism]] is an extremely fuzzy concept, pointing to the supposed influence of one dominant culture over others, i.e. a form of [[soft power]], which changes the moral, cultural, and societal [[worldview]] of the subordinate country. In some ways, this is such an expansion of the concept of imperialism as to be meaningless. This is more than just \"foreign\" music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera [[Dallas (1978 TV series)#Dallas and the Cold War|Dallas during the Cold War]] changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled [[South Korea]]n drama series in [[North Korea]]. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.\n\nImperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics{{which|date=December 2014}}, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy.<ref name=\"IESS\">\"Imperialism.\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd edition.</ref>\n\n===Age of Imperialism===\n{{Main|International relations, 1648\u20131814|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\nThe Age of Imperialism, a time period beginning around 1760, saw European industrializing nations, engaging in the process of colonizing, influencing, and annexing other parts of the world.<ref>[https://archive.org/search.php?query=atlas%20world%20history%20haywood John Haywood, ''Atlas of world history'' (1997)]</ref>  19th century episodes included  the \"[[Scramble for Africa]].\"<ref>See Stephen Howe, ed., ''The New Imperial Histories Reader'' (2009) [https://h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=32358 online review].</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|[[Scramble for Africa|Africa]], divided into colonies under multiple empires, c. 1913]]\n\nIn the 1970s British historians [[John Andrew Gallagher|John Gallagher]] (1919\u20131980) and [[Ronald Robinson]] (1920\u20131999) argued that European leaders rejected the notion that \"imperialism\" required formal, legal control by one government over a colonial region.

At first planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items.  Apart from India, this was seldom true.  By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector.  Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India,  but not from most of the rest of its empire.  The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies. Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires. France did slightly better. The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise.  However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable.

To obtain raw materials, Europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies. European industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes, cotton, vegetable oils, and metal ores from overseas. Concurrently, industrialization was quickly making Europe the center of manufacturing and economic growth, driving resource needs.<ref name=\"Adas 2008 54-58\">\n{{cite book\n|last= Adas\n|first= Michael\n|title= Turbulent Passage A Global History of the Twentieth Century\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= Pearson Education, Inc.\n|isbn= 978-0-205-64571-8\n|pages= 54\u201358\n|edition= Fourth\n|author2= Peter N.

With the invention of railroads and telegraphs, it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies. Steam railroads and steam-driven ocean shipping made possible the fast, cheap transport of massive amounts of goods to and from colonies.<ref name=\"Adas 2008 54-58\"/>\n\nAlong with advancements in communication, Europe also continued to advance in military technology. European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly.  By the 1880s, the [[machine gun]] had become a reliable battlefield weapon. This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879).<ref name=\"Adas 2008 54-58\"/>\n\n==Theories of imperialism==\n\nAnglophone academic studies often base their theories regarding imperialism on the British experience of Empire. The term ''imperialism'' was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. Supporters of \"imperialism\" such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] quickly appropriated the concept. For some,{{Who|date=September 2016}} imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.\n\n[[John A. Hobson]], A leading English Liberal, developed a highly influential interpretation of ''Imperialism: A Study'' (1902) that expanded on his belief that free enterprise capitalism had a negative impact on the majority of the population.  In ''Imperialism'' he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home.  It was invested abroad because lower wages paid the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages.  So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise.  Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living. .  By the 1970s, historians such as David K. Fieldhouse<ref>David K. Fieldhouse,  \"\u2018Imperialism\u2019: An Historiographical Revision\" ''Economic History Review ''14.2 (1961): 187\u2013209.</ref> and Oron Hale could argue that \"the Hobsonian foundation has been almost completely demolished.\"<ref name=\"Hale\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}}  The British experience failed to support it.  However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'' (1916). Lenin portrayed [[Theory of Imperialism|Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition]] that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism. which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets.  Lenin's treatise became a standard textbook that flourished until the Collapse of communism in 1989\u201391.<ref>Tony Brewer, ''Marxist theories of imperialism: a critical survey'' (2002)</ref>\n\nSome theoreticians on the non-Communist left have emphasized the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to [[Christopher Columbus]] and, in some accounts, to the [[Crusades]]. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect\u2014among other shifts in sensibility\u2014a growing unease, even great distaste, with the pervasiveness of such power, specifically, Western power.<ref>Mark F. Proudman, \"Words for Scholars: The Semantics of 'Imperialism'\", ''Journal of the Historical Society'', Sept. 2008, Vol. 8 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;395\u2013433</ref><ref>D. K. Fieldhouse, \"Imperialism\": A Historiographical Revision,\" ''South African Journal of Economic History,'' (1992) 7#1 pp.&nbsp;45\u201372</ref>\n\nHistorians and political theorists have long debated the correlation between capitalism, class and imperialism. Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J. A. Hobson (1858\u20131940), [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950), [[Thorstein Veblen]] (1857\u20131929), and [[Norman Angell]] (1872\u20131967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the [[Interwar period|interwar years]]. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order.<ref>P. J.

The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and this validated their domination. For example, the [[Western world]] saw people living in tropical environments as \"less civilized\", therefore justifying colonial control as a [[civilizing mission]]. Across the three major waves of [[European colonialism]] (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), [[environmental determinism]] served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy. This takes two forms, [[orientalism]] and tropicality.\n\nSome geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into [[climate zone | climatic zones]]. These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic [[temperate climate]] produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being. In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy. The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat. Similarly, orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location.<ref>\nCompare:\nGilmartin, Mary. (2009). \"Colonialism/Imperialism\".

A modern doctrine in [[amphibious warfare]] was one of the reasons in the fast Japanese territorial expansion.]]\n\nFor over 200 years, Japan [[Sakoku|remained isolated from the rest of the world]], staying in a feudal system. However, in the 1850s [[Perry Expedition|military pressure by the United States]] and other world powers forced Japan to open itself to the world markets, ending the period of isolation. A [[Bakumatsu|period of conflicts and revolutions]] unleashed in the uncertainty of the new period, ending in 1867 with the reunification of the political power in only one leader: the Japanese Emperor. Everything was ready for Japan to embrace the [[Industrial Revolution]]. However, from the start the Japanese didn't look too enthusiastic on relying on other countries to obtain industrial manufactures and remaining forever an underdeveloped nation, key to this understanding is the traditional Japanese psyche of self-sustainability that made them survive isolated for centuries. Thus, Japan initiated a process of modernization through central planning and a firm direction of the government. This became one of the fastest modernization processes in world history: in a matter of few decades it went through the full technological evolution that took centuries in Europe. Japan's late industrialization example became a leading case for underdeveloped countries that suffered from European rule. By the early 1900s, Japan was a naval power that could hold its own against an established European power like Russia.\n\nWithout much natural resources and territory to sustain the increasing Japanese population that industrialization brought, Japan turned to imperialism and expansionism as a way to compensate for its lackings and also to strengthen itself, the national motto ''\"Fukoku ky\u014dhei\"'' (\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175, \"Enrich the state, strengthen the military\") as a sign of this attitude. Also the mentioned typical self-sustaining mentality of the Japanese was a cause of this change in foreign policy.\n\nAnd Japan was eager to take every opportunity. In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the [[Republic of Ezo]] to incorporate definitely the island of [[Hokkaido]] to Japan. For centuries, Japan viewed the [[Ryukyu Islands]] as one of its provinces. In 1871 the [[Mudan incident]] happened: [[Paiwan people|cannibal Taiwanese aborigines]] murdered 54 [[Ryukyuan people|Ry\u016bky\u016ban]] sailors that had their ship shipwrecked. At that time the [[Ryukyu Islands]] were claimed by both [[Qing China]] and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens. They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese [[Ryukyu Domain]] was declared, and in 1874 a [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|retaliatory incursion to Taiwan]] was sent, which was a success. The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese cannibals in the [[Formosa Expedition]] of 1867. Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series. Japan occupied Taiwan for the rest of 1874 and then left owing to Chinese pressures, but in 1879 it finally annexed the [[Ryukyu Islands]]. In 1875 Qing China sent a 300-men force to subdue the Taiwanese cannibals, but unlike the Japanese the Chinese were routed, ambushed and 250 of their men were killed; the failure of this expedition exposed once more the failure of Qing China to exert effective control in Taiwan, and acted as another incentive for the Japanese to annex Taiwan. Eventually, the spoils for winning the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894 included [[Taiwan]].\n\nIn 1875 Japan took its first operation against [[Kingdom of Joseon|Joseon Korea]], another territory that for centuries it coveted; the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] made Korea open to international trade. [[Korea]] was annexed in 1910. As a result of winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905, Japan took part of [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] from Russia. Precisely, the victory against the [[Russian Empire]] shook the world: never before an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat. Japan's victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for [[Decolonization]]. During [[World War I]], Japan took German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]], and [[Marshall Islands]], and kept the islands as League of nations mandates. At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area. By the '30s, economic depression, urgency of resources and a growing distrust in the Allied powers made Japan lean to a hardened militaristic stance. Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance. In 1931 Japan took [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Manchuria]] from China. International reactions condemned this move, but Japan's already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on.\n\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China. By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced. Thus a military move to gain access to them was needed, and so Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]], bringing the United States to World War II. Using its superior technological advances in [[naval aviation]] and its modern doctrines of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] and [[naval warfare]], Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history, by the end of the [[Pacific War]], Japan had conquered much of East Asia and the Pacific, including the east of [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], part of [[New Guinea]] and many islands of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Just as Japan's late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European \"[[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]\". This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests. However, the United States were benefited by the long-term, [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]] and over time the massive output of their industrial muscle, together with improvements in their military doctrines, turned the war in their favor. Japan's defeat in 1945 meant that its imperial gains, along with the proposed Pan-Asian sphere, were lost altogether,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lehigh.edu/~rfw1/courses/1999/spring/ir163/Papers/pdf/jamm.pdf| author=Joseph A.

In 1453, [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] besieged the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], resulting in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] after 1,500 years of Roman rule. Thereafter, making it the capital of the empire. During the 16th and 17th centuries, in particular at the height of its power under the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Ottoman Empire was a powerful multinational, multilingual empire, which invaded and colonized much of [[Southeast Europe]], [[Western Asia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the great [[migration of the Serbs]] to escape prosecution. At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained [[Provinces of the Ottoman Empire|32 provinces]] and numerous [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|vassal states]]. Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries.<ref>Jane Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 1516\u20131800'' (2008).</ref>\n\nWith [[Constantinople]] as its capital and control of lands around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean basin]], the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the [[Eastern world|Eastern]] and Western worlds for six centuries.

This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it. The [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]] took place after Polish nobility from the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] wrote the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]]. The war resulted in eastern [[Poland]] being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918. The southern campaigns involved a series of [[Russo-Persian Wars]], which began with the [[Persian Expedition of 1796]], resulting in the acquisition of [[Georgia (country)]] as a protectorate. Between 1800 and 1864, Imperial armies invaded south in the [[Russian conquest of the Caucasus]], the [[Murid War]], and the [[Russo-Circassian War]]. This last conflict led to the [[ethnic cleansing of Circassians]] from their lands. The [[Russian conquest of Siberia]] over the [[Khanate of Sibir]] took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the [[Daur people|Daur]], the [[Koryaks]], the [[Itelmens]], [[Mansi people]] and the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today. The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed [[Cossacks]] hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate [[Sosloviye]] in the late 18th century. Cossacks were then used in Imperial Russian campaigns against other tribes.<ref>Willard  Sunderland,  \"An Empire of Peasants.

Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the [[Age of Discovery]], such as those undertaken by [[Christopher Columbus]], Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the [[Caribbean basin]]. Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of ''[[Conquistador]]s'', which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies.\n\n==== Imperialism in the Caribbean basin ====\nIn congruence with the colonialist activities of competing European imperial powers throughout the 15th \u2013 19th centuries, the Spanish were equally engrossed in extending geopolitical power. The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism. Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the [[Aztec Empire]] and [[Inca Empire]], Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation's imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin.\n[[File:Spanish Caribbean Islands in the American Viceroyalties 1600.png|thumb|Spanish colonies and territories in the Caribbean basin (c. 1490 \u2013 c. 1660)]]\nEchoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain's European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin.\n\nWhile leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda. Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver). A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations. Notable examples of these indigenous groups include the [[Ta\u00edno|Ta\u03afno]] populations inhabiting Puerto Rico and segments of Cuba. Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals. The emergence of the ''[[Encomienda]]'' system during the 16th \u2013 17th centuries in occupied colonies within the Caribbean basin reflects a gradual shift in imperial prioritization, increasingly focusing on large-scale production and exportation of agricultural commodities.\n\n==== Scholarly debate and controversy ====\nThe scope and scale of Spanish participation in imperialism within the Caribbean basin remains a subject of scholarly debate among historians. A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism. Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists.\n\nAmong historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th \u2013 19th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]. In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically-driven form of imperialism. Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism.\n\nFurther divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought. Noteworthy examples include [[cultural imperialism]], whereby proponents such as John Downing and Annabelle Sreberny-Modammadi define imperialism as ''\"...the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one.\"''<ref>Downing, John; Ali Mohammadi; Annabelle Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). ''Questioning the media: a critical introduction'' (2, illustrated ed.). SAGE. p. 482. {{ISBN|978-0-8039-7197-4}}.</ref> Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force.\" Moreover, colonialism is understood as ''\"...the form of imperialism in which the government of the colony is run directly by foreigners.\"''<ref>Downing; Sreberny-Mohammadi (1995). p.482.</ref>\n\nIn spite of diverging perspectives and the absence of a unilateral scholarly consensus regarding imperialism among historians, within the context of Spanish expansion in the Caribbean basin during the colonial era, imperialism can be interpreted as an overarching ideological agenda that is perpetuated through the institution of colonialism. In this context, colonialism functions as an instrument designed to achieve specific imperialist objectives.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\n[[File:Guayana_Esequiba_(zona_completa).png|thumb|Striped, the [[Guayana Esequiba]] area claimed by Venezuela|270x270px]]\n\n==== Punto Fijo Pact ====\n\nVenezuela has had a history of expansionist actions to add to its territory and regional influence.

It still routes most Internet traffic today,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://bgp.potaroo.net/index-bgp.html |title=BGP Analysis Reports |accessdate=2013-01-09}}</ref> despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, [[IPv6]]. IPv4 is described in [[IETF]] publication RFC 791 (September 1981), replacing an earlier definition (RFC 760, January 1980).\n\nIPv4 is a [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] protocol for use on [[packet-switched]] networks. It operates on a [[best effort delivery]] model, in that it does not guarantee delivery, nor does it assure proper sequencing or avoidance of duplicate delivery. These aspects, including data integrity, are addressed by an [[upper layer protocol|upper layer]] transport protocol, such as the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP).\n\n{{IPstack}}\n\n==Addressing==<!--redirect from [[IPv4 address]]-->\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted IPv4 address representation to its [[Binary numeral system|binary]] value]]\nIPv4 uses 32-bit addresses which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. \n\nIPv4 reserves special address blocks for [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast]] addresses (~270 million addresses).\n\n===Address representations===\nIPv4 addresses may be represented in any notation expressing a 32-bit integer value. They are most often written in the [[dot-decimal notation]], which consists of four [[Octet (computing)|octet]]s of the address expressed individually in [[decimal]] numbers and separated by [[Full stop|periods]]. \n\nFor example, the quad-dotted IP address 192.0.2.235 represents the 32-bit [[decimal]] number 3221226219, which in [[hexadecimal]] format is 0xC00002EB. This may also be expressed in dotted hex format as 0xC0.0x00.0x02.0xEB, or with octal byte values as 0300.0000.0002.0353.\n\n[[CIDR notation]] combines the address with its routing prefix in a compact format, in which the address is followed by a slash character (/) and the count of consecutive ''1'' bits in the routing prefix (subnet mask).\n\n===Allocation===\nIn the original design of IPv4, an IP address was divided into two parts: the network identifier was the most significant octet of the address, and the host identifier was the rest of the address. The latter was also called the ''rest field''. This structure permitted a maximum of 256 network identifiers, which was quickly found to be inadequate.\n\nTo overcome this limit, the most-significant address octet was redefined in 1981 to create ''network classes'', in a system which later became known as [[classful network]]ing. The revised system defined five classes. Classes A, B, and C had different bit lengths for network identification. The rest of the address was used as previously to identify a host within a network. Because of the different sizes of fields in different classes, each network class had a different capacity for addressing hosts. In addition to the three classes for addressing hosts, Class D was defined for [[multicast]] addressing and Class E was reserved for future applications.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\nStarting around 1985, methods were devised to subdivide IP networks. One method that has proved flexible is the use of the ''variable-length subnet mask'' ([[VLSM]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc779089%28WS.10%29.aspx |title=Planning Classless Routing: TCP/IP |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2003-03-28 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3com.com/other/pdfs/infra/corpinfo/en_US/501302.pdf |title=HP Networking: switches, routers, wired, wireless, HP TippingPoint Security |publisher=3com.com |accessdate=2012-01-20}}</ref>\nBased on the IETF standard RFC 1517 published in 1993, this system of classes was officially replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR), which expressed the number of bits (from the [[Most significant bit|most significant]]) as, for instance, /24, and the class-based scheme was dubbed ''classful'', by contrast. CIDR was designed to permit repartitioning of any address space so that smaller or larger blocks of addresses could be allocated to users. The hierarchical structure created by CIDR is managed by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) and the [[Regional Internet Registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). Each RIR maintains a publicly searchable [[WHOIS]] database that provides information about IP address assignments.\n\n===Special-use addresses===\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) have restricted from general use various [[reserved IP addresses]] for special purposes. Some are used for maintenance of [[routing table]]s, for [[multicast]] traffic, operation under [[failure mode]]s, or to provide addressing space for public, unrestricted uses on private networks.\n<section begin=IPv4-special-address-blocks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Reserved IP addresses]].

Packets addresses in these ranges are not routable in the public Internet, because they are ignored by all public routers. Therefore, private hosts cannot directly communicate with public networks, but require [[network address translation]] at a routing gateway for this purpose.\n<section begin=IPv4-private-networks/><!-- This table is transcluded to other pages, such as [[Blackhole server]].

Additionally, encapsulated packets may be encrypted for the transmission across public networks to secure the data.\n\n===Link-local addressing===\nRFC 3927 defines the special address block 169.254.0.0/16 for [[link-local address]]ing. These addresses are only valid on links (such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection) connected to a host. These addresses are not routable. Like private addresses, these addresses cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the internet. These addresses are primarily used for address autoconfiguration ([[Zeroconf]]) when a host cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server or other internal configuration methods.\n\nWhen the address block was reserved, no standards existed for address autoconfiguration. [[Microsoft]] created an implementation called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA), which was deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto]] standard. Many years later, in May 2005, the [[IETF]] defined a formal standard in RFC 3927, entitled ''Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses''.\n\n===Loopback===\n{{Main article|Loopback}}\nThe class A network 127.0.0.0 (classless network 127.0.0.0/8) is reserved for [[loopback]]. IP packets whose source addresses belong to this network should never appear outside a host. The [[modus operandi]] of this network expands upon that of a loopback interface:\n* IP packets whose source and destination addresses belong to the network (or subnetwork) of the same loopback interface are returned to that interface;\n* IP packets whose source and destination addresses belong to networks (or subnetworks) of different interfaces of the same host, one of them being a loopback interface, are forwarded regularly.\n\n===Addresses ending in 0 or 255===\n{{Main article|IPv4 subnetting reference}}\nNetworks with subnet masks of at least 24 bits, i.e. Class C networks in classful networking, and networks with CIDR suffixes /24 to /30 (255.255.255.0\u2013255.255.255.252) may not have an address ending in 0 or 255.\n\nClassful addressing prescribed only three possible subnet masks: Class A, 255.0.0.0 or /8; Class B, 255.255.0.0 or /16; and Class C, 255.255.255.0 or /24. For example, in the subnet 192.168.5.0/255.255.255.0 (192.168.5.0/24) the identifier 192.168.5.0 commonly is used to refer to the entire subnet. To avoid ambiguity in representation, the address ending in the octet ''0'' is reserved.\n\nA [[broadcast address]]<ref name=\":0\" /> is an address that allows information to be sent to all interfaces in a given subnet, rather than a specific machine. Generally, the broadcast address is found by obtaining the bit complement of the subnet mask and performing a bitwise OR operation with the network identifier. In other words, the broadcast address is the last address in the address range of the subnet. For example, the broadcast address for the network 192.168.5.0 is 192.168.5.255. For networks of size /24 or larger, the broadcast address always ends in 255.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n! !! Binary form !!

For example, in the /16 subnet 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0, which is equivalent to the address range 192.168.0.0\u2013192.168.255.255, the broadcast address is 192.168.255.255. One can use the following addresses for hosts, even though they end with 255: 192.168.1.255, 192.168.2.255, etc. Also, 192.168.0.0 is the network identifier and must not be assigned to an interface.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-31\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 31\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref> The addresses 192.168.1.0, 192.168.2.0, etc., may be assigned, despite ending with 0.\n\nIn the past, conflict between network addresses and broadcast addresses arose because some software used non-standard broadcast addresses with zeros instead of ones.<ref>{{cite web\n|url       = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122#page-66\n|title     = Requirements for Internet Hosts&nbsp;\u2013 Communication Layers\n|author     = [[Robert Braden]]\n|date=October 1989\n|publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n|page      = 66\n|rfc       = 1122\n}}</ref>\n\nIn networks smaller than /24, broadcast addresses do not necessarily end with 255.

The use of domain names requires translating, called ''resolving'', them to addresses and vice versa. This is analogous to looking up a phone number in a phone book using the recipient's name.\n\nThe translation between addresses and domain names is performed by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), a hierarchical, distributed naming system which allows for subdelegation of name spaces to other DNS servers.\n\n==Address space exhaustion==\n{{Main article|IPv4 address exhaustion}}\nSince the 1980s, it was apparent that the pool of available IPv4 addresses was being depleted at a rate that was not initially anticipated in the original design of the network address system.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = World 'running out of Internet addresses'\n |url         = http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-23\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110125195711/http://technology.inquirer.net/infotech/infotech/view/20110121-315808/World-running-out-of-Internet-addresses\n |archivedate = 2011-01-25\n |df          = \n}}</ref> The main market forces which accelerated IPv4 address depletion included:\n* Rapidly growing number of Internet users\n* Always-on devices&nbsp;\u2014 [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] modems, [[cable modem]]s\n* Mobile devices&nbsp;\u2014 [[laptop computer]]s, [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]s, [[mobile phone]]s.\n\nThe threat of exhaustion motivated the introduction of a number of remedial technologies, such as [[classful network]]s, [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods, [[network address translation]] (NAT) and strict usage-based allocation policies. To provide a long-term solution to the pending address exhaustion, [[IPv6]] was created in the 1990s, which made many more addresses available by increasing the address size to 128 bits. IPv6 has been in commercial deployment since 2006. \n\nThe primary address pool of the Internet, maintained by [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]], was exhausted on 3 February 2011, when the last 5 blocks were allocated to the 5 RIRs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032107.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs&nbsp;\u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN,nanog mailing list}}</ref> [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|APNIC]] was the first RIR to exhaust its regional pool on 15 April 2011, except for a small amount of address space reserved for the transition to IPv6, which will be allocated under a much more restricted policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8|url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|accessdate=15 April 2011|author=Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre|date=15 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6113MZsj4?url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8|archivedate=17 August 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe accepted and standard long term solution is to use [[IPv6]] which increased the address size to 128 bits, providing a vastly increased address space that also allows improved route aggregation across the Internet and offers large subnetwork allocations of a minimum of 2<sup>64</sup> host addresses to end-users.

In practice, the field has become a [[hop count]]\u2014when the datagram arrives at a [[router (computing)|router]], the router decrements the TTL field by one. When the TTL field hits zero, the router discards the packet and typically sends an [[ICMP Time Exceeded]] message to the sender.\n\nThe program ''traceroute'' uses these ICMP Time Exceeded messages to print the routers used by packets to go from the source to the destination.</dd>\n<dt>Protocol{{anchor|Protocol}}</dt>\n<dd>This field defines the protocol used in the data portion of the IP datagram.

Errors in the data field must be handled by the encapsulated protocol.

The design accommodates networks of diverse physical nature; it is independent of the underlying transmission technology used in the Link Layer. Networks with different hardware usually vary not only in transmission speed, but also in the [[MTU (networking)|maximum transmission unit]] (MTU). When one network wants to transmit datagrams to a network with a smaller MTU, it may [[IP fragmentation|fragment]] its datagrams. In IPv4, this function was placed at the [[Internet Layer]], and is performed in IPv4 routers, which thus require no implementation of any higher layers for the function of routing IP packets.\n\nIn contrast, [[IPv6]], the next generation of the Internet Protocol, does not allow routers to perform fragmentation; hosts must determine the path MTU before sending datagrams.\n\n===Fragmentation===\nWhen a router receives a packet, it examines the destination address and determines the outgoing interface to use and that interface's MTU.  If the packet size is bigger than the MTU, and the Do not Fragment (DF) bit in the packet's header is set to 0, then the router may fragment the packet.\n\nThe router divides the packet into fragments. The max size of each fragment is the MTU minus the IP header size (20 bytes minimum; 60 bytes maximum). The router puts each fragment into its own packet, each fragment packet having following changes:\n* The ''total length'' field is the fragment size.\n* The ''more fragments'' (MF) flag is set for all fragments except the last one, which is set to 0.\n* The ''fragment offset'' field is set, based on the offset of the fragment in the original data payload. This is measured in units of eight-byte blocks.\n* The ''header checksum'' field is recomputed.\n\nFor example, for an MTU of 1,500 bytes and a header size of 20 bytes, the fragment offsets would be multiples of\n<math>\\frac{1500-20}{8} = 185</math>.\nThese multiples are 0, 185, 370, 555, 740, ...\n\nIt is possible that a packet is fragmented at one router, and that the fragments are further fragmented at another router. For example, a packet of 4,520 bytes, including the 20 bytes of the IP header (without options) is fragmented to two packets on a link with an MTU of 2,500 bytes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Total bytes\n!|Header bytes\n!|Data bytes\n!|\"More fragments\" flag\n!|Fragment offset (8-byte blocks)\n|-\n|1\n|2500\n|20\n|2480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|2040\n|20\n|2020\n|0\n|310\n|}\n\nThe total data size is preserved: 2480 bytes + 2020 bytes = 4500 bytes.\nThe offsets are\n<math>0</math>\nand\n<math>\\frac{0 + 2480}{8} = 310</math>.\n\nOn a link with an MTU of 1,500 bytes,  each fragment results in two fragments:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!|Fragment\n!|Total bytes\n!|Header bytes\n!|Data bytes\n!|\"More fragments\" flag\n!|Fragment offset (8-byte blocks)\n|-\n|1\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|0\n|-\n|2\n|1020\n|20\n|1000\n|1\n|185\n|-\n|3\n|1500\n|20\n|1480\n|1\n|310\n|-\n|4\n|560\n|20\n|540\n|0\n|495\n|}\n\nAgain, the data size is preserved: 1480 + 1000 = 2480, and 1480 + 540 = 2020.\n\nAlso in this case, the ''More Fragments'' bit remains 1 for all the fragments that came with 1 in them and for the last fragment that arrives, it works as usual, that is the MF bit is set to 0 only in the last one. And of course, the Identification field continues to have the same value in all re-fragmented fragments. This way, even if fragments are re-fragmented, the receiver knows they have initially all started from the same packet.\n\nThe last offset and last data size are used to calculate the total data size:\n<math>495 \\times 8 + 540 = 3960 + 540 = 4500</math>.\n\n===Reassembly===\nA receiver knows that a packet is a fragment if at least one of the following conditions is true:\n\n* The \"more fragments\" flag is set. (This is true for all fragments except the last.)\n* The \"fragment offset\" field is nonzero. (This is true for all fragments except the first.)\n\nThe receiver identifies matching fragments using the foreign and local address, the protocol ID, and the identification field. The receiver reassembles the data from fragments with the same ID using both the fragment offset and the more fragments flag. When the receiver receives the last fragment (which has the \"more fragments\" flag set to 0), it can calculate the length of the original data payload, by multiplying the last fragment's offset by eight, and adding the last fragment's data size. In the example above, this calculation was 495*8 + 540 = 4500 bytes.\n\nWhen the receiver has all fragments, they can be correctly ordered by using the offsets, and reassembled to yield the original data segment.\n\n==Assistive protocols==\nThe Internet Protocol is the protocol that defines and enables [[internetwork]]ing at the [[Internet Layer]] and thus forms the Internet. It uses a logical addressing system. IP addresses are not tied in any permanent manner to hardware identifications and, indeed, a network interface can have multiple IP addresses. Hosts and routers need additional mechanisms to identify the relationship between device interfaces and IP addresses, in order to properly deliver an IP packet to the destination host on a link. The [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) performs this IP-address-to-hardware-address translation for IPv4. (A hardware address is also called a [[MAC address]].) In addition, the reverse correlation is often necessary. For example, when an IP host is booted or connected to a network it needs to determine its IP address, unless an address is preconfigured by an administrator. Protocols for such inverse correlations exist in the [[Internet Protocol Suite]]. Currently used methods are [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP), [[Bootstrap Protocol]] (BOOTP) and, infrequently, [[RARP|reverse ARP]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the Internet]]\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[List of IP protocol numbers]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=note/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiversity | IPv4}}\n* https://www.iana.org \u2014 Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n* http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/protocol/ip.htm \u2014 IP Header Breakdown, including specific options\n* RFC 3344 \u2014 IPv4 Mobility\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608114541/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/060710-tech-argument-ipv6-nat.html IPv6 vs. carrier-grade NAT/squeezing more out of IPv4]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110109025511/http://www.ripe.net/rs/news/ipv4-ncc-20031030.html RIPE report on address consumption as of October 2003]\n* [https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space Official current state of IPv4 /8 allocations, as maintained by IANA]\n* [http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html Dynamically generated graphs of IPv4 address consumption with predictions of exhaustion dates\u2014Geoff Huston]\n* [https://www.apnic.net/community/ecosystem/igf/articles/ip-addressing-in-china-2004 IP addressing in China and the myth of address shortage]\n* [http://www.inetcore.com/project/ipv4ec/index_en.html Countdown of remaining IPv4 available addresses] (estimated)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Internet Protocol]]\n[[Category:Internet Standards]]\n[[Category:Internet layer protocols]]\n[[Category:Network layer protocols]]\n[[Category:IPv4| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]", "sha1": "30fd9d32rmzxrnzlkgkuqhjfnuqs9sh"}}, {"title": "IPv6", "ns": "0", "id": "15318", "revision": {"id": "866486944", "parentid": "865352729", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T16:56:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "Briancricks", "id": "11383388"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Larger address space */ Removed stray .", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Update|part=RFC 8200 and RFC 8201|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{IPstack}}\n'''Internet Protocol version 6''' ('''IPv6''') is the most recent version of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), the [[communications protocol]] that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the [[Internet]]. IPv6 was developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of [[IPv4 address exhaustion]]. IPv6 is intended to replace [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"ipv6nz\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipv6.org.nz/ipv6-faqs/|title=FAQs|author=New Zealand IPv6 Task Force|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> IPv6 became a Draft Standard in December 1998, and became an [[Internet Standard]] on 14 July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/07/rfc-8200-ipv6-has-been-standardized/ | title=RFC 8200 \u2013 IPv6 has been standardized | first=Aftab |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Internet Society | date=17 July 2017 |access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDevices on the Internet are assigned a unique [[IP address]] for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use. The total number of possible IPv6 addresses is more than {{val|7.9|e=28}} times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms]] have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four [[hexadecimal]] digits with the groups being separated by colons, for example 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this full notation exist.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4). IPv6 was first formally described in [[Internet standard]] document {{IETF RFC|1883}}, published in December 1995.<ref name=rfc1883>{{Citation|rfc=1883|title=Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification|authorlink=Steve Deering|author=S.

It simplifies aspects of address assignment ([[IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|stateless address autoconfiguration]]), network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits to facilitate an automatic mechanism for forming the host identifier from [[link layer]] addressing information ([[MAC address]]). [[Network security]] was a design requirement of the IPv6 architecture, and included the original specification of [[IPsec]].\n\nIPv6 does not specify interoperability features with IPv4, but essentially creates a parallel, independent network. Exchanging traffic between the two networks requires translator gateways employing one of several transition mechanisms, such as [[NAT64]], or a [[tunneling protocol]] like [[6to4]], [[6in4]], or [[Teredo tunneling|Teredo]].\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. It is currently described by [[IETF]] publication {{IETF RFC|791}} (September 1981), which replaced an earlier definition ({{IETF RFC|760}}, January 1980). IPv4 included an addressing system that used numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|year=1995|month= January|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR). As of September 2015, all of [[Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre]] (APNIC), the [[RIPE NCC|R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens Network Coordination Centre]] (RIPE_NCC), [[Latin America and Caribbean Network Information Centre]] (LACNIC), and [[American Registry for Internet Numbers]] (ARIN) have reached this stage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Fahmida|title=IPv4 Address Exhaustion Not Instant Cause for Concern with IPv6 in Wings|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/IT-Infrastructure/IPv4-Address-Exhaustion-Not-Instant-Cause-for-Concern-with-IPv6-in-Wings-287643/|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Mark|title=Europe hits old internet address limits|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19600718|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Huston|first=Geoff|title=IPV4 Address Report|url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/}}</ref> This leaves [[AFRINIC|African Network Information Center]] (AFRINIC) as the sole regional internet registry that is still using the normal protocol for distributing IPv4 addresses.\n\n===Working-group proposals===\nBy the beginning of 1992, several proposals appeared for an expanded Internet addressing system and by the end of 1992 the IETF announced a call for white papers.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=1550|title=IP: Next Generation (IPng) White Paper Solicitation|first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=December 1993|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1550}}</ref> In September 1993, the IETF created a temporary, ad-hoc ''IP Next Generation'' (IPng) area to deal specifically with such issues. The new area was led by [[Allison Mankin]] and [[Scott Bradner]], and had a directorate with 15 engineers from diverse backgrounds for direction-setting and preliminary document review:<ref name=rfc1752/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://grnlight.net/index.php/programming-articles/103-history-of-the-ipng-effort|publisher=Sun|title=History of the IPng Effort}}</ref> The working-group members were [[J.

(Version 5 was used by the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]].)\n\nIt is widely expected that the Internet will use IPv4 alongside IPv6 for the foreseeable future. Direct communication between the IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols is not possible; therefore, intermediary trans-protocol systems are needed as a communication conduit between IPv4 and IPv6 whether on a single device or among [[Node (networking)|network nodes]].\n\n==Comparison with IPv4==\nOn the Internet, data is transmitted in the form of [[network packet]]s. IPv6 specifies a new [[IPv6 packet|packet format]], designed to minimize packet header processing by routers.<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726>{{cite web|rfc=1726|title=Technical Criteria for Choosing IP The Next Generation (IPng)|last=Partridge|first=C.|last2=Kastenholz|first2=F.|date=December 1994|url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1726.txt}}</ref> Because the headers of IPv4 packets and IPv6 packets are significantly different, the two protocols are not interoperable. However, in most respects, IPv6 is an extension of IPv4. Most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, which is approximately 340 undecillion addresses).\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, the square of the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\nRenumbering an existing network for a new connectivity provider with different routing prefixes is a major effort with IPv4.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=2071|title=Network Renumbering Overview: Why would I want it and what is it anyway?|first=P.|last=Ferguson|first2=H.|last2=Berkowitz|date=January 1997|url=http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2071}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|rfc=2072|title=Router Renumbering Guide|first=H.|last=Berkowitz|date=January 1997|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2072}}</ref> With IPv6, however, changing the prefix announced by a few routers can in principle renumber an entire network, since the host identifiers (the least-significant 64 bits of an address) can be independently self-configured by a host.<ref name=rfc4862>{{cite web|rfc=4862|title=IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration|first=S.|last=Thomson|first2=T.|last2=Narten|first3=T.|last3=Jinmei|date=September 2007|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4862}}</ref>\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly) implemented feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts can configure themselves automatically when connected to an IPv6 network using the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] via [[Internet Control Message Protocol version 6]] (ICMPv6) router discovery messages. When first connected to a network, a host sends a [[link-local address|link-local]] router solicitation multicast request for its configuration parameters; routers respond to such a request with a router advertisement packet that contains Internet Layer configuration parameters.<ref name=rfc4862/> Routers present a special case of requirements for address configuration, as they often are sources of autoconfiguration information, such as router and prefix advertisements. Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref>\n\nIf IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration is unsuitable, IPv6 just like IPv4 allows for stateful configuration with the [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or  manual static configuration of hosts.\n\n===SLAAC privacy extensions===\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet. In this approach each device on the network has a unique address globally reachable directly from any other location on the Internet.\n\nA unique IP address can potentially be used to track the network activity of a device. Moreover, when using IPv6 address auto-configuration, the Interface Identifier ([[MAC address]]) of a [[Network interface controller|network card]] is used to make its public IPv6 interface identifier unique, exposing the type of hardware used and providing a unique handle for a user's online activity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Autoconfiguration on the basis of the network card MAC address is therefore a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops, because when they access the Internet from different [[local area networks]], their MAC based interface identifier would always stay the same. Thus the MAC address based interface identifier can be used to track the movement and usage of a particular mobile device.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 | authors= T. Narten, R. Draves & S. Krishnan |date= September 2007 |website= www.ietf.org |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen IPv6 was developed in the mid-90s, the Internet was not accessed by a large number of mobile devices and privacy was not the priority it has become today. To address these privacy concerns, the SLAAC protocol was updated with mechanisms that were termed \u201cPrivacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6\u201d, codified in RFC 4941. This allows for the IPv6 address interface identifier to be generated randomly. If the same interface identifier is generated for two devices in the same local area network, the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) function of the IPv6 [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP) will resolve the situation. The SLAAC privacy extension also implements a time out, which is configurable, so that the IPv6 interface addresses will be discarded and a new interface identifier is generated. Typically the time out is configured to 24 hours. So IPv6 autoconfiguration will generate and set a new IPv6 host address every day. As of late 2014 the SLAAC privacy extensions functionality was implemented by the following operating systems: all [[Microsoft Windows]] after [[Windows XP]], all versions of [[Mac OS X]] from 10.7 onward, all versions of [[iOS]] since 4.3, all versions of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] since 4.0 ([[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Ice Cream Sandwich]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world-01 |title= Privacy Extensions for IPv6 SLAAC | authors= T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended. But with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014|isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7|page=196}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}}   IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, packet processing by routers is generally more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, a study in 2015 indicated that some network operators dropped IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traversed transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].<ref name=draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world-01>{{cite web|work=draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world-01|title=Observations on the Dropping of Packets with IPv6 Extension Headers in the Real World|first=F.|last=Gont|first2=J.|last2=Linkova|first3=T.|last3=Chown|first4=S.|last4=Liu|date=October 2015|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-in-real-world-01}}</ref>\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 Packet format==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|KB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 Packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a very different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref>\n\nThe identifier is only unique within the subnet to which a host is connected. IPv6 has a mechanism for automatic address detection,<ref name=\"rfc-editor.org\">{{IETF RFC|3315}}, R. Droms, J. Bound, B. Volz, T. Lemon, C. Perkins, and M.

If there is no answer after a predetermined number of attempts, the host concludes that no routers are connected. If it does get a response from a router, there will be network information inside that is needed to create a globally unique address. There are also two flag bits that tell the host whether it should use DHCP to get further information and addresses:\n* The Manage bit, that indicates whether or not the host should use DHCP to obtain additional addresses\n* The Other bit, that indicates whether or not the host should obtain other information through DHCP. The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<ref name=\"T. Narten pp. 54\"/>\n** On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.\n** Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.\n\n===Link-local address===\nAll interfaces of IPv6 hosts require a link-local address. A link-local address is derived from the MAC address of the interface and the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. The process involves filling the address space with prefix bits left-justified to the most-significant bit, and filling the MAC address in EUI-64 format into the least-significant bits. If any bits remain to be filled between the two parts, those are set to zero.<ref name=\"rfc-editor.org\"/>\n\nThe uniqueness of the address on the subnet is tested with the [[IPv6 address#Duplicate address detection|Duplicate Address Detection]] (DAD) method.<ref>{{cite web|author1=S.

The prefix is supplied from router advertisements on the network. Multiple prefix announcements cause multiple addresses to be configured.<ref name=\"T.

[[Local Internet registries]] are assigned at least {{IPaddr||32}} blocks, which they divide among subordinate networks.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Address Allocation and Assignment Policy|publisher=RIPE NCC|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011|url=http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-512}}</ref> The initial recommendation stated assignment of a {{IPaddr||48}} subnet to end-consumer sites ({{IETF RFC|3177}}).

It remains to be seen if ISPs will honor this recommendation. For example, during initial trials, [[Comcast]] customers were given a single {{IPaddr||64}} network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Comcast Activates First Users With IPv6 Native Dual Stack Over DOCSIS |website= Comcast.com |publisher=[[Comcast]] |date=31 January 2011|url=http://blog.comcast.com/2011/01/comcast-activates-first-users-with-ipv6-native-dual-stack-over-docsis.html}}</ref>\n\nIPv6 addresses are classified by three types of networking methodologies: [[unicast]] addresses identify each network interface, [[anycast]] addresses identify a group of interfaces, usually at different locations of which the nearest one is automatically selected, and [[multicast]] addresses are used to deliver one packet to many interfaces. The [[Broadcasting (computing)|broadcast]] method is not implemented in IPv6. Each IPv6 address has a scope, which specifies in which part of the network it is valid and unique. Some addresses are unique only on the local (sub-)network. Others are globally unique.\n\nSome IPv6 addresses are reserved for special purposes, such as [[loopback]], [[6to4]] tunneling, and [[Teredo tunneling]], as outlined in {{IETF RFC|5156}}. Also, some address ranges are considered special, such as link-local addresses for use on the local link only, [[Unique local address]]es (ULA), as described in {{IETF RFC|4193}}, and solicited-node multicast addresses used in the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\n==IPv6 in the Domain Name System==\nIn the [[Domain Name System]], [[hostname]]s are mapped to IPv6 addresses by AAAA resource records, so-called ''quad-A'' records. For [[Reverse DNS lookup|reverse resolution]], the IETF reserved the domain [[.arpa|ip6.arpa]], where the name space is hierarchically divided by the 1-digit [[hexadecimal]] representation of [[nibble]] units (4 bits) of the IPv6 address. This scheme is defined in {{IETF RFC|3596}}.\n\n<!-- [[A6 record]] redirects to this section. -->\nAt the design stage of the IPv6 DNS architecture, the AAAA scheme faced a rival proposal. This alternate approach, designed to facilitate network renumbering, uses ''A6'' records for the forward lookup and a number of other innovations such as ''bit-string labels'' and ''[[CNAME_record#DNAME_record|DNAME]]'' records. It is defined in {{IETF RFC|2874}} and its references (with further discussion of the pros and cons of both schemes in {{IETF RFC|3364}}), but has been deprecated to experimental status ({{IETF RFC|3363}}).\n\n==Transition mechanisms==\n{{Main|IPv6 transition mechanism}}\n\nIPv6 is not foreseen to supplant IPv4 instantaneously. Both protocols will continue to operate simultaneously for some time. Therefore, [[IPv6 transition mechanisms]] are needed to enable IPv6 hosts to reach IPv4 services and to allow isolated IPv6 hosts and networks to reach each other over IPv4 infrastructure.<ref name=sixxs>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixxs.net/faq/connectivity/?faq=comparison|title=IPv6 Transition Mechanism / Tunneling Comparison|publisher=Sixxs.net|accessdate=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Silvia Hagen]] a dual-stack implementation of the IPv4 and IPv6 on devices is the easiest way to migrate to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222\u2013223}}</ref> Many other transition mechanisms use tunneling to encapsulate IPv6 traffic within IPv4 networks.

This permits dual-stack hosts to participate in IPv6 and IPv4 networks simultaneously. The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF|accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP implementations to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. Dual-stack also needs to be implemented on [[Router (computing)|routers]], so that they can forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nHowever, outdated DNS server implementations don\u2019t support IPv6. While dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6. Various versions of Internet applications, such as the [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), don\u2019t support IPv6.<ref name=\"Steven J.

However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with a public facing IPv4 and IPv6, thus supporting dual stack, because some ISPs have run out of IPv4 addresses that are globally routable. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach [[web servers]] and other destinations that have an IPv4 address.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIPv6 addresses are in the process of being allocated all over the world. A significant percentage of ISPs in all [[Regional Internet Registry]] (RIR) zones have already obtained IPv6 address space. This includes many of the world\u2019s major ISPs and [[mobile network]] operators, such as [[Verizon Wireless]], [[StarHub TV|StarHub Cable]], [[Chubu Electric Power|Chubu Telecommunications]], [[Kabel Deutschland]], [[Swisscom]], [[T-Mobile]], [[Internode (ISP)|Internode]] and [[Telefonica]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nro.net/ipv6/ |title= IPv6 | author= |date=  |website= www.nro.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile there are still some ISPs that only allocate their [[DSL]] customers an IPv4, many ISPs allocate their customers only an IPv6 or dual stack IPv4 and IPv6. ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  |website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213. When the Internet backbone was IPv4 only one of the frequently used tunneling protocols was [[6to4]].<ref name=\"Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols\"/> [[Teredo tunneling]] was also frequently used for integrating IPv6 LANs with the IPv4 Internet backbone. Teredo is outlined in RFC 4380 and allows IPv6 [[local area networks]] to tunnel over IPv4 networks, by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP. The Teredo relay is an IPv6 router that mediates between a Teredo server and the native IPv6 network. It was expected that 6to4 and Teredo would be widely deployed until ISP networks would switch to native IPv6, but by 2014 Google Statistics showed that the use of both mechanisms had dropped to almost 0.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n====IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses====\nHybrid dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations recognize a special class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. These addresses consist of an 80-bit prefix of zeros, the next 16 bits are ones, and the remaining, least-significant 32 bits contain the IPv4 address. These addresses are typically written with a 96-bit prefix in the standard IPv6 format, and the remaining 32 bits written in the customary [[dot-decimal notation]] of IPv4. For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128 represents the IPv4 address 192.0.2.128. A deprecated format for IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses is ::192.0.2.128.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291|rfc=4291|title=IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture|publisher=IETF|date=February 2006|accessdate=2017-11-28}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the significant internal differences between IPv4 and IPv6, some of the lower-level functionality available to programmers in the IPv6 stack does not work the same when used with IPv4-mapped addresses. Some common IPv6 stacks do not implement the IPv4-mapped address feature, either because the IPv6 and IPv4 stacks are separate implementations (e.g., [[Microsoft Windows]] 2000, XP, and Server 2003), or because of security concerns ([[OpenBSD]]).<ref name=openbsd-mapped-addr>{{man|4|inet6|OpenBSD}}</ref> On these operating systems, a program must open a separate socket for each IP protocol it uses. On some systems, e.g., the [[Linux kernel]], [[NetBSD]], and [[FreeBSD]], this feature is controlled by the socket option IPV6_V6ONLY, as specified in {{IETF RFC|3493}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3493#page-22|rfc=3493|title=Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6|publisher=IETF|page=22|date=February 2003|accessdate=2017-11-28}}</ref>\n\n==IPv6 readiness==\nCompatibility with IPv6 networking is mainly a software or firmware issue. However, much of the older hardware that could in principle be upgraded is likely to be replaced instead.

All personal computers and smartphones running recent major [[operating system]] versions support IPv6. Many popular applications with networking capabilities are compliant.

Burkholder and Lyman L. Johnson, ''Colonial Latin America'', 7th edition. New York: Oxford University Press 2010, p. 19</ref> The administrative, political and military center of the empire was located in [[Cusco]] in modern-day [[Peru]]. The [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]] arose from the highlands of Peru sometime in the early 13th century. Its [[neo-Inca State|last stronghold]] was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in 1572.\n\nFrom 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western [[South America]], centered on the [[Andes|Andean]] Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods. At its largest, the empire joined [[Peru]], large parts of modern [[Ecuador]], western and south central [[Bolivia]], northwest [[Argentina]], north and [[Incas in Central Chile|central Chile]] and a small part of southwest [[Colombia]] into a state comparable to the historical empires of [[Eurasia]]. Its official language was [[Quechua languages|Quechua]].<ref>http://www.machupicchu-tours-peru.org/blog/quechua-language-incas</ref> Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred ''[[Huaca]]s'', but the Inca leadership encouraged the [[solar deity|sun worship]] of [[Inti]] \u2013 their [[solar deity|sun god]] \u2013 and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of [[Pachamama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=inca|title=The Inca - All Empires|publisher=}}</ref> The Incas considered their king, the [[Sapa Inca]], to be the \"son of the sun.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091110041802/http://www.nflc.org/Reach/7ca/enCAInca.htm \"The Inca.\"] ''The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland.'' 29 May 2007. Retrieved 10 Sept 2013.</ref>\n\nThe Inca Empire was unique in that it lacked many features associated with civilization in the [[Old World]]. In the words of one scholar, \"The Incas lacked the use of wheeled vehicles. They lacked animals to ride and draft animals that could pull wagons and plows... [They] lacked the knowledge of iron and steel... Above all, they lacked a system of writing... Despite these supposed handicaps, the Incas were still able to construct one of the greatest imperial states in human history\".<ref>\"McEwan, Gordon F. (2006). ''The Incas: New Perspectives'', New York: W. W. Norton & Co, p. 5</ref> Notable features of the Inca Empire include its monumental architecture, especially stonework, extensive road network reaching all corners of the empire, finely-woven [[Textile|textiles]], use of knotted strings ({{lang|qu|[[quipu]]}}) for record keeping and communication, agricultural innovations in a difficult environment, and the organization and management fostered or imposed on its people and their labor.\n\nThe Incan economy has been described in contradictory ways by scholars: as \"feudal, slave, socialist (here one may choose between socialist paradise or socialist tyranny)\".<ref>La Lone, Darrell E. \"The Inca as a Nonmarket Economy: Supply on Command versus Supply and Demand,\" p. 292. https://www.academia.edu/885136/The_Inca_as_a_nonmarket_economy_Supply_on_command_versus_supply_and_demand, accessed 10 Aug 2017</ref> The Inca empire functioned largely without money and without markets. Instead, exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. \"Taxes\" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire. The Inca rulers (who theoretically owned all the means of production) reciprocated by granting access to land and goods and providing food and drink in celebratory feasts for their subjects.<ref>Morris, Craig and von Hagen, Adrianna (2011), ''The Incas'', London: Thames & Hudson, pp. 48\u201358</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Inca referred to their empire as ''Tawantinsuyu'',{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=221}} \"the four ''suyu''\". In [[Quechua language|Quechua]], ''tawa'' is four and ''-ntin'' is a suffix naming a group, so that a ''tawantin'' is a quartet, a group of four things taken together, in this case representing the four ''suyu'' (\"regions\" or \"provinces\") whose corners met at the capital. The four ''suyu'' were: [[Chinchaysuyu]] (north), [[Antisuyu]] (east; the Amazon jungle), [[Qullasuyu]] (south) and [[Kuntisuyu]] (west). The name ''Tawantinsuyu'' was, therefore, a descriptive term indicating a union of provinces. The Spanish transliterated the name as ''Tahuatinsuyo'' or ''Tahuatinsuyu''.\n\nThe term ''Inka'' means \"ruler\" or \"lord\" in Quechua and was used to refer to the ruling class or the ruling family.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Inca | encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary | year=2009 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inca}}</ref> The Incas were a very small percentage of the total population of the empire, probably numbering only 15,000 to 40,000, but ruling a population of around 10 million people.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=93}} The Spanish adopted the term (transliterated as ''Inca'' in Spanish) as an ethnic term referring to all subjects of the empire rather than simply the ruling class. As such, the name ''Imperio inca'' (\"Inca Empire\") referred to the nation that they encountered and subsequently conquered.\n\n==History==\n===Antecedents===\nThe Inca Empire was the last chapter of thousands of years of [[Andean civilization]]. Andean civilization was one of five civilizations in the world deemed by scholars to be \"pristine\", that is indigenous and not derivative from other civilizations.<ref>Upton, Gary and von Hagen, Adriana (2015), ''Encyclopedia of the Incas'', New York: Rowand & Littlefield, p. 2. Some scholars cite 6 or 7 pristine civilizations.</ref>\n\nThe Inca Empire was preceded by two large-scale empires in the Andes: the [[Tiwanaku Empire|Tiwanaku]] (c. 300\u20131100 AD), based around [[Lake Titicaca]] and the [[Wari Empire|Wari]] or Huari (c. 600\u20131100 AD) centered near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]]. The Wari occupied the Cuzco area for about 400 years. Thus, many of the characteristics of the Inca Empire derived from earlier multi-ethnic and expansive Andean cultures.<ref>McEwan, Gordon F. (2006), ''The Incas: New Perspectives'', New York: W. W. Norton & Company, p. 65</ref>\n\n[[Carl Troll]] has argued that the development of the Inca state in the central Andes was aided by conditions that allows for the elaboration of the [[staple food]] [[chu\u00f1o]]. Chu\u00f1o, which can be stored for long periods, is made of potato dried at the freezing temperatures that are common at nighttime in the southern [[Peru]]vian highlands. Such link between the Inca state and chu\u00f1o may be questioned as potatoes and other crops such as maize can also be dried with only sunlight.<ref name=Gade2016/> Troll did also argue that [[llama]]s, the Inca's pack animal, can be found in its largest numbers in this very same region.<ref name=Gade2016>{{cite book |last=Gade |first=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Spell of the Urubamba: Anthropogeographical Essays on an Andean Valley in Space and Time |url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319208480#aboutBook |chapter=Urubamba Verticality: Reflections on Crops and Diseases |location= |publisher= |page=86 |isbn=978-3-319-20849-7 |author-link= }}</ref> It is worth considering the maximum extent of the Inca Empire roughly coincided with the greatest distribution of llamas and [[alpaca]]s in Pre-Hispanic America.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hardoy |first=Jorge Henr\u00edque |date=1973 |title=Pre-Colombian Cities |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=fbQJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=llama+inca+expansion+colombia+limi&source=bl&ots=Rirv1B3ECv&sig=eNEgkUGhfN1RQ2uoR71F2WF52Xw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFtZvGvZTZAhVJHJAKHeZYA_MQ6AEIdDAP#v=onepage&q&f=false |location= |publisher= |page=24 |isbn=978-0802703804 |author-link= }}</ref> The link between the Andean [[biome]]s of [[Puna grassland|puna]] and [[p\u00e1ramo]], [[pastoralism]] and the Inca state is a matter of research.<ref name=Gade1996/> As a third point Troll pointed out irrigation technology as advantageous to the Inca state-building.<ref name=Gade1996>{{cite journal |last1=Gade |first1=Daniel W. |date=1996 |title=Carl Troll on Nature and Culture in the Andes (Carl Troll \u00fcber die Natur und Kultur in den Anden)  |url= |journal=[[Erdkunde]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=301\u2013316 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref> While Troll theorized environmental influences on the Inca Empire he opposed [[environmental determinism]] arguing that culture lay at the core of the Inca civilization.<ref name=Gade1996/>\n\n===Origin===\nThe Inca people were a [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] tribe in the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] area around the 12th century. Incan [[oral history]] tells an origin story of three caves. The center cave at Tampu T'uqu ''(Tambo Tocco)'' was named Qhapaq T'uqu (\"principal niche\", also spelled ''Capac Tocco''). The other caves were Maras T'uqu ''(Maras Tocco)'' and Sutiq T'uqu ''(Sutic Tocco)''.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=57}} Four brothers and four sisters stepped out of the middle cave. They were: [[Manco Capac|Ayar Manco]], [[Ayar Cachi]], Ayar Awqa ''(Ayar Auca)'' and Ayar Uchu; and [[Mama Ocllo]], [[Mama Raua]], Mama Huaco and Mama Qura ''(Mama Cora)''. Out of the side caves came the people who were to be the ancestors of all the Inca clans.\n\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Manco Capac, First Inca, 1 of 14 Portraits of Inca Kings - overall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manco C\u00e1pac]], First Inca, 1 of 14 Portraits of Inca Kings, Probably mid-18th century. Oil on canvas. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nAyar Manco carried a magic staff made of the finest gold. Where this staff landed, the people would live. They traveled for a long time. On the way, Ayar Cachi boasted about his strength and power. His siblings tricked him into returning to the cave to get a sacred [[llama]]. When he went into the cave, they trapped him inside to get rid of him.\n\nAyar Uchu decided to stay on the top of the cave to look over the Inca people. The minute he proclaimed that, he turned to stone. They built a shrine around the stone and it became a sacred object. Ayar Auca grew tired of all this and decided to travel alone. Only Ayar Manco and his four sisters remained.\n\nFinally, they reached Cusco. The staff sank into the ground. Before they arrived, Mama Ocllo had already borne Ayar Manco a child, [[Sinchi Roca]]. The people who were already living in Cusco fought hard to keep their land, but Mama Huaca was a good fighter. When the enemy attacked, she threw her [[bolas]] (several stones tied together that spun through the air when thrown) at a soldier (gualla) and killed him instantly. The other people became afraid and ran away.\n\nAfter that, Ayar Manco became known as [[Manco C\u00e1pac]], the founder of the Inca. It is said that he and his sisters built the first Inca homes in the valley with their own hands. When the time came, Manco C\u00e1pac turned to stone like his brothers before him. His son, Sinchi Roca, became the second emperor of the Inca.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=69}}\n\n===Kingdom of Cusco===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Cusco}}\n\nUnder the leadership of Manco C\u00e1pac, the Inca formed the small city-state [[Kingdom of Cusco]] (Quechua ''Qusqu', Qosqo''). In 1438, they began a far-reaching expansion under the command of [[Sapa Inca]] (paramount leader) [[Pachacuti|Pachacuti-Cusi Yupanqui]], whose name literally meant \"earth-shaker\". The name of Pachacuti was given to him after he conquered the Tribe of [[Chancas]] (modern [[Apur\u00edmac Region|Apur\u00edmac]]). During his reign, he and his son Tupac Yupanqui brought much of the [[Andes]] mountains (roughly modern Peru and Ecuador) under Inca control.<ref name=\"isbn0-521-31896-3\">{{Cite book|last1=Demarest |first1=Arthur Andrew |last2=Conrad |first2=Geoffrey W. |title=Religion and Empire: The Dynamics of Aztec and Inca Expansionism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1984 |pages=57\u201359 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=IqecX148zLsC|page=57}} |isbn=0-521-31896-3 }}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and formation===\n[[File:Capitulo-XXXVIII.jpg|thumb|The first image of the Inca in Europe, [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]], ''[[Cronica del Peru]]'', 1553]]\n\nPachacuti reorganized the kingdom of Cusco into the Tahuantinsuyu, which consisted of a central government with the Inca at its head and four provincial governments with strong leaders: Chinchasuyu (NW), Antisuyu (NE), Kuntisuyu (SW) and Qullasuyu (SE).<ref>The three laws of [[Tawantinsuyu]] are still referred to in Bolivia these days as the three laws of the Qullasuyu.</ref> Pachacuti is thought to have built [[Machu Picchu]], either as a family home or summer retreat, although it may have been an agricultural station.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Weatherford | first=J.

He then sent messages to their leaders extolling the benefits of joining his empire, offering them presents of luxury goods such as high quality textiles and promising that they would be materially richer as his subjects.\n\nMost accepted the rule of the Inca as a ''[[List of French phrases used by English speakers#F|fait accompli]]'' and acquiesced peacefully. Refusal to accept Inca rule resulted in military conquest. Following conquest the local rulers were executed. The ruler's children were brought to Cusco to learn about Inca administration systems, then return to rule their native lands. This allowed the Inca to indoctrinate them into the Inca nobility and, with luck, marry their daughters into families at various corners of the empire.\n\n===Expansion and consolidation===\n[[File:Manqu Qhapaqwan Mama Uqllu.gif|thumb|left|Manco C\u00e1pac and Mama Ocllo, children of the [[Inti]]]]\n\nTraditionally the son of the Inca ruler led the army.

T\u00fapac Inca's most important conquest was the Kingdom of [[Chimor]], the Inca's only serious rival for the Peruvian coast. T\u00fapac Inca's empire stretched north into modern-day Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nT\u00fapac Inca's son [[Huayna C\u00e1pac]] added a small portion of land to the north in modern-day Ecuador and in parts of Peru. At its height, the Inca Empire included [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]], most of what is now [[Ecuador]] and [[Incas in Central Chile|a large portion]] of what is today [[Chile]], north of the [[Maule River]]. The advance south halted after the [[Battle of the Maule]] where they met determined resistance from the [[Mapuche]].

However, most of the southern portion of the Inca empire, the portion denominated as Qullasuyu, was located in the [[Altiplano]].\n\nThe Inca Empire was an amalgamation of languages, cultures and peoples. The components of the empire were not all uniformly loyal, nor were the local cultures all fully integrated. The Inca empire as a whole had an economy based on exchange and taxation of luxury goods and labour. The following quote describes a method of taxation:\n\n<blockquote>For as is well known to all, not a single village of the highlands or the plains failed to pay the tribute levied on it by those who were in charge of these matters. There were even provinces where, when the natives alleged that they were unable to pay their tribute, the Inca ordered that each inhabitant should be obliged to turn in every four months a large quill full of live lice, which was the Inca's way of teaching and accustoming them to pay tribute.<ref name=\"StarnKirk2009\">{{cite book|first1=Orin |last1=Starn|first2=Carlos Iv\u00e1n |last2=Kirk|first3=Carlos Iv\u00e1n |last3=Degregori|title=The Peru Reader: History, Culture, Politics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=YyNo4Nsh_qQC}}|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8750-6}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Inca Civil War and Spanish conquest===\n{{Main|Inca Civil War|Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire}}\n[[File:Inca_Expansion.svg|thumb|Inca expansion (1438\u20131533)]]\n[[File:Luis Montero - The Funerals of Inca Atahualpa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Atahualpa]], the last [[Sapa Inca]] of the empire, was executed by the Spanish on 29&nbsp;August 1533]]\n\nSpanish [[conquistadors]] led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] and his brothers explored south from what is today [[Panama]], reaching Inca territory by 1526.<ref>*{{cite web\n | author = [[Juan de Samano (secretario)|Juan de Samano]]\n | url = http://bloknot.info/juan-de-samanos-relacion-de-los-primeros-descubrimientos-peru-francisco-pizarro-y-diego-de-almagro-1526/\n | title = Relacion de los primeros descubrimientos de Francisco Pizarro y Diego de Almagro, 1526\n | publisher = bloknot.info (A.

This approval was received as detailed in the following quote: \"In July 1529 the [[Isabella of Portugal|queen of Spain]] signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Incas. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in Peru, or New Castile, as the Spanish now called the land.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Somervill |first=Barbara |title=Francisco Pizarro: Conqueror of the Incas |publisher=Compass Point Books |year=2005 |page=52 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=j-FusDo4ssoC|page=52}} |isbn=978-0-7565-1061-9}}</ref>\n\nWhen they returned to Peru in 1532, a [[Inca Civil War|war of succession]] between the sons of [[Sapa Inca]] Huayna Capac, [[Hu\u00e1scar]] and [[Atahualpa]], and unrest among newly conquered territories weakened the empire. Perhaps more importantly, [[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[typhus]] and [[measles]] had spread from Central America.\n\nThe forces led by Pizarro consisted of 168 men, one [[cannon]], and 27 horses. Conquistadors ported lances, [[arquebus]]es, steel armor and [[Rapier|long swords]]. In contrast, the Inca used weapons made out of wood, stone, copper and bronze, putting them at significant technological disadvantage. In addition, due to the absence of horses in the Americas, the Inca did not develop tactics to fight cavalry. However, the Inca were still effective warriors, being able to successfully [[Battle of the Maule|fight]] the [[Mapuche]], which later would [[Arauco War|strategically defeat]] the Spanish as they expanded [[Destruction of the Seven Cities|further south]].\n\nThe first engagement between the Inca and the Spanish was the [[Battle of Pun\u00e1]], near present-day [[Guayaquil]], Ecuador, on the Pacific Coast; Pizarro then founded the city of [[Piura]] in July 1532. [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]] was sent inland to explore the interior and returned with an invitation to meet the Inca, Atahualpa, who had defeated his brother in the civil war and was resting at [[Cajamarca]] with his army of 80,000 troops, that were at the moment armed only with hunting tools (knives and lassos for hunting llamas).\n\nPizarro and some of his men, most notably a friar named [[Vincente de Valverde]], met with the Inca, who had brought only a small retinue. The Inca offered them ceremonial [[chicha]] in a golden cup, which the Spanish rejected. The Spanish interpreter, Friar Vincente, read the \"[[Requerimiento]]\" that demanded that he and his empire accept the rule of King [[Charles I of Spain]] and convert to Christianity. Atahualpa dismissed the message and asked them to leave. After this, the Spanish began their [[Battle of Cajamarca|attack]] against the mostly unarmed Inca, captured Atahualpa as hostage, and forced the Inca to collaborate.\n\nAtahualpa offered the Spaniards enough gold to fill the [[The Ransom Room|room he was imprisoned in]] and twice that amount of silver. The Inca fulfilled this ransom, but Pizarro deceived them, refusing to release the Inca afterwards. During Atahualpa's imprisonment Hu\u00e1scar was assassinated elsewhere.

Meanwhile, an associate of Pizarro, [[Diego de Almagro]], attempted to claim Cusco. Manco tried to use this intra-Spanish feud to his advantage, recapturing Cusco in 1536, but the Spanish retook the city afterwards. Manco Inca then retreated to the mountains of [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] and established the small [[Neo-Inca State]], where he and his successors ruled for another 36 years, sometimes raiding the Spanish or inciting revolts against them. In 1572 the last Inca stronghold was conquered and the last ruler, [[T\u00fapac Amaru]], Manco's son, was captured and executed.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=31}} This ended resistance to the Spanish conquest under the political authority of the Inca state.\n\nAfter the fall of the Inca Empire many aspects of Inca culture were systematically destroyed, including their sophisticated farming system, known as the [[vertical archipelago]] model of agriculture.{{sfn|Sanderson|1992|p=76}} Spanish colonial officials used the Inca [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system for colonial aims, sometimes brutally.

Beginning in [[Colombia]], smallpox spread rapidly before the Spanish invaders first arrived in the empire. The spread was probably aided by the efficient Inca road system.

While Quechua had been spoken in the Andean region, including central Peru, for several centuries prior to the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]], the dialect of Quechua the Incas imposed was an adaptation from the Kingdom of Cusco (an early form of \"Southern Quechua\" originally named Qhapaq Runasimi, or 'the great language of the people'), or what some historians define as the Cusco dialect.<ref>[http://www.macalester.edu/linguistics/endangered/Quechua/Quechua.htm Quechua] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012083947/http://www.macalester.edu/linguistics/endangered/Quechua/Quechua.htm |date=12 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds/Quechua/QuechuaOriginsAndDiversity.htm|title=Origins And Diversity of Quechua|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe language imposed by the Incas diverted from its original phonetics as some societies formed their own regional varieties. The diversity of Quechua at that point and even today does not come directly from the Incas, who were just a part of the reason for Quechua's diversity. The civilizations within the empire that had previously spoken Quechua kept their own variety distinct from the Quechua the Incas spread. Although these dialects of Quechua had a similar linguistic structure, they differed according to the region in which they were spoken.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nAlthough many of the societies within the empire spoke or learned to speak Quechua, others continued to speak their original languages, such as [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which remains in use in contemporary Bolivia, where it is the primary indigenous language and in various regions surrounding Bolivia. The linguistic body of the Inca Empire was thus varied.

Most families did not invest very much into their child until they reached the age of two, or most of the times three years old. Once the child reached the age of three a \u2018coming of age\u2019 ceremony occurred. This ceremony was called the ''rutuchikuy'' ritual. For the Incas this ceremony indicated that the child had entered the stage of \u2018ignorance\u2019. During this ceremony the family would invite all relatives to their house for food and dance and then each member of the family would receive a lock of hair from the young child. After each family member had received a piece of the hair, the father would then shave the child\u2019s head. According to Covey, this stage of life was categorized by a stage of \u201cignorance, inexperience, and lack of reason, a condition that the child would overcome with time.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">Covey, R.

Unlike the previous ritual ceremony, the celebration of maturity was to signify the child's sexual potency. In the western world this ceremony would be known as a celebration of puberty, however for the Incas it was called ''warachikuy'' for boys and ''qikuchikuy'' for girls. The ''warachikuy'' ceremony included dancing, fasting, tasks to show their strength, and family ceremonies. The boy would also be given new clothes and taught how to act as an unmarried man. On the other hand, the girls ceremony ''qikuchikuy'' signified the onset of menstruation, therefore the girl would go into the forest alone and not return until the bleeding had ended. In the forest she would fast, and upon arrival the girl would be given a new name, adult clothing, and advice. This 'folly' stage of life was important because this was the time the young adults could have sex without having to be a parent.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBetween the ages 20-30 the young adults were \"ripe for serious thought and labor\".<ref name=\":1\" /> The young adults were able to hold on to their 'youthful status' during this age by living at home and helping out their home community. The young adults only reached their 'full potential' once they were married.\n\nIn the end, the male and female terms describe the individuals loss of sexual vitality and humanity. Specifically, the decrepitude stage signifies the loss of their mental well being and further physical dystrophy.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |Table  7.1 from R.

The four corners of these quarters met at the center, Cusco. These ''suyu'' were likely created around 1460 during the reign of Pachacuti before the empire reached its largest territorial extent. At the time the ''suyu'' were established they were roughly of equal size and only later changed their proportions as the empire expanded north and south along the Andes.<ref>Rowe in Steward, Ed., p. 262</ref>\n\nCusco was likely not organized as a ''wamani'', or province. Rather, it was probably somewhat akin to a modern [[federal district]], like Washington, D.C. or Mexico City. The city sat at the center of the four ''suyu'' and served as the preeminent center of politics and religion. While Cusco was essentially governed by the Sapa Inca, his relatives and the royal ''panaqa'' lineages, each ''suyu'' was governed by an ''Apu'', a term of esteem used for men of high status and for venerated mountains. Both Cusco as a district and the four ''suyu'' as administrative regions were grouped into upper ''hanan'' and lower ''hurin'' divisions. As the Inca did not have written records, it is impossible to exhaustively list the constituent ''wamani''. However, colonial records allow us to reconstruct a partial list.

Customs, expectations and traditional local power holders governed behavior. The state had legal force, such as through ''tokoyrikoq'' (lit. \"he who sees all\"), or inspectors. The highest such inspector, typically a blood relative to the Sapa Inca, acted independently of the conventional hierarchy, providing a point of view for the Sapa Inca free of bureaucratic influence.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Inca had three moral precepts that governed their behavior:\n\n* ''Ama sua'': Do not steal\n* ''Ama llulla'': Do not lie\n* ''Ama quella'': Do not be lazy\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Bernardo de Tagle Inti.svg|thumb|[[Inti]], as represented by [[Jos\u00e9 Bernardo de Tagle]] of Peru]]\n\nColonial sources are not entirely clear or in agreement about Inca government structure, such as exact duties and functions of government positions. But the basic structure can be broadly described. The top was the ''Sapa Inca''. Below that may have been the ''Willaq Umu'', literally the \"priest who recounts\", the High Priest of the Sun.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=99}} However, beneath the ''Sapa Inca'' also sat the ''Inkap rantin'', who was a confidant and assistant to the ''Sapa Inca'', perhaps similar to a Prime Minister.<ref>R. T. Zuidema, Hierarchy and Space in Incaic Social Organization. Ethnohistory, Vol. 30, No. 2. (Spring, 1983), pp. 97</ref> Starting with [[Topa Inca Yupanqui]], a \"Council of the Realm\" was composed of 16 nobles: 2 from ''hanan'' Cusco; 2 from ''hurin'' Cusco; 4 from Chinchaysuyu; 2 from Cuntisuyu; 4 from Collasuyu; and 2 from Antisuyu. This weighting of representation balanced the ''hanan'' and ''hurin'' divisions of the empire, both within Cusco and within the Quarters (''hanan suyukuna'' and ''hurin suyukuna'').{{sfn|Zuidema|1983|pp= 48}}\n\nWhile provincial [[bureaucracy]] and government varied greatly, the basic organization was decimal. Taxpayers \u2013 male heads of household of a certain age range \u2013 were organized into [[corv\u00e9e labor]] units (often doubling as military units) that formed the state's muscle as part of [[mit'a]] service. Each unit of more than 100 tax-payers were headed by a ''kuraka'', while smaller units were headed by a ''kamayuq'', a lower, non-hereditary status. However, while ''kuraka'' status was hereditary and typically served for life, the position of a ''kuraka'' in the hierarchy was subject to change based on the privileges of superiors in the hierarchy; a ''pachaka kuraka'' could be appointed to the position by a ''waranqa kuraka''. Furthermore, one ''kuraka'' in each decimal level could serve as the head of one of the nine groups at a lower level, so that a ''pachaka kuraka'' might also be a ''waranqa kuraka'', in effect directly responsible for one unit of 100 tax-payers and less directly responsible for nine other such units.{{sfn|Julien|1982|pp=121\u2013127}}{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=233\u2013234}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=114-115}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most notable example is [[Machu Picchu]], which was constructed by [[Inca engineers]]. The prime Inca structures were made of stone blocks that fit together so well that a knife could not be fitted through the stonework. These constructs have survived for centuries, with no use of mortar to sustain them.\n\nThis process was first used on a large scale by the [[Pukara|Pucara]] (ca. 300 BC\u2013AD 300) peoples to the south in [[Lake Titicaca]] and later in the city of [[Tiwanaku]] (ca. AD 400\u20131100) in present-day Bolivia. The rocks were sculpted to fit together exactly by repeatedly lowering a rock onto another and carving away any sections on the lower rock where the dust was compressed. The tight fit and the concavity on the lower rocks made them extraordinarily stable, despite the ongoing challenge of earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\n===Measures, calendrics and mathematics===\n[[File:Tupa-inca-tunic.png|thumb|Inca tunic]]\n[[File:All-tocapu-sin-BV.png|thumb|[[Tokapu]].

[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\n\nPhysical measures used by the Inca were based on human body parts. Units included fingers, the distance from thumb to forefinger, palms, [[cubit]]s and wingspans. The most basic distance unit was ''thatkiy'' or ''thatki'', or one pace. The next largest unit was reported by Cobo to be the ''topo'' or ''tupu'', measuring 6,000 ''thatkiy''s, or about {{convert|7.7|km|1|abbr=on}}; careful study has shown that a range of {{convert|4.0|to|6.3|km|1|abbr=on}} is likely. Next was the ''wamani'', composed of 30 ''topo''s (roughly {{convert|232|km||disp=or|abbr=on}}). To measure area, 25 by 50 wingspans were used, reckoned in ''topo''s (roughly {{convert|3,280|km2||disp=or|abbr=on}}). It seems likely that distance was often interpreted as one day's walk; the distance between ''tambo'' way-stations varies widely in terms of distance, but far less in terms of time to walk that distance.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=246\u2013247}}{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=179-180}}\n\nInca [[calendar]]s were strongly tied to [[astronomy]]. Inca astronomers understood [[equinox]]es, [[solstice]]s and [[zenith]] passages, along with the [[Transit of Venus|Venus cycle]]. They could not, however, predict [[eclipse]]s. The Inca calendar was essentially [[lunisolar]], as two calendars were maintained in parallel, one [[solar calendar|solar]] and one [[lunar calendar|lunar]]. As 12 lunar months fall 11 days short of a full 365-day solar year, those in charge of the calendar had to adjust every winter solstice. Each lunar month was marked with festivals and rituals.{{sfn|D'Altroy|2014|pp=150\u2013154}} Apparently, the days of the week were not named and days were not grouped into weeks. Similarly, months were not grouped into seasons. Time during a day was not measured in hours or minutes, but in terms of how far the sun had travelled or in how long it had taken to perform a task.{{sfn|McEwan|2008|p=185-187}}\n\nThe sophistication of Inca administration, calendrics and engineering required facility with numbers.

protocol]] in the [[Internet protocol suite]] for relaying [[datagram]]s across network boundaries. Its [[routing]] function enables [[internetworking]], and essentially establishes the [[Internet]].\n\nIP has the task of delivering [[Packet (information technology)|packets]] from the source [[Host (network)|host]] to the destination host solely based on the [[IP address]]es in the packet [[Header (computing)|headers]]. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that [[encapsulation (networking)|encapsulate]] the data to be delivered.  It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.\n\nHistorically, IP was the [[Connectionless communication|connectionless]] datagram service in the original Transmission Control Program introduced by [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]] in 1974; the other being the connection-oriented [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP). The Internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as TCP/IP.\n\nThe first major version of IP, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4), is the dominant protocol of the Internet. Its successor, [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] IPv6, has been growing in adoption for the last years, reaching almost 20% of the Internet traffic as of April, 2018.<ref name=\":0\">https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html</ref>\n\n==Function==\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|260px|Sample encapsulation of application data from [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] to a Link protocol frame]]\nThe Internet Protocol is responsible for addressing hosts, encapsulating data into datagrams (including [[IP fragmentation|fragmentation and reassembly]]) and routing datagrams from a source host to a destination host across one or more IP networks.'''<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPFunctions.htm |title=The TCP/IP Guide |author=Charles M. Kozierok}}</ref>''' For these purposes, the Internet Protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system.\n\nEach datagram has two components: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and a [[Payload (computing)|payload]].  The [[IP header]] includes source IP address, destination IP address, and other metadata needed to route and deliver the datagram.  The payload is the data that is transported.  This method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation.\n\nIP addressing entails the assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces.  The address space is divided into [[subnetwork]]s, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as [[Router (computing)|routers]], whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries.  Routers communicate with one another via specially designed [[routing protocol]]s, either [[interior gateway protocol]]s or [[exterior gateway protocol]]s, as needed for the topology of the network.\n\n==Version history==\nIn May 1974, the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers]] (IEEE) published a paper entitled \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\".<ref>Vinton G. Cerf, Robert E. Kahn, \"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\", IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. 22, No. 5, May 1974 pp. 637\u2013648</ref> The paper's authors, [[Vint Cerf]] and [[Bob Kahn]], described an [[internetworking]] protocol for sharing resources using [[packet switching]] among [[network node]]s. A central control component of this model was the \"Transmission Control Program\" that incorporated both connection-oriented links and datagram services between hosts. The monolithic Transmission Control Program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[User Datagram Protocol]] at the [[transport layer]] and the Internet Protocol at the [[network layer]]. The model became known as the ''Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Model'' and ''[[Internet protocol suite]]'', and informally as ''TCP/IP''.\n\nIP versions 0 to 3 were experimental versions, used between 1977 and 1979. The following [[Internet Experiment Note]] (IEN) documents describe versions of the Internet Protocol prior to the modern version of IPv4:\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien2.txt IEN 2] (''Comments on Internet Protocol and TCP''), dated August 1977 describes the need to separate the TCP and Internet Protocol functionalities (which were previously combined.)  It proposes the first version of the IP header, using 0 for the version field.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien26.pdf IEN 26] (''A Proposed New Internet Header Format''), dated February 1978 describes a version of the IP header that uses a 1-bit version field.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien28.pdf IEN 28] (''Draft Internetwork Protocol Description Version 2''), dated February 1978 describes IPv2.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien41.pdf IEN 41] (''Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4''), dated June 1978 describes the first protocol to be called IPv4.  The IP header is different from the modern IPv4 header.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien44.pdf IEN 44] (''Latest Header Formats''), dated June 1978 describes another version of IPv4, also with a header different from the modern IPv4 header.\n* [http://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien54.pdf IEN 54] (''Internetwork Protocol Specification Version 4''), dated September 1978 is the first description of IPv4 using the header that would be standardized in {{IETF RFC|760}}.\n\nThe dominant internetworking protocol in the [[Internet Layer]] in use today is [[IPv4]]; the number 4 is the protocol version number carried in every IP datagram. IPv4 is described in {{IETF RFC|791}} (1981).\n\nVersion 5 was used by the [[Internet Stream Protocol]], an experimental streaming protocol.\n\nThe successor to IPv4 is [[IPv6]]. IPv6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed, such as TP/IX ({{IETF RFC|1475}}), PIP ({{IETF RFC|1621}}) and TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses, {{IETF RFC|1347}}). Its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses. While IPv4 uses [[32-bit|32 bits]] for addressing, yielding c. 4.3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] ({{val|4.3|e=9}}) addresses, IPv6 uses [[128-bit]] addresses providing ca. 340 [[undecillion]], or {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. Although adoption of IPv6 has been slow, {{as of|June 2008|lc=on}}, all [[United States government]] systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for IPv6.<ref>[http://www.gcn.com/print/25_16/41051-1.html CIO council adds to IPv6 transition primer<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701130628/http://www.gcn.com/print/25_16/41051-1.html |date=2006-07-01 }}, gcn.com</ref>\n\nThe assignment of the new protocol as IPv6 was uncertain until due diligence revealed that IPv6 had not yet been used previously.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mulligan|first1=Geoff|title=It was almost IPv7|url=http://archive.oreilly.com/cs/user/view/cs_msg/25036|website=O'Reilly|publisher=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref><!-- TODO: also https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ullmann-ipv7-03 and/or others at ietf.org and elsewhere? --><ref name=\":0\" /> Other protocol proposals named ''IPv9'' and ''IPv8'' briefly surfaced, but had no affiliation with any international standards body, and have had no support.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/06/ipv9_hype_dismissed/|title = China disowns IPv9 hype|date = 6 July 2004|accessdate = 4 May 2014|publisher = [[The Register]]|last = Leyden|first = John|website = theregister.co.uk}}</ref> However, on April 1, 1994, the [[IETF]] published an [[April Fools' Day]] joke about IPv9.<ref>{{IETF RFC|1606}}: ''A Historical Perspective On The Usage Of IP Version 9''. April 1, 1994.</ref>\n\n==Reliability==\nThe design of the Internet protocol suite adheres to the [[end-to-end principle]], a concept adapted from the [[CYCLADES]] project. Under the end-to-end principle, the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of availability of links and nodes. No central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network. For the benefit of reducing [[network complexity]], the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the [[end node]]s.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, the Internet Protocol only provides [[best-effort delivery]] and its service is characterized as [[Reliability (computer networking)|unreliable]]. In network architectural language, it is a [[connectionless protocol]], in contrast to [[connection-oriented communication]]. Various error conditions may occur, such as [[data corruption]], [[packet loss]] and duplication. Because routing is dynamic, meaning every packet is treated independently, and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets, different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths, resulting in [[out-of-order delivery]] to the receiver.\n\nAll error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes. The [[upper layer protocol]]s of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues. For example, a host may [[Data buffer|buffer]] network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application.\n\nIPv4 provides safeguards to ensure that the IP packet header is error-free. A routing node calculates a [[checksum]] for a packet. If the checksum is bad, the routing node discards the packet. Although the [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] (ICMP) allows such notification, the routing node is not required to notify either end node of these errors. By contrast, in order to increase performance, and since current [[link layer]] technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection,<ref>{{IETF RFC|1726}} section 6.2</ref> the IPv6 header has no [[checksum]] to protect it.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2460}}</ref>\n\n==Link capacity and capability==\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of, or suitable for, performing the data transmission requested. One of the technical constraints is the size of data packets allowed on a given link.

Impeachment does not necessarily mean removal from office; it is only a formal statement of charges, akin to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]], and is thus only the first step towards removal. Once an individual is impeached, he or she must then face the possibility of conviction via legislative vote, which then entails the removal of the individual from office.\n\nBecause impeachment and conviction of officials involve an overturning of the normal constitutional procedures by which individuals achieve high office (election, ratification, or appointment) and because it generally requires a [[supermajority]], they are usually reserved for those deemed to have committed serious abuses of their office. In the [[United States]], for example, impeachment at the federal level is limited to those who may have committed \"[[high crimes and misdemeanors]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erskine|first=Daniel H.|date=2008|title=The Trial of Queen Caroline and the Impeachment of President Clinton: Law As a Weapon for Political Reform|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_globalstudies/vol7/iss1/2/|journal=Washington University Global Studies Law Review|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|issn=1546-6981}}</ref>\n\nImpeachment has its origins in [[English law]] but fell out of use in the 18th century. It exists under constitutional law in many states around the world, including [[Brazil]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"impeachment\" derives from Old French ''empeechier'' from Latin ''impedicare'' expressing the idea of becoming caught or entrapped, and has analogues in the modern [[French Language|French]] verb ''emp\u00eacher'' (to prevent) and the modern [[English Language|English]] ''impede''. Medieval popular etymology also associated it (wrongly) with derivations from the Latin ''impetere'' (to attack). (In its more frequent and more technical usage, [[Witness impeachment|impeachment]] of a [[witness]] means challenging the honesty or credibility of that person.)\n\nImpeachment was first used in the British political system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Specifically, the process was first used by the English \"[[Good Parliament]]\" against [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer|Baron Latimer]] in the second half of the 14th century. Following the British example, the constitutions of Virginia (1776), Massachusetts (1780) and other states thereafter adopted the impeachment mechanism, but they restricted the punishment to removal of the official from office. As well, in private organizations, a [[motion to impeach]] can be used to prefer charges.<ref>{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=265|edition=1969|year=1969}}</ref>\n\n==In various jurisdictions==\n\n===Austria===\nThe [[President of Austria|Austrian Federal President]] can be impeached by the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] (''Bundesversammlung'') before the Constitutional Court. The constitution also provides for the recall of the president by a [[referendum]]. Neither of these courses has ever been taken. This is likely because while the President is vested with considerable powers on paper, they act as a largely ceremonial figurehead in practice, and are thus hardly in a position to abuse their powers.\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Seealso|Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|Impeachment proposals against Michel Temer}}\nThe [[President of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], state governors and municipal mayors may be impeached by the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] and tried and removed by the [[Federal Senate]]. Upon conviction, the officeholder has his political rights revoked for eight years--which has the effect of barring him from running for any office.\n\n[[Fernando Collor de Mello]], the 32nd President of Brazil, resigned in 1992 amidst impeachment proceedings. Despite his resignation, the Senate nonetheless voted to convict him and bar him from holding any office for eight years, due to evidence of [[bribery]] and misappropriation.\n\nIn 2016, the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] initiated [[Impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff|an impeachment case]] against President [[Dilma Rousseff]] on allegations of budgetary mismanagement.<ref>{{cite news |author=Andrew Jacobs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/world/americas/brazil-dilma-rousseff-impeachment-vote.html |title=Brazil's Lower House of Congress Votes for Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 17, 2016 |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}</ref> Following her conviction, she was replaced by Vice President [[Michel Temer]], who had served as [[Acting (law)|acting]] president while Rousseff's case was pending.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36273916 |title=Brazil's Dilma Rousseff to face impeachment trial |date=May 12, 2016 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-11-13}}</ref>\n\n===Bulgaria===\nThe [[President of Bulgaria]] can be removed only for [[high treason]] or violation of the constitution. The process is started by a two-thirds majority vote of the [[Parliament of Bulgaria|Parliament]] to impeach the President, whereupon the Constitutional Court decides whether the President is guilty of the crime of which he is charged. If he is found guilty, he is removed from power. No Bulgarian President has ever been impeached. The same procedure can be used to remove the [[Vice President of Bulgaria]], which has also never happened.\n\n===Croatia===\nThe process of impeaching the [[President of Croatia]] can be initiated by a two-thirds majority vote in favor in the [[Sabor]] and is thereafter referred to the [[Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], which must accept such a proposal with a two-thirds majority vote in favor in order for the president to be removed from office. This has, however, never occurred in the history of the Republic of [[Croatia]]. However, in case of a successful impeachment motion a president's constitutional term of five years would be terminated and an election called within 60 days of the vacancy occurring. During the period of vacancy the presidential powers and duties would be carried out by the [[Speaker of the Croatian Parliament]] in his/her capacity as Acting President of the Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabor.hr/fgs.axd?id=17074|title=Constitution of Croatia|at=\u00a7 105|format=PDF|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\nThe [[President of the Czech Republic]] could be impeached only for an act of high [[treason]] (which is not defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] itself). The process has to start in the [[Senate of the Czech Republic]] which only has the right to impeach the president, this passes the case to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic]] which has to decide whether the President is guilty or not. If the Court decides that the President is guilty then the President loses his office and the ability to be elected President of the Czech Republic ever again.<ref>[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html \u00dastava \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky].

Once the Bundestag or the Bundesrat impeaches the president, the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decides whether the President is guilty as charged and, if this is the case, whether to remove him or her from office. The Federal Constitutional Court also has the power to remove federal judges from office for willfully violating core principles of the [[Grundgesetz|federal constitution]] or a [[states of Germany|state]] constitution. The impeachment procedure is regulated in Article 61 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]].\n\n===Hong Kong===\nThe [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] can be impeached by the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]]. A motion for investigation, initiated jointly by at least one-fourth of all the legislators charging the Chief Executive with \"serious breach of law or dereliction of duty\" and refusing to resign, shall first be passed by the Council. An independent investigation committee, chaired by the [[Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal]], will then carry out the investigation and report back to the Council. If the Council find the evidence sufficient to substantiate the charges, it may pass a motion of impeachment by a two-thirds majority.<ref name=HKSAR>{{cite web |url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_4.html |title=Basic Law of Hong Kong |website=basiclaw.gov.hk |publisher=Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government |date= |accessdate=November 13, 2016}}</ref>{{rp|Article 73(9)}}\n\nHowever, the Legislative Council does not have the power actually to remove the Chief Executive from office, as the Chief Executive is appointed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|Central People's Government]].

Other than impeachment, no other penalty can be given to a president in position for the violation of the Constitution under [[s:Constitution of India/Part XIX|Article 361]] of the constitution. However a president after his term/removal can be punished for his already proven unlawful activity under [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971|disrespecting constitution]], etc<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prevention of Insults to National Honour (Amendment) Act of 1971|url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/pdf/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|accessdate=2 July 2017}}</ref> No president has faced impeachment proceedings. Hence, the provisions for impeachment have never been tested. The president in position cannot be charged and needs to step down in order for that to happen.\n\n===Iran===\nThe [[Assembly of Experts]] can impeach the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and appoint a new one, although the Supreme Leader elects half the Assembly.\n\nThe [[President of Iran]] can be impeached jointly by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly (Majlis)]] and the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. A new presidential election is then triggered. [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], Iran's first president, was impeached in June 1981 and removed from the office. [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]] was elected as the new president.\n\nCabinet ministers can be impeached by the members of the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly of Iran|Assembly]]. Presidential appointment of a new minister is subject to a parliamentary [[vote of confidence]]. Impeachment of ministers has been a fairly commonly used tactic in the power struggle between the president and the assembly during the last several governments.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{anchor|Ireland}}{{anchor|Republic of Ireland}}In the [[Republic of Ireland]] formal impeachment only applies to the [[President of Ireland|Irish president]]. Article 12 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish Constitution]] provides that, unless judged to be \"permanently incapacitated\" by the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], the president can only be removed from office by the houses of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament) and only for the commission of \"stated misbehaviour\". Either house of the Oireachtas may impeach the president, but only by a resolution approved by a majority of at least two-thirds of its total number of members; and a house may not consider a proposal for impeachment unless requested to do so by at least thirty of its number.\n\nWhere one house impeaches the president, the remaining house either investigates the charge or commissions another body or committee to do so. The investigating house can remove the president if it decides, by at least a two-thirds majority of its members, both that the president is guilty of the charge, and that the charge is sufficiently serious as to warrant the president's removal. To date no impeachment of an Irish president has ever taken place. The president holds a largely ceremonial office, the dignity of which is considered important, so it is likely that a president would resign from office long before undergoing formal conviction or impeachment.\n\nThe Republic's Constitution and law also provide that only a joint resolution of both houses of the Oireachtas may remove a judge. Although often referred to as the \"impeachment\" of a judge, this procedure does not technically involve impeachment.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004843561|title=LOCK HIM UP : impeachments in the united states.|last=DON.|first=RILEY,|date=2017|publisher=LULU COM|isbn=9781365960857|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1004843561}}</ref>\n\n===Italy===\nIn Italy, according to Article 90 of the Constitution, the President of the Republic can be impeached through a majority vote of the Parliament in joint session for high treason and for attempting to overthrow the Constitution.

The procedural rules were modeled after the US rules and are quite similar to them. Impeachment has been used eight times since 1814, last in 1927. Many argue that impeachment has fallen into [[desuetude]]. In cases of impeachment, an appointed court (Riksrett) takes effect.\n\n===Pakistan===\nThe country's ruling coalition said on August 7, 2008, that it would seek the impeachment of [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]], alleging the U.S.-backed former general had \"eroded the trust of the nation\" and increasing pressure on him to resign. He resigned on August 18, 2008. Another kind of impeachment in Pakistan is known as the vote of less-confidence or vote of mis-understanding and has been practiced by provincial assemblies to weaken the national assembly.\n\nImpeaching a president requires a two-thirds majority support of lawmakers in a joint session of both houses of Parliament.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{main|Impeachment in the Philippines}}\nImpeachment in the Philippines follows procedures similar to the [[United States]]. Under Sections 2 and 3, Article XI, [[Constitution of the Philippines]], the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]] has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions ([[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], [[Civil Service Commission (Philippines)|Civil Service Commission]] and the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit]]), and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|Ombudsman]]. When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.<ref name=\"Article XI\">{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines - Article XI|accessdate= 2008-07-25|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}</ref>\n\nA main difference from US proceedings however is that only one third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the President (as opposed to a simple majority of those present and voting in their US counterpart). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the Senators act as judges with the Senate President presiding over the proceedings (the Chief Justice jointly presides with the Senate President if the President is on trial). Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two thirds (i.e. 16 of 24 members) of all the Members of the Senate vote in favor of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n====Impeachable offenses and officials====\nThe 1987 Philippine Constitution says the grounds for impeachment include culpable violation of the Constitution, bribery, [[Graft_(politics)|graft]] and corruption, and betrayal of public trust. These offenses are considered \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" under the Philippine Constitution.\n\nThe President, Vice President, Supreme Court justices, and members of the Constitutional Commission and Ombudsman are all considered impeachable officials under the Constitution.\n\n====Impeachment proceedings and attempts====\nPresident [[Joseph Estrada]] was the first official [[Trial of Joseph Estrada|impeached]] by the House in 2000, but the trial ended prematurely due to outrage over a vote to open an envelope where that motion was narrowly defeated by his allies. Estrada was deposed days later during the [[2001 EDSA Revolution]].\n\nIn 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008, impeachment complaints were filed against President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], but none of the cases reached the required endorsement of 1/3 of the members for transmittal to, and trial by, the Senate.\n\nIn March 2011, the House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Merceditas Gutierrez|impeached]] [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Ombudsman]] [[Merceditas Gutierrez]], becoming the second person to be impeached. In April, Gutierrez resigned prior to the Senate's convening as an impeachment court.\n\nIn December 2011, in what was described as \"blitzkrieg fashion\", 188 of the 285 members of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] [[Impeachment of Renato Corona|voted]] to transmit the 56-page [[Articles of Impeachment against Chief Justice Renato Corona|Articles of Impeachment]] against [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Renato Corona]].\n\nTo date, three officials had been successfully impeached by the House of Representatives, and two were not convicted. The latter, [[Renato Corona|Chief Justice Renato C. Corona]], on May 29, 2012 has been convicted by the Senate guilty under Article II of the Articles of Impeachment (of betraying public trust), with 20-3 votes from the Senator Judges.\n\n===Peru===\n[[File:Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, ao lado de seus vice-presidentes, discursa sobre seu processo de impeachment.png|thumb|Peru's President [[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] speaks about the impeachment process against him.]]\n{{Seealso|First impeachment process against Pedro Pablo Kuczynski}}\n\n===Poland===\nIn Polish law there is no impeachment procedure defined, as it is present in the other countries. Infringements of the law can be investigated only by special Parliament's Committee or (if accusations involve people holding the highest offices of state) by the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]]. The State Tribunal is empowered to rule for the removal of individuals from public office but it is not a common practice.\n\n===Romania===\nThe [[President of Romania|President]] can be impeached by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and is then suspended. A referendum then follows to determine whether the suspended President should be removed from office. President [[Traian B\u0103sescu]] was impeached twice by the Parliament: in 2007 and more recently in July 2012. [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2007|A referendum was held]] on May 19, 2007 and a large majority of the electorate voted against removing the president from office. For the most recent suspension [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|a referendum was held]] on July 29, 2012, but was invalidated due to low turnout, however the results were heavily against the president (<ref>[[:ro:Referendumul pentru demiterea pre\u0219edintelui Rom\u00e2niei, 2012]]</ref>{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=October 2017}})\n\n===Russia===\nThe [[President of Russia]] can be impeached if both the [[State Duma]] (which initiates the impeachment process through the formation of a special investigation committee) and the [[Federation Council of Russia]] vote by a two-thirds majority in favor of impeachment and, additionally, the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation|Supreme Court]] finds the President guilty of [[treason]] or a similarly heavy crime against the nation and the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation|Constitutional Court]] confirms that the constitutional procedure of the impeachment process was correctly observed. In 1995&ndash;1999, the Duma made several attempts to impeach then-President [[Boris Yeltsin]], but they never had a sufficient number of votes for the process to reach the Federation Council.\n\n===South Korea (Republic of Korea)===\n{{Also|Impeachment of Park Geun-hye}}\nAccording to the Article 65 Clause 1 of [[Constitution of South Korea]], if President, Prime Minister, or other state council members including Supreme Court and Constitutional court members, violate the Constitution or other laws of official duty, the National Assembly can impeach them. Clause 2 states the impeachment bill may be proposed by one third or more of the total members of the National Assembly, and shall require majority voting and approved by two thirds or more of the total members of the National Assembly. This article also states that any person against whom a motion for impeachment has been passed shall be suspended from exercising his power until the impeachment has been adjudicated and shall not extend further than removal from public office. Provided, That it shall not exempt the person impeached from civil or criminal liability.\n\nTwo presidents have been impeached since the foundation of the Sixth Republic of Korea and adoption of the new [[Constitution of South Korea]] in 1987. [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in 2004 was impeached by the National Assembly but was overturned by the Constitutional Court. [[Park Geun-hye]] in 2016 was impeached by the National Assembly, and the impeachment was confirmed by the Constitutional Court on March 10, 2017.\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn [[Taiwan]], according to the [[Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]], impeachment of the president or the vice president by the [[Legislative Yuan]] shall be initiated upon the proposal of more than one-half of the total members of the Legislative Yuan and passed by more than two-thirds of the total members of the Legislative Yuan, whereupon it shall be presented to the grand justices of the [[Judicial Yuan]] for adjudication.\n\n===Ukraine===\nDuring the crisis which started in November 2013, the increasing political stress of the face-down between the protestors occupying Independence Square in Kiev and the State Security forces under the control of [[President Yanukovych]] led to deadly armed force being used on the protestors. Following the negotiated return of Kiev's City Hall on February 16, 2014, occupied by the protesters since November 2013, the security forces thought they could also retake \"Maidan\", Independence Square. The ensuing fighting on 17th through 21st of February 2014 resulted in a considerable number of deaths and a more generalised alienation of the population, and the withdrawal of President Yanukovych to his support area in the East of Ukraine.\n \nIn the wake of the President's departure, Parliament convened on February 22; it reinstated the 2004 Constitution, which reduced Presidential authority, and voted impeachment of President Yanukovych as ''[[de facto]]'' recognition of his departure from office as President of an integrated Ukraine. The President riposted that Parliament's acts were illegal as they could pass into law only by Presidential signature.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], at least in theory, all persons, whether peers or commoners, may be prosecuted and tried by the two Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] for any crimes whatsoever.<ref name=UK0001 >{{cite web|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN02666|title=Standard Note SN/PC/2666: Impeachment|format=PDF|last=Gay|first=Oonagh|date=November 30, 2004|publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Library|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> The first recorded impeachment is that of [[William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer]] during the [[Good Parliament]] of 1376. The last was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] in 1806.<ref name=UK0001 />\n\n====Procedure====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], it is the [[House of Commons]] that holds the power of initiating an impeachment. Any member may make accusations of any crime. The member must support the charges with evidence and [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|move]] for impeachment. If the Commons carries the motion, the mover receives orders to go to the bar at the [[House of Lords]] and to impeach the accused \"in the name of the House of Commons, and all the commons of the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe mover must tell the Lords that the House of Commons will, in due time, exhibit particular articles against the accused, and make good the same. The Commons then usually selects a committee to draw up the charges and create an \"Article of Impeachment\" for each. (In the case of [[Warren Hastings]], however, the drawing up of the articles preceded the formal impeachment.) Once the committee has delivered the articles to the Lords, replies go between the accused and the Commons via the Lords. If the Commons have impeached a peer, the Lords take custody of the accused; otherwise, custody goes to [[Black Rod#Black Rod in the United Kingdom|Black Rod]]. The accused remains in custody unless the Lords allow bail. The Lords set a date for the trial while the Commons appoints managers, who act as prosecutors in the trial. The accused may defend by counsel.\n\nThe House of Lords hears the case. The procedure used to be that the [[Lord Chancellor]] presided (or the [[Lord High Steward]] if the defendant was a [[peerage|peer]]); but this was when the Lord Chancellor was both the Lords' presiding officer and head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Since both these roles were removed from that office by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], which created the [[Lord Speaker]] to preside over the Lords and made the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] head of the judiciary, it is not certain who would preside over an impeachment trial today. If Parliament is not in session, then the trial is conducted by a \"Court of the Lord High Steward\" instead of the House of Lords (even if the defendant is not a peer). The differences between this court and the House of Lords are that in the House all of the peers are judges of both law and fact, whereas in the Court the Lord High Steward is the sole judge of law and the peers decide the facts only; and the bishops are not entitled to sit and vote in the Court.<ref>[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-419.htm ''Commentaries on the Laws of England,] [[William Blackstone]], vol. 4 chapter 19 (1769)</ref> Traditionally, peers would wear their parliamentary robes during the hearings. \n\nThe hearing resembles an ordinary trial: both sides may call witnesses and present evidence. At the end of the hearing the lords vote on the verdict, which is decided by a simple majority, one charge at a time. Upon being called, a peer must rise and declare \"guilty, upon my honour\" or \"not guilty, upon my honour\". After voting on all of the articles has taken place, and if the Lords find the defendant guilty, the Commons may move for judgment; the Lords may not declare the punishment until the Commons have so moved. The Lords may then decide whatever punishment they find fit, within the law. A royal [[pardon]] cannot excuse the defendant from trial, but a pardon may reprieve a convicted defendant. However, a pardon cannot override a decision to remove the defendant from the public office they hold.\n\n====History====\n\nParliament has held the power of impeachment since medieval times. Originally, the House of Lords held that impeachment could only apply to members of the [[peerage]], as the nobility (the Lords) would try their own peers, while commoners ought to try their peers (other commoners) in a [[jury]]. However, in 1681, the Commons declared that they had the right to impeach whomsoever they pleased, and the Lords have respected this resolution. Offices held \"during good behaviour\" are terminable by the writ of either ''[[quo warranto]]''<ref>eg. [[R v Richardson]]</ref> or ''[[scire facias]]'', which has even been employed by and against well-placed judges.<ref>Raoul Berger, ''Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems'' p. 132 (1974, Harvard University Press)</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], impeachment fell into disuse, the [[bill of attainder]] becoming the preferred form of dealing with undesirable subjects of the Crown. However, during the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] and thereafter, impeachments became more popular, as they did not require the assent of the Crown, while bills of attainder did, thus allowing Parliament to resist royal attempts to dominate Parliament. The most recent cases of impeachment dealt with [[Warren Hastings]], [[Governor-General of India]] between 1773 and 1786 ([[Impeachment of Warren Hastings|impeached in 1788]]; the Lords found him not guilty in 1795), and [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], in 1806 (acquitted). The last attempted impeachment occurred in 1848, when [[David Urquhart]] accused [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] of having signed a secret treaty with [[Imperial Russia]] and of receiving monies from the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar]]. Palmerston survived the vote in the Commons; the Lords did not hear the case.\n\n=====Queen Caroline=====\n{{main|Pains and Penalties Bill 1820}}\n[[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]], consort of [[George IV of Great Britain|King George IV]], was tried by the House of Commons and acquitted. This began as impeachment proceedings, but then became a different procedure as a [[bill of attainder|bill of pains and penalties]].\n\n====Modern politics====\nThe procedure has, over time, become rarely used and some legal authorities (such as [[Halsbury's Laws of England]]) consider it to be probably obsolete. The principles of \"responsible government\" require that the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and other executive officers answer to Parliament, rather than to the Sovereign. Thus the Commons can remove such an officer through a [[motion of no confidence]] without a long, drawn-out impeachment. However, it is argued by some that the remedy of impeachment remains as part of British constitutional law, and that legislation would be required to abolish it. Furthermore, impeachment as a means of punishment for wrongdoing, as distinct from being a means of removing a minister, remains a valid reason for accepting that it continues to be available, at least in theory.\n\nThe Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1967 recommended \"that the right to impeach, which has long been in disuse, be now formally abandoned\".<ref>\"Report from the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege\", HC 34 1967-68 para 115.</ref> Their recommendation not having been implemented in the meantime, the Select Committee on Privileges in 1977 declared it \"to be of continuing validity\" and again urged that it be adopted.<ref>\"Third report from the Committee of Privileges: Recommendations of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege\", HC 417 1976-77 para 16.</ref> Shortly before this report was issued, in April 1977 the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]]' annual conference unanimously passed a motion calling on [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Steel]] to move for the impeachment of [[Ronald King Murray, Lord Murray|Ronald King Murray]] QC, the [[Lord Advocate]], over his handling of the [[Patrick Meehan]] miscarriage of justice affair.<ref>{{cite news |title=Liberals confident of victory on petrol duty |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=April 11, 1977 |page=2}}</ref> Steel did not move any such motion but Murray (now Lord Murray, a former [[List of Senators of the College of Justice|Senator of the College of Justice]] of Scotland) agreed that the power still existed.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1999 noted the previous recommendations to formally abandon the power impeachment, and stated that \"The circumstances in which impeachment has taken place are now so remote from the present that the procedure may be considered obsolete\".<ref>\"Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege report\", HC 214 1998-99, para 16.</ref> Notwithstanding, on August 25, 2004, [[Plaid Cymru]] MP [[Adam Price]] announced his [[Impeach Blair campaign|intention to move for the impeachment]] of [[Tony Blair]] for his role in involving Britain in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He asked the [[Leader of the House of Commons]] [[Peter Hain]] whether he would confirm that the power to impeach was still available, reminding Hain that as President of the Young Liberals he had supported the attempted impeachment of Murray. Hain responded by quoting the 1999 Joint Committee's report, and the advice of the Clerk of the House of Commons that impeachment \"effectively died with the advent of full responsible Parliamentary government\".<ref>''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040909/debtext/40909-08.htm#40909-08_spnew15 Hansard]'' HC 6ser vol 424 col 871.</ref>\n\nThe [[election court]] has some of the powers associated with impeachment cases in other countries, and can remove elected officials from office in the case of [[electoral fraud]]. [[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Lutfur Rahman]] was the [[directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets]], in London until he was removed from office for breaching electoral rules.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tower Hamlets election fraud mayor Lutfur Rahman removed from office|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-32428648|date=April 23, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Impeachment in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Senate in session.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The impeachment trial of President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999, Chief Justice [[William H.

(Various [[U.S. state|state]] constitutions include similar measures, allowing the state legislature to impeach the governor or other officials of the state government.) In contrast to the British system, in the United States impeachment is only the first of two stages, and conviction during the second stage requires \"the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Constitution. Article I, \u00a7 3, clause 6|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3}}</ref> Impeachment does not necessarily result in removal from office; it is only a legal statement of charges, parallel to an [[indictment]] in [[criminal law]]. An official who is impeached faces a second legislative vote (whether by the same body or another), which determines conviction, or failure to convict, on the charges embodied by the impeachment. Most constitutions require a [[supermajority]] to convict. Although the subject of the charge is criminal action, it does not constitute a criminal trial; the only question under consideration is the removal of the individual from office, and the possibility of a subsequent vote preventing the removed official from ever again holding political office in the jurisdiction where he or she was removed. Impeachment with respect to political office should not be confused with [[witness impeachment]].\n\n====Impeachable offenses====\nThe Constitution defines impeachment at the federal level and limits impeachment to \"The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States\" who may be impeached and removed only for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".<ref name=\"law.cornell.edu\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html#section4 U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 4]</ref> Several commentators have suggested that [[United States Congress|Congress]] alone may decide for itself what constitutes a \"high crime or misdemeanor\", especially since ''[[Nixon v.

The House has not impeached a Member of Congress since Blount. As each House has the authority to expel its own members without involving the other chamber, expulsion has been the method used for removing Members of Congress.\n\n[[Jefferson's Manual]], which is integral to the Rules of the House of Representatives,<ref>House Rules {{cite web|url=http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 31, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212085230/http://www.rules.house.gov/house_rules_precedents.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2010 }}</ref> states that impeachment is set in motion by charges made on the floor, charges proferred by a memorial, a member's resolution referred to a committee, a message from the president, or from facts developed and reported by an investigating committee of the House. It further states that a proposition to impeach is a question of high privilege in the House and at once supersedes business otherwise in order under the rules governing the order of business.\n\n====Process====\nAt the federal level, the impeachment process is a two-step procedure. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] must first pass, by a simple majority of those present and voting, articles of impeachment, which constitute the formal allegation or allegations. Upon passage, the defendant has been \"impeached\". Next, the [[United States Senate|Senate]] tries the accused. In the case of the impeachment of a president, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] presides over the proceedings. For the impeachment of any other official, the Constitution is silent on who shall preside, suggesting that this role falls to the Senate's usual presiding officer, the President of the Senate who is also the [[Vice President of the United States]]. \n\nIn theory at least, as President of the Senate, the [[Vice President of the United States]] could preside over their own impeachment, although legal theories suggest that allowing a defendant to be the judge in their own case would be a blatant [[conflict of interest]]. If the Vice President did not preside over an impeachment (of anyone besides the President), the duties would fall to the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]].\n\nTo convict an accused, \"the concurrence of two thirds of the members present\" is required.<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Constitution. Article I, \u00a7 3, clause 6|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section3}}</ref> Conviction removes the defendant from office. Following conviction, the Senate may vote to further punish the individual by barring him or her from holding future federal office, elected or appointed. Conviction by the Senate does not bar criminal prosecution. Even after an accused has left office, it is possible to disqualify the person from future office or from certain emoluments of his prior office (such as a pension). If there is no charge for which a [[two-thirds majority]] of the senators present vote \"guilty\", the defendant is acquitted and no punishment is imposed.\n\n====History of federal impeachment proceedings in the United States====\nCongress regards impeachment as a power to be used only in extreme cases; the [[House of Representatives]] has initiated impeachment proceedings only 64 times since 1789 (most recently the 2010 impeachment, then removal from office, of Judge [[Thomas Porteous]] of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana]]) with only the following 19 of these proceedings actually resulting in the House's passing Articles of Impeachment:\n\n* Two presidents:\n** [[Andrew Johnson]], Democrat/National Union, was [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeached]] on  February 24, 1868, by the House of Representatives after violating the newly created [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] by a  126 to 47 vote. President Johnson was acquitted by the Senate, which voted 35\u201319 in favor of conviction, falling one vote short of the necessary two-thirds needed to remove him from office. The Tenure of Office Act would later be found unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in [[obiter dictum|dicta]].\n** [[Bill Clinton]], Democrat, was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives on articles charging [[perjury]] (specifically, lying to a federal [[grand jury]]) by a 228\u2013206 vote and [[obstruction of justice]] by a 221\u2013212 vote. The House rejected other articles: one was a count of [[perjury]] in a civil deposition in [[Paula Jones]]' [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit against Clinton (by a 205\u2013229 vote), the second accused Clinton of [[abuse of power]] (by a 148\u2013285 vote). President Clinton was acquitted by the Senate. The votes to remove him from office fell short of the necessary two-thirds: 45\u201355 on obstruction of justice and 50\u201350 on perjury.\n* [[Impeachment process against Richard Nixon|Impeachment proceedings]] against [[Richard Nixon]] were referred to the full House of Representatives for consideration and ended with his resignation.\n* In 1876, [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] officer [[William W.

Article Begins Here -->\n\nThe '''Ibizan Hound''' ({{lang-ca|ca eivissenc}}, {{lang-es|podenco ibicenco}}) is a lean, agile [[dog]] of the [[hound]] family. There are two hair types of the [[dog breed|breed]]: smooth and wire. The more commonly seen type is the smooth. Some consider there to be a third type, long, but the longhair is most likely a variation of the wire.\n\n== Description ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:6 month old ibizan hounds.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Two 6 months old Ibizan hounds]]\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Ibizan Hound is an elegant and agile breed, with an athletic and attractive outline and a ground-covering springy trot. Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. Its large upright ears - a hallmark of the breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm. Coming in both smooth and wire-coated varieties, their coat is a combination of red and white with the nose, ears, eye rims, and pads of feet being a light tan color. Its eyes are a striking [[amber (color)|amber]] color and have an alert and intelligent expression. The Ibizan may range in height, depending on which Standard you follow, from {{convert|22|to|29|in|cm}} and weigh from {{convert|45|to|65|lb|kg}}, males being larger than females. The Ibizan Hound coat can also range from smooth to Wire. wire coats are to be hard and can range from 1-3 inches in length. \n\n===Temperament===\nIbizan Hounds are intelligent, active, and engaging by nature. They rank 53rd in [[Stanley Coren]]'s [[The Intelligence of Dogs]], being of average working/obedience intelligence, but many Ibizan owners will enjoy recounting a multitude of examples of their problem-solving abilities. They are true \"clowns\" of the dog world, delighting in entertaining their people with their antics. Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet, but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike. They generally make good house dogs, but are active and athletic, therefore need a lot of daily exercise. They do not make good kennel dogs. Ibizan hounds are sweet, but they are very stubborn and independent.\n\nIbizan Hounds are \"escapologists\": they are able to jump incredible heights from a standstill, so they need very tall fences. They also have been known to climb, and many can escape from crates, open baby gates and even locks. They have a strong [[prey drive]], therefore they cannot be trusted off leash unless in a safely enclosed area. Once off the leash, they might not come back for a long time. A hound that knows where its home is and the surrounding area will usually return unscathed.\n\n==Health==\nThe Ibizan Hound is typical of the [[Hound Group]] in that it rarely suffers from [[hereditary]] illness. Minor health concerns for the breed include [[seizure]]s and [[Allergy|allergies]]; very rarely, one will see [[axonal dystrophy]], [[cataract]], [[retinal dysplasia]] and [[deafness]] in the breed. Ibizan Hound owners should have their dogs' eyes tested by a [[veterinarian]] before breeding. CERF and [[BAER]] testing is recommended for the breed.  Ibizan Hounds are sensitive to [[barbiturate]] [[anesthesia]], and typically live between 12 and 14 years.<ref>Coile, Caroline, Ph.D., ''Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds'', Barron's Educational Series, 2005. Page 80.</ref>\n\n==History and use ==\n[[File:Femelle Podenco Ibicenco.jpg|thumb|Female Ibizan Hound]]\nThis breed originates in the island of [[Eivissa]] and has been traditionally used in the [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking areas of Spain, and [[France]] where it was known under the name of ''le charnigue'', to hunt [[rabbit]]s and other small game. The Ibizan Hound is a fast dog that can hunt on all types of terrain, working by scent, sound and sight. Hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs, with perhaps a male or two, as the female is considered the better hunter.\n\nTraditionally a farmer may have one dog and a very well off farmer two dogs to catch rabbits for food. However in the last twenty years it is seen as a sport where between five and fifteen dogs can be seen in the chase of one rabbit.\n\nThe Ibizan Hound authority Miquel Rossell\u00f3 has provided a detailed description of a working trial which characterises their typical hunting technique and action,<ref>''C\u00e0 Eivessenc: l\u2019Alternativa/Podenco Ibicenco: La Alternativa''. Palma de Mallorca: Caixa de Balears ''Sa Nostra'' 1987</ref> strikingly illustrated with action photos by [[Charles Camberoque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camberoque.net/site/page.php3?serie=Podencos+Ibizencos&debut=1|title=Charles Camberoque|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> which demonstrate hunt behaviour and typical hunt terrain. \nWhile local hunters will at times use one dog or a [[Brace (hunting)|brace]], and frequently packs of six to eight or as many as fifteen, the working trial requires an evaluation of one or two braces. A brace is called a ''colla''. The couples should be tested on at least two to five rabbits (not hares), without the use of any other hunting aid. An inspection and evaluation of the exterior, fitness, character and obedience of the dogs is recommended prior to the hunt. \nThe trial is qualified as having 5 parts. The dogs should show: (1) careful tracking and scenting of the rabbit, without being distracted in the least, 0-30 points; (2) correct signalling of the game, patient stand, strong jump into the air, obedience 0-10 points; (3) chase, giving tongue, speed, sureness, anticipation 0-30 points; (4) putting the game to cover at close quarters, listening, waiting, obedience, correct attack 0-10 point; and (5) good catch, or correct indication of the game\u2019s location, retrieval, obedience 0-20 points.\n\nIndividual dogs are expected to show a great degree of discipline, obedience and co-operation. They should be extremely agile, have good speed and a powerful vertical jump from a stationary position in rough and often heavily covered ground. They should have excellent scent-tracking abilities, give tongue at the right time when approaching the game closely, and otherwise be silent so that they can locate the game by sound.\n\nThe Ibizan Hound is similar in function and type to several breeds, such as the [[Pharaoh Hound]], the [[Cirneco dell'Etna]], the [[Portuguese Podengo]], and the [[Podenco Canario]]. The Ibizan Hound is the largest of these breeds, classified by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]] as primitive types.\n\nThis breed is considered by most experts one of the most ancient dog breeds. It is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the ''tesem'', the [[ancient Egypt]]ian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the [[Phoenicians]], who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eivissaweb.com/reports/archaeological-sites/phoenician-settlement-of-sa-caleta/|title=Phoenician settlement of sa Caleta|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> A recent [[DNA analysis]]<ref name=genstruct>{{cite journal\n | last = Parker\n | first = H.G.\n |author2=Kim, L.V. |author3=Sutter, N.B. |author4=Carlson, S. |author5=Lorentzen, T.D. |author6=Malek, T.B. |author7=Johnson, G.S. |author8=DeFrance, H.B. |author9=Ostrander, E.A. |author10= Kruglyak, L. \n | date = 2004-05-21\n | title = Genetic structure of the purebred domestic dog\n | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n | volume = 304\n | issue = 5674\n | pmid = 15155949\n | doi = 10.1126/science.1097406\n | url = http://www.britainhill.com/GeneticStructure.pdf\n | pages = 1160\u20134\n }}</ref> \ndid not find support for this opinion and did not include the Ibizan Hound among their identified [[ancient dog breeds]].

Heidi G. Parker, the lead author of the original study has stated recently that indeed their original findings do not imply that the Ibizan Hound is not an ancient breed and that with better tools they would in all likelihood be able to trace a continuous lineage of thousands of years for many dog breeds and add them to their group of ancient dogs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonterrierclubofamerica.org/boston-terrier-health/genetic-structure-purebred-dog.htm|title=The Boston Terrier Club Of America|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Ibizan Hound is frequently competed in lure coursing through the AKC and ASFA, and also competes in LGRA straight racing and NOTRA oval track racing.  Some parts of the country also use them for coursing live prey, generally jackrabbits.\n\nThe Ibizan Hound breed is recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, Continental Kennel Club, [[American Kennel Club]], [[United Kennel Club]], Kennel Club of Great Britain, [[Canadian Kennel Club]], National Kennel Club, [[New Zealand Kennel Club]], [[Australian National Kennel Council]], America's Pet Registry, and American Canine Registry. It was fully recognized by the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1979.\n\n==In folk culture==\nAccording to journalist Norman Lewis, when an owner no longer wants to own one of these dogs (having too much of an appetite, for instance), it is considered very bad luck to kill the dog. Instead, they release the dog on the other side of the island, so that someone else might 'adopt' the animal.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lewis|first= Norman|authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=A view of the world : selected journalism |url= |edition= 2nd|series= |volume= |year= 1986|publisher= Eland Publishing Ltd.|location= London|isbn= 0-907871-43-7|oclc= |doi=  |pages= 83\u201390|chapter= 7|chapterurl= }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sighthoundsanctuary.org Sighthound Sanctuary & Animal Services]\n*[http://www.dogfacts.org/ibizan-hound-dog-pictures.htm Ibizan Hound Photos]\n*[http://www.camberoque.net/site/page.php3?serie=Podencos+Ibizencos&debut=1 Charles Camberoque: photos of Ibizans at work]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjUBljM_HI8 Video: How Ibizans hunt]\n*[http://www.criadorscaeivissenc.com/ Ibizan Hound Club (Eivissa)]\n*[http://www.podenco.net/english.php Norwegian Ibizan Hound Club]\n*[http://www.podenco.ch Swiss Ibizan Hound Club]\n*[http://www.podencoclub.de German Ibizan Hound Club]\n*[http://www.ibizanhoundrescue.com Ibizan Hound Rescue in Spain]\n*[http://www.snowliefibizanhounds.co.uk Ibizan Hounds in the UK]\n*[http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Podenco&stable=0&shownotice=1#Links Additional information on the German language Wikipedia.(In German: \"Podenco Ibicenco\")]\n<!--- en:Ibizan Hound --->\n{{Primitive dogs}}\n{{Spanish dogs}}\n{{FCI 5}}\n[[Category:Animals of Ibiza]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in the Balearic Islands]]\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n{{hounds}}\n[[Category:Rare dog breeds]]\n[[Category:Sighthounds]]", "sha1": "kgjczu0f0hoveqck6q4rcurkqsw54wt"}}, {"title": "Irish Wolfhound", "ns": "0", "id": "15335", "revision": {"id": "865055047", "parentid": "864491096", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T12:01:13Z", "contributor": {"ip": "1.136.111.206"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n<!-- Begin Infobox Dogbreed.

The [[Gael (Ancient people)|Irish]] continued to breed them for this purpose, as well as to guard their homes and protect their stock. [[C\u00fachulain]], a name which translates literally as \"hound of Culain\", gained his name when as a child, known then as S\u00e9tanta, when he slew the ferocious guard dog of Culain, forcing him to offer himself as a replacement.<ref name=\"McBryde 1998 19\"/>\n\n[[File:Wolfhound mascot wb.jpg|thumb|right|[[Irish Guards]]' mascot in parade dress]]\n[[File:WWI Irish recruiting poster LOC cph.3g10979.jpg|thumb|right|WWI recruitment poster]]\n\nDuring the English Conquest of Ireland, only the nobility were allowed to own Irish Wolfhounds, the numbers permitted depending on position. They were much coveted and were frequently given as gifts to important personages and foreign nobles. Wolfhounds were the companions of the regal, and were housed themselves alongside them. [[King John of England]], in about 1210 presented an Irish hound, [[Gelert]], to [[Llywelyn the Great|Llewellyn]], a prince of [[Wales]]. The poet The Hon [[William Robert Spencer]] immortalised this hound in a poem.<ref name=\"McBryde 1998 19\"/>\n\nIn his ''Historie of Ireland'' completed 1571, [[Edmund Campion]] gives a description of the hounds used for hunting the wolves on the [[Wicklow Mountains|Dublin and Wicklow mountains]]. He says: They (the Irish) are not without wolves and greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt. Due to their popularity overseas many were exported to European royal houses leaving numbers in Ireland depleted. This led to a declaration by [[Oliver Cromwell]] himself being published in [[Kilkenny]] on 27 April 1652 to ensure that sufficient numbers remained to control the wolf population.<ref name=\"Howell\">{{cite book | last =Howell | first =Elsworth S. | authorlink = | title = The International Encyclopedia of Dogs | publisher =McGraw-Hill | year = 1971| location = | pages = 254\u2013255| isbn = 978-0-7015-2969-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McBryde|first=Mary|title=The Irish Wolfhound: Symbol of Celtic Splendor.|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages= 24\u201325|isbn=978-0-87605-169-6}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the Irish Wolfhound in the 18th century tell of its great size, strength and greyhound shape as well as its scarcity. Writing in 1790, Bewick described it as the largest and most beautiful of the dog kind; about 36&nbsp;inches high, generally of a white or cinnamon colour, somewhat like the Greyhound but more robust. He said that their aspect was mild, disposition peaceful, and strength so great that in combat the Mastiff or Bulldog was far from being an equal to them. The last wolf in Ireland is thought to have been killed at Myshall, on the slopes of [[Mount Leinster]] in Co. Carlow in 1786 by a pack of wolfdogs kept by a Mr Watson of Ballydarton. The remaining hounds in the hands of a few families who were mainly descendants of the old Irish chieftains, were now symbols of status rather than hunters, they were said to be the last of their race.<ref>{{cite book|last=McBryde|first=Mary|title=The Irish Wolfhound: Symbol of Celtic Splendor.|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages= 27\u201331|isbn=978-0-87605-169-6}}</ref>\n\n===Modern wolfhound===\n[[File:Irish Guards' Mascot - Leitrim Boy.jpg|thumb|right|Member of the Irish Guards, pictured at Waterford Barracks with the regiment's mascot, an Irish Wolfhound named ''Leitrim Boy''.]]\n[[File:Irish wolfhound.jpg|thumb|right|National Geographic illustration showing the great size of the breed.]]\nScotsman Captain George Augustus Graham is responsible with a few other breeders for attempting to reaffirm the breed's existence. In 1879 he wrote: \"It has been ascertained beyond all question that there are few specimens of the breed still left in Ireland and England to be considered Irish Wolfhounds, though falling short of the requisite dimensions. This blood is now in my possession.\" Captain Graham devoted his life to ensuring the survival of the Irish Wolfhound. Owing to the small numbers of surviving specimens outcrossing was used in the breeding programme. It is believed that\n[[Borzoi]], [[Great Dane]], [[Scottish Deerhound]] and [[English Mastiff]] dogs all played their part in Graham's creation of the dog we currently know.  The famous English Mastiff Garnier's Lion was bred to the Deerhound Lufra, and their offspring Marquis enters Wolfhound pedigrees through his granddaughter Young Donagh. Graham included \"a single outcross of Tibetan Wolf Dog\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton, |first=Ferelith editor|title=The World Encyclopedia of Dogs|year=1971|publisher=The World Publishing Company|location=New York and Cleveland|pages=672}}</ref>   This was long assumed to have been a Tibetan Mastiff.  However, a photograph of \"Wolf\" shows a bearded, long-coated dog\u2014what would now be called a \"[[Kinnaur Sheepdog|Tibetan Kyi Apso]]\" or \"dokhyi apso\". In 1885 Captain Graham with other breeders founded the Irish Wolfhound Club, and the Breed Standard of Points to establish and agree the ideal to which breeders should aspire.<ref name=\"Howell\"/><ref>Samaha(1991)pp.8-19</ref>\n\nThe Wolfhound was historically a dog that only nobles could own and was taken up by the British during their rule in Ireland. This made it unpopular as a national symbol and the [[Kerry Blue Terrier]] was adopted by Republicans such as [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].The Wolfhound has been adopted as a symbol by both [[rugby football|rugby codes]]. The [[Ireland national rugby league team|national rugby league team]] is nicknamed the Wolfhounds, and the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], which governs rugby union, changed the name of the country's A (second-level) national team in that code to the [[Ireland Wolfhounds]] in 2010.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Irish Wolfhound Sam.jpg|thumb|Irish Wolfhound]]\nConsidered by the American Kennel Club to be the tallest of all dog breeds, describing the breed as, \"Of great size and commanding appearance, the Irish Wolfhound is remarkable in combining power and swiftness with keen sight.

This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone for long periods of time. An Irish Wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owner\u2019s possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish Wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, \u201cgentle when stroked, fierce when provoked\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last=McBryde|first=Mary|title=The Irish Wolfhound: Symbol of Celtic Splendor.|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page= 14|isbn=978-0-87605-169-6}}</ref>   They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to [[Coursing|course]] another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.<ref>{{cite book|last=McBryde|first=Mary|title=The Irish Wolfhound: Symbol of Celtic Splendor.|year=1998|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|pages= 97, 160\u2013162|isbn=978-0-87605-169-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Wolfhound of today is far from the one that struck fear into the hearts of the Ancient Romans. Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, patience and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish Wolfhound is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required this dog is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish Wolfhound breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them acutely aware and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.<ref name=\"Glover\">{{cite book | last = Glover | first = Linda | title = Irish wolfhound (World of Dogs)  | publisher = TFH | year = 1999|  isbn = 978-1-85279-077-6}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Chiot Irish Wolfhound.jpg|thumb|right|An Irish Wolfhound puppy]]\nLike many large dog breeds, Irish Wolfhounds have a relatively short lifespan.

Most breeders today recommend that they not be supplemented to slow their rapid growth.\n\nIrish Wolfhounds are the tallest of all dog breeds, sometimes reaching 7 feet tall on their hind legs.

The head is long and pointed, like a full sized Greyhound. Overall, they look like \"miniature\" [[Greyhound]]s. Though many Italian Greyhound owners dispute the use of the term \"miniature greyhound\" in reference to the breed itself, by definition of the American Kennel Club<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.akc.org/breeds/italian_greyhound/history.cfm |work=AKC.org |publisher=American Kennel Club |title=History |access-date=13 April 2014}}</ref> they are true genetic Greyhounds, with a bloodline extending back over 2,000 years. Their current small stature is a function of selective breeding. Their gait is distinctive and should be high stepping and free, rather like that of a horse.   They are able to run at top speed with a double suspension gallop,<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.akc.org/videos/breeds/italian_greyhound.swf |publisher=American Kennel Club | title=Italian Greyhound (video) |accessdate=13 April 2014 }}</ref> and can achieve a top speed of up to {{convert|25|mph|km/h}}.\n\nRecognised coat colours in the UK are Black, Blue (grey), Red and Fawn. For [[The Kennel Club]] (UK), all colours except brindle are accepted. For the [[American Kennel Club]], and the [[Australian National Kennel Council]], [[coat (dog)|parti colored]] Italian Greyhounds are accepted, while the FCI standard for international shows allows white only on the chest and feet. Coat colours of Black, Blue and Isabelle (Fawn) exist in all nuances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/uploaded_files/200g10-en.doc|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale]]|title=Italian Greyhound standard|accessdate=13 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe modern Italian Greyhound's appearance is a result of breeders throughout Europe, particularly [[Austria]]n, [[Germany|German]], [[Italy|Italian]], [[France|French]] and [[United Kingdom|British]], making great contributions to the forming of this [[breed]]. The Italian Greyhound should resemble a small Greyhound, or rather a [[Sloughi]].\n\n==Temperament==\n[[Image:Double-suspension.kozmo.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a [[double suspension gallop]], note all four feet off the ground.]]\n\nThe Italian Greyhound makes a good [[companion dog]] and enjoys the company of people. However, the breed's slim build and short coat make them somewhat fragile, and injury can result from rough or careless play with children. They are fast, agile and athletic, and love to run. Due to their size, and in some lineages poor bone density, they are prone to broken legs. Italian Greyhounds make reasonably good watchdogs, as they bark at unfamiliar sounds. They may also bark at passers-by and other animals. However, they should not be considered \"true\" guard dogs as they are often aloof with strangers and easily spooked to run.\n\nAs [[sighthound]]s, Italian Greyhounds instinctively hunt by sight and have an extremely high [[prey drive|predator drive]]. As with most sighthounds, [[Martingale (collar)|martingale collar]]s are often used with Italian greyhounds since their necks are nearly the same width as their skulls. Some Italian Greyhounds take part in [[dog agility]]. The breed's lithe body and its love of action provide potential to do well at this sport, although their natural inclination is for straight-out racing rather than for working tightly as a team with a handler on a technical course. [[Lure coursing]] is well-suited to the Italian Greyhound. They are fast dogs, and while they are not as well suited to racing as their larger cousins, many Italian Greyhounds participate in amateur straight-track and oval-track racing.\n\n==Grooming==\n[[File:IG Valerka.jpg|thumb|right|The breed has a short and almost odorless coat that requires little grooming]]\n\nDogs of this breed have an extremely short and almost odorless coat that requires little more than an occasional bath about once a month (though many veterinarians suggest{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} that even bathing once per month is too frequent for this breed), but a wipe-down with a damp cloth is recommended after walks as seeds, burrs and floating dust in the air can get into the coat and irritate the skin. This breed sheds medium to little hair.\n\n==Health==\nThe Italian Greyhound has a median lifespan of 13.5 in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breed Longevity Data|url=http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm}}</ref> A 1993 US breed club survey gives an average lifespan of 9 years but more than a quarter of the dogs had \"accidents\" recorded as cause of death. \n\nHealth problems that can be found in the breed:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiangreyhound.org/pages/200about_igs.html#health |title=Health concerns |publisher=Italian Greyhound Club of America |first=Teri |last=Dickinson |accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Oo9XfCGk?url=http://www.italiangreyhound.org/pages/200about_igs.html |archivedate=13 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>\n* [[Epilepsy in animals|Epilepsy]]\n* [[Perthes disease|Legg-Perthes disease]] (degeneration of the hip)\n* [[luxating patella|Patellar Luxation]] (slipped stifles)\n* [[von Willebrand disease]] (vWD) (Bleeding disorder)\n* [[Progressive retinal atrophy]] (PRA)\n* [[Canine follicular dysplasia|Color dilution alopecia]] (hair loss in dilute pigmented dogs, i.e.: blues, blue fawns, etc.)\n* Leg Breaks (most common under the age of 2)\n* [[Cataract]]s\n* [[Vitreous degeneration]]\n* [[Liver shunt]]s\n* [[Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]\n* [[Periodontal disease]], gum recession, early tooth loss, bad tooth enamel\n* [[Hypothyroidism]], Autoimmune Thyroid Disease ([[Hashimoto's disease]])\nTheir scissor-bite and thin jaw bones make them susceptible to [[periodontal disease]], which can be avoided with good dental care.

In research by the Ortheopedic Foundation for Animals, the Italian Greyhound was found to be the least affected by [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] out of 157 breeds.

[[Mummy|Mummified]] dogs very similar to the Italian Greyhound (or small Greyhounds) have been found in Egypt, and pictorials of small Greyhounds have been found in [[Pompeii]], and they were probably the only accepted companion-dog there.

This belief is based on the depiction of miniature greyhounds in the early decorative arts of these countries and on the archaeological discovery of small greyhound skeletons.{{citation_needed|date=February 2016}} By the Middle Ages, the breed had become distributed throughout Southern Europe and was later a favorite of the Italians of the sixteenth century, among whom miniature dogs were in great demand. Sadly, though, 'designer' breeders tried, and failed, to make the breed even smaller by crossbreeding it with other breeds of dogs. This only led to mutations with deformed skulls, bulging eyes and dental problems. The original Italian Greyhound had almost disappeared when groups of breeders got together and managed to return the breed to normal. From this period onward the history of the breed can be fairly well traced as it spread through Europe, arriving in England in the seventeenth century.{{citation_needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nThe grace of the breed has prompted several artists to include the dogs in paintings, among others [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Pisanello]], and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]].{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe breed has been popular with [[royal family|royalty]].

The musical intertwines the plots of several [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Charles Perrault]] [[fairy tale]]s, exploring the consequences of the characters' wishes and quests. The main characters are taken from \"[[Little Red Riding Hood]]\",<!-- Use Grimm rendering of \"Riding Hood\" in this instance only --> \"[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]\", \"[[Rapunzel]]\", and \"[[Cinderella]]\", as well as several others. The musical is tied together by a story involving a childless baker and his wife and their quest to begin a family (the original beginning of The Grimm Brothers' Rapunzel), their interaction with a witch who has placed a curse on them, and their interaction with other storybook characters during their journey.\n\nThe musical debuted in San Diego at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in 1986 and premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on November 5, 1987, where it won several [[Tony Award]]s, including [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Score]], [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book]], and [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Actress in a Musical]] (Joanna Gleason), in a year dominated by ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1988). The musical has since been produced many times, with a 1988 US national tour, a 1990 West End production, a 1997 tenth anniversary concert, a 2002 Broadway revival, a 2010 London revival<ref>{{cite web | last = Hutchins | first = Michael H. | coauthors = | title = Into the Woods | work = The Stephen Sondheim Reference Guide | publisher = | date = October 14, 2010 | url = http://www.sondheimguide.com/woods.html | accessdate = January 11, 2012}}</ref> and in 2012 as part of New York City's outdoor Shakespeare in the Park series.\n\nA [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] [[Into the Woods (film)|film adaptation]] directed by [[Rob Marshall]] and starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Emily Blunt]], [[James Corden]], [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Chris Pine]], [[Tracey Ullman]], [[Christine Baranski]] and [[Johnny Depp]] was released in 2014.

The Witch also took the Baker's father's newborn child [[Rapunzel]]. She explains the curse will be lifted if the Baker and his Wife can find the four ingredients that the Witch needs for a certain potion; \"the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold,\" all before the chime of midnight in three days' time.  All begin their journeys into the woods\u2014Jack goes to market to sell his beloved Milky White, Cinderella's family rides to the Festival while Cinderella goes to her mother's grave to ask for guidance, Little Red goes to her grandmother's house, and the Baker, refusing his wife's help, goes to find the ingredients (\"Prologue\").\n\nCinderella visits her mother's grave and receives a beautiful gown and golden slippers from her mother's spirit (\"Cinderella at the Grave\"). Jack encounters a Mysterious Man who mocks him for trying to sell his cow for more than a \"sack of beans\" and then vanishes. Little Red Ridinghood meets a hungry [[Big Bad Wolf|Wolf]] who convinces her to take a detour on her way to Granny's (\"Hello, Little Girl\"). The Baker and his Wife squabble over her presence in the woods, but come across Jack with Milky White. Not having the money necessary to buy the cow, they convince Jack that the beans the Baker has found in his father's old hunting jacket are magic beans and buy the cow for five of them. Jack bids a tearful goodbye to his cow (\"I Guess This Is Goodbye\"), and the Baker orders his wife to return to the village with the cow. He has qualms about being so dishonest, but his wife reasons that the chance to have a child justifies their trickery (\"Maybe They're Magic\").\n\nThe Witch has raised Rapunzel as her own daughter, keeping her locked away from the world in a tall tower accessible only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair (\"Our Little World\"). But this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Ridinghood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences (\"I Know Things Now\"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which grow into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that it was a nice ball (\"A Very Nice Prince\") but seems nonplussed by the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes (\"First Midnight\") and they continue their journeys through the woods.\n\nThe next morning, Jack describes his adventure climbing the beanstalk (\"Giants in the Sky\"). He gives the Baker five gold pieces he stole from the giants to buy back his cow. When the Baker hesitates, Jack climbs back up the beanstalk to find more. The Mysterious Man emerges and taunts the Baker, stealing the money. The Baker's Wife confesses she has lost the cow, and she and the Baker split up to look for it. Cinderella's Prince and Rapunzel's Prince, who are brothers, meet and compare the their newfound and unobtainable amours (\"Agony\"). The Baker's Wife, who is eavesdropping, takes note when Rapunzel's prince mentions that he is in love with a girl in a tower with hair \"as yellow as corn.\" The Baker's Wife fools Rapunzel into letting down her hair by telling her that she is her prince and pulls out a piece of it. Meanwhile, The Mysterious Man returns Milky White to the Baker.\n\nThe Baker's Wife and Cinderella meet again, and the Baker's Wife makes a desperate grab for her shoes, almost succeeding before Cinderella flees. The Baker and his wife reunite, now with three of the four items. The Baker admits that they will have to work together to fulfill the quest (\"It Takes Two\"). Jack arrives with a hen that lays golden eggs and attempts to buy Milky White back, but the cow suddenly keels over dead as midnight chimes. Again, the characters recite morals (\"Second Midnight\"). The Witch discovers that the Prince has been visiting Rapunzel and, in fury and anguish, demands that Rapunzel stay with her so she can protect her from the outside world (\"Stay with Me\"). When Rapunzel refuses, the Witch cuts off Rapunzel's hair and banishes her to a desert. The Mysterious Man gives the Baker the money to buy another cow. Jack encounters Little Red Ridinghood, who is now sporting a wolf skin cape and a large knife for protection. She goads him into returning once again to the Giant's home to steal a magic harp.\n\nCinderella, returning from the last night of the festival, describes how the Prince spread pitch on the stairs to prevent her from escaping. Caught between wanting to escape and wanting to stay, she eventually resolves to let the Prince decide, leaving him one of her slippers as a clue to her identity (\"On the Steps of the Palace\"). The Baker's Wife frantically tries to convince her to give up her other shoe, offering her the sixth magic bean in exchange for it. Cinderella throws the bean aside, but trades shoes with the Baker's Wife and flees. The Baker arrives with another cow; they now have all four items. The Prince's Steward grabs the slipper from the Baker's Wife, and they are fighting over it when a great crash is heard and Jack's mother runs in to report that there is a dead Giant in her backyard. The Prince, more concerned with finding Cinderella, waves her off and departs with one of the slippers, giving the other to the Baker and his wife. Jack, to his mother's relief, returns with the magic harp. The Witch discovers that the new cow is unsatisfactory (as it's a regular cow which has been is covered with flour). However, the Witch is able to resurrect Milky White and instructs the Baker and his Wife to feed the other ingredients to her. Jack tries to milk her, but no milk comes. The Baker's Wife reveals where she got the yellow hair, and the Witch furiously explains that she cannot have touched any of the ingredients. The Mysterious Man tells the Baker to feed the hair-like corn silk to the cow. Now Milky White gives milk which is the potion. The Witch reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father. The Witch drinks the potion. At the chime of the third midnight the Mysterious Man falls dead, his reparation complete, the curse is broken, and the Witch regains the youth and beauty she had before the curse.\n\nCinderella's Prince searches for the girl whose foot fits the slipper; the stepsisters try but can only get it on by cutting off parts of their feet (\"Careful My Toe\"). Cinderella appears, her foot fits the slipper, and she becomes the Prince's bride. Rapunzel bears twins in the desert where her Prince finds her. The Witch attempts to curse the couple, but with the curse broken, her powers are gone. At Cinderella's wedding to the Prince, Florinda and Lucinda are blinded by birds as they try to win Cinderella's favor. The Baker's Wife, very pregnant, thanks Cinderella for the slipper. Everyone is at the wedding. Everyone but the Witch and the stepsisters congratulate themselves on being able to live happily \"Ever After,\" though they fail to notice another beanstalk growing sky-high...\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator introduces the action again: \"Once Upon a Time...Later.\" All the characters seem happy but are still wishing: The Baker and his Wife have their precious baby boy, but wish for more room and bicker over the Baker's unwillingness to hold his child; Jack and his mother are rich and well-fed, but Jack misses his kingdom in the sky; Cinderella is living with her Prince Charming in the Palace, but is getting bored. (\"So Happy\").\n\nEveryone is suddenly knocked over by a loud crash. The enormous foot of a Giant has destroyed the Witch's garden, sparing only a few beans. The Baker and his Wife decide that they must tell the Royal Family, and the Baker travels to the palace. His news is ignored by the Prince's Steward, and also by Jack's Mother when he stops at her house to ask for Jack's aid. When he returns home, Little Red Ridinghood arrives on her way to Granny's: her house has been destroyed and her mother is missing. The Baker and his Wife decide to escort her. Meanwhile, Jack decides that he must slay the Giant and Cinderella learns from her bird friends that her mother's grave was disturbed and decides to investigate, dressed in her old rags. Once again, everyone heads into the woods, but this time the mood is somber, for \"the skies are strange, the winds are strong\" (\"Into the Woods\" Reprise).\n\nRapunzel has also fled to the woods in a hysterical fit, driven mad by her treatment at the Witch's hands. Her Prince has followed her, but when he encounters his brother they each confess they have another reason for their presence in the woods. They have grown bored and frustrated with their marriages and now lust after two beautiful women asleep in the woods - [[Snow White]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]] (\"Agony\" Reprise).\n\nThe Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood get lost in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, bringing news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant is a woman\u2013widow of the Giant that Jack killed. Her booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed by being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch (\"Witch's Lament\").\n\nThe Royal Family continue on their way, fleeing despite the Baker's pleas for them to stay and fight the Giant. The Witch declares she will find Jack and sacrifice him to the Giant, and the Baker and his Wife decide they must find him first and split up to search. The Baker's Wife meets Cinderella's Prince, and he rapidly seduces her (\"Any Moment\"). Meanwhile, the Baker discovers Cinderella at her mother's ruined grave and convinces her to join their group for safety. The Prince, satisfied, leaves the Baker's Wife with a few platitudes, and she reflects on her adventure of the woods and her return to domestic life with family (\"Moments in the Woods\"). However, she has lost her way, stumbles into the path of the Giant, and is consequently killed by a falling tree.\n\nThe Baker, Little Red, and Cinderella await the return of the Baker's Wife when the Witch drags in Jack, whom she found weeping over the Baker's Wife's body. The grief-stricken Baker unwittingly agrees to give Jack to the Giantess, causing an argument. The characters first blame each other for their predicament, until finally they all decide to blame the Witch for growing the beans in the first place (\"Your Fault\"). Disgusted and fed up, the Witch curses and scolds them for their inability to accept responsibility, throwing away the rest of her magic beans. This brings her mother's curse on her again, and she vanishes. (\"Last Midnight\").\n\nThe Baker flees, but is visited by his father's spirit who convinces him to face his responsibilities (\"No More\"). The Baker returns and helps plan killing the Giantess, using Cinderella's bird friends to peck out the Giant's eyes at an area smeared with pitch, where Jack and the Baker can finally deliver a fatal blow. Cinderella stays behind to protect the Baker's child and when her Prince passes by, he nearly fails to recognize her. She confronts him, having learned of his infidelity from her birds and he explains his feelings of unfulfillment and his reasons for seducing another woman. She asks him to go, and he sorrowfully leaves.\n\nLittle Red returns with the news that her grandmother has been killed by the Giantess. Meanwhile, the Baker tells Jack that his mother is dead. Jack vows to kill the steward until the Baker convinces him that will not benefit anyone. Cinderella comforts Little Red and tries to address her qualms\u2013does killing the Giant make them no better than she is? The Baker and Cinderella explain to Jack and Little Red that everyone is connected, and choices have consequences (\"No One Is Alone\").\n\nThe four remaining characters slay the Giant and the deceased characters now including the Royal Family (who have lost their way and starved to death in the woods) and the Princes (who have their new paramours, [[Snow White]] and [[Sleeping Beauty]], on their arms) return to share one last set of morals with the audience. The survivors resolve to band together and rebuild. The spirit of the Baker's Wife appears to comfort her mourning husband, advising him to tell their child their story. The Baker begins to tell the child the story of the play, while the Witch appears with the final moral: \"Careful the things you say, Children Will Listen.\" All join in on a last reprise of the title song, surmising that we all must venture into the woods while remembering the choices we've made and learning from each endeavor we come across (\"Finale\"). As the characters conclude the song singing, \"Into the woods, and out of the woods and happily ever after\", Cinderella closes the show with one last \"I wish...\"\n\n==Productions==\n\n===Pre-Broadway San Diego production===\n''Into the Woods'' premiered at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in San Diego, California, on December 4, 1986 and ran for 50 performances under the direction of James Lapine.<ref>[http://www.sondheimguide.com/woods.html#Globe \"Into the Woods' listing, Old Globe Theatre, 1986] SondheimGuide.com, retrieved April 17, 2010</ref> Many of the performers from that production appeared in the Broadway cast but John Cunningham, who played the Narrator, Wolf and Steward and [[George Coe]], as the Mysterious Man and Cinderella's Father were replaced by [[Tom Aldredge]], who played the Narrator and Mysterious Man.

Cinderella's Prince and the Wolf, who share the characteristic of being unable to control their appetites, are usually played by the same actor. Similarly, the Narrator and the Mysterious Man, who share the characteristic of commenting on the story while avoiding any personal involvement or responsibility. Granny and Cinderella's Mother, who are both matriarchal characters in the story, are also typically played by the same person, who also gives voice to the nurturing but later murderous Giant's Wife.\n\nThe show covers multiple themes: growing up, parents and children, accepting responsibility, morality, and finally, wish fulfillment and its consequences.<ref>Flatow, Sheryl. Liner Notes, ''Into the Woods'' CD, 1988, RCA Victor 6796-2-RC</ref> The ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' reviewers wrote that the play's \"basic insight... is at heart, most fairy tales are about the loving yet embattled relationship between parents and children. Almost everything that goes wrong\u2014which is to say, almost everything that can\u2014arises from a failure of parental or filial duty, despite the best intentions.\"<ref>Henry, William A. and Bland, Elizabeth A.

The witch isn't just a scowling old hag, but a key symbol of moral ambivalence. James Lapine said that the most unpleasant person (the Witch) would have the truest things to say and the \"nicer\" people would be less honest.<ref>Holden, Stephen.[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-tale.html \"A Fairy-Tale Musical Grows Up\"].

In particular, the opening words, \"I wish\", are set to the interval of a rising major second and this small unit is both repeated and developed throughout the show, just as Lapine's book explores the consequences of self-interest and \"wishing.\" The dialogue in the show is characterized by the heavy use of [[Syncopation|syncopated]] speech. In many instances, the characters' lines are delivered with a fixed beat that follows natural speech rhythms, but is also purposely composed in eighth, sixteenth, and quarter note rhythms as part of a spoken song. Like many Sondheim/Lapine productions, the songs contain thought-process narrative, where characters converse or think aloud.\n\nSondheim drew on parts of his troubled childhood when writing the show. In 1987, he told ''Time Magazine'' that the \"father uncomfortable with babies [was] his father, and [the] mother who regrets having had children [was] his mother.\"<ref name= \"master\">{{cite news|last = Henry|first = William A, III|last2 =Bland| first2 =Elizabeth L. |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966141,00.html |title =Master of the Musical (subscription required, abstract)|publisher =Time Magazine|date= December 7, 1987|accessdate = July 28, 2012}}</ref> <!--cannot verify this quote, the link is to abstract only-->\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!
