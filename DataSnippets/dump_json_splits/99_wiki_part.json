The discovery of bauxite in the 1940s and the subsequent establishment of the bauxite-alumina industry shifted Jamaica's economy from [[sugar]] and [[banana]]s. By the 1970s, Jamaica had emerged as a world leader in export of these minerals as foreign investment increased.<ref name=\"m.state.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://m.state.gov/md7600.htm|title=Jamaica (04/01)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004013147/http://m.state.gov/md7600.htm|archivedate=4 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWeakness in the financial sector, speculation, and lower levels of investment erode confidence in the productive sector. The government continues its efforts to raise new sovereign debt in local and international financial markets in order to meet its U.S. dollar debt obligations, to mop up liquidity to maintain the exchange rate and to help fund the current budget deficit.\n\nJamaican Government economic policies encourage foreign investment in areas that earn or save foreign exchange, generate employment, and use local raw materials. The government provides a wide range of incentives to investors, including remittance facilities to assist them in repatriating funds to the country of origin; tax holidays which defer taxes for a period of years; and duty-free access for machinery and raw materials imported for approved enterprises.\n\n[[Jamaican Free Zones|Free trade zones have stimulated investment]] in garment assembly, light manufacturing, and data entry by foreign firms. However, over the last 5 years, the garment industry has suffered from reduced export earnings, continued factory closures, and rising unemployment. This may be attributed to intense competition, absence of [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) parity, drug contamination delaying deliveries, and the high cost of operation, including security costs. The Government of Jamaica hopes to encourage economic activity through a combination of privatization, financial sector restructuring, reduced interest rates, and by boosting tourism and related productive activities.\n\nIn April 2014, the Governments of Jamaica and China signed the preliminary agreements for the first phase of the Jamaican Logistics Hub (JLH) - the initiative that aims to position Kingston as the fourth node in the global logistics chain, joining Rotterdam, Dubai and Singapore, and serving the Americas.<ref name=\"reuters.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/01/jamaica-china-ports-idUSL1N0MT0WL20140401|title=Jamaica signs deal for China-built cargo shipping hub|work=Reuters|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The Project, when completed, is expected to provide many jobs for Jamaicans, Economic Zones for multinational companies<ref name=\"jis.gov.jm\">{{cite web|url=http://jis.gov.jm/proposed-caymanas-economic-zone-one-16/|title=Proposed Caymanas Economic Zone To Be One Of 16 - Jamaica Information Service|work=Jamaica Information Service|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> and much needed economic growth to alleviate the country's heavy [[debt-to-GDP ratio]].

Although the manufacturing and services sectors have grown in the second half of the 20th century, Jamaica's economy still faces some serious problems.\n\nThe Jamaican economy suffered its fourth consecutive year of negative growth (0.4%) in 1999. All sectors excepting bauxite/alumina, energy, and tourism shrank in 1998 and 1999. In 2000, Jamaica experienced its first year of positive growth since 1995.<ref name=\"m.state.gov\" />\n\nInflation fell from 25% in 1995 to single digits in 2000, reaching a multidecade low of 4.3% in 2004. Through periodic intervention in the market, the central bank also has prevented any abrupt drop in the exchange rate. The Jamaican dollar has been slipping, despite intervention, resulting in an average exchange rate of J$73.40 per US$1.00 and J136.2 per \u20ac1.00 (February 2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oanda.com/convert/fxhistory|title=Historical Currency Converter - OANDA|author=|date=|website=www.oanda.com}}</ref> In addition, inflation has been trending upward since 2004 and is projected to once again reach a double digit rate of 12-13% through the year 2008 due to a combination of unfavorable weather damaging crops and increasing agricultural imports and high energy prices.<ref>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20080103T220000-0500_131002_OBS_JAMAICA_S_ECONOMIC_AND_FINANCIAL_MARKET_OUTLOOK_FOR_____.asp Jamaica's economic and financial market outlook for 2008 - JAMAICAOBSERVER.COM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930122439/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/magazines/Business/html/20080103T220000-0500_131002_OBS_JAMAICA_S_ECONOMIC_AND_FINANCIAL_MARKET_OUTLOOK_FOR_____.asp |date=30 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOver the last 30 years, real per capita GDP increased at an average of just one percent per year, making Jamaica one of the slowest growing developing countries in the world.\n\nTo reverse this trajectory, the Government of Jamaica embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious program of reforms for which it has garnered national and international support:  a four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF)  by  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) providing  a  support package of US$932 million;  World Bank Group and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) programs providing  US$510 million each to facilitate the GoJ\u2019s economic reform agenda to stabilize the economy, reduce debt and create the conditions for growth and resilience.. In addition, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) will continue to support private sector development.\n\nThe reform program is beginning to bear fruit: Institutional reforms and measures to improve the environment for the private sector have started to restore confidence in the Jamaican economy. Jamaica jumped 27 places to 58 among 189 economies worldwide in the 2015 Doing Business ranking, the country\u2019s credit rating has improved and the Government has successfully raised more than US$2 billion in the international capital in the markets in 2014 and 2015..\n\nDespite some revival, economic growth is still low: the Jamaican Government is forecasting real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.9 per cent for the fiscal year 2015/2016 and the country continues to be  confronted by serious social issues that predominantly affect youth, such as high levels of crime and violence and high unemployment. Jamaica, which had seen its poverty rate drop almost 20 percent over two decades, saw it increase by eight percent in a few years.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Jamaica is about 13.2% (April 2015, Statistical Institute of Jamaica ), with youth unemployment more than twice the national rate (38%). However, among Jamaica\u2019s assets are its skilled labor force and strong social and governance indicators.<ref>http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/jamaica/overview</ref>\n\n==Primary industries==\n[[File:Jamaica Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|350px|A proportional representation of Jamaica's exports.]]\n\n===Agriculture===\nAgricultural production is an important contributor to Jamaica's economy. Agricultural production accounted for 7.4% of GDP in 1997, providing employment for nearly a quarter of the country.<ref name=\"nationsencyclopedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Jamaica-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Jamaica Agriculture, Information about Agriculture in Jamaica|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> Jamaica's agriculture, together with forestry and fishing, accounted for about 6.6% of GDP in 1999. [[Sugar]] has been produced in Jamaica for centuries, it is the nation's dominant agricultural export.<ref name=\"nationsencyclopedia.com\"/> Sugar is produced in nearly every [[parish]]. The production of raw sugar in the year 2000 was estimated at 175,000 tons, a decrease from 290,000 tons in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Jamaica-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Agriculture - Jamaica - import, export, crops|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n \nJamaican agriculture has been less prominent in GDP in the 2000s than other industries, hitting an all-time low between 2004 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://trading-economics.com/jamaica/gdp-from-agriculture|title=Jamaica GDP from Agriculture|website=Trading Economics|publisher=TRADING ECONOMICS|accessdate=29 November 2017}}</ref> This may have been due to a reaction to increased competition as international trade policies were enacted. For example, as NAFTA was enacted in 1993, a significant amount of Caribbean exports to the United States diminished, being out competed by Latin American exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/caribbean-basin-struggles-in-naftas-shadow-0|title=Caribbean Basin Struggles in NAFTA's Shadow|website=International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development|publisher=International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development Organization|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> Another example is the Banana Import Regime's 3rd phase, in which EU nations had first given priority in banana imports to previously colonized nations. Under pressure by the World Trade Organization, the EU policy was altered to provide a non-discriminatory trade agreement. Jamaica's banana industry was easily outpriced by American companies exporting Latin American goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2010/433852/EXPO-INTA_ET(2010)433852_EN.pdf|title=The EU Banana Regime: Evolution And Implications of its Recent Changes|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> Jamaica's agriculture industry is now bouncing back, growing from being 6.6% of GDP to 7.2%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_jm.html|title=CENTRAL AMERICA AND CARIBBEAN :: JAMAICA|website=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref> The recent growth of the agriculture industry may lead to further improvements in unemployment and exports.\n\nSugar formed 7.1% of the exports in 1999 and Jamaica made up about 4.8% of the total production of sugar in the Caribbean. Sugar is also used for the production of by-products such as molasses, rum and some wallboard is made from [[bagasse]].\n\n[[Banana]] production in 1999 was 130,000 tons. Bananas formed 2.4% of the exports in 1999 and Jamaica formed around 7.5% of the total production of banana in the Caribbean. Jamaica stopped exporting banana in 2008 after suffering from several years of hurricanes that devastated the plantations.\n\n[[Coffee]] is mainly grown around the [[Blue Mountains (Jamaica)|Blue Mountains]] and in hilly areas. One type in particular, [[Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee]], is considered among the best in the world because at those heights in the Blue Mountains, the cooler climate causes the berries to take longer to ripen and the beans develop more of the substances which on roasting give coffee its flavor. Coffee formed 1.9% of exports in 1999. The picking season lasts from August to March. The coffee is exported from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].\n\n[[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is grown throughout Jamaica and local sales absorb about 1/3 of the output to be made into instant drinks and confectionery. [[Citrus fruit]] is mainly grown in the central parts of Jamaica, particularly between the elevations of 1,000-2,500 feet. The picking season lasts from November to April. Two factories in [[Bog Walk]] produce fruit juices, canned [[fruit]], essential [[oil]]s and [[marmalade]]. [[Coconut]]s are grown on the northern and eastern coasts, which provide enough [[copra]] to supply factories to make butterine, [[margarine]], [[lard]], edible [[oil]] & laundry [[soap]].\n\nOther export crops are [[pimento]], [[ginger]], [[tobacco]], [[sisal]] and other fruit are exported. [[Rice]] is grown around swampy areas around the Black River & around Long Bay in Hanover and Westmoreland parishes for local consumption.\n\nAs tastes have changed in Jamaica in favor of more meat and [[convenience food|packaged food]] the national food import bill has grown to the point that it threatens the health of the economy. The government has responded by encouraging gardening and farming, a response which has had limited success. For example, the percentage of potatoes grown locally has increased, but imports of french fries have continued at a high level.<ref name=NYT80313>{{cite news|title=As Cost of Importing Food Soars, Jamaica Turns to the Earth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/world/americas/as-cost-of-importing-food-soars-jamaica-turns-to-the-earth.html|accessdate=4 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 August 2013|author=Damien Cave}}</ref>\n\n===Animal Husbandry===\n\nPastures form a good percentage of the land in Jamaica. Many properties specialize in cattle rearing. Livestock holdings were 400,000 head of cattle, 440,000 goats, 180,000 hogs & 30,000 sheep. Although animal products & numbers of livestock are increasing, this isn't enough for local requirements for a growing population. Dairying has increased since the erection of a [[condensed milk]] factory at Bog Walk in 1940. Even so, the supply of dairy products is not enough for local requirements and there are large imports of [[powdered milk]], [[butter]] and [[cheese]].\n\n===Fishing===\nThe [[fishing industry]] grew during the 1900s, primarily from the focus on inland fishing. Several thousand fishermen make a living from fishing. The shallow waters and cays off the south coast are richer than the northern waters. Other fishermen live on the [[Pedro Bank|Pedro Cays]], {{convert|80|mi|km}} to the south of Jamaica.\n\nJamaica supplies about half of its fish requirements; major imports of frozen and salted fish are imported from the USA & Canada.\n\nThe total catch in 2000 was 5,676 tons, a decrease from 11,458 tons in 1997; the catch was mainly marine, with freshwater [[carp]], [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], etc., crustaceans & molluscs.\n\n===Forestry===\n\nBy the late 1890, only {{convert|185000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of Jamaica's original {{convert|1000000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of forest remained. Roundwood production was 881,000 cu m (31.1 million cu ft) in 2000. About 68% of the timber cut in 2000 was used as fuel wood while 32% was used for industrial use. The forests that once covered Jamaica now exist only in mountainous areas. They only supply 20% of the island timber requirements. The remaining forest is protected from further exploitation. Other accessible mountain areas are being reforested, mainly with [[pine]]s, mahoe and [[mahogany]].\n\n===Mining===\n\n[[File:Windalco, Alumina plant.jpg|thumb|Windalco, Alumina plant in the background (Kirkvine, Manchester)]]Jamaica was the third-leading producer of [[bauxite]] and [[alumina]] in 1998, producing 12.6 million tons of bauxite, accounting for 10.4% of world production, and 3.46 million tons of alumina, accounting for 7.4% of world production. 8,540 million tons of bauxite was mined in 2012 and 10,200 million tons of bauxite in 2011.<ref>https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bauxite/mcs-2012-bauxi.pdf</ref>\t\n\nMining and quarrying made up 4.1% of the nation's gross domestic product in 1999. Bauxite and alumina formed 55.2% of exports in 1999 and are the second-leading money earner after tourism. Jamaica has reserves of over 2 billion tonnes, which are expected to last 100 years. Bauxite is found in the central parishes of St. Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, St. Catherine, St. Ann, and Trelawny. There are four alumina plants and six mines.\n\nJamaica has deposits of several million tons of [[gypsum]] on the southern slopes of the Blue Mountains. Jamaica produced 330,441 tons of gypsum in the year 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Jamaica-MINING.html|title=Mining - Jamaica - export, sector|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> some of which was used in the local cement industry and in the manufacturing of building materials.\n\nOther minerals present in Jamaica include [[marble]], [[limestone]], and [[silica]], as well as [[ore]]s of [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]] and [[iron]]. Some of these are worked in small quantities. [[Petroleum]] has been sought, but so far none has been found.\n\n==Secondary Industries==\n\n===Manufacturing===\nThe manufacturing sector is an essential contributor to the Jamaican economy. Though manufacturing accounted for 13.9% of GDP in 1999. Jamaican companies contribute many manufactures such as [[food]] processing; [[oil refining]]; produced [[chemical]]s, construction materials, [[plastic]] goods, [[paint]]s, [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[carton]]s, [[leather]] goods and [[cigar]]s & assembled [[electronics]], [[textile]]s and [[apparel]]. The garment industry is a major job employer for thousands of hundreds of locals and they formed 12.9% of exports in 1999 earning US$159 million. Chemicals formed 3.3% of the exports in 1999 earning US$40 million.\n\nAn oil refinery is located near Kingston converts crude petroleum obtained from [[Venezuela]] into [[gasoline]] and other products. These are mainly for local use. The [[construction]] industry is growing due to new hotels and attractions being built for tourism. [[Construction]] and installation formed 10.4% of the GDP in 1999.\n\nManufactured goods were imported and formed 30.3% of the imports and cost US$877 million in 1999.\n\nSince the launch of the Jamaican Logistics Hub initiative,<ref name=\"reuters.com\"/><ref name=\"jamaicalogisticshub.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jamaicalogisticshub.com/about/|title=jamaicalogisticshub.com|author=|date=|website=jamaicalogisticshub.com}}</ref> various economic zones have been proposed throughout the country to assemble goods from other parts of the world for distribution to the Americas.<ref name=\"jis.gov.jm\"/>\n\n==Tertiary industries==\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism is tied with remittances as Jamaica's top source of revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jm.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> The tourism industry earns over 50 percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings and provides about one-fourth of all jobs in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gttp.org/html/jamaica.html|title=GTTP: The Global Travel and Tourism Partnership|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724182114/http://www.gttp.org/html/jamaica.html|archivedate=24 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Most tourist activity is centered on the island's northern coast, including the communities of [[Montego Bay]], [[Ocho Rios]], and [[Port Antonio]], as well as in [[Negril]] on the island's western tip.\n\nSome destinations include Ocho Rios, [[Green Grotto Caves]], Y.S. Falls and Appleton Estate.  Most of the tourist sites are landmarks as well as homes for many Jamaicans. Many of the most frequented tourist sites are located mainly by water such as rivers and beaches where fishermen make a living from seafood. One of the most famous beach towns in Jamaica is Ocho Rios, a located in the parish of Saint Ann on the north coast of Jamaica. It was once a fishing village but now attracts millions of tourists yearly. The site is popular today because of the food and culture that can be found there.\n\nAnother famous location in Jamaica that attracts millions yearly is [[Dunn's River Falls]], located in Ocho Rios; this waterfall is approximately 600 feet long and runs off into the sea.

It lies {{convert|600|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Iceland]] (495&nbsp;km (305&nbsp;mi) NE of [[Kolbeinsey]]), {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} east of central [[Greenland]] and {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} west of the [[North Cape, Norway]]. The island is mountainous, the highest summit being the Beerenberg volcano in the north. The isthmus is the location of the two largest lakes of the island, [[S\u00f8rlaguna]] (South Lagoon), and [[Nordlaguna]] (North Lagoon). A third lake is called Ullerenglaguna (Ullereng Lagoon). Jan Mayen was formed by the [[Jan Mayen hotspot]].\n\nAlthough administered separately, [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]] are collectively assigned the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code \"SJ\".\n\n==Natural resources==\n[[File:Jan Mayen Von Karman Vortex street Apr 5 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]] created by [[Beerenberg]] volcano in the westerly winds.]]\n\nJan Mayen Island has one exploitable natural resource, [[gravel]], from the site at Trongskaret. Other than this, economic activity is limited to providing services for employees of [[Norway]]'s [[radio communications]] and [[meteorological]] stations located on the island. Jan Mayen has one unpaved [[airstrip]], [[Jan Mayensfield]], which is about {{convert|1585|m|abbr=on}} long. The {{convert|124.1|km|mi|abbr=on}} coast has no [[port]]s or [[harbour]]s, only offshore anchorages.\n\nThere are important [[fishing]] resources, and the existence of Jan Mayen establishes a large [[exclusive economic zone]] around it. A dispute between Norway and [[Denmark]] regarding the fishing exclusion zone between Jan Mayen and Greenland was settled in 1988 granting Denmark the greater area of sovereignty. Significant deposits of petroleum and natural gas are suspected by geologists to lie below Jan Mayen's surrounding [[seabed|seafloors]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/21/oil-norway-arctic-idUSL6N0GM16S20130821 |title=Oil majors eye oil, gas off Arctic Jan Mayen island |publisher=reuters |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Status==\n[[File:Beerenberg JanMayen.JPG|thumb|Snow-covered [[Beerenberg]] beyond coastal hills]]\n\nJan Mayen Island is an integral [[list of possessions of Norway|part of the Kingdom of Norway]].

Strong indicators exist of their presence in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]] before the arrival of the [[Viking]]s, and medieval chronicles such as the famous ''[[Brendan#The Voyage of Saint Brendan|Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot]]'' testify to the extensive interest in exploration at the time. A modern-day trans-Atlantic journey proved the ability of the early navigators to reach all lands of the north Atlantic even further from Ireland than Jan Mayen\u2014and, given favorable winds, at a speed roughly equal to that of modern yachts.<ref>{{citation |last1=Severin |first1=Tim |title=The Brendan Voyage |publisher=Random House |year=2000 |origyear=1978 }}</ref> Though quite feasible, there is nevertheless no direct physical trace of medieval landings or settlement on Jan Mayen.\n\nThe land named ''Svalbar\u00f0'' (\"cold coast\") by the Vikings in the early medieval book [[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]] may have been Jan Mayen (instead of [[Spitsbergen]], renamed [[Svalbard]] by the Norwegians in modern times); the distance from Iceland to ''Svalbar\u00f0'' mentioned in this book is two days' sailing (with favorable winds), consistent with the approximate {{convert|550|km|abbr=on}} to Jan Mayen and not with the minimum {{convert|1550|km|abbr=on}} to Spitsbergen.<ref name=\"Wordie\">J. M. Wordie (1922), \"Jan Mayen Island\", ''The Geographical Journal'' Vol 59 (3), pp. 180-194</ref> However much Jan Mayen may have been known in Europe at that time, it was subsequently forgotten for some centuries.\n\nIn the 17th century, many claims of the island's rediscovery were made, spurred by the rivalry on the Arctic whaling grounds, and the island received many names. According to [[Thomas Edge]], an early 17th-century whaling captain who was often inaccurate, \"William {{sic}} [[Henry Hudson|Hudson]]\" discovered the island in 1608 and named it \"Hudson's Touches\" (or \"Tutches\"). However, Henry Hudson could only have come by on his voyage in 1607 (if he had made an illogical detour) and he made no mention of it in his journal.<ref name=\"Wordie\" /> Douglas Hunter, in ''Half Moon'' (2009), believes Hudson may not have mentioned his supposed discovery of the island because he was \"loath to address a crew insurrection that might well have erupted at that time, when the men realized where he was trying to take them.\" This is, however, merely speculation on Hunter's part. There is absolutely no evidence to support such a claim.\n\nAccording to [[William Scoresby]] (1820: p.{{nbsp}}154), referring to the mistaken belief that the Dutch had discovered the island in 1611, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] whalers discovered the island \"about the same time\" and named it \"Trinity Island\". Muller (1874: pp.{{nbsp}}190\u2013191) took this to mean they had come upon Jan Mayen in 1611 or 1612, which was repeated by many subsequent authors. There were, in fact, no Hull whalers in either of these years, the first Hull whaling expedition having been sent to the island only in 1616 (see below). As with the previous claim made by Edge, there is no cartographical or written proof for this supposed discovery.<ref name=\"Hacq\"/>\n\n===Jan Mayen during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery===\n[[File:Arctic.svg|thumb|200px|In the [[Age of Discovery]] (Age of Exploration), the Dutch were the first non-natives to [[List of Dutch inventions and discoveries#Explorations|undisputedly explore and map many unknown isolated areas]] of the world, including Jan Mayen and the [[History of Svalbard|Svalbard archipelago]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].]]\n====First verified discoveries: mapping and naming====\n[[File:C.G.

The Dutchman Fopp Gerritsz, whilst in command of a whaling expedition sent out by the Englishman John Clarke, of [[Dunkirk]], claimed (in 1631) to have discovered the island on June 28 and named it \"Isabella\".<ref name=\"Hacq\">Louwrens Hacquebord, \"The Jan Mayen Whaling Industry\" in ''Jan Mayen Island in Scientific Focus'', Stig Skreslet, editor, Springer Verlag 2004</ref><ref name=\"Holland\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Holland\n|first=Clive\n|title=Arctic Exploration and Development, c. 500 B.C. to 1915: an encyclopedia\n|publisher=Garland\n|year=1994\n|location=New York\n|url=\n|page=\n}}</ref><ref>Hart, S.

Two of its ships, financed by merchants from [[Amsterdam]] and [[Enkhuizen]], reached Jan Mayen in July 1614. The captains of these ships\u2014[[Jan Jacobszoon May van Schellinkhout]] on the ''Gouden Cath'' (Golden Cat), and Jacob de Gouwenaer on the ''Orangienboom'' (Orange Tree)\u2014named it ''Mr. Joris Eylant'' after the Dutch cartographer [[Joris Carolus]] who was on board and mapped the island. The captains acknowledged that a third Dutch ship, the ''Cleyn Swaentgen'' (Little Swan) captained by Jan Jansz Kerckhoff and financed by ''Noordsche Compagnie'' shareholders from [[Delft]], had already been at the island when they arrived. They had assumed the latter, who named the island ''Maurits Eylandt'' (or Mauritius) after [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]], would report their discovery to the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]]. However, the Delft merchants had decided to keep the discovery secret and returned in 1615 to hunt for their own profit. The ensuing dispute was only settled in 1617, though both companies were allowed to whale at Jan Mayen in the meantime.<ref name=\"Hacq\" />\n\nIn 1615, the English whaler [[Robert Fotherby]] went ashore.

Only two ships, one from the ''Noordsche Compagnie'', and the other from the Delft merchants, were off Jan Mayen in 1615. The following year a score of vessels were sent to the island. The ''Noordsche Compagnie'' sent eight ships escorted by three warships under Jan Jacobsz. Schrobop; while the Delft merchants sent up five ships under Adriaen Dircksz. Leversteyn, son of one of the above merchants.<ref name = \"Muller\">Samuel Muller. 1874. ''Geschiedenis van de Noordsche Compagnie.'' Gebr van der Post.</ref> There were also two ships from Dunkirk sent by John Clarke, as well as a ship each from London and Hull.\n\nHeertje Jansz, master of the ''Hope'', of Enkhuizen, wrote a day-by-day account of the season. The ships took two weeks to reach Jan Mayen, arriving early in June. On 15 June they met the two English ships, which Schrobop allowed to remain, on condition they gave half their catch to the Dutch.<ref name=\"Dalg\u00e5rd\">Sune Dalg\u00e5rd. 1962.

By late July the first ship had left with a full cargo of [[whale oil]]; the rest left early in August, several filled with oil.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.geuzebroek.info/walvisvaart_1616.htm\n|title=Journaal van schipper Heertgen Jansz d anno 1616\n|language=Dutch\n|accessdate=2012-07-11\n}}</ref>\n\nThat year 200 men were seasonally living and working on the island at six temporary whaling stations (spread along the northwest coast). During the first decade of whaling more than ten ships visited Jan Mayen each year, while in the second period (1624 and later) five to ten ships were sent. With the exception of a few ships from Dunkirk, which came to the island in 1617 and were either driven away or forced to give a third of their catch to the Dutch,<ref name = \"Dalg\u00e5rd\" /> only the Dutch and merchants from Hull<ref>Appleby, John C. \"Conflict, cooperation and competition: The rise and fall of the Hull whaling trade during the seventeenth century\". ''The Northern Mariner'', XVIII No. 2, (April 2008), 23-59.</ref> sent up ships to Jan Mayen from 1616 onward. In 1624 ten wooden houses were built in [[Titeltbukta|South Bay]]. About this time the Dutch appear to have abandoned the temporary stations consisting of tents of sail and crude furnaces, replacing them with two semi-permanent stations with wooden storehouses and dwellings and large brick furnaces, one in the above-mentioned South Bay and the other in the [[Engelskbukta (Jan Mayen)|North Bay]]. In 1628 two forts were built to protect the stations.<ref name=\"Hacq\" /> Among the sailors active at Jan Mayen was the later admiral [[Michiel Adriaensz de Ruyter]]. In 1633, at the age of 26, he was for the first time listed as an officer aboard ''de Groene Leeuw'' (The Green Lion). He again went to Jan Mayen in 1635, aboard the same ship.\n\n[[File:Altes Grabkreuz f\u00fcr einen tapferen Holl\u00e4nder.png|thumb|Old cross on the grave of seven Dutchmen, reading \"Here rest brave Dutch men\"]]\nIn 1632 the ''Noordsche Compagnie'' expelled the Danish-employed Basque whalers from Spitsbergen. In revenge, the latter sailed to Jan Mayen, where the Dutch had left for the winter, to plunder the Dutch equipment and burn down the settlements and factories. Captain Outger Jacobsz of [[Grootebroek]] was asked to stay the next winter (1633/34) on Jan Mayen with six shipmates to defend the island. While a group with the same task survived the winter on Spitsbergen, all seven on Jan Mayen died of [[scurvy]] or [[trichinosis]] (from eating raw polar bear meat) combined with the harsh conditions.\n\nDuring the first phase of whaling the hauls were generally good, some exceptional. For example, Mathijs Jansz. Hoepstock caught 44 whales in [[Hoepstockbukta]] in 1619, which produced 2,300 casks of whale oil. During the second phase the hauls were much lower. While 1631 turned out to be a very good season, the following year, due to the weather and ice, only eight whales were caught. In 1633 eleven ships managed to catch just 47 whales; while a meager 42 were caught by the same number in 1635.<ref name=\"Hacq\" /> The [[bowhead whale]] was locally hunted to near-extinction around 1640 (approximately 1000 had been killed and processed on the island),<ref name=\"Hacq\" /> at which time Jan Mayen was abandoned and stayed uninhabited for two and a half centuries.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n[[File:Jan Mayen-Stations-en1 1.svg|thumb|Map of settlements on Jan Mayen]]\nDuring the [[International Polar Year]] 1882&ndash;1883 the [[Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition]] stayed one year at Jan Mayen. The expedition performed extensive mapping of the area, their maps being of such quality that they were used until the 1950s. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]]n polar station on Jan Mayen Island was built and equipped in 1882 fully at [[Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek|Count Wilczek's]] own expense.\n\n[[Polar bear]]s appear on Jan Mayen,<ref>Michael Jones and Kenneth Olwig. 2008.

Between 1900 and 1920, there were a number of Norwegian trappers spending winters on Jan Mayen, hunting [[Arctic fox]]es in addition to some polar bears.

The four-man team on Jan Mayen stayed at their posts and in an act of defiance began sending their weather reports to the [[United Kingdom]] instead of Norway. The British codenamed Jan Mayen 'Island X' and attempted to reinforce it with troops to counteract any [[Nazi Germany|German]] attack. The Norwegian patrol boat {{HNoMS|Fridtjof Nansen|1930|6}} ran aground on [[Nansenflua]], one of the islands' many uncharted lava reefs and the 68-man crew abandoned ship and joined the Norwegian team on shore. The British expedition commander, prompted by the loss of the gunboat, decided to abandon Jan Mayen until the following spring and radioed for a rescue ship. Within a few days a ship arrived and evacuated the four Norwegians and their would-be reinforcements after demolishing the weather station to prevent it from falling into German hands. The Germans attempted to land a weather team on the island on 16 November 1940. The German [[naval trawler]] carrying the team crashed on the rocks just off Jan Mayen after a patrolling British [[destroyer]] had picked them up on radar. This was not a coincidence as the German plan had been compromised from the beginning with British wireless interceptors of the Radio Security Service following the communications of the [[Abwehr]] (the German Intelligence service) concerning the operation and the destroyer had  been waiting.<ref>TNA HW 19/37~~~~</ref> Most of the crew struggled ashore and were taken prisoner by a landing party from the destroyer.<ref name=\"Rigge\" />\n\n[[File:Jan mayen sign hg.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional signpost with directions to civilization on Jan Mayen station]]\n[[Allies of World War II|The Allies]] returned to the island on 10 March 1941, when the Norwegian ship ''Veslekari'', escorted by the patrol boat ''Honningsvaag'', dropped 12 Norwegian weathermen on the island. The team's radio transmissions soon betrayed its presence to the [[Axis Powers|Axis]], and German planes from Norway began to bomb and strafe Jan Mayen whenever weather would permit it, though they did little damage.  Soon supplies and reinforcements arrived and even some anti-aircraft guns, giving the island a garrison of a few dozen weathermen and soldiers. By 1941, Germany had given up hope of evicting the Allies from the island and the constant air raids stopped.\n\nOn 7 August 1942, a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] \"Condor\", probably on a mission to bomb the station, smashed into the nearby mountainside of Danielssenkrateret in fog, killing all nine crew members.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://home.online.no/~vteigen/planecrash.html \n |title=The crash site at Danielssenkrateret \n |accessdate=2012-07-11 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004043357/http://home.online.no/~vteigen/planecrash.html \n |archivedate=2012-10-04 \n |df= \n}}</ref> In 1950, the wreck of another German plane with four crew members was discovered on the southwest side of the island.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.jan-mayen.no/history.htm\n|title=Jan Mayen History\n|accessdate=2014-05-29\n}}</ref> In 1943, the Americans established a radio locating station named Atlantic City in the north to try to locate [[Greenland in World War II|German radio bases in Greenland]].\n\nAfter the war, the meteorological station was located at Atlantic City, but moved in 1949 to a new location. Radio Jan Mayen also served as an important radio station for ship traffic in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. In 1959, [[NATO]] decided to build the [[LORAN-C]] network in the Atlantic Ocean, and one of the transmitters had to be on Jan Mayen. By 1961, the new military installations, including a new airfield, were operational.\n\nFor some time, scientists doubted if there could be any activity in the Beerenberg volcano, but in 1970 the volcano erupted, and added another {{convert|3|km2|abbr=on}} of land mass to the island during the three-to-four weeks it lasted. It had more eruptions in 1973 and 1985. During an eruption, the sea temperature around the island may increase from just above freezing to about {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}.\n\nHistoric stations and huts on the island are Hoyberg, Vera, Olsbu, [[Puppebu]] (cabin), Gamlemetten or Gamlestasjonen (the old weather station), Jan Mayen Radio, Helenehytta, Margarethhytta, and Ulla (a cabin at the foot of the Beerenberg).\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Nature reserve===\nA regulation dating from 2010 renders the island a nature reserve under Norwegian jurisdiction.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/md/xd-20101119-1456.html\n|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804194515/http://www.lovdata.no/for/sf/md/xd-20101119-1456.html\n|dead-url=yes\n|archive-date=2012-08-04\n|title=FOR 2010-11-19 nr 1456: Forskrift om fredning av Jan Mayen naturreservat\n|language=Norwegian\n|accessdate=2012-07-11\n}}</ref> The aim of this regulation is to ensure the preservation of a pristine Arctic island and the marine life nearby, including the ocean floor. Landings at Jan Mayen can be done by boat. However, this is permitted only at a small part of the island, named B\u00e5tvika (Boat Bay). As there is no commercial airline operating at the island, one cannot get there by plane except by [[Air charter|chartering one]]. Admission for landings by a charter plane has to be obtained in advance. Admission to stay on the island has to be obtained in advance, and is generally limited to a few days (or even hours). Putting up a tent or setting up camp is prohibited.

Nord-Jan has a round shape and is dominated by the {{convert|2277|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high [[Beerenberg]] volcano with its large [[ice cap]] ({{convert|114.2|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), which can be divided into twenty individual outlet glaciers.  The largest of those is [[S\u00f8rbreen]], with an area of {{convert|15|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a length of {{convert|8.7|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.  South-Jan is narrow, comparatively flat and unglaciated. Its highest elevation is [[Rudolftoppen]] at {{convert|769|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The station and living quarters are located on South-Jan.  The island lies at the northern end of the [[Jan Mayen Microcontinent]]. The [[Continental fragment|microcontinent]] was originally part of the [[Greenland Plate]], but now forms part of the [[Eurasian Plate]]. In terms of land area, it is approximately twice the size of [[Liechtenstein]] with the addition of [[San Marino]].\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island was identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it is a breeding site for large numbers of [[seabird]]s, supporting populations of [[northern fulmar]]s (78,000\u2013160,000 pairs), [[little auk]]s (10,000\u2013100,000 pairs), [[thick-billed guillemot]] (74,000\u2013147,000 pairs) and [[black guillemot]]s (100\u20131,000 pairs).<ref name=bli>{{cite web |url= http://www.birdlife.org |title= Jan Mayen island |accessdate=2013-08-22 |work= Important Bird Areas factsheet |first= |last= |publisher= BirdLife International |year=2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nJan Mayen has a hyperoceanic [[Climate of the Arctic|polar]] climate, similar to Greenland and Svalbard, with a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen classification]] of ''ET''.

Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.\n\nThe [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Conn\u00e9table]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the Assembly of the [[States of Jersey]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl\u00e9es paroissiales'').

It does, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey is part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]].

This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (96.8&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was \u221210.3&nbsp;\u00b0C (13.5&nbsp;\u00b0F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5&nbsp;\u00b0C (101.3&nbsp;\u00b0F) in [[Faversham]], [[Kent]] on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of [[England]] during the summer months.\nSnow falls rarely in Jersey; some years will pass with no snow fall at all.\n\nThe terrain consists of a [[plateau]] sloping from long sandy bays in the south to rugged cliffs in the north.

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the States of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.\n\nJersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its \"Zero/Ten\" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm|title=Harmful tax competition \u2013 Taxation and Customs Union \u2013 European Commission|website=Taxation and Customs Union}}</ref> at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The [[European Commission]] has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited \"political\" authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.\n\nJersey is ranked as a [[tax haven]] by many organisations with the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ranking Jersey as 16th, one rank behind the United Kingdom {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.\n\n===Currency===\n[[File:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Automatic teller machine|cash machines]] at a bank that dispensed a choice of [[Bank of England]] or Jersey banknotes.

Following [[Napol\u00e9on III|Louis Napol\u00e9on]]'s coup of 1851, more French ''proscrits'' arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

In 2015, Jersey's first ever national survey of religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have [[irreligion|no religion]], with only small handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure. Of those that specified a denomination of Christianity, equal proportions were 'Catholic' or 'Roman Catholic' (43%) as were 'Anglican' or 'Church of England' (44%).

In the countryside, [[Methodism]] found its traditional stronghold. A substantial minority of [[Catholic Church in Jersey|Roman Catholics]] can also be found in Jersey. There are two Catholic private combined primary and secondary schools: [[De La Salle College, Jersey|De La Salle College]] in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]] is an all-boys school, and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Saviour is an all-girls school; and [[Faithful Companions of Jesus|FCJ]] primary school in St. Saviour.

During the 20th century, [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural influence]] saw an intense [[language shift]] take place and Jersey today is predominantly [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]].<ref name=\"Facts about Jersey\"/> J\u00e8rriais nonetheless survives; around 2,600 islanders (three percent) are reckoned to be habitual speakers, and some 10,000 (12 percent) in all claim some knowledge of the language, particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes. There have been efforts to revive J\u00e8rriais in schools, and the highest number of declared J\u00e8rriais speakers is in the capital.\n\n[[File:Lillie langtry.JPG|thumb|upright|Actress [[Lillie Langtry]], nicknamed the ''Jersey Lily''.]]\nThe [[dialect]]s of J\u00e8rriais differ in [[phonology]] and, to a lesser extent, [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in J\u00e8rriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. [[Anglicisation]] of the [[place names]] increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.\n\nSome [[Neolithic]] carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey.

''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop. ''Bourd\u00e9lots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Ni\u00e8r beurre|l\u00e9 ni\u00e8r beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced.

The number, size, and visible locations of these megalithic monuments (especially [[La Hougue Bie]]) have suggested that social organisation over a wide area, including surrounding coasts, was required for the construction.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands. The claim was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. The King of England gave up claim to mainland Normandy and appointed a Warden, a position now termed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and a [[bailiff]] to govern in his stead. The Channel Islands were never absorbed into the Kingdom of England. However the churches in Jersey were left under the control of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances|Diocese of Coutances]] for another 300 years.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe existing Norman customs and laws were allowed to continue, with the exception that the ultimate head of the legal system was the King of England rather than the Duke of Normandy. There was no attempt to introduce English law. The law was conducted through 12 jurats, constables (''conn\u00e9table'') and a bailiff (''Baill\u00e9'').

His troops succeeded in breaching the outer defences, forcing the garrison back to the keep. The garrison came to an agreement that they would surrender if not relieved by [[Michaelmas]] and du Guesclin sailed back to Brittany, leaving a small force to carry on the siege. An English relief fleet arrived in time.<ref>Ford (2004), p. 23</ref> On 7 October 1406, 1,000 French men at arms led by Pero Nino, a Castilian nobleman turned corsair, invaded Jersey, landing at St Aubin's Bay and defeated the 3,000 defenders but failed to capture the island.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|50\u20131}}\n\nThe rise of [[Joan of Arc]] inspired France to evict the English from mainland France, with the exception of Calais, putting Jersey back in the front line.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|54}} The French did not succeed in capturing Jersey during the Hundred Years' War, but by taking advantage of the split in England during the [[Wars of the Roses]] captured Mont Orgueil in the summer of 1461, allegedly as part of a secret deal between [[Margaret of Anjou]] and [[Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9]] to gain French support for the Lancastrian cause. The island was held by the French until 1468, when Yorkist forces and [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey|local militia]] were able to recapture the castle.<ref>Watts (2004), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nDue to the island's strategic importance to the English crown, the islanders were able to negotiate, over a number of centuries, the right to retain privileges and improve on certain benefits, such as trade rights, from the King.\n\n==Reformation to the civil war==\nDuring the 16th century, ideas of the reformation of the church coupled with the split with the Catholic Faith by [[Henry VIII of England]], resulted in the islanders adopting the [[Protestant]] religion, in 1569 the churches moved under the control of the [[Diocese of Winchester]].<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|81}} [[Calvinism]] in Jersey meant that life became very austere. Laws were strictly enforced, punishment for wrong doers was severe, but education was improved.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|83\u20136}}\n\nThe excommunication of [[Elizabeth I of England]] by the Pope increased the military threat to the island and the increasing use of gunpowder on the battlefield meant that the fortifications on the island had to be adapted. A new fortress was built to defend [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St Aubin's Bay]], the new [[Elizabeth Castle]] was named after the queen by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] when he was governor. The island militia was reorganised on a parish basis and each parish had two cannon which were usually housed in the church - one of the [[Saint Peter, Jersey|St Peter]] cannon can still be seen at the bottom of Beaumont Hill.\n\n[[Image:Map of Jersey by G Mercator 1639..JPG|thumb|250px|This map of Jersey, published in 1639, shows interior details such as Le Mont \u00e8s Pendus (the gallows hill, now called Westmount).

The civil war also divided Jersey, and while the sympathy of islanders lay with Parliament, the de Carterets (see Sir [[George Carteret]] and Sir [[Philippe de Carteret II]]) held the island for the king.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] visited the island in 1646 and again in October 1649 following the [[Trial and execution of Charles I|trial and execution]] of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In the Royal Square in [[Saint Helier|St. Helier]] on 17 February 1649, Charles was publicly proclaimed king after his father's death (following the first public proclamation in Edinburgh on 5 February 1649).<ref>{{cite book |first=Maija |last=Jansso |title=Art and Diplomacy: Seventeenth-Century English Decorated Royal Letters to Russia and the Far East |publisher=BRILL, 2015 |ISBN=9789004300453 |page=204}}</ref> Parliamentarian forces eventually captured the island in 1651 and Elizabeth Castle seven weeks later.

The Jersey merchants built up a thriving business empire in the Newfoundland and [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] fisheries. Companies such as Robins and the Le Boutilliers set up thriving businesses.\n\n==18th century==\n[[Image:Jersey round tower.jpg|thumb|left|Round towers were built along the coasts to protect the Island from French attack.]]\nBy the 1720s, a discrepancy in coinage values between Jersey and France was threatening economic stability. The States of Jersey therefore resolved to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the [[Liard (coin)|liard]] to six to the [[Sou (coin)|sou]]. The legislation to that effect implemented in 1729 caused popular riots that shook the establishment.<ref>*''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> The devaluation was therefore cancelled.\n\nThe [[Chamber of Commerce]] founded 24 February 1768 is the oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nThe ''Code'' of 1771 laid down for the first time in one place the extant laws of Jersey, and from this time, the functions of the Royal Court and the States of Jersey were delimited, with sole legislative power vested in the States.\n\n[[Methodism]] arrived in Jersey in 1774, brought by fishermen returning from [[Newfoundland]]. Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but King George III refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1789, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] in 1809.\n\n[[Image:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', [[John Singleton Copley]], 1782-1784.]]\n\nThe 18th century was a period of political tension between Britain and France, as the two nations clashed all over the world as their ambitions grew. Because of its position, Jersey was more or less on a continuous war footing.\n\nDuring the [[American Wars of Independence]], two attempted invasions of the island were made. In 1779, the Prince of Orange [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] was prevented from landing at St Ouen's Bay; on 6 January 1781, a force led by [[Baron de Rullecourt]] captured St Helier in a daring dawn raid, but was defeated by a British army led by Major [[Francis Peirson]] in  the [[Battle of Jersey]]. A short-lived peace was followed by the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which, when they had ended, had changed Jersey forever. In 1799-1800, over 6000 Russian troops under the command of [[Charles du Houx de Viom\u00e9nil]] were quartered in Jersey after an evacuation of Holland.\n\nThe first printing press was introduced to Jersey in 1784.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Jersey cattle judging-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jersey cattle]] were developed as a breed during the 19th century. Judging the quality of cows remains a feature of rural life.]]\n\nThe number of English-speaking soldiers stationed on the island and the number of retired officers and English-speaking labourers who came to the islands in the 1820s led to the island gradually moving towards an English-speaking culture in the town.\n\nThe ''[[livre tournois]]'' had been used as the legal [[currency]] for centuries. However, it was abolished during the [[French Revolution]]ary period. Although the coins were no longer minted, they remained the legal currency in Jersey until 1837, when dwindling supplies and consequent difficulties in trade and payment obliged the adoption of the [[Jersey pound|pound sterling]] as [[legal tender]].\n\nThe military roads constructed (on occasion at gunpoint in the face of opposition from landowners) by the governor, [[George Don (British Army officer)|General George Don]], to link coastal fortifications with St. Helier harbour had an unexpected effect on agriculture once peace restored reliable trade links. Farmers in previously isolated valleys were able to swiftly transport crops grown in the island's [[microclimate]] to waiting ships and then on to the markets of London and Paris ahead of the competition. In conjunction with the introduction of [[steamship]]s and the development of the French and British [[railway]] systems, Jersey's agriculture was no longer as isolated as before.\n\nThe population of Jersey rose rapidly, from 47,544 in 1841 to 56,078 20 years later, despite a 20% mortality rate amongst new born children. Life expectancy was 35 years. Both immigration and emigration increased.<ref name=\"RL\"/>{{rp|186}}\n\nThe town expanded with many new streets and houses in a Georgian style, in 1843 it was agreed to erect street names. The Theatre Royal was built, as were [[Victoria College, Jersey]] in 1852 and extensions to the harbour, which were called Victoria Harbour.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|181\u20135}} Jersey issued its first coins in 1841, and exhibited 34 items at [[The Great Exhibition]] in 1851, the world's first ever [[Pillar box]] was installed in 1852 and a paid police force was created in 1854.<ref name=RL/>{{rp|178\u2013185}}\n\n[[File:Jersey Railway map.png|thumb|250px|Map of the former railway lines of Jersey]]\nTwo railways, the [[Jersey Railway|Jersey Western Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Jersey_Western_Railway|title=Jersey Western Railway - theislandwiki|website=www.theislandwiki.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> in 1870, and the [[Jersey Eastern Railway]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theislandwiki.org/index.php/Jersey_Eastern_Railway|title=Jersey Eastern Railway - theislandwiki|website=www.theislandwiki.org|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref> in 1874, were opened.

The eastern railway closed in 1926 and the western railway in 1936 after a fire disaster that year.\n\nJersey was the fourth-largest shipbuilding area in the 19th-century [[British Isles]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/jersey/3345299.stm|title=Tourism schooner plans unveiled|date=24 December 2003|publisher=|accessdate=24 February 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> building over 900 vessels around the island. Shipbuilding declined with the coming of iron ships and steam. A number of banks on Jersey, guarantors of an industry both onshore and off, failed in 1873<ref name=RL/>{{rp|193}} and 1886, even causing strife and discord in far-flung societies. The population fell slightly in the 20 years to 1881.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the former thriving [[cider]] and wool industries declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - [[Jersey cattle]] and [[Jersey Royal]] potatoes. The former was the product of careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke. \n\nThe anarchist philosopher, [[Peter Kropotkin]], who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]''.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of [[tourism]] as an important industry (linked with the improvement in passenger ships)<ref name=RL/>{{rp|196}} which reached its climax in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s.\n\n==20th century==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[New World Tapestry]].

The years before the First World War saw the foundation of cultural institutions, the Battle of Flowers and the Jersey Eisteddfod. The first aeroplanes arrived in Jersey in 1912.\n\nIn 1914, the British garrison was withdrawn at the start of the war and the militia were mobilised. Jersey men served in the British and French armed forces. Numbers of German prisoners of war were interned in Jersey. The influenza epidemic of 1918 added to the toll of war.\n\nIn 1919, [[imperial measurements]] replaced, for the most part, the tradition Jersey system of weights and measures; women aged over 30 were given the vote; and the endowments of the ancient grammar schools were repurposed as scholarships for Victoria College.\n\nIn 1921, the visit of King [[George V]] was the occasion for the design of the parish crests.\n\nIn 1923, the British government asked Jersey to contribute an annual sum towards the costs of the Empire. The States of Jersey refused and offered instead a one-off contribution to war costs. After negotiations, Jersey's one-off contribution was accepted.\n\nThe first motor car had arrived in 1899, and by the 1930s, competition from motor buses had rendered the railways unprofitable, with final closure coming in 1935 (except for the later German reintroduction of rail during the military occupation).

Twenty died as a result. The islanders endured near-starvation in the winter of 1944-45, after the Channel Islands had been cut off from German-occupied Europe by Allied forces advancing from the Normandy beachheads, avoided only by the arrival of the [[Red Cross]] supply ship ''Vega'' in December 1944.

The island of Jersey has an area of 119 square kilometres, with 70 kilometres of coastline.  Jersey claims a territorial sea of {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}} and an exclusive fishing zone of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nJersey is the largest and southernmost of the [[Channel Islands]].  It is located north of [[Brittany]] and west of the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in [[Normandy]].  About 30% of the population of the island is concentrated in [[Saint Helier]], which is a parish and the [[Capital city|capital]] town of the island.\n\n==Physical geography==\nBesides the main island, the bailiwick includes [[List of islands of the Bailiwick of Jersey|other islets and reefs]] with no permanent population: [[\u00c9cr\u00e9hous|Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous]], [[Minquiers|Les Minquiers]], [[Pierres de Lecq|Les Pierres de Lecq]], [[Les Dirouilles]]. \n\nThe highest point in the island is [[Les Platons]] on the north coast, at {{convert|136|m|ft|0}}. Parts of the parish of [[Saint Clement, Jersey|St Clement]] in the south were previously below sea-level but the construction of a seawall and infilling of low land has probably left only a few pockets of land below mean sea level. The terrain is generally low-lying on the south coast, with some rocky [[headland]]s, rising gradually to rugged cliffs along the north coast.  On the west coast there are [[sand dune]]s.  Small valleys run north to south across the island.  Very large tidal variation exposes large expanses of sand and rock to the southeast at low tide.\n\nSnow falls rarely in Jersey; some years will pass with no snow fall at all. \n\n{{Weather

In 1839 for example, {{convert|268199|impgal|L}} of cider were exported from [[Jersey]] to England alone,<ref>''Balleine's History of Jersey'', {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> but by 1870 exports from Jersey had slumped to {{convert|4632|impgal|L}}.<ref>''The Triumph of the Country'', Kelleher, Jersey 1994, {{ISBN|0-9518162-4-1}}</ref> Beer had replaced cider as a fashionable drink in the main export markets, and even the home market had switched to beer as the population became more urban. Potatoes overtook cider as the most important crop in Jersey in the 1840s. Small-scale cider production on farms for domestic consumption, particularly by seasonal workers from Brittany and mainland Normandy, was maintained, but by the mid-20th century production dwindled until only eight farms were producing cider for their own consumption in 1983.<ref>Jersey Society in London, Bulletin, 1983</ref> The number of orchards had been reduced to such a level that the destruction of trees in the Great Storm of 1987 demonstrated how close the Islands had come to losing many of its traditional cider apple varieties. A concerted effort was made to identify and preserve surviving varieties and new orchards were planted. As part of diversification, farmers have moved into commercial cider production, and the cider tradition is celebrated and marketed as a heritage experience.\n\n===Textiles===\nThe [[knitting]] of woollen garments was a thriving industry for Jersey during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/knitting/regional/index.html Regional Knitting in the British Isles and Ireland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027131353/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/fashion/features/knitting/regional/index.html |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Ship building===\nJersey was the 4th largest ship building area in the 19th century [[British Isles]]. See [[History of Jersey]].\n\n==Historical exchange rates==\nJersey pounds per US dollar - 0.55 (2005), 0.6981 (January 2002), 0.6944 (2001), 0.6596 (2000), 0.6180 (1999), 0.6037 (1998), 0.6106 (1997); the Jersey pound is at par with the British pound.\n\n==Taxation==\nUntil the twentieth century, the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey. The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) was in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol. The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% for decades.\n\nHistorically, no [[Value added tax|VAT]] was levied in Jersey, with the result that luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France. This provided an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT also led to the growth of a [[Fulfillment house|fulfilment]] industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported in a manner [[Value-Added-Tax-free imports from the Channel Islands|avoiding VAT on arrival]], thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005 the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. The States of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) in 2008. Although this is a form of VAT, it has been charged at a much lower rate than UK or French VAT, and as such Jersey's fulfilment industry continues.\n\nThe strategy for introducing the new GST tax was to fill a 'black hole' in the budget that was created by the introduction of a new 0/10 tax that replaced the old tax system that previously exempted foreign investors from corporation tax and levied a 20% rate on Jersey residents. The new 0/10 tax exempts all businesses except those in financial services from having to pay any corporation tax (0%), while leaving the financial services to pay a low tax rate (10%). The income generated from the new 0/10 tax proposal will not be equal to the revenue of the original tax system and this leaves Jersey with a deficit in its budget of several million pounds.\n\nTo fill the deficit created by the changes made to Jersey's tax structure, the States of Jersey introduced GST.\nGST is added to most goods and services, which has raised the cost of living. The people hit the hardest by the new GST will be the people on the lowest incomes, however, to try to prevent islanders living below the poverty line, the States of Jersey introduced an Income Support service in January 2008.\n\nIt is arguable that the people who benefit from Jersey's new tax structure are the owners of the large businesses that are separate or support the financial service based businesses. This is because they do not have to pay any corporation tax but will still benefit from the island's business.<ref>8 March 2005 Proposition P44/2005: [http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/documents/propositions/14968-27446-832005.htm Fiscal Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030501/http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/documents/propositions/14968-27446-832005.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}\n\n* 12 May 2005\n** [http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/view_vote.asp?id_number=197 Amendment &mdash;

There were two stations in St Helier: {{rws|St Helier (Weighbridge)}} (JR) and {{rws|St Helier (Snow Hill)}} (JER).\n\nAfter closure, most of the infrastructure was removed and today little evidence remains of these railways. A small number of former station buildings are still standing, including St Helier Weighbridge, which is now in use as the [[Liberty Wharf]] shopping centre, and [[St Aubin railway station]], which is used today as the Parish Hall of [[Saint Br\u00e9lade]]. Part of the former Jersey Railway line from St Aubin to Corbi\u00e8re has been converted into a [[rail trail]] for cyclists and walkers.\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|German military occupation 1940\u20131945]], light railways were re-established by the Germans for the purpose of supplying coastal fortifications. A one-metre gauge line was laid down following the route of the former Jersey Railway from Saint Helier to [[La Corbi\u00e8re]], with a branch line connecting the stone quarry at Ronez in [[Saint John, Jersey|Saint John]]. A 60cm line ran along the west coast, and another was laid out heading east from Saint Helier to [[Gorey, Jersey|Gorey]]. The first line was opened in July 1942, the ceremony being disrupted by passively resisting Jersey spectators.<ref>Cruickshank, Charles G. (1975) ''The German Occupation of the Channel Islands'', The Guernsey Press, {{ISBN|0-902550-02-0}}</ref> The German railway infrastructure was dismantled after the Liberation in 1945.\n\nTwo railways operate at the [[Pallot Heritage Steam Museum]]; a standard gauge heritage steam railway, and a narrow gauge pleasure line operated by steam-outline diesel motive power.\n\n==Road transport==\n{{main|Roads in Jersey}}\n\n'''[[Highway]]s:'''\n<br>''total:''\n577&nbsp;km (1995)\n<br>''paved:''\nNA km\n<br>''unpaved:''\nNA km\n\n=== Buses ===\n{{main|LibertyBus}}\n[[File:LibertyBus in Jersey.JPG|thumb|A double-decker bus in St. Brelade, Jersey]]\nBuses are operated by CT Plus Jersey, a local subsidiary of [[HCT Group]]. Bus service routes radiate from the Liberation Station in St Helier.\n\nIn 2012, it was announced that [[CT Plus]] would take over the operation of the bus service, commencing on 2 January 2013, ending 10 years of Connex service in Jersey. This new service is called [[LibertyBus]].\n\n===Cycling===\nJersey has a well sign posted Island Cycle Network. A [[Trail|traffic-free route for cyclists and pedestrians]] links Saint Helier to [[La Corbi\u00e8re]] and a branch of this route ends up at St Peter's village passing Jersey Airport.\n\n===Driving===\n[[File:Jersey Traffic-Sign \u00bbGreen Lane\u00ab.Jpg|thumb|A ''green lane'' sign.|upright]]\n[[File:License plate of Jersey (UK).jpg|200px|thumb|Jersey vehicle number plate]]\nDriving is on the left hand side. The maximum speed limit throughout the entire island is 40&nbsp;mph (64&nbsp;km/h), with slower limits on certain stretches of road, such as 20/30&nbsp;mph (32/48&nbsp;km/h) in built up areas and 15&nbsp;mph (24&nbsp;km/h) on roads designated as ''green lanes''.\n\nVisitors wishing to drive must possess a Certificate of Insurance or an International Green Card, a valid Driving Licence or International Driving Permit (UK International Driving Permits are not valid). Photocopies are not acceptable. A nationality plate must be displayed on the back of visiting vehicles.\n\nIt is an offence to hold a mobile phone whilst driving a moving vehicle.  Where fitted, all passengers inside a vehicle must wear a seat belt at all times, regardless of whether they are sitting in the front or the rear.\n\nThe penalties for drinking and driving in Jersey are up to \u00a32,000 fine or 6 months in prison for the first offence plus unlimited disqualification of driving licence. It is an offence to drive whilst under the influence of drugs. Since July 2014 it has also been illegal to smoke in any vehicle carrying passengers under the age of 18. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-28305726|title=Smoking banned in cars with children|author=|date=15 July 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Parking===\n\nSingle yellow lines indicate that parking is prohibited and is liable to a fine. \n\nPaycards are used to pay for parking throughout Jersey with the exception of the harbour, airport and waterfront car parks where a pay upon exit scheme is operated. Paycards require scratching off the appropriate day, date, month, and time.\n\nPayment by paycards is required for parking wherever the paycard symbol is displayed.

Hawaiians]], is an [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]] currently administered by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]. Johnston Atoll is a National Wildlife Refuge and is closed to public entry. Limited access for management needs is only by Letter of Authorization from the U.S. Air Force and Special Use Permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nFor nearly 70 years, the atoll was under the control of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]]. During that time, it was variously used as a naval refueling depot, an [[Johnston Island Air Force Base|airbase]], a nuclear and biological weapons testing site, a secret missile base, and a chemical weapon and [[Agent Orange]] storage and disposal site. These activities left the area environmentally contaminated and remediation and monitoring continue.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Midway.jpg|thumb|Johnston Atoll is located between the Marshall Islands and the Hawaiian Islands]]\n\nThe Johnston Atoll is a deserted {{convert|1300|ha|adj=mid}} [[atoll]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]] located about {{convert|750|nmi|lk=on}} southwest of the island of Hawai'i and is grouped as one of the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]].<ref name=\"factbook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html|title=United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges|publisher=|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref> The atoll, which is located on a [[coral reef]] platform, has four islands.

They located guano on the atoll in March 1858 and they proceeded to claim the island.<ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. insular areas application of the U.S. Constitution : report to the chairman, Committee on Resources, House of Representatives.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwSHlQ4hzDEC&pg=PA51|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-1-4289-7935-2|pages=51\u2013}}</ref> By 1858, Johnston Atoll was claimed by both the United States and the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. In June 1858, Samuel Allen, sailing on the ''Kalama'', tore down the [[U.S. flag]] and raised the [[Hawaiian flag]] renaming the atoll '''Kalama'''.

On January 16, 1893, the Hawaiian [[Legation]] at London reported a diplomatic conference over this temporary occupation of the island.

A board shed was built on the southeast side of the larger island, and a small [[tramway track|tramline]] run up onto the slope of the low hill, to facilitate the removal of guano.

Two years later in December 1959, the Secretary of Defense approved the Secretary of the Treasury's request to use Sand Island for U.S. Coast Guard LORAN A and C station sites. The USCG was granted permission to install a LORAN A and C station on Sand Island to be manned by U.S. Coast Guard personnel through June 30, 1992. The permit for a LORAN station to operate on Johnston Island was terminated in 1962. On November 1, 1957, a new United States Coast Guard [[LORAN#LORAN-A and other systems|LORAN-A]] station was commissioned. By 1958, the Coast Guard LORAN Station at Sand Island began transmitting on a 24-hour basis, thus establishing a new LORAN rate in the Central Pacific. The new rate between Johnston Island and [[French Frigate Shoals]] gave a higher order of accuracy for fixing positions in the steamship lanes from Oahu, Hawaii, to Midway Island. In the past, this was impossible in some areas along this important shipping route. The U.S. Coast Guard LORAN-A Station on Sand Island ceased transmitting on June 30, 1961 when the station began transmitting from the [[LORAN-C#Data channel (ldc)|LORAN-C]] station and was using a larger 625-foot antenna by 1979.  \n\nThe LORAN-C station was disestablished on July 1, 1992, and all Coast Guard personnel, electronic equipment, and property departed the atoll that month. Buildings on Sand Island were transferred to other activities. LORAN whip antennas on Johnston and Sand Islands were removed, and the 625-foot LORAN tower and antenna were demolished on December 3, 1992. The LORAN A and C station and buildings on Sand Island were then dismantled and removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loran-history.info/Johnston_Island/johnston_island.htm|title=Loran Station Johnson Island|author=|date=|website=www.loran-history.info|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Jtimeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnstonmemories.com/usacap/life/history/jahistory.html|title=History of Johnston Atoll Timeline|publisher=|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===National nuclear weapon test site 1958\u20131963===\n{{See also|Operation Fishbowl|Operation Dominic|Operation Hardtack I}}\n\n====Successes====\nBetween 1958 and 1975, Johnston Atoll was used as an American national [[nuclear test]] site for atmospheric and extremely [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]]s in [[outer space]].

The first launch in \"Operation Fishbowl\" was a successful research and development launch with no [[warhead]]. In the end, \"Operation Fishbowl\" produced four successful high-altitude detonations: \"[[Starfish Prime]]\", \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Checkmate|Checkmate]]\", \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill Triple Prime|Bluegill Triple Prime]]\", and \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Kingfish|Kingfish]]\". In addition, it produced one atmospheric nuclear explosion, \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Tightrope|Tightrope]].\"\n\nOne of these, \"Starfish Prime\" on July 9, 1962, had a 1.4-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] explosion, using a [[W49]] warhead at an altitude of about {{convert|400|km|abbr=off|sp=us}}. It created a very brief fireball visible over a wide area, and also bright artificial auroras that were visible for several minutes in Hawaii. \"Starfish Prime\" also produced an [[nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] that disrupted some [[electric power]] and [[communication system]]s in Hawaii. It also pumped enough radiation into the [[Van Allen belts]] to destroy or damage seven [[satellite]]s in orbit.\n\nThe final Fishbowl launch that used a Thor missile carried the \"Kingfish\" 400-kiloton warhead up to its {{convert|98|km|adj=mid|sp=us}} detonation altitude. Although it was officially one of the Operation Fishbowl tests, it is sometimes not listed among high-altitude nuclear tests because of its lower detonation altitude. \"Tightrope\" was the final test of Operation Fishbowl and detonated on November 3, 1962. It launched on a [[MIM-14 Nike-Hercules|nuclear-armed Nike-Hercules]] missile, and it was detonated at a lower altitude than the other tests:\n\n\"At Johnston Island, there was an intense white flash.

The second launch of the Fishbowl series, \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill|Bluegill]]\", carried an active warhead. Bluegill was \"lost\" by a defective range safety tracking radar and had to be destroyed 10 minutes after liftoff even though it probably ascended successfully. The subsequent nuclear weapon launch failures from Johnston Atoll caused serious contamination to the island and surrounding areas with [[Weapons-grade nuclear material|weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] that remains an issue to this day.\n\nThe failure of the \"Bluegill\" launch created in effect a [[dirty bomb]] but did not release the nuclear warhead's plutonium debris onto Johnston Atoll as the missile fell into the ocean south of the island and was not recovered. However, the \"Starfish\", \"Bluegill Prime\", and \"Bluegill Double Prime\" test launch failures in 1962 scattered radioactive debris over Johnston Island contaminating it, the lagoon, and Sand Island with plutonium for decades.<ref name=\"Nautilus\">{{cite web|url=http://nautilus.org/apsnet/cleaning-up-johnston-atoll/|title=\"Cleaning up Johnston Atoll\", APSNet Special Reports, November 25, 2005|work=Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Birds\"/>\n\n[[File:Contaminated Johnston Island Launch Emplacement 1, Bluegill Prime, Thor failure, July 25, 1962..jpg|thumb|Johnston Island Launch Emplacement One (LE1) after a Thor missile launch failure and explosion contaminated the island with Plutonium during the Operation \"Bluegill Prime\" nuclear test, July, 1962]]\n\n\"[[Operation Fishbowl#Starfish|Starfish]]\", a high altitude Thor launched nuclear test scheduled for June 20, 1962, was the first to contaminate the atoll. The rocket with the 1.45-megaton Starfish device (W49 warhead and the [[W76|MK-4]] [[Atmospheric entry|Re-entry vehicle]]) on its nose was launched that evening, but the Thor missile engine cut out only 59 seconds after launch. The range safety officer sent a destruct signal 65 seconds after launch, and the missile was destroyed at approximately {{convert|10.6|km|abbr=off}} altitude. The warhead high explosive detonated in 1-point safe fashion, destroying the warhead without producing nuclear yield. Large pieces of the plutonium contaminated missile including pieces of the warhead, booster rocket, engine, re-entry vehicle and missile parts fell back on Johnston Island. More wreckage along with plutonium contamination was found on nearby Sand Island.\n\n\"[[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill Prime|Bluegill Prime]],\" the second attempt to launch the payload which failed last time was scheduled for 23:15 (local) on July 25, 1962. It too was a genuine disaster and caused the most serious plutonium contamination on the island. The Thor missile was carrying one pod, two re-entry vehicles and the [[W50 (nuclear warhead)|W50]] nuclear warhead. The missile engine malfunctioned immediately after ignition, and the range safety officer fired the destruct system while the missile was still on the launch pad. The Johnston Island launch complex was demolished in the subsequent explosions and fire which burned through the night. The launch emplacement and portions of the island were contaminated with radioactive plutonium spread by the explosion, fire and wind-blown smoke.\n\n[[File:Dominic Bluegill Prime radiation cleanup.jpg|thumb|left|Inspection of Thor rocket engine remains on Johnston Island after failure of \"Bluegill Prime\" nuclear test attempt, July 1962]]\n\nAfterward, the Johnston Island launch complex was heavily damaged and contaminated with plutonium. Missile launches and nuclear testing halted until the radioactive debris was dumped and soils were recovered and the launch emplacement rebuilt. Three months of repairs, decontamination, and rebuilding the LE1 as well as the backup pad LE2 were necessary before tests could resume. In an effort to continue with the testing program, U.S. troops were sent in to do a rapid cleanup. The troops scrubbed down the revetments and launch pad, carted away debris and removed the top layer of coral around the contaminated launch pad. The plutonium-contaminated rubbish was dumped in the lagoon, polluting the surrounding marine environment. More than 550 drums of contaminated material were dumped in the ocean off Johnston from 1964\u20131965. At the time of the Bluegill Prime disaster, the top fill around the launch pad was scraped by a bulldozer and grader. It was then dumped into the lagoon to make a ramp, so the rest of the debris could be loaded onto landing craft to be dumped out into the ocean. An estimated 10 percent of the plutonium from the test device was in the fill used to make the ramp. Then the ramp was covered and placed into a {{convert|25|acre|m2|abbr=on}} landfill on the island during 1962 dredging to extend the island. The lagoon was again dredged in 1963\u20131964 and used to expand Johnston Island from {{convert|220|acre|abbr=on}} to {{convert|625|acre|abbr=on}} recontaminating additional portions of the island.\n\n[[File:Thor missile at Johnston Island.jpg|thumb|PGM-17 Thor missile at Johnston Island]]\nOn October 15, 1962 the \"[[Operation Fishbowl#Bluegill Double Prime|Bluegill Double Prime]]\" test also misfired. During the test, the rocket was destroyed at a height of 109,000 feet after it malfunctioned 90 seconds into the flight. U.S. Defense Department officials confirm that when the rocket was destroyed, it contributed to the radioactive pollution on the island.\n\nIn 1963, the U.S. Senate ratified the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|Limited Test Ban Treaty]], which contained a provision known as \"Safeguard C\". Safeguard C was the basis for maintaining Johnston Atoll as a \"ready to test\" above-ground nuclear testing site should atmospheric nuclear testing ever be deemed to be necessary again. In 1993, Congress appropriated no funds for the Johnston Atoll \"Safeguard C\" mission, bringing it to an end.\n\n===Anti-satellite mission 1962\u20131975===\n{{main article|Program 437}}\nProgram 437 turned the [[PGM-17 Thor]] into an operational anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon system, a capability that was kept top secret even after it was deployed. The Program 437 mission was approved for development by U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] on November 20, 1962 and based at the Atoll. Program 437 used modified Thor missiles that had been returned from deployment in Great Britain and was the second deployed U.S. operational nuclear anti-satellite operation. Eighteen more suborbital Thor launches took place from Johnston Island during the 1964\u20131975 period in support of Program 437. In 1965\u20131966 four Program 437 Thors were launched with 'Alternate Payloads' for satellite inspection. This was evidently an elaboration of the system to allow visual verification of the target before destroying it. These flights may have been related to the late 1960s Program 922, a non-nuclear version of Thor with infrared homing and a high-explosive warhead. Thors were kept positioned and active near the two Johnston Island launch pads after 1964. However, partly because of the [[Vietnam War]], in October 1970 the Department of Defense had transferred Program 437 to standby status as an economic measure. The [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] led to [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] that prohibited 'interference with national means of verification', which meant that ASAT's were not allowed, by treaty, to attack Russian spy satellites. Thors were removed from Johnston Atoll and were stored in mothballed war-reserve condition at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] from 1970 until the anti-satellite mission of Johnston Island facilities was ceased on August 10, 1974, and the program was officially discontinued on April 1, 1975, when any possibility of restoring the ASAT program was finally terminated.

Built to incinerate chemical munitions on the island, planning started in 1981, construction began in 1985, and was completed five years later. Following completion of construction and facility characterization, JACADS began operational verification testing (OVT) in June 1990. From 1990 until 1993, the Army conducted four planned periods of Operational Verification Testing (OVT), required by Public Law 100-456. OVT was completed in March 1993, having demonstrated that the reverse assembly incineration technology was effective and that JACADS operations met all environmental parameters. The OVT process enabled the Army to gain critical insight into the factors that establish a safe and effective rate of destruction for all munitions and agent types. Only after this critical testing period did the Army proceed with full-scale disposal operations at JACADS. Transition to full-scale operations started in May 1993 but the facility did not begin full-scale operations until August 1993.\n\nAll of the chemical weapons once stored on Johnston Island were demilitarized and the agents incinerated at JACADS with the process completing in 2000 followed by the destruction of legacy hazardous waste material associated with chemical weapon storage and cleanup. JACADS was demolished by 2003 and the island was stripped of its remaining infrastructure and environmentally remediated.<ref name=\"cma.army.mil\"/>\n{{-}}\n===Closure and remaining structures===\nIn 2003, structures and facilities, including those used in JACADS, were removed, and the runway was marked closed. The last flight out for official personnel was June 15, 2004. After this date, the base was completely deserted, with the only structures left standing being the Joint Operations Center (JOC) building at the east end of the runway, chemical bunkers in the weapon storage area and at least one [[Quonset hut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mark in the Pacific \u2013 The Last Day|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~markinthepacific/id5.html|accessdate=April 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBuilt in 1964, the JOC is a four-floor concrete and steel administration building for the island that has no windows and was built to withstand a [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale|category IV]] [[tropical cyclone]] as well as atmospheric nuclear tests. The building remains standing but was gutted entirely in 2004, during an [[asbestos abatement]] project. All doors of the JOC except one have been welded shut. The ground floor has a side building attached which served as a facility for decontamination that contained three long snaking corridors and 55 shower heads one could walk through during decontamination.<ref name=\"Hurricane\"/>\n\nRows of bunkers in the Red Hat Storage Area remain intact; however, an agreement was established between the U.S. Army and EPA Region IX on August 21, 2003, that the Munitions Demilitarization Building (MDB) at JACADS would be demolished and the bunkers in the RHSA used for disposal of construction rubble and debris. After placement of the debris inside the bunkers, they were secured and the entries blocked with a concrete block barrier (a.k.a. [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]] Block) to prevent access to the bunker interior.<ref name=\"Baseline\"/>\n\n===Contamination and cleanup===\n\nOver the years, leaks of Agent Orange as well as chemical weapon leaks in the weapon storage area occurred where caustic chemicals such as [[sodium hydroxide]] were used to mitigate toxic agents during cleanup. Larger spills of nerve and mustard agent within the MCD at JACADS also took place. Small releases of chemical weapon components from JACADS were cited by the EPA. Multiple studies of the Johnston Atoll environment and ecology have been conducted and the Atoll is likely the most studied island in the Pacific.<ref name=\"Baseline\"/>\n\nDr. Lisa Lobel's work at the Atoll on the impact of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] contamination in reef [[damselfish]] (''Abudefduf sordidus'') demonstrated that [[embryo]]nic abnormalities could be used as a metric for comparing contaminated and uncontaminated areas.<ref name=Lobel2011>{{cite journal |author=Lobel, Lisa K |title=Toxic Caviar: Using Fish Embryos to Monitor Contaminant Impacts |journal=In: Pollock NW, ed.

The contaminated launch site was stripped, the debris gathered and buried in the island's 1962 expansion. A comprehensive radiological survey was completed in 1980 to record transuranic contamination remaining from the 1962 THOR missile aborts. The Air Force also initiated research on methods to remove dioxin contamination from soil resulting from leakage of the stored Herbicide Orange.<ref name=\"Baseline\"/> Since then, U.S. defense authorities have surveyed the island in a series of studies.\n\nContaminated structures were dismantled and isolated within the former THOR Launch Emplacement No. 1 (LE-1) as a start for the cleanup program. About 45,000 tons of soil contaminated with radioactive isotopes was collected and placed into a fenced area covering {{convert|24|acres|abbr=on}} on the north of the island.

The collected radioactive soil and other debris was buried in a landfill created within the former LE-1 area from June 2002 through November 11, 2002. Remediation at the Radiation Control Area included the construction of a 61-centimeter-thick cap of coral sealing the landfill.

The stripped Johnston Island was briefly offered for sale with several deed restrictions in 2005 as a \"residence or vacation getaway,\" with potential usage for \"eco-tourism\" by the GSA's Office of Real Property Utilization and Disposal. The proposed sale included the unique postal zip code 96558, formerly assigned to the Armed Forces in the Pacific. The proposed sale did not include running water, electricity, or activation of the closed runway.

The islands were wired with 13 outgoing and 10 incoming commercial telephone lines, a 60-channel submarine cable, 22 DSN circuits by satellite, an [[Autodin]] with standard remote terminal, a digital telephone switch, the [[Military Auxiliary Radio System|Military Affiliated Radio System]] (MARS station), a UHF/VHF air-ground radio, and a link to the Pacific Consolidated Telecommunications Network (PCTN) satellite. [[Amateur radio]] operators occasionally transmitted from the island, using the KH3 [[Call sign|call-sign]] prefix.<ref name=\"Memorieshistory\"/> The United States Undersea Cable Corporation were awarded contracts to lay underwater cable in the Pacific.

These cables were manufactured by the Simplex Wire and Cable Company with the repeaters being supplied by Felten and Guilleaume. In 1993 a satellite communication ground station was added to augment the atolls communications capability.\n\nJohnston Atoll's economic activity was limited to providing services to American military and contractor personnel residing on the island. The Island was regularly resupplied by ship or barge and all foodstuffs and manufactured goods were imported. The base had six 2.5-megawatt (MW) electrical generators using diesel engines. The runway was also available to commercial airlines for emergency landings (a fairly common event), and for many years it was a regular stop on Continental Micronesia airline's \"island hopper\" service between Hawaii and the Marshall Islands.\n\nThere were no official license plates issued for use on Johnston Atoll. U.S. government vehicles were issued U.S. government license plates and private vehicles retained the plates from which they were registered.

politically, the area has also been referred to in the [[Western world|West]] as the [[Middle East|Middle]] or [[Near East]]. The territory of [[Jordan]] now covers about {{convert|91,880|sqkm}}.\n\nBetween 1950 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, although not widely recognized, Jordan claimed and administered an additional {{convert|5,880|sqkm}} encompassing the West Bank; in 1988 and with continuing Israeli occupation, [[King Hussein]] relinquished Jordan's claim to the West Bank in favor of the [[Palestinians]].\n\nJordan is landlocked except at its southern extremity, where nearly {{convert|26|km}} of shoreline along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] provide access to the [[Red Sea]].\n\n'''[[Geographic coordinates]]:'''\n{{coord|31|00|N|36|00|E|type:country}}\n\n==Boundaries==\n[[File:Jordan Topography.png|thumb|350px|[[Borders of Jordan]].]]\nExcept for small sections of the borders with Israel and Syria, Jordan's international boundaries do not follow well-defined natural features of the terrain. The country's boundaries were established by various international agreements and with the exception of the border with Israel, none was in dispute in early 1989.\n\nJordan's boundaries with Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia do not have the special significance that the border with Israel does; these borders have not always hampered tribal nomads in their movements, yet for a few groups borders did separate them from traditional grazing areas and delimited by a series of agreements between the United Kingdom and the government of what eventually became Saudi Arabia) was first formally defined in the Hadda Agreement of 1925.\n\nIn 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded an agreement that realigned and delimited the boundary. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about {{convert|18|km}}. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.\n\n==Topography==\n[[File:Middle East Topographic Political EN.svg|thumb|A satellite map of the Middle East with Jordan in the center.]]\n[[File:Salt, Jordan.jpg|thumb|A village near [[Al-Salt]] in the [[Balqa Governorate]].]]\n[[File:wadirum66.jpg|thumb|[[Wadi Rum]] in Southern Jordan.]]\n\nThe country consists mainly of a [[plateau]]<!--How is it called?--> between {{convert|700|m}} and {{convert|1,200|m}} meters high, divided into [[ridge]]s by [[valley]]s and [[Canyon|gorges]], and a few mountainous areas. West of the plateau, land descents form the East Bank of  the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. The valley is part of the north-south [[Great Rift Valley]], and its successive depressions are [[Lake Tiberias]] (Sea of Galilee; its bottom is about {{convert|-258|m}}), [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], the [[Dead Sea]] (its bottom is about {{convert|-730|m}}), [[Arabah]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] at the [[Red Sea]]. Jordan's western border follows the bottom of the rift. Although an earthquake-prone region, no severe shocks had been recorded for several centuries.\n\nBy far the greatest part of the East Bank is [[desert]], displaying the land forms and other features associated with great aridity. Most of this land is part of the [[Syrian Desert]] and northern [[Arabian Desert]]. There are broad expanses of [[sand]] and [[dune]]s, particularly in the south and southeast, together with [[salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]. Occasional jumbles of sandstone hills or low mountains support only meager and stunted vegetation that thrives for a short period after the scanty winter rains. These areas support little life and are the least populated regions of Jordan.\n\nThe drainage network is coarse and incised. In many areas the relief provides no eventual outlet to the sea, so that [[sediment|sedimentary deposits]] accumulate in basins where moisture evaporates or is absorbed in the ground. Toward the depression in the western part of the East Bank, the desert rises gradually into the Jordanian Highlands\u2014a steppe country of high, deeply cut limestone plateaus with an average elevation of about 900 meters. Occasional summits in this region reach 1,200 meters in the northern part and exceed 1,700 meters in the southern part; the highest peak is [[Jabal Ramm]] at 1,754 meters (though the highest peak in all of Jordan is [[Jabal Umm al Dami]] at 1854 meters.  It is located in a remote part of southern Jordan). These highlands are an area of long-settled villages.\n\nThe western edge of this plateau country forms an escarpment along the eastern side of the [[Jordan River]]-Dead Sea depression and its continuation south of the Dead Sea. Most of the [[wadi]]s that provide drainage from the plateau country into the depression carry water only during the short season of winter rains. Sharply incised with deep, canyon-like walls, whether flowing or dry the wadis can be formidable obstacles to travel.\n\nThe [[Jordan River]] is short, but from its mountain headwaters (approximately 160 kilometers north of the river's mouth at the Dead Sea) the riverbed drops from an elevation of about 3,000 meters above sea level to more than 400 meters below sea level. Before reaching Jordanian territory the river forms the [[Sea of Galilee]], the surface of which is 212 meters below sea level. The Jordan River's principal tributary is the [[Yarmouk River]]. Near the junction of the two rivers, the Yarmouk forms the boundary between Israel on the northwest, Syria on the northeast, and Jordan on the south. The [[Zarqa River]], the second main tributary of the Jordan River, flows and empties entirely within the East Bank.\n\nA 380-kilometer-long rift valley runs from the Yarmouk River in the north to Al Aqaba in the south. The northern part, from the Yarmouk River to the Dead Sea, is commonly known as the Jordan Valley. It is divided into eastern and western parts by the Jordan River. Bordered by a steep escarpment on both the eastern and the western side, the valley reaches a maximum width of twenty-two kilometers at some points. The valley is properly known as ''Al Ghawr'' or ''Al Ghor'' (the depression, or valley).\n\nThe rift valley on the southern side of the Dead Sea is known as the Southern ''Ghawr'' and the Wadi al Jayb (popularly known as the Wadi al Arabah). The Southern Ghawr runs from Wadi al Hammah, on the south side of the Dead Sea, to Ghawr Faya, about twenty-five kilometers south of the Dead Sea. Wadi al Jayb is 180 kilometers long, from the southern shore of the Dead Sea to Al Aqaba in the south. The valley floor varies in level. In the south, it reaches its lowest level at the Dead Sea (more than 400 meters below sea level), rising in the north to just above sea level. Evaporation from the sea is extreme due to year-round high temperatures. The water contains about 250&nbsp;grams of dissolved salts per liter at the surface and reaches the saturation point at 110 meters.\n\nThe Dead Sea occupies the deepest depression on the land surface of the earth. The depth of the depression is accentuated by the surrounding mountains and highlands that rise to elevations of 800 to 1,200 meters above sea level. The sea's greatest depth is about 430 meters, and it thus reaches a point more than 825 meters below sea level. A drop in the level of the sea has caused the former [[Lisan Peninsula]] to become a land bridge dividing the sea into separate northern and southern basins.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Jordan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|A [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] map of Jordan.]]\n[[File:jordan232.jpg|right|thumb|The countryside near [[Al-Salt|Salt]].]]\n[[File:Jordansnow9.jpg|thumb|Snow in Amman.]]\nThe major characteristic of the climate is the contrast between a relatively rainy season from November to April and very dry weather for the rest of the year. With hot, dry, uniform summers and cool, variable winters during which practically all of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs, the country has a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean-style climate]].\n\nIn general, the farther inland from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] a given part of the country lies, the greater are the seasonal contrasts in temperature and the less rainfall. [[Atmospheric pressure]]s during the summer months are relatively uniform, whereas the winter months bring a succession of marked low pressure areas and accompanying [[cold front]]s. These cyclonic disturbances generally move eastward from over the Mediterranean Sea several times a month and result in sporadic precipitation.\n\nMost of the East Bank receives less than {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain a year and may be classified as a dry [[desert]] or [[steppe]] region. Where the ground rises to form the highlands east of the Jordan Valley, precipitation increases to around {{convert|300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the south and {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more in the north. The [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]], lying in the lee of high ground on the West Bank, forms a narrow climatic zone that annually receives up to {{convert|300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain in the northern reaches; rain dwindles to less than {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} at the head of the [[Dead Sea]].\n\nThe country's long summer reaches a peak during August. January is usually the coolest month. The fairly wide ranges of temperature during a twenty-four-hour period are greatest during the summer months and have a tendency to increase with higher elevation and distance from the Mediterranean seacoast. Daytime temperatures during the summer months frequently exceed {{convert|36|\u00b0C|1}} and average about {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1}}. In contrast, the winter months\u2014November to April\u2014bring moderately cool and sometimes cold weather, averaging about {{convert|13|\u00b0C|1}}. Except in the rift depression, frost is fairly common during the winter, it may take the form of snow at the higher elevations of the north western highlands. Usually it [[snow]]s a couple of times a year in western [[Amman]].\n\nFor a month or so before and after the summer dry season, hot, dry air from the desert, drawn by low pressure, produces strong winds from the south or southeast that sometimes reach [[gale]] force. Known in the Middle East by various names, including the khamsin, this dry, sirocco-style wind is usually accompanied by great dust clouds. Its onset is heralded by a hazy sky, a falling [[barometer]], and a drop in relative humidity to about 10 percent. Within a few hours there may be a {{convert|10|F-change}} to {{convert|15|F-change}} rise in temperature. These windstorms ordinarily last a day or so, cause much discomfort, and destroy [[crop]]s by desiccating them.\n\nThe [[Shamal (wind)|shamal]], another wind of some significance, comes from the north or northwest, generally at intervals between June and September. Remarkably steady during daytime hours but becoming a breeze at night, the shamal may blow for as long as nine days out of ten and then repeat the process. It originates as a dry continental mass of polar air that is warmed as it passes over the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. The dryness allows intense heating of the Earth's surface by the sun, resulting in high daytime temperatures that moderate after sunset.\n\n==Area and boundaries==\n'''Area:'''\n<br>''total:'' 89,342&nbsp;km\u00b2\n<br>''land:''  88,802&nbsp;km\u00b2\n<br>''water:'' 540&nbsp;km\u00b2\n\n'''Land boundaries:'''\n<br>''total:'' 1,744&nbsp;km\n<br>''border countries:''\n[[Iraq]] 179&nbsp;km, [[Israel]] 307&nbsp;km, [[Saudi Arabia]] 731&nbsp;km, [[Syria]] 379&nbsp;km, [[West Bank]] 148&nbsp;km\n\n'''Coastline:''' 26&nbsp;km\n<br />''note:''\nJordan also borders the Dead Sea, for {{convert|50|km}}\n\n'''Maritime claims:'''\n<br>''territorial sea:''\n{{convert|3|nmi|3|abbr=on|lk=in}}\n\n'''Elevation extremes:'''\n<br>''lowest point:''  [[Dead Sea]] \u2212408 m\n<br>''highest point:'' [[Jabal Umm ad Dami]] 1,854 m\n\n==Resources and land use==\n[[Image:Phosphate Mines in Jordan ast 2005258.jpg|upright|thumb|Phosphate Mines in Jordan, east of the southerly Dead Sea]]\n'''Natural resources:''' [[phosphate]]s, [[potash]], [[oil shale]]\n\n'''Land use:'''\n<br>''[[arable land]]:''\n2.41%\n<br>''permanent crops:''\n0.97%\n<br>''other:''\n96.62% (2012)\n\n'''[[Irrigated land]]:'''\n788.6&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2004)\n\n'''Total renewable water resources:'''\n0.94&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\n'''Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):'''\n<br>''total:''\n0.94&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr (31%/4%/65%)\n<br>''per capita:''\n166 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2005)\n\n==Environmental concerns==\nDroughts; occasional minor earthquakes in areas close to the Jordan Rift Valley\n\n'''Environment \u2013 current issues:'''\nlimited natural fresh water resources and [[water stress]]; [[deforestation]]; [[overgrazing]]; [[soil erosion]]; [[desertification]]\n\n'''Environment \u2013 international agreements:'''\n<br>''party to:''\n[[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Kyoto Protocol|Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Marine Dumping]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Wetlands]]\n<br>''signed, but not ratified:''\nnone of the selected agreements\n\n==See also==\n* [[Winston's Hiccup]]\n* [[Borders of Jordan]]\n\n==References==\n* {{loc}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Jordan topics}}\n{{Geography of Asia}}\n{{Asia topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Jordan| ]]", "sha1": "1k9b5ib7gynek80ho9ep7t5nghapbkj"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Jordan", "ns": "0", "id": "15717", "revision": {"id": "862937085", "parentid": "862934221", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T17:52:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Alex Cohn", "id": "60778"}, "comment": "Reverted good faith edits by [[Special:Contributions/DanielaAlonso2|DanielaAlonso2]] ([[User talk:DanielaAlonso2|talk]]): Every Jordanian Christian is ethnically Arab?

Jordan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] based on the [[constitution]] promulgated on January 8, 1952. The king exercises his power through the government he appoints which is responsible before the [[Parliament of Jordan|Parliament]]. \n\nKing Abdullah has been sovereign since the death of his father in 1999. [[Omar Razzaz]] has been Prime Minister since 4 June 2018.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[King of Jordan|King]]\n|[[Abdullah II of Jordan]]\n|\n|7 February 1999\n|-\n|[[Prime Minister of Jordan|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Omar Razzaz]]\n|[[Independent (politician)|Independent]]\n|4 June 2018\n\n|}\nThe [[Constitution of Jordan]] vests [[executive authority]] in the [[King of Jordan|king]] and in his [[Cabinet of Jordan|cabinet]]. The king signs, executes, and [[veto]]es all laws. The king may also suspend or dissolve parliament, and shorten or lengthen the term of session. A veto by the king may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses of parliament at his discretion, most recently in November 2009.<ref name=\"Freedom House\">Freedomhouse.org http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2010&country=7849</ref> The king appoints and may dismiss all judges by decree, approves [[constitutional amendment|amendment]]s to the constitution after passing by both parliaments, declares [[war]] and acts as the supreme leader of the [[Military of Jordan|armed forces]]. Cabinet decisions, [[court]] judgments, and the national [[currency]] are issued in his name. The Cabinet, led by a [[prime minister]], was formerly appointed by the king, but following the [[2011 Jordanian protests]], King Abdullah agreed to an elected cabinet. The cabinet is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]] on matters of general policy; a two-thirds vote of \"[[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]]\" by the Chamber can force the cabinet to resign.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n[[Legislature|Legislative]] power rests in the [[bicameral]] National Assembly. The [[National Assembly of Jordan|National Assembly]] (''Majlis al-Umma'') has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The [[Chamber of Deputies of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]] (''Majlis al-Nuwaab'') has 130 members, elected for a four-year terms in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] with 15 seats reserved for women by a special electoral college. In addition nine seats are reserved for Christians and three for [[Chechen people|Chechens]]/[[Circassians]]. While the Chamber of Deputies is elected by the people, its main legislative abilities are limited to approving, rejecting, or amending legislation with little power to initiate laws.<ref name=\"Freedom House\" /> The [[Senate of Jordan|Assembly of Senators]] (''Majlis al-Aayan'') has 65 members appointed by the King for a four-year term. The Assembly of Senators is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies and can be removed by a \"[[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]\".\n\nPolitical factions or blocs in the Jordanian parliament change with each parliamentary election and typically involve one of the following affiliations; a democratic Marxist/Socialist faction, a mainstream liberal faction, a moderate-pragmatic faction, a mainstream conservative faction, and an extreme conservative faction (such as the [[Islamic Action Front]]).\n\nThe Jordanian Chamber of Deputies is known for brawls between its members, including acts of violence and the use of weapons. In September 2013 Representative [[Talal al-Sharif]] tried to shoot one of his colleagues with an assault rifle while at the parliamentary premises.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tamer al-Samadi |url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/security/2013/09/jordan-violence-parliament-tribal.html |title=Jordan MP Fires Kalashnikov  In Parliament |publisher=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=25 September 2013 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Judicial branch==\nThe judiciary is completely independent from the other two branches of the government.  The constitution provides for three categories of courts\u2014[[civil court|civil]] (in this case meaning \"regular\"), religious, and special. Regular courts consist of both civil and criminal varieties at the first level\u2014First Instance or Conciliation Courts, second level\u2014Appelette or Appeals Courts, and the Cassation Court which is the highest judicial authority in the kingdom. There are two types of religious courts: Sharia courts which enforce the provisions of Islamic law and civil status, and tribunals of other religious communities officially recognized in Jordan.\n\n==Political conditions==\n[[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] ruled Jordan from 1953 to 1999, surviving a number of challenges to his rule, drawing on the loyalty of his military, and serving as a symbol of unity and stability for both the Jordanians and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] communities in Jordan. King Hussein ended [[martial law]] in 1989 and ended suspension on [[Political party|political parties]] that was initiated following the loss of the West Bank to Israel and in order to preserve the status quo in Jordan. In 1989 and 1993, Jordan held free and fair [[parliament]]ary elections. Controversial changes in the election law led [[Islamist]] parties to boycott the 1997, 2011 and 2013 elections.\n\n[[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah II]] succeeded his father Hussein following the latter's death in February 1999. Abdullah moved quickly to reaffirm Jordan's [[peace treaty]] with [[Israel]] and its relations with the [[United States]]. Abdullah, during the first year in power, refocused the government's agenda on economic reform.\n\nJordan's continuing structural economic difficulties, burgeoning population, and more open political environment led to the emergence of a variety of political parties. Moving toward greater independence, Jordan's parliament has investigated corruption charges against several regime figures and has become the major forum in which differing political views, including those of political Islamists, are expressed.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, it was announced that King Abdullah had dismissed his government.  This has been interpreted as a pre-emptive move in the context of the Tunisian Jasmine Revolution and unfolding events in nearby Egypt.\n\n==Decentralization==\n[[King Abdullah II]] and the Jordanian Government began the process of decentralization, with the [[Madaba]] governorate as the pilot project, on the regional level dividing the nation into three regions: North, Central, and South. The [[Greater Amman Municipality]] will be excluded from the plan but it will set up a similar decentralization process.  Each region will have an elected council that will handle the political, social, legal, and economic affairs of its area.  This decentralization process is part of Jordan's Democratization Program.\n\n==Corruption==\n{{further|Corruption in Jordan|International rankings of Jordan}}\nJordan ranked 47th out of 180 nations in the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].  The Constitution of Jordan states that no member of Parliament can have any financial or business dealings with the government and no member of the royal family can be in the government.  However, corruption remains a problem in Jordan despite progress.  Corruption cases are examined by the Anti-Corruption Commission and then referred to the judiciary for legal action.  Corruption in Jordan takes the form of [[nepotism]], favouritism, and [[bribery]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nAdministratively, Jordan is divided into twelve [[governor]]ates (''muhafazat'', singular\u2014''muhafazah''), each headed by a governor appointed by the king. They are the sole authorities for all government departments and development projects in their respective areas:\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n#[[Ajlun]]\n#[[Aqaba]]\n#[[Balqa]]\n#[[Al Karak|Karak]]\n#[[Mafraq]]\n#[[Amman]]\n#[[Tafilah]]\n#[[Zarqa]]\n#[[Irbid]]\n#[[Jerash]]\n#[[Ma'an]]\n#[[Madaba]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa|ABEDA]],  [[Arab Cooperation Council|ACC]], [[AFESD]], [[Arab League|AL]], [[Arab Monetary Fund|AMF]], [[Council of Arab Economic Unity|CAEU]], CCC, [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization|CTBTO]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia|ESCWA]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICC]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], IDB, [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[Intelsat]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] (observer), [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] (correspondent), [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] (partner), [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNMIBH]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan|UNMOT]], [[United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia|UNOMIG]], [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UNRWA]], [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|UNTAET]], [[World Tourism Organization|UNWTO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], WTrO\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/constitution_jo.html Constitution of Jordan]\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Middle_East/Jordan/Government|Jordan Government}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Politics of}}\n{{Jordan topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Jordan}}\n[[Category:Politics of Jordan| ]]", "sha1": "5sy6nhb4yv2g07162jy0n8cfpcaw050"}}, {"title": "Economy of Jordan", "ns": "0", "id": "15719", "revision": {"id": "866648404", "parentid": "866648029", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T17:11:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Thomas.W", "id": "3045327"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/81.153.154.31|81.153.154.31]] ([[User talk:81.153.154.31|talk]]): Rv unsourced and unexplained inflation of numbers (see IP's contributions for a lot more of the same).", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country = Jordan<ref name=\"CIA World Fact Book -

The main obstacles to Jordan's economy are scarce water supplies, complete reliance on oil imports for energy, and regional instability. Just over 10% of its land is [[arable land|arable]] and the water supply is limited. [[Rainfall]] is low and highly variable, and much of Jordan's available ground water is not renewable. Jordan's economic resource base centers on [[phosphate]]s, [[potash]], and their fertilizer derivatives; [[tourism]]; overseas remittances; and foreign aid. These are its principal sources of hard currency earnings. Lacking coal reserves, hydroelectric power, large tracts of forest or commercially viable oil deposits, Jordan relies on natural gas for 93% of its domestic energy needs. Jordan used to depend on Iraq for oil until the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Jordan also has a plethora of industrial zones producing goods in the [[textile]], [[aerospace]], [[Defense (industry)|defense]], [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]], [[pharmaceutical]], and [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] sectors.\n\nIn the last few years Jordan's economic growth has slowed, averaging around 2%. Jordan's total foreign debt in 2011 was $19 billion, representing 60% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 93.4% of its GDP.<ref name=\"instability1\">{{cite web|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/sada/?fa=63061&mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRovsqvMZKXonjHpfsX67uUoXaSg38431UFwdcjKPmjr1YoGRcR0aPyQAgobGp5I5FEIQ7XYTLB2t60MWA%3D%3D#comments|title=Jordan is Sliding Toward Insolvency|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=2016-03-18|work=KIRK H.

About 4 percent of Jordan\u2019s labor force worked in the agricultural sector in 2002. The most profitable segment of Jordan\u2019s agriculture is fruit and vegetable production (including tomatoes, cucumbers, citrus fruit, and bananas) in the Jordan Valley. The rest of crop production, especially cereal production, remains volatile because of the lack of consistent rainfall. Fishing and forestry are negligible in terms of the overall domestic economy. The fishing industry is evenly divided between live capture and aquaculture; the live weight catch totaled just over 1,000 metric tons in 2002. The forestry industry is even smaller in economic terms; approximately 240,000 total cubic meters of roundwood were removed in 2002, the vast majority for fuelwood.<ref name=cp>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Jordan.pdf \"Country Profile: Jordan\"]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (September 2006). {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\n===Mining and minerals===\nPotash and phosphates are among the country\u2019s main economic exports. In 2003 approximately 2 million tons of potash salt production translated into US$192 million in export earnings, making it the second most lucrative [[export good|exported good]]. Potash production totaled 1.9 million tons in 2004 and 1.8 million tons in 2005. In 2004 approximately 6.75 million tons of phosphate rock production generated US$135 million in export earnings, placing it fourth on Jordan\u2019s principal export list. With production totaling 6.4 million tons in 2005, Jordan was the world\u2019s third largest producer of raw phosphates. In addition to these two major minerals, smaller quantities of unrefined salt, copper ore, gypsum, [[manganese]] ore, and the mineral precursors to the production of ceramics (glass sand, clays, and feldspar) are also mined.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n[[Image:View into a different reality.jpg|thumb|A [[recycling]] project situated a few kilometres outside [[Amman]]. The men who work there are usually immigrants who work for a few hundred pounds a month in a dangerous working environment, full of toxic fumes where they are required to carry out hard manual tasks.]]\n\nThe industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, construction, and power, accounted for approximately 26 percent of gross domestic product in 2004 (including manufacturing, 16.2 percent; construction, 4.6 percent; and mining, 3.1 percent). More than 21 percent of the country\u2019s labor force was reported to be employed in this sector in 2002. The main industrial products are potash, phosphates, pharmaceuticals, cement, clothes, and fertilizers. The most promising segment of this sector is construction. In the past several years, demand has increased rapidly for housing and offices of foreign enterprises based in Jordan to better access the Iraqi market. The manufacturing sector has grown as well (to nearly 20 percent of GDP by 2005), in large part as a result of the United States\u2013Jordan Free Trade Agreement (ratified in 2001 by the U.S. Senate); the agreement has led to the establishment of approximately 13 [[Qualifying Industrial Zone]]s (QIZs) throughout the country. The QIZs, which provide duty-free access to the U.S. market, produce mostly light industrial products, especially ready-made garments. By 2004 the QIZs accounted for nearly US$1.1 billion in exports according to the Jordanian government.<ref name=cp/>\n\nJordan's free trade agreement (FTA) with the US \u2013 the first in the Arab world \u2013 has already made the US one of Jordan's most significant markets. By 2010, it would have barrier-free export access in almost all sectors. A number of trade agreements with countries in the Middle Eastern and North African regions and beyond should also reap increasing benefits, not in the least the Agadir Agreement, which is seen as a precursor to an FTA with the EU. Jordan also recently signed an FTA with Canada. Furthermore, Jordan\u2019s plethora of industrial zones offering tax incentives, low utility costs and improved infrastructure links are helping incubate new developments. The relatively high skills level is also a key factor in promoting investment and stimulating the economy, particularly in value-added sectors. Despite the fact that Jordan has few natural resources it does benefit from abundant reserves of potash and phosphates, which are widely used in the production of fertilisers. Exports by these industries are expected to have a combined worth of $1bn in 2008. Other important industries include pharmaceuticals, which exported around $435m in 2006 and $260m in the first half of 2008 alone, as well as textiles, which were worth $1.19bn in 2007. Although the value of Jordan\u2019s industrial sector is high, the kingdom faces a number of challenges. Because the country is dependent on importing raw materials, it is vulnerable to price volatility. Shortages in water and power also make consistent development difficult. Despite these challenges, Jordan\u2019s economic openness and long-standing fertiliser and pharmaceutical industries should continue to provide a solid source of foreign currency.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/publication.asp?country%3D19 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829151238/http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/publication.asp?country=19 |archivedate=29 August 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n[[Jordan]] has a plethora of industrial zones and special economic zones aimed at increasing exports and making Jordan an industrial giant. The Mafraq SEZ is focused on industry and logistics hoping to become the regional logistics hub with air, road, and rail links to neighboring countries and eventually Europe and the Persian Gulf. The Ma'an SEZ is primarily industrial focusing on satisfying domestic demand and reducing reliance on imports. With a national rail system under construction, Jordan expects trade to grow significantly and Jordan will mostly become the trade hub of the Levant and even the Middle East region as a whole due to its geography and natural resources.\n\n===Telecoms and IT===\nTelecommunications is a billion-dollar industry with estimates showing that core markets of fixed-line, mobile and data service generate annual revenue of around JD836.5m ($1.18bn) per year, which is equivalent to 13.5% of GDP. Jordan's IT sector is the most developed and competitive in the region due to the 2001 telecom liberalization. Market share of the mobile sector, the most competitive telecoms market, is currently fairly evenly divided between the three operators, with Zain, owned by MTC Kuwait, maintaining the largest share (39%), followed by France Telecom\u2019s brand Orange (36%) and Umniah (25%), which is 96% owned by Bahrain\u2019s Batelco. End of year figures for 2007 show that the market trend is towards greater parity, with Zain\u2019s share falling in the space of a year from 47% in 2006 and the other two operators picking up subscribers. The increased competition has led to pricing that is more favourable to consumers. Mobile penetration is currently around 80%.\n\nAmbitious subsequent national strategies were formulated already since Y 2000 as a private sector initiative directly led by his majesty the king of Jordan. Information technology association in Jordan (int@j ) was established to kick off a private sector process that would focus on preparing Jordan for the new economy through IT and shall reflect the national objectives towards automation and modernization in co-operation with the ministry of information technology in Jordan the (MOICT). The latest strategy will take the sector through to 2011, aims to bring Jordan to precise objectives. The ICT sector currently accounts for over a 14% (indirect) of the kingdom's GDP. This figure includes foreign investment and total domestic revenue from the sector. Employment growth in the sector was progressive and reached up to 60.000 (indirect ) by 2008. The government is working to address employment issues and education related to sector by developing ICT training and opportunities to increase the overall penetration of ICT in Jordanian society. The policy outlines a number of objectives for the country to reach within the next three years, including almost doubling the size of the sector to $3bn, and pushing internet user penetration up to 50%.\n\nThe early founder of Int@j and its first chairman of the board is Karim Kawar and early activists who drove the national strategic objectives and helped formulate an action plan through the developing pillars were Marwan Juma Jordan's minister of ICT, Doha Abdelkhaleq on labour and education. Humam Mufti on advocacy and Nashat Masri on Capital and finance amongst others.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\nSuch an infrastructure made Jordan a suitable location for IT startups that operate in the fields of web development, mobile application development, online services, and investment in IT businesses.\n\nIt should be noted that the IT industry in Jordan in the year 2000 and beyond got a very big boost after the Gulf War of 1991. This boost came from a large influx of immigrants from the Gulf countries to Jordan, mostly from Jordanian expatriates from Kuwait, totaling few hundred thousands. This large wave impacted Jordan in many ways, and one of them was on its IT industry.<ref>Naser, K., The Impact of Gulf War Immigration on the Growth of a Private Sector; The Information Technology (IT) industry in Jordan and the impact of government policies on the sector. Dissertation. The George Washington University, May 21, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Energy===\n{{Further|Energy in Jordan|Nuclear energy in Jordan|Oil shale in Jordan}}\nEnergy remains perhaps the biggest challenge for continued growth for Jordan\u2019s economy. Spurred by the surge in the price of oil to more than $145 a barrel at its peak, the Jordanian government has responded with an ambitious plan for the sector. The country\u2019s lack of domestic resources is being addressed via a $14bn investment programme in the sector. The programme aims to reduce reliance on imported products from the current level of 96%, with renewables meeting 10% of energy demand by 2020 and nuclear energy meeting 60% of energy needs by 2035. The government also announced in 2007 that it would scale back subsidies in several areas, including energy, where there have historically been regressive subsidies for fuel and electricity. In another new step, the government is opening up the sector to competition, and intends to offer all the planned new energy projects to international tender.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\nUnlike most of its neighbors, Jordan has no significant petroleum resources of its own and is heavily dependent on oil imports to fulfill its domestic energy needs. In 2002 proved oil reserves totaled only {{convert|445000|oilbbl}}. Jordan produced only {{convert|40|oilbbl/d}} in 2004 but consumed an estimated {{convert|103000|oilbbl/d}}. According to U.S. government figures, oil imports had reached about {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}} in 2004. The Iraq invasion of 2003 disrupted Jordan\u2019s primary oil supply route from its eastern neighbor, which under Saddam Hussein had provided the kingdom with highly discounted crude oil via overland truck routes. Since late 2003, an alternative supply route by tanker through the Al Aqabah port has been established; Saudi Arabia is now Jordan\u2019s primary source of imported oil; Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are secondary sources. Although not so heavily discounted as Iraqi crude oil, supplies from Saudi Arabia and the UAE are subsidized to some extent.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the face of continued high oil costs, interest has increased in the possibility of exploiting Jordan's vast [[oil shale reserves|oil shale resources]], which are estimated to total approximately 40&nbsp;billion tons, 4&nbsp;billion tons of which are believed to be recoverable. Jordan's [[oil shale]] resources could produce {{convert|28|Goilbbl|km3}} of oil, enabling production of about {{convert|100000|oilbbl/d}}. The [[oil shale in Jordan]] has the fourth largest in the world which currently, there are several companies who are negotiating with the Jordanian government about exploiting the oil shale like [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Petrobras]] and [[Eesti Energia]].\n\nNatural gas is increasingly being used to fulfill the country\u2019s domestic energy needs, especially with regard to electricity generation. Jordan was estimated to have only modest natural gas reserves (about 6&nbsp;billion cubic meters in 2002), but new estimates suggest a much higher total. In 2003 the country produced and consumed an estimated 390&nbsp;million cubic meters of natural gas. The primary source is located in the eastern portion of the country at the Risha gas field. Until the early 2010s, the country imported the bulk of its natural gas via the [[Arab Gas Pipeline]] that stretches from the Al Arish terminal in Egypt underwater to [[Aqaba|Al Aqabah]] and then to northern Jordan, where it links to two major power stations. This Egypt\u2013Jordan pipeline supplied Jordan with approximately 1&nbsp;billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.<ref name=cp/> Gas supplies from Egypt were halted in 2013 due to insurgent activities in the Sinai and domestic gas shortages in Egypt. In light of this, a [[liquified natural gas]] terminal was built in the Port of Aqaba to facilitate gas imports. In 2017, a low-capacity gas pipeline from Israel was completed which supplies the [[Arab Potash]] factories near the Dead Sea. As of 2018, a large capacity pipeline from Israel is under contstruction in northern Jordan which is expected to begin operating by 2020 and will supply the kingdom with 3 BCM of gas per year, thereby satisfying most of Jordan\u2019s natural gas consumption needs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ghazal |first1=Mohammad |title=Israeli gas to Jordan expected in 2020 \u2014 official |url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/israeli-gas-jordan-expected-2020-\u2014-official |accessdate=6 July 2018 |publisher=[[The Jordan Times]] |date=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe state-owned National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) produces most of Jordan\u2019s electricity (94%). Since mid-2000, privatization efforts have been undertaken to increase independent power generation facilities; a Belgian firm was set to begin operations at a new power plant near Amman with an estimated capacity of 450 megawatts. Power plants at Az Zarqa (400 megawatts) and Al Aqabah (650&nbsp;MW) are Jordan's other primary electricity providers. As a whole, the country consumed nearly 8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2003 while producing only 7.5&nbsp;billion kWh of electricity. Electricity production in 2004 rose to 8.7&nbsp;billion kWh, but production must continue to increase in order to meet demand, which the government estimates would continue to grow by about 5% per year. About 99 percent of the population is reported to have access to electricity.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Transport===\nThe transportation sector on average contributes some 10% to Jordan\u2019s GDP, with transportation and communications accounting for $2.14bn in 2007. Well aware of the sector\u2019s importance to the country\u2019s service and industry-oriented economy, in 2008 the government formulated a new national transport strategy with the aim to improve, modernise and further privatise the sector. With no imminent solution to the ongoing security crisis in Iraq in sight, prospects for the Jordanian transport sector as a whole look bright. The country will arguably remain one of the major transit points for both goods and people destined for Iraq, while the number of tourists visiting Jordan is set to continue to increase. The main events to follow in the near future are the relocation of Aqaba\u2019s main port, a national railway system, and the construction of a new terminal at QAIA. Volatility in fuel prices is almost certainly going to have negative effects on operational costs and as such may hamper the sector\u2019s average annual growth of around 6%. However, uncertain fuel prices also offer a great deal of incentive to boost private investments in alternative modes of transport such as public buses and improved trains.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\n===Media and Advertising===\nAlthough the state remains a major influence, Jordan\u2019s media sector has seen significant privatisation and liberalisation efforts in recent years. Based on official rack rates, research firm Ipsos estimated that the advertisement sector spent some $280m towards publicity in Jordan\u2019s media, 80% of which was spent on newspapers, followed by TV, radio and magazines. The biggest event of 2007 was the cancelled launch of ATV, the kingdom\u2019s first private broadcaster. As a result, the state-owned Jordan TV (JTV) remains the country\u2019s sole broadcaster. In recent years, Jordan has also seen a spectacular rise in the number of blogs, websites and news portals as sources of news information. The increasing diversification of Jordan\u2019s media is a good sign and should boost advertising revenues and private initiatives.\n\nRecording growth of 30%, 2007 turned out to be yet another outstanding year for Jordan\u2019s advertising industry. Following nearly a decade of double-digit growth, however, most publicity specialists expect to see a relative slowdown in 2008. Unlike 2007, no major campaigns were planned for the first part of 2008. Additionally, the Jordanian advertising had some catching up to do with the rest of the region in terms of average expenditure per capita. As the sector matures, it is only normal for growth figures to gradually decrease. Since 2000 total ad spend increased from $77m to $280m in 2007, an increase of 260%. The Jordanian telecoms sector was the biggest ad spender in 2007, accounting for around 20% of the market, followed by banking and finance sector (12%), services industry (11%), real estate (8%) and the automotive sector (5%). In the next year, particularly if there is a downturn, it would become increasingly important for the sector to develop good vocational training and to begin to take advantage of new media markets.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\n===Services===\nServices accounted for more than 70 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004. The sector employed nearly 75 percent of the labor force in 2002.<ref name=cp/>\n[[File:Arab Bank HQ3.JPG|thumb|290px|[[Arab Bank]] headquarters in [[Amman]]]]\nThe banking sector is widely regarded as advanced by both regional and international terms. In 2007, total profits of the 15 listed banks rose 14.89% to JD640m ($909m). Jordan\u2019s strong growth of 6% in 2007 was reflected in a 20.57% expansion in net credit to JD17.9bn ($25.4bn) by the end of the year. Most improvement was in trade, construction and industry. Many banks suffered from the sharp correction in the Amman Stock Market in 2006, encouraging them to focus on core banking business in 2007, and this was reflected in a 16.65% rise in net interest and commission income to JD1.32bn ($1.87bn). The stock market also picked up in 2007 and total portfolio income losses decreased. Although Jordan\u2019s banking sector is small by global standards, it has attracted strong interest from regional investors in Lebanon and the GCC. New regulations introduced by the CBJ, in addition to political stability, have helped to create a favourable investment environment. Its conservative policies helped Jordan avoid the global financial crisis of 2009, Jordanian banks was one of the only countries that posted a profit in 2009.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\nContributing an estimated JD477.5m ($678.05m), or 4.25% of Jordan\u2019s GDP, according to figures from the Central Bank, the construction sector performed strongly in 2007. The Great Amman Municipality (GAM) completed its master plan for the capital, which is expected to grow from 700&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> today to 1700&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> by 2025. Amman is changing from a predominantly horizontal to a largely vertical city due to various clusters of high-rises. Significant developments outside Amman include the rapid residential build-up of Zarqa, the transformation of Aqaba into a commercial and tourist centre, and the construction of a series of high-end hotels and tourist resorts along the Dead Sea. A new airport terminal, Amman ring road and a light rail between the capital and Zarqa are being constructed.\n\nDespite recording a relative slowdown compared to the expansion of recent years, Jordan\u2019s construction and real estate market continued to grow in 2007. Trading totaled JD5.6bn ($8bn), up from JD5.2bn ($7.4bn) in 2006, according to Jordan\u2019s Land and Survey Department. Although the years of astounding growth\u2014some 75% in 2004 and 48% in 2005\u2014seem to have passed, the future looks bright for real estate, as demand continues to outstrip supply, while Jordan remains a very attractive investment destination for foreign businesses, second-home buyers and Jordanians working abroad. With Jordan\u2019s continuing sharp population growth, as well as its strategic location at the heart of the Middle East, the kingdom\u2019s main market drivers indicate a bright future for years to come. Although a number of class-A office space developments are currently under construction, it would take a few years to close the gap between demand and supply. The Amman retail market may become more saturated in the short term. Consequently, developers may turn to other cities to build supermarkets and malls.\n\nJordan's insurance market, with 29 companies operating in a country of just 5.7 million people, is saturated, despite regulatory encouragements for mergers and acquisitions. In terms of market share based on premiums, motor coverage accounts for 42.4%, medical insurance 18.6%, fire and property damage 17%, life 9.8%, marine and transport 7.9% and other insurance the remaining 4.3%. The insurance sector made up 2.52% of GDP in 2006, up from 2.43% in 2005. Current plans call for increasing the sector\u2019s GDP contribution to 7% in the short term and 10% in the long term. The sector holds great potential but remains underdeveloped. Region-wide price increases and a lack of consumer understanding of products are two major challenges. In addition, cultural considerations, including religion, make improving market penetration difficult. The cost of living has also risen, and the IMF forecasts that the inflation rate would reach 9% in 2008. Salaries have remained unchanged, however, leaving consumers with less disposable income. Other than mandatory motor coverage, insurance products are considered a luxury by average Jordanians, who must often prioritise spending. There would likely only be a few changes to the market in the coming year. Members of the sector would like to see greater coordination among the regulators and those working for the kingdom's legal system in order to improve insurance laws.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\nThe state of the tourism sector is widely regarded as below potential, especially given the country\u2019s rich history, ancient ruins, Mediterranean climate, and diverse geography. Despite personal appeals by the king and an increasingly sophisticated marketing campaign, the industry is still adversely affected by the political instability of the region. More than 5 million visitors entered Jordan in 2004, generating US$1.3 billion in earnings. Earnings from tourism rose to US$1.4 billion in 2005. The fact that the bulk of Jordan\u2019s tourist trade emanates from elsewhere in the Middle East should contribute to the industry\u2019s growth potential in the years ahead, as Jordan is relatively stable, open, and safe in comparison to many of its neighbors.<ref name=cp/>  The tourism sector remains an important element of the Jordanian economy, directly employing some 30,000 Jordanians and contributing 10% to the kingdom\u2019s GDP. Despite a decline in Arab and Gulf visitors, 2007 marked a year of steady growth for the tourism sector. Revenues jumped 13% to nearly $2.11bn during the first 11 months, up from $1.86bn for the same period in 2006. The sector is overseen by the government\u2019s National Tourism Strategy (NTS), which was established in 2004 to take the industry through 2010. NTS aimed to double tourism revenues during the period and to increase tourism-related jobs to 91,719. The first goal has already been met but the second one might be more of a challenge: between 2004 and 2007 the total number of people employed in the sector rose from 23,544 to 35,484. This is impressive growth, but less than half the 90,000-or-more goal. NTS hopes to place Jordan as a boutique destination for high-end tourists. The strategy identifies seven priorities or niche markets: cultural heritage (archaeology); religious; ecotourism; health and wellness; adventure; meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE); and cruises. The Jordan Tourism Board\u2019s (JTB) marketing budget has increased in the past year from JD6m ($8.52m) to JD11.5m ($16.3m). These are positive times for tourism in Jordan, with steady growth and major projects in the pipeline. The sector has to make improvements of infrastructure and marketing, but overall the industry has been improving for the past several years.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\n==External trade==\n[[Image:2006Jordanian exports.PNG|thumb|left|Jordanian exports in 2006]]\n[[File:Jordan Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|300px|A proportional representation of Jordan's exports.]]\nSince 1995, economic growth has been low. Real GDP has grown at only about 1.5% annually, while the official unemployment has hovered at 14% (unofficial estimates are double this number). The budget deficit and public debt have remained high and continue to widen, yet during this period inflation has remained low due mainly to stable monetary policy and the continued peg to the United States Dollar. Exports of manufactured goods have risen at an annual rate of 9%. Monetary stability has been reinforced, even when tensions were renewed in the region during 1998, and during the illness and ultimate death of King Hussein in 1999.\n\nExpectations of increased trade and tourism as a consequence of Jordan's peace treaty with [[Israel]] have been disappointing. Security-related restrictions to trade with the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] have led to a substantial decline in Jordan's exports there. Following his ascension, King Abdullah improved relations with Arabic states of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Syria]], but this brought few real economic benefits. Most recently the Jordanians have focused on [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] membership and a [[Free Trade Agreement]] with the U.S. as means to encourage [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]].\n\n==Investment==\nThe stock [[market capitalisation]] of listed companies in Jordan was valued at $37.639 billion in 2005 by the [[World Bank]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20394793~menuPK:1192714~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html |title=Data - Finance |publisher= |accessdate=3 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405102322/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20394793~menuPK%3A1192714~pagePK%3A64133150~piPK%3A64133175~theSitePK%3A239419%2C00.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Salaries==\nAccording to the 2015 Middle East and North Africa Salary Survey conducted by Bayt.com, Respondents from GCC (49%) seem somewhat happier with the raise they received in 2014, as compared to respondents from Levant (42%):<ref>[http://img.b8cdn.com/images/uploads/article_docs/bayt-salary-survey-0515-en_25290_EN.pdf ''The Middle East and North Africa Salary Survey-May 2015''], Bayt.com. Retrieved 29 June 2015</ref>\n\n==Aqaba==\nThough a town of only 100,000 people, [[Aqaba]] is setting an example of how to attract investment. In a decade, domestic and foreign investment into the Aqaba region has increased dramatically and the town\u2019s population is set to double over the next 10 years. Certainly, the town benefits from some natural advantages. Located at the southern tip of the country, between Saudi Arabia and Israel on the shores of the Red Sea, the city is close to the Suez Canal, with easy access to key trade centres in both the Middle East and Africa. Aqaba is also the kingdom\u2019s only deep-water port town, taking up most of Jordan\u2019s scant {{convert|27|km|0|abbr=on}} of coastline. The Aqaba Special Economic Zone (ASEZ) has been responsible for most of this development since it opened in 2001.\n\nIt covers 375&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and offers a basket of tax and tariff incentives, as well as full repatriation rights and more flexible operating regulations. There is a 5% flat tax on most economic activities, no tariffs on imported goods, no currency restrictions and no property taxes for corporate land. Additionally \u2013 and somewhat controversially, given Jordan\u2019s past issues with unemployment \u2013 companies based in ASEZ are allowed to employ up to 70% foreign workers in their operations. Jordan\u2019s investment profile has been growing nationally, but according to the Jordan Investment Board (JIB), the ASEZ has exceeded investment targets by 33%. By 2006 it had already brought in around $8bn in investment, some $2bn more than the original target of $6bn by 2020. ASEZ expects to attract a further $12bn spread across a number of sectors, including tourism, finance and industry. The Development Law of 2008 set in place a universal framework for special development areas based on the Aqaba model.<ref name=\"oxfordbusinessgroup.com\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Jordan Investment Board]]\n* [[MENA ICT Forum]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Brand, Laurie.

Forests, mainly of [[Casuarinaceae]], cover about half the island.  [[Sea turtles]] nest on the beaches around the island.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because it supports a very large colony of [[sooty tern]]s, with up to 100,000 breeding pairs. It also has a much smaller colony of [[greater crested tern]]s (with at least 50 breeding pairs recorded in 1994).

Before the independence of Madagascar, France transferred the administration to [[Saint-Pierre, R\u00e9union|Saint-Pierre]] on [[R\u00e9union|R\u00e9union Island]]. [[Madagascar]] became independent in 1960 and claims sovereignty over the island since 1972. [[Guano]] ([[phosphate]]) deposits were exploited from the start of the 20th century until 1970. The island was abandoned during [[World War II]] and was visited by German [[submarine]]rs. Installations, including a hangar, rail lines, houses and a jetty are in ruins.\n\n===Wrecks===\nThe island lies on the sea route between South Africa and the northern tip of Madagascar.  It is affected by strong currents, and has become the site of numerous wrecks.  Most visible are the remains of the [[SS Tottenham (1901)|SS ''Tottenham'']] which ran onto the southern fringing reef in 1911.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n|location = Juan de Nova Island\n|metric

He is best known for his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]], based on his works ''[[Astronomia nova]]'', ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', and ''[[Epitome of Copernican Astronomy]]''. These works also provided one of the foundations for [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].\n\nKepler was a mathematics teacher at a [[seminary]] school in [[Graz]], where he became an associate of [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]]. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] in [[Prague]], and eventually the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]] and his two successors [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. He also taught mathematics in [[Linz]], and was an adviser to [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]]. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of [[optics]], invented an improved version of the [[refracting telescope]] (the [[Keplerian telescope]]), and was mentioned in the [[Telescope|telescopic]] discoveries of his contemporary [[Galileo Galilei]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in Rome.<ref>http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006427&searchAssoc=Assoc{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 9/7/2017</ref>\n\nKepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]], but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of [[quadrivium|mathematics]] within the [[liberal arts]]) and [[physics]] (a branch of [[natural philosophy]]). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of [[reason]].<ref>Barker and Goldstein. \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy\", pp.&nbsp; 112\u201313.</ref> Kepler described his new astronomy as \"celestial physics\",<ref>Kepler.

His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a [[mercenary]], and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands. His mother, [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina Guldenmann]], an innkeeper's daughter, was a [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[herbalist]].

''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp; 49\u201369.</ref>\n\n== Graz (1594\u20131600) ==\n\n=== ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|thumb|right|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[solar system]], from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1596)]]\n\nKepler's first major astronomical work, ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery'') [1596], was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on July 19, 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. He found that each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets\u2014[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively\u2014[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]\u2014Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;60\u201365; see also: Barker and Goldstein, \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy.\"</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|left|Close-up of an inner section of Kepler's model]]\n\nAs he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]. His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.<ref>Barker and Goldstein. \"Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy,\" pp.&nbsp;99\u2013103, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nWith the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the T\u00fcbingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas.  ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]].<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;65\u201371.</ref>\n\nThough the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]''. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.<ref>Field. ''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff.</ref>\n\nIn terms of the impact of ''Mysterium'', it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his \"[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De Revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]\". Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the earth's orbit rather than that of the sun \"as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy.\" Modern astronomy owes much to \"Mysterium Cosmographicum\", despite flaws in its main thesis,  \"since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it.\" <ref>Dreyer, J.L.E.

M\u00fcller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on ''Mysterium'', but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials\u2014who had helped set up the match\u2014pressured the M\u00fcllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler''. pp.&nbsp;71\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).<ref>Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100, 114\u2013116; Caspar.

He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.<ref>Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;85\u201386.</ref>\n\nHe also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent ''Mysterium'', among them [[Reimarus Ursus]] (Nicolaus Reimers B\u00e4r)\u2014the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] and a bitter rival of [[Tycho Brahe]]. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the [[Tychonic system]] with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;86\u201389</ref>\n\nInstead, he turned his attention to [[chronology]] and \"harmony,\" the [[numerology|numerological]] relationships among music, [[mathematics]] and the physical world, and their [[astrology|astrological]] consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting [[astrological aspects]] and astronomical distances to [[meteorology|weather]] and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data\u2014just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in [[Prague]]; on January 1, 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;89\u2013100</ref>\n\n== Prague (1600\u20131612) ==\n\n=== Work for Tycho Brahe ===\n[[Image:Tycho Brahe.JPG|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]]]\n\nOn February 4, 1600, Kepler met [[Tycho Brahe]] and his assistants [[Franz Tengnagel]] and [[Longomontanus]] at [[Ben\u00e1tky nad Jizerou]] (35&nbsp;km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory<ref>[http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope# Using Tycho's data, see 'Two views of a system' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014442/http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope |date=July 21, 2011 }}</ref> from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of [[Johannes Jessenius]], Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;100\u201308.</ref>\n\nPolitical and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]]. To that end, Kepler composed an essay\u2014dedicated to Ferdinand\u2014in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: \"In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet\" (\"There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p. 110.</ref>  Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in ''Astronomiae Pars Optica''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;108\u201311.</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' that should replace the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]]. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;111\u201322.</ref>\n\n=== Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II ===\nKepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in T\u00fcbingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous [[Alchemy|alchemists]]) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;149\u201353</ref>\n\nOfficially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and [[Utraquist]], but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ([[Johannes Matth\u00e4us Wackher von Wackhenfels]], [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]], [[David Fabricius]], Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;146\u2013148, 159\u2013177</ref>\n\n=== ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' ===\n[[Image:Kepler Optica.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A plate from ''[[Astronomiae Pars Optica]]'', illustrating the structure of eyes of various species.]]\n[[File:Kepler - Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur, 1604 - 158093 F.jpg|thumb|''Astronomiae pars optica'']]\n\nAs Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations\u2014now available to him in their entirety\u2014and began the slow process of tabulating the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to ''all'' astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the [[inverse-square law]] governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the [[Lens (anatomy)|eye's lens]] onto the [[retina]]. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected \"in the hollows of the brain\" due to the \"activity of the Soul.\"<ref>Finger, \"Origins of Neuroscience,\" p. 74. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001.</ref> Today, ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 142\u2013146</ref> With respect to the beginnings of [[projective geometry]], Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[conic section]] were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an [[ellipse]] becomes a [[parabola]] when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single [[point at infinity]], thus having the properties of a large circle.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], [[Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times]], p. 299. [[Oxford University Press]], 1972.</ref>\n\n=== Supernova of 1604 ===\n{{see also|Kepler's Supernova}} [[Image:Keplers supernova.jpg|thumb|Remnant of Kepler's Supernova [[SN 1604]]]]\n\nIn October 1604, a bright new evening star ([[SN 1604]]) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began systematically observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a [[fiery trigon]], the start of the about 800-year cycle of [[great conjunction]]s; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of [[Charlemagne]] (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his ''[[De Stella Nova]]''. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the [[celestial spheres]] were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]]; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the [[Star of Bethlehem]]\u2014analogous to the present new star\u2014would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;153\u2013157</ref>\n[[Image:Kepler Drawing of SN 1604.png|thumb|upright|left|The location of the ''stella nova'', in the foot of [[Ophiuchus]], is marked with an ''N'' (8 grid squares down, 4 over from the left).]]\n\n=== ''Astronomia nova'' ===\nThe extended line of research that culminated in ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A New Astronomy'')\u2014including the first two [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]\u2014began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an [[equant]] (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two [[arcminute]]s (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an [[ovoid]] orbit to the data.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;123\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of [[God the Father]]) was the source of motive force in the solar system. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert's]] theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive ''species'')<ref>On motive species, see Lindberg, \"The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light,\" pp.&nbsp;38\u201340.</ref> radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.<ref>\"Kepler's decision to base his causal explanation of planetary motion on a distance-velocity law, rather than on uniform circular motions of compounded spheres, marks a major shift from ancient to modern conceptions of science&nbsp;... [Kepler] had begun with physical principles and had then derived a trajectory from it, rather than simply constructing new models.  In other words, even before discovering the area law, Kepler had abandoned uniform circular motion as a physical principle.\"  Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, \"Distance and Velocity in Kepler's Astronomy\", ''Annals of Science,'' 51 (1994): 59\u201373, at p. 60.</ref><ref>Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;199\u2013202.</ref>  Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]] of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle, however, required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: ''planets sweep out equal areas in equal times''\u2014Kepler's second law of planetary motion.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;129\u2013132</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler Mars retrograde.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[geocentric]] trajectory of Mars through several periods of [[apparent retrograde motion]] (''Astronomia nova,'' Chapter 1, 1609)]]\n\nHe then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped [[ovoid]] orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', p.&nbsp;133</ref> Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that ''all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus''\u2014Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for ''Astronomia nova'', though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;131\u2013140; Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;277\u2013279</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Dioptrice}}''Dioptrice'', ''Somnium'' manuscript, and other work ===\nIn the years following the completion of ''Astronomia Nova'', most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and a comprehensive set of [[ephemerides]] (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]]. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the [[Chronology of Jesus|dating of events in the life of Jesus]], and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]].<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;178\u201381</ref>\n\nKepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared ''Tertius Interveniens'' [Third-party Interventions]. Nominally this work\u2014presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius\u2014was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the \"evil-smelling dung\" in which \"an industrious hen\" scrapes, there was an \"occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget\" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;181\u201385.

Upon publishing his account as ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, ''Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo'' [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in ''Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus'', providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to ''Astronomia Nova''.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;192\u2013197</ref>\n\nAfter hearing of Galileo's telescopic discoveries, Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne.<ref>Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' p. 384</ref>  The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as ''Dioptrice'' in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of [[double-convex converging lens]]es and [[double-concave diverging lens]]es\u2014and how they are combined to produce a [[Galilean telescope]]\u2014as well as the concepts of [[real image|real]] vs. [[virtual image|virtual]] images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope\u2014now known as the ''astronomical'' or ''[[Keplerian telescope]]''\u2014in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;198\u2013202</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler conjecture 2.jpg|thumb|One of the diagrams from ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'', illustrating the [[Kepler conjecture]]]]\n\nAround 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as ''[[Somnium (novel)|Somnium]]'' [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of ''Somnium'' was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story\u2014several times longer than the actual text\u2014which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.<ref>Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;1\u201378</ref>\n\n===Work in mathematics and physics===\nAs a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'' (''A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow''). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical [[atomism|atomistic]] physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]], a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.<ref>Schneer, \"Kepler's New Year's Gift of a Snowflake,\" pp.&nbsp;531\u201345</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kepler |first1=Johannes |editor1-last=Hardie |editor1-first=Colin |title=De nive sexangula |trans-title=The Six-sided Snowflake |url= |date=1966 |origyear=1611 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |oclc=974730 }}</ref>\n\n=== Personal and political troubles ===\nIn 1611, the growing political-religious tension in Prague came to a head. Emperor Rudolph\u2014whose health was failing\u2014was forced to abdicate as [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]]  by his brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]]. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;202\u2013204</ref>\n\nAlso in that year, Barbara Kepler contracted [[Hungarian spotted fever]], then began having [[seizure]]s. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in W\u00fcrttemberg and [[Padua]]. At the [[Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen|University of T\u00fcbingen]] in W\u00fcrttemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] heresies in violation of the [[Augsburg Confession]] and the [[Formula of Concord]] prevented his return. The [[University of Padua]]\u2014on the recommendation of the departing Galileo\u2014sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in [[Linz]]. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.<ref>Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&nbsp;222\u2013226; Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;204\u201307</ref>\n\nKepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, ''Eclogae Chronicae'', from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;208\u201311</ref>\n\n== Linz and elsewhere (1612\u20131630) ==\n[[Image:Kepler Statue Linz.jpg|thumb|A statue of Kepler in [[Linz]]]]\n\nIn Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the ''Rudolphine Tables'') were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague\u2014though he was excluded from [[Eucharist]] by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina]] in the Protestant town of [[Leonberg]]. That blow, happening only a few years after Kepler\u2019s [[excommunication]], is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhamrvcsVyIC&pg=PT125&lpg=PT125&dq=mazer+waged+an+assault+against+kepler&source=bl&ots=rRbOXeTHUA&sig=9IUhfpehovxpXf0nJlFf15Z2TxU&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6r8ftoLPTAhULKlAKHbmPCPIQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=mazer%20waged%20an%20assault%20against%20kepler&f=false|title=Shifting the Earth: The Mathematica Quest to Understand the Motion of the Universe|last=Mazer|first=Arthur|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-02427--0|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHis first publication in Linz was ''De vero Anno'' (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth; he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]]'s [[Gregorian calendar|reformed calendar]] to Protestant German lands; that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise ''Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum'', on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, published in 1615.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;209\u201320, 227\u2013240</ref>\n\n=== Second marriage ===\nOn October 30, 1613, Kepler married the 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger.

Despite the title, which referred simply to heliocentrism, Kepler's textbook culminated in his own ellipse-based system. The ''Epitome'' became Kepler's most influential work. It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes.<ref name=\"Gingerich pp 302\">Gingerich, \"Kepler, Johannes\" from ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', pp.&nbsp;302\u201304</ref>  Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in ''Astronomia nova'') to all the planets as well as the Moon and the [[Galilean moons|Medicean satellites of Jupiter]],<ref>By 1621 or earlier, Kepler recognized that Jupiter's moons obey his third law.\n\nKepler contended that rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation to their satellites, so that the satellites are swept around the central body; thus the rotation of the Sun drives the revolutions of the planets and the rotation of the Earth drives the revolution of the Moon.  In Kepler's era, no one had any evidence of Jupiter's rotation.  However, Kepler argued that the force by which a central body causes its satellites to revolve around it, weakens with distance; consequently, satellites that are farther from the central body revolve slower.  Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obeyed this pattern and he inferred that a similar force was responsible.  He also noted that the orbital periods and semi-major axes of Jupiter's satellites were roughly related by a 3/2 power law, as are the orbits of the six (then known) planets.  However, this relation was approximate:  the periods of Jupiter's moons were known within a few percent of their modern values, but the moons' semi-major axes were determined less accurately.<br><br>\n\nKepler discussed Jupiter's moons in his ''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae'' [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz (\"Lentiis ad Danubium\"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg=PA554#v=onepage&q&f=false page 554].

Because, regarding the body of Jupiter, whether it turns around its axis, we don't have proofs for what suffices for us [regarding the rotation of ] the body of the Earth and especially of the Sun, certainly [as reason proves to us]:  but reason attests that, just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that can go farther from it orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (''sescupla'' ) of the proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as [is used for] the six planets above.  In his [book] ''The World of Jupiter'' [''Mundus Jovialis'', 1614], [[Simon Marius|[Simon] Mayr]] [1573\u20131624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four [moons] of Jupiter:  3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo)&nbsp;... Mayr presents their time periods:  1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 3 hours, 16 days 18 hours:  for all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of] 3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2.</blockquote></ref> it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data.<ref>Wolf, ''A History of Science, Technology and Philosophy'', pp.&nbsp;140\u201341; Pannekoek, ''A History of Astronomy'', p 252</ref>\n\nAs a spin-off from the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and the related ''Ephemerides'', Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work\u2014especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars\u2014six between 1617 and 1624\u2014Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;239, 300\u201301, 307\u201308</ref>\n\n[[Image:Kepler-1619-pl-3.jpg|thumb|Geometrical harmonies in the perfect solids from ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619)]]\n\nIn 1615, Ursula Reingold, a woman in a financial dispute with Kepler's brother Christoph, claimed Kepler's mother Katharina had made her sick with an evil brew. The dispute escalated, and in 1617 Katharina was accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]]; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time. Beginning in August 1620, she was imprisoned for fourteen months. She was released in October 1621, thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler. The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors. Katharina was subjected to ''territio verbalis'', a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess. Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his \"harmonic theory\". The result, published in 1619, was ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (\"Harmony of the World\").<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;240\u2013264; Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', chapters I, XI-XIII; Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&nbsp;21\u201339</ref>\n\n=== ''Harmonices Mundi'' ===\n{{main|Harmonices Mundi}}\n\nKepler was convinced \"that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world\".<ref>Quotation from Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;265\u2013266, translated from ''Harmonices Mundi''</ref>  In ''Harmony'', he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world\u2014particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects\u2014in terms of music.<ref>The opening of the movie ''[[Mars et Avril]]'' by [[Martin Villeneuve]] is based on German astronomer Johannes Kepler's cosmological model from the 17th century, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies.

From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies\u2014and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler\u2014with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories\u2014treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;266\u201390</ref>\n\nAmong many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion. He then tried many combinations until he discovered that (approximately) \"''The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances''.\" Although he gives the date of this epiphany (March 8, 1618), he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion.<ref name=\"Miller2009\">{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Arthur I. |authorlink=Arthur I.

However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension \u2014 the root of the ongoing [[Thirty Years' War]] \u2014 once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]] placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to [[Ulm]], where he arranged for the printing of the ''Tables'' at his own expense.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;308\u2013328</ref>\n\nIn 1628, following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand's armies under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]], Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein. Though not the general's court astrologer per se, Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself. In his final years, Kepler spent much of his time traveling, from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and [[Ulm]] to a temporary home in [[\u017baga\u0144|Sagan]], and finally to [[Regensburg]]. Soon after arriving in Regensburg, Kepler fell ill. He died on November 15, 1630, and was buried there; his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard.<ref>Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;332\u2013351, 355\u201361</ref> Only Kepler's self-authored poetic epitaph survived the times:\n\n:''Mensus eram coelos, nunc terrae metior umbras''\n:''Mens coelestis erat, corporis umbra iacet.''\n\n:I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure\n:Skybound was the mind, earthbound the body rests.<ref>Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers, p. 427.</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nKepler's belief that God created the cosmos in an orderly fashion caused him to attempt to determine and comprehend the laws that govern the natural world, most profoundly in astronomy.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Kepler</ref><ref>https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy/The-techniques-of-astronomy#ref1211452</ref> The phrase \"I am merely thinking God's thoughts after Him\" has been attributed to him, although this is probably a capsulized version of a writing from his hand:\n<blockquote>Those laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that we could share in his own thoughts.<ref>Letter (9/10 Apr 1599) to the Bavarian chancellor Herwart von Hohenburg.

Several major figures such as [[Galileo]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] completely ignored Kepler's ''Astronomia nova.''  Many astronomers, including Kepler's teacher, Michael Maestlin, objected to Kepler's introduction of physics into his astronomy. Some adopted compromise positions. [[Isma\u00ebl Bullialdus]] accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse, while [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]] used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant.<ref>For a detailed study of the reception of Kepler's astronomy see Wilbur Applebaum, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996HisSc..34..451A \"Keplerian Astronomy after Kepler: Researches and Problems,\"] ''History of Science'', 34(1996): 451\u2013504.</ref><ref>Koyr\u00e9, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;362\u2013364</ref><ref>North, ''History of Astronomy and Cosmology'', pp.&nbsp; 355\u201360</ref>\n\nSeveral astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and its various modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date.

In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work\u2014notably those of [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] and Robert Hooke\u2014began to incorporate attractive forces (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of [[Principle of inertia (physics)|inertia]].<ref>Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, \"Inertia.\"</ref> This culminated in Isaac Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].<ref>Kuhn, ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;238, 246\u2013252</ref>\n\n== Historical and cultural legacy ==\n[[Image:Brahe kepler.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Tycho Brahe and Kepler in [[Prague]], Czech Republic]]\n[[Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1971, MiNr 1649.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[East Germany|GDR]] stamp featuring Kepler]]\n\n===History of science===\nBeyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy, Kepler has loomed large in the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and [[historiography of science]]. Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Montucla]]'s 1758 ''Histoire des math\u00e9matiques'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]]'s 1821 ''Histoire de l'astronomie moderne''. These and other histories written from an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later [[Romanticism in science|Romantic]]-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.  \n[[William Whewell]], in his influential ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of [[scientific method]]. Similarly, [[Ernst Friedrich Apelt]]\u2014the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by [[Catherine the Great]]\u2014identified Kepler as a key to the \"[[Scientific revolution|Revolution of the sciences]]\". \nApelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;363\u2013367</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Koyr\u00e9]]'s work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyr\u00e9, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the \"[[Scientific Revolution]]\" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyr\u00e9 placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.<ref>Jardine, \"Koyr\u00e9's Kepler/Kepler's Koyr\u00e9,\" pp.&nbsp;367\u2013372; Shapin, ''The Scientific Revolution'', pp.&nbsp;1\u20132</ref>\n\nPhilosophers of science\u2014such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], and [[Karl Popper]]\u2014have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], [[analogical reasoning]], falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of [[analytical psychology]] on scientific investigation.<ref>Pauli, \"The Influence of Archetypical Ideas\"</ref>\n\n===Editions and translations===\nModern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century).\n\nAn edition in eight volumes, '' Kepleri Opera omnia,'' was prepared by  Christian Frisch (1807\u20131881), during  1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.\nFrisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary.\n\nA new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by [[Walther von Dyck]] (1856\u20131934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.\n\nMax Caspar (1880\u20131956) published his German translation of Kepler's ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' in 1923.  \nBoth Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician [[Alexander von Brill]] (1842\u20131935). \nCaspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the ''Kepler-Kommission'' in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908\u20131992) and Franz Hammer (1898\u20131979), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. \nMax Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948.<ref>Gingerich, introduction to Caspar's ''Kepler'', pp.&nbsp;3\u20134</ref>  The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976\u20132003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984\u20131999) and [[Roland Bulirsch]] (1998\u20132014).<ref>\nUlrich Grigull, \"Sechzig Jahre Kepler-Kommission\", in: Sitzungsberichte der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Sitzung vom 5.

Kepler was hardly the first to combine physics and astronomy; however, according to the traditional (though disputed) interpretation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], he would be the first astrophysicist in the era of modern science.</ref>\n\nThe debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has  produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1959 ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution.<ref>Stephen Toulmin, Review of ''The Sleepwalkers'' in ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 59, no. 18 (1962), pp.&nbsp;500\u2013503</ref>\n\nA well-received, if fanciful, historical novel by [[John Banville]], ''Kepler'' (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science.<ref>William Donahue, \"A Novelist's Kepler,\" Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 13 (1982), pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136; \"Dancing the grave dance: Science, art and religion in John Banville's ''Kepler'',\" ''English Studies'', Vol. 86, no. 5 (October 2005), pp.&nbsp;424\u2013438</ref>  \nSomewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction, ''Heavenly Intrigue'' (2004), suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data.<ref>[[Marcelo Gleiser]], \"Kepler in the Dock\", review of Gilder and Gilder's ''Heavenly Intrigue'', ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 35, pt. 4 (2004), pp.&nbsp;487\u2013489</ref>\n\n=== Veneration and eponymy===\nIn Austria, Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin]], minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]] personally, and he probably influenced the construction of [[Eggenberg Castle]] (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''.<ref name=\"Eggenberg Palace coin\">{{cite web | url=http://austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en&muenzeSubTypeId=108&muenzeId=336 | title=Eggenberg Palace coin | publisher=Austrian Mint | accessdate=September 9, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210659/http://www.austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en | archivedate=May 31, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe German composer [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an opera about Kepler entitled ''[[Die Harmonie der Welt]]'', and a symphony of the same name was derived from music for the opera.\n[[Philip Glass]] wrote an opera called ''[[Kepler (opera)|Kepler]]'' based on Kepler's life (2009).\n\nKepler is honored together with Nicolaus Copernicus with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on May 23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://satucket.com/lectionary/Calendar.htm|title=Calendar of the Church Year according to the Episcopal Church|publisher=Charles Wohlers|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{main|List of things named after Johannes Kepler}}\nDirectly named for Kepler's contribution to science are [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], [[Kepler's Supernova]] (Supernova 1604, which he observed and described) and the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra|Kepler Solids]], a set of geometrical constructions, two of which were described by him, and the [[Kepler conjecture]] on [[sphere packing]].\n\n[[File:AS12-52-7745.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler crater]] as photographed by [[Apollo 12]] in 1969]]\n*In astronomy: The lunar crater [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler]] (''Keplerus'', named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], 1651), the asteroid [[1134 Kepler]] (1929), [[Kepler (crater on Mars)]] (1973), [[Kepler Launch Site]] for model rockets (2001), the [[Kepler Mission]], a space [[photometer]] launched by [[NASA]] in 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm |title=Kepler Mission Sets Out to Find Planets Using CCD Cameras |publisher=DailyTech |first=Jansen |last=Ng |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310010146/http://www.dailytech.com/Kepler+Mission+Sets+Out+to+Find+Planets+Using+CCD+Cameras/article14421.htm |archivedate=March 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  [[Johannes Kepler ATV]] ([[Automated Transfer Vehicle]] launched to resupply the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in 2011).\n*Educational institutions: [[Johannes Kepler University Linz]] (1975), [[Kepler College]] (Seattle, Washington), besides several institutions of primary and secondary education, such as Johannes Kepler Grammar School,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gjk.cz|title=GJK.cz|publisher=GJK.cz|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}</ref> at the site where Kepler lived in Prague, and ''Kepler Gymnasium'', [[T\u00fcbingen]]\n*Streets or squares named after him:  Keplerplatz Vienna (station of [[Vienna U-Bahn]]), Keplerstra\u00dfe in Hanau near Frankfurt am Main,  Keplerstra\u00dfe in Munich, Germany, Keplerstra\u00dfe and Keplerbr\u00fccke in Graz, Austria, Keplerova ulice in Prague.\n* The [[Kepler Mountains]] and [[Kepler Track]] in Fiordland National Park,  South Island, New Zealand;

He was a member of a [[solid-state physics]] group, led by [[William Shockley]] and chemist Stanley Morgan. Other personnel working in the group were [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians. He moved his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]].<ref>Hoddeson, Lillian and Daitch, Vicki. [https://books.google.com/books/about/True_Genius.html?id=2QSfAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129 \"True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen\"], p. 117. \"Soon, however, life in Summit would become easy and rich for the Bardeens.\"</ref>\n\nThe assignment of the group was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.  Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments mysteriously failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states, and they met almost daily to discuss the work.  The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.<ref>Brattain quoted in [https://books.google.com/books/about/Crystal_Fire.html?id=0bTpcTLCu6MC&pg=PA127 ''Crystal Fire'' p. 127]</ref> By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to ''[[Physical Review]]''. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments.  The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily and suggested that they use glycol borate (gu), a viscous chemical that didn't evaporate. Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Crystal_Fire.html?id=0bTpcTLCu6MC&pg=PA132 ''Crystal Fire'' p. 132]</ref> put a voltage on a droplet of gu placed across a [[p\u2013n junction]].\n\n===The invention of the transistor===\n{{main|Transistor|History of the transistor}}\n[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|340px|A stylized replica of the first transistor invented at Bell Labs on December 23, 1947]]\n\nOn December 23, 1947, Bardeen and Brattain were working without Shockley when they succeeded in creating a [[point-contact transistor]] that achieved amplification. By the next month, [[Bell Labs]]' patent attorneys started to work on the patent applications.<ref name=\"John Bardeen 2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/bardeen/bardeen2.html |title=Biography of John Bardeen 2 |accessdate=2007-12-24 |publisher=PBS }}</ref>\n\nBell Labs' attorneys soon discovered that Shockley's field effect principle had been anticipated and patented in 1930 by [[Julius Lilienfeld]], who filed his [[MESFET]]-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925.<ref>{{patent|US|1745175|\"Method and apparatus for controlling electric current\" first filing in Canada on 22.10.1925}}</ref>\n\nShockley publicly took the lion's share of the credit for the invention of transistor; this led to a deterioration of Bardeen's relationship with Shockley.<ref>Diane Kormos Buchwald. ''American Scientist'' 91.2 (Mar.-Apr. 2003): 185\u201386.</ref> Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 278</ref><ref>R Kessler, 1997, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1997/04/06/absent-at-the-creation/2a432ee5-b1e3-49b9-93f2-ad821d1832dd/  ''Absent at the Creation''], Washington Post Magazine.</ref>\n\nThe \"transistor\" (a combination of \"transconductance\" and \"resistor\") was 1/50 as large as the [[vacuum tube]]s it replaced in televisions and radios and allowed electrical devices to become more compact.<ref name=\"washpost\"/>\n\n===University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign===\n[[File:Bardeen plaque uiuc.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A commemorative plaque remembering John Bardeen and the theory of superconductivity, at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]]]\n\nBy 1951, Bardeen was looking for a new job.

Element, 1999, {{ISBN|1-86204-572-0}}.</ref>\n\n==Materials and methods==\nIn creating jewellery, [[gemstone]]s, [[coin]]s, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. Platinum alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually [[sterling silver]], or 92.5% fine silver. In [[costume jewellery]], [[stainless steel]] findings are sometimes used.\n\n[[File:Collar abalorios.jpg|thumb|Bead embroidery design.]]\n\nOther commonly used materials include [[glass]], such as fused-glass or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]; [[wood]], often carved or turned; [[Exoskeleton|shell]]s and other natural animal substances such as [[bone]] and [[ivory]]; natural [[clay]]; [[polymer clay]]; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give an English [[Assay office]] (the building which gives English jewellery its stamp of approval, the [[Hallmark]]) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.\n\n[[Bead]]s are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, [[wood]], shells, clay and polymer clay. [[beadwork|Beaded jewellery]] commonly encompasses [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[earring]]s, [[belt (clothing)|belt]]s and [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]s. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as [[seed bead]]s, these are the beads used for the \"woven\" style of beaded jewellery. Another use of seed beads is an embroidery technique where seed beads are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the [[Victorian era]], is enjoying a [[renaissance]] in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many [[African culture|African]] and indigenous North American cultures.\n\n[[Silversmith]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[Lapidary|lapidaries]] methods include [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], [[soldering]] or [[welding]], cutting, [[Lapidary|carving]] and \"cold-joining\" (using [[adhesive]]s, [[staple (fastener)|staples]] and [[rivet]]s to assemble parts).<ref>McCreight, Tim.

Among them are:\n\n;[[Amber]]: Amber, an ancient [[organic gemstone]], is composed of tree resin that has hardened over time. The stone must be at least one million years old to be classified as amber, and some amber can be up to 120 million years old.\n;[[Amethyst]]: Amethyst has historically been the most prized gemstone in the quartz family. It is treasured for its purple hue, which can range in tone from light to dark.\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]\n;[[Emerald]]: Emeralds are one of the three main precious gemstones (along with rubies and sapphires) and are known for their fine green to bluish green colour. They have been treasured throughout history, and some historians report that the Egyptians mined emerald as early as 3500 BC.\n;[[Jade]]: Jade is most commonly associated with the colour green but can come in a number of other colours as well. Jade is closely linked to Asian culture, history, and tradition, and is sometimes referred to as the ''stone of heaven''.\n;[[Jasper]]: Jasper is a gemstone of the chalcedony family that comes in a variety of colours. Often, jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone. Picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often beiges and browns) and swirls in the stone\u2019s pattern.\n;[[Quartz]]: Quartz refers to a family of crystalline gemstones of various colours and sizes.  Among the well-known types of quartz are [[rose quartz]] (which has a delicate pink colour), and smoky quartz (which comes in a variety of shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as [[Amethyst]] and [[Citrine]], are also part of the quartz family. [[Rutilated quartz]] is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.\n;[[Ruby]]: Rubies are known for their intense red colour and are among the most highly valued precious gemstones.  Rubies have been treasured for millennia. In [[Sanskrit]], the word for ruby is ''ratnaraj'', meaning ''king of precious stones''.\n;[[Sapphire]]: The most popular form of sapphire is blue sapphire, which is known for its medium to deep blue colour and strong saturation.  Fancy sapphires of various colours are also available.  In the United States, blue sapphire tends to be the most popular and most affordable of the three major precious gemstones (emerald, ruby, and sapphire).\n;[[Turquoise]]: Turquoise is found in only a few places on earth, and the world\u2019s largest turquoise producing region is the southwest United States.  Turquoise is prized for its attractive colour, most often an intense medium blue or a greenish blue, and its ancient heritage.  Turquoise is used in a great variety of jewellery styles.  It is perhaps most closely associated with southwest and Native American jewellery, but it is also used in many sleek, modern styles.  Some turquoise contains a matrix of dark brown markings, which provides an interesting contrast to the gemstone\u2019s bright blue colour.\n\nSome gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms.  Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.\n\nSome gems, for example, [[amethyst]], have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as [[cubic zirconia]], which can be used in place of diamond.<ref>Nassau, K. (1980).''Gems made by man''. {{ISBN|0-8019-6773-2}}</ref>\n\n===Metal finishes===\n[[File:A002.jpg|thumb|right|An example of gold plated jewellery]]\nFor [[platinum]], [[gold]], and [[silver]] jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, [[brushed metal|brushed]], and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as [[diamond]]s. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving \"brush strokes\". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy [[Surface texture|texture]].\n\nSome jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.\n\n==Impact on society==\nJewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings;<ref name=\"Pliny33\">Pliny the Elder. ''The Natural History''. ed. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]], Book XXXIII ''The Natural History of Metals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+33.1 Online at the Perseus Project] Chapter 4. Accessed July 2006</ref> later, [[sumptuary law]]s dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as [[Body piercing|piercings]], has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, [[hip hop]] culture has popularised the slang term [[bling-bling]], which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.\n\nConversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise [[wedding ring]]s for men, which caught on, as well as [[engagement ring]]s for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.<ref>Howard, Vicky. \"A real Man's Ring: Gender and the Invention of Tradition.\" ''Journal of Social History'', Summer 2003, pp 837\u2013856.</ref> Religion has also played a role in societies influence. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social [[Haraam|taboo]],<ref>[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]. ''[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/Q_LP/ The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam (online)]''</ref> and many religions have edicts against excessive display.<ref>Greenbaum, Toni. \"SILVER SPEAKS: TRADITIONAL JEWELRY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST\". ''Metalsmith'', Winter2004, Vol. 24, Issue 1, p.56. Greenbaum provides the explanation for the lack of historical examples; the majority of Islamic jewellery was in the form of bridal [[Dowry|dowries]], and traditionally was not handed down from generation to generation; instead, on a woman's death it was sold at the [[souk]] and recycled or sold to passers-by. Islamic jewellery from before the 19th century is thus exceedingly rare.</ref> In Christianity, the New Testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles Paul and Peter. In Revelation 17, \"the great whore\" or false religious system, is depicted as being \"decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand.\" (Rev. 17:4) For Muslims it is considered [[haraam]] for a man to wear [[gold]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|title=Dictionary of Islam|date=1995}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient [[culture]]s worked.\n\n===Prehistory===\n\nThe earliest known Jewellery was actually created not by humans (Homo Sapiens) but by Neanderthal living in Europe. Specifically, perforated beads made from small sea shells have been found dating to 115,000 years ago in the Cueva de los Aviones, a cave along the southeast coast of Spain. Later in Kenya, at [[Enkapune Ya Muto]], beads made from perforated [[ostrich]] egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news//3270-150507-siberia-denisovan-bracelet|title=Stone Bracelet May Have Been Made by Denisovans|year=2015|quote=A stone bracelet unearthed in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia in 2008 is being called the oldest-known jewelry of its kind. Anatoly Derevyanko, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, and the research team believe that the cave\u2019s Denisovan layers were uncontaminated by human activity from a later period. The soil around the two fragments of the jewelry piece was dated with oxygen isotopic analysis to 40,000 years ago. \"In the same layer, where we found a Denisovan bone, were found interesting things; until then it was believed these were the hallmark of the emergence of Homo sapiens. First of all, there were symbolic items, such as jewelry, including the stone bracelet as well as a ring, carved out of marble,\" Derevyanko told The Siberian Times}}</ref>\n\nLater, the [[European early modern humans]] had crude [[necklace]]s and [[bracelet]]s of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string or animal [[sinew]], or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. In some cases, jewellery had shell or [[mother-of-pearl]] pieces.\nA decorated engraved pendant (the [[Star Carr Pendant]]) dating to around 11,000 BC, and thought to be the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain, was found at the site of [[Star Carr]] in [[North Yorkshire]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.40.8 | issue=40 | title=A Unique Engraved Shale Pendant from the Site of Star Carr: the oldest Mesolithic art in Britain | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Milner | first1 = Nicky}}</ref> In southern [[Russia]], carved bracelets made of [[mammoth]] [[tusk]] have been found.

The last 2 million years. ''Reader's Digest''. {{ISBN|0-86438-007-0}}</ref> The [[Egyptians]] preferred the luxury, rarity, and workability of [[gold]] over other metals. In [[Predynastic Egypt]] jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among [[grave goods]].\n\nIn conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured [[glass]], along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. [[Lapis lazuli]] and silver had to be imported from beyond the country\u2019s borders.\n\nEgyptian designs were most common in [[Phoenicia]]n jewellery. Also, ancient [[Turkey|Turkish]] designs found in [[Persia]]n jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and [[Europe]] was not uncommon. Women wore elaborate gold and silver pieces that were used in ceremonies.<ref name=\"last2millionyears\" />\n\n===Europe and the Middle East===\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n[[File:Mesopotamian - Pair of Basket-Shaped Hair Ornaments - Walters 572064, 572065.jpg|thumb| Pair of Gold Hair Ornaments, Mesopotamian, circa 2000 BC (Isin-larsa period). Decorated with granulation and [[cloisonn\u00e9]]. [[Walters Art Museum]] collections.]]\nBy approximately 5,000 years ago, jewellery-making had become a significant craft in the cities of [[Mesopotamia]]. The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]], where hundreds of burials dating 2900\u20132300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of [[Puabi]] contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as [[lapis lazuli]] crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In [[Assyria]], men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including [[amulet]]s, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and [[cylinder seal]]s.<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 155\u2013157.</ref>\n\nJewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], fine [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]], and [[filigree]].<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 295\u2013297.</ref>\n\nExtensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites. One record in the [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] royal archives, for example, gives the composition of various items of jewellery: {{quote|\n* 1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including: 34 flat speckled chalcedony bead, [and] 35 gold fluted beads, in groups of five.\n* 1 necklace of flat speckled chalcedony beads including: 39 flat speckled chalcedony beads, [with] 41 fluted beads in a group that make up the hanging device.\n* 1 necklace with rounded lapis lazuli beads including: 28 rounded lapis lazuli beads, [and] 29 fluted beads for its clasp.<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 297.</ref>\n}}\n\n====Greece====\n[[File:Earring Mycenae Louvre Bj135.jpg|thumb|left|Gold earring from [[Mycenae]], 16th century BC.]] [[File:Gold Wreath.jpg|thumb|Gold Wreath]]\nThe Greeks started using gold and gems in jewellery in 1600 BC, although beads shaped as shells and animals were produced widely in earlier times. Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jewellery Through 7000 Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lZQAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=British Museum Publications|isbn=978-0-7141-0054-8|pages=65\u201386}}</ref> Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the \u2018Gold Olive Wreath\u2019 (4th century BC), which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Deppert-Lippitz, Barbara |author2=Bromberg, Anne R. |author3=Dennis, John |title=Ancient Gold Jewelry at the Dallas Museum of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUtQAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Dallas Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936227-19-1|chapter=Ch. 4 Europe and Western|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using [[amethyst]]s, [[pearl]], and [[emerald]]s. Also, the first signs of [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]s appeared, with the Greeks creating them from [[India]]n [[Sardonyx]], a striped brown pink and cream [[agate]] stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.\n\n[[File:Pendant Camiros Louvre Bj2169-9.jpg|thumb|right|Pendant with naked woman, made from [[electrum]], [[Rhodes]], around 630\u2013620 BC.]]\nJewellery in [[Greece]] was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the \"[[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]\" or endowed the owner with [[supernatural powers]], while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.\n\n[[File:Ancient Greek jewelry Pontika (Ukraina) 300 bC.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Greek jewellery from 300 BC.]]\nThey worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and [[wax]], followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.'''\nThe Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous [[polychrome]] butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near [[Olbia]], with only one example ever found anywhere else.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|title=Polychrome Necklaces from the Late Hellenistic Period|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greek - Bracelets from the Olbia Treasure - Walters 57375, 57376 - Group.jpg|thumb|left|These [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] bracelets from the 1st century BC show the influence of Eastern cultures.

The most common artefact of early Rome was the [[brooch]], which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads & pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported [[Sri Lanka]]n [[sapphire]]s and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and [[amber]] in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled [[England]], fossilised [[wood]] called [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger [[pendant]]s that could be filled with [[perfume]].\n\nLike the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the \"Evil Eye\" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an [[engraved gem]] on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into [[medieval]] times when [[Monarch|kings]] and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.<ref name=\"last2millionyears\" />\n\n==== Middle Ages ====\n[[File:Fibules m\u00e9rovingiennes 01.JPG|thumb|left|Merovingian fibulae, [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]].]]\n[[File:F\u00edbula aquiliforme (M.A.N.

The [[Celts]] and [[Merovingians]] in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, [[signet ring]]s, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the [[Tara Brooch]]. The [[Torc]] was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6th\u20137th century burial near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]] are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle.<ref>Duby Georges and Philippe Ari\u00e8s, eds.

Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like [[kolt]]s that decorated [[headband]].\nLike other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.<ref name=\"Byzantium\">Sherrard, P.

Time-Life International.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n====Renaissance====\n[[File:Cameo Claudius Cdm Paris Chab220.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sardonyx]] [[cameo (carving)|cameo]].]]\nThe [[Renaissance]] and exploration both had significant impacts on the development of jewellery in Europe. By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the [[Cheapside Hoard]], the stock of a jeweller hidden in [[London]] during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian [[emerald]], [[topaz]], [[amazonite]] from Brazil, [[spinel]], [[iolite]], and [[chrysoberyl]] from Sri Lanka, [[ruby]] from India, Afghan [[lapis lazuli]], [[Iran|Persian]] [[turquoise]], Red Sea [[peridot]], as well as Bohemian and Hungarian [[opal]], [[garnet]], and [[amethyst]]. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings.<ref>Scarisbrick, Diana. ''Rings: Symbols of Wealth, Power, and Affection''. New York: Abrams, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8109-3775-1}} p&nbsp;77.</ref> Notable among merchants of the period was [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]], who brought the precursor stone of the [[Hope Diamond]] to France in the 1660s.\n\nWhen [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon\u2019s rule, jewellers introduced ''[[parure]]s'', suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond [[tiara]], diamond [[earring]]s, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon\u2019s wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of [[costume jewellery]], with [[Scale (zoology)|fish scale]] covered glass beads in place of [[pearl]]s or [[conch]] shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called ''bijoutiers'', while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called ''joailliers'', a practice which continues to this day.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Romanticism====\n[[File:Schwarzer Trauerschmuck2.jpg|thumb|right|Mourning jewellery in the form of a [[jet (lignite)|jet]] [[brooch]], 19th century.]]\nStarting in the late 18th century, [[Romanticism]] had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the public\u2019s fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern [[archaeology]] and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or [[costume jewellery]]. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith [[Fran\u00e7ois-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Froment-Meurice]]. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery. It originated in England, where [[Queen Victoria]] was often seen wearing [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] jewellery after the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one.<ref name = \"1000facts\"/>\n\nIn the United States, this period saw the founding in 1837 of [[Tiffany & Co.]] by [[Charles Lewis Tiffany]]. Tiffany's put the United States on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]. In France, [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Pierre Cartier]] founded [[Cartier SA]] in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of [[Bulgari]] in Italy. The modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and [[patronage]].\n\nThis period also saw the first major collaboration between East and West. Collaboration in [[Pforzheim]] between German and Japanese artists led to [[Shakud\u014d]] plaques set into [[Filigree]] frames being created by the Stoeffler firm in 1885).<ref>Ilse-Neuman, Ursula.

Fall2006, Vol. 26 Issue 3, p12\u201313, 2p</ref> Perhaps the grand final\u00e9 \u2013 and an appropriate transition to the following period \u2013 were the masterful creations of the Russian artist [[Peter Carl Faberg\u00e9]], working for the Imperial Russian court, whose [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]]s and jewellery pieces are still considered as the epitome of the goldsmith\u2019s art.\n\n====18th Century / Romanticism/ Renaissance====\nMany whimsical fashions were introduced in the extravagant eighteenth century. Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 9781289626945|page=71}}</ref>\n\n====Art Nouveau====\nIn the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing [[Art Nouveau]] style and the closely related German [[Jugendstil]], British (and to some extent American) [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Catalan [[Modernisme]], Austro-Hungarian [[Sezession]], Italian \"Liberty\", etc.\n\nArt Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonn\u00e9, and [[plique-\u00e0-jour]].  Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], working for the Paris shop of [[Samuel Bing]], was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The [[Darmstadt Artists' Colony]] and [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]] provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark [[Georg Jensen]], though best known for his [[Silver (household)|Silverware]], also contributed significant pieces. In England, [[Liberty & Co.]], (notably through the [[Cymric (metalware)|Cymric]] designs of [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]) and the British arts & crafts movement of [[Charles Robert Ashbee]] contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's dragonfly design is one of the best examples of this. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamel]]s played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.\n\nThe end of [[World War I]] once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.<ref>Constantino, Maria. ''Art Nouveau''. Knickerbocker Press; 1999 {{ISBN|1-57715-074-0}} as well as Ilse-Neuman 2006.</ref>\n\n====Art Deco====\nGrowing political tensions, the after-effects of the war, and a reaction against the perceived decadence of the turn of the 20th century led to simpler forms, combined with more effective manufacturing for mass production of high-quality jewellery. Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as [[Art Deco]]. [[Walter Gropius]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] movement, with their philosophy of \"no barriers between artists and craftsmen\" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master [[Naum Slutzky]]. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German [[Elizabeth Treskow]], although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.\n\n===Asia===\n[[File:Andhra Pradesh Royal earrings 1st Century BCE.jpg|thumb|Royal earrings, [[India]], 1st Century BC.]]\n[[File:Bhupendra Singh Patiala.jpg|thumb|[[India]]n king [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala]] wearing [[Patiala Necklace]] which contained 2,930 diamonds, including as its centrepiece, the world's seventh largest diamond, the \"De Beers\", that had a 428 carat pre-cut weigh, and weighed 234.65 carats in its final setting.

Blue [[kingfisher]] [[feather]]s were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, [[jade]] was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty.<ref name=\"kingfisherhistory\" /> The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. Jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries BC show evidence of having been worked with a compound [[milling machine]], hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.<ref>Lu, Peter J., \"Early Precision Compound Machine from Ancient China.\" ''Science,'' 6/11/2004, Vol. 304, Issue 5677</ref>\n\n[[File:Huan in shape of a coiled serpent.jpg|thumb|right|Jade coiled serpent, [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC\u2013220 AD)]]\n[[File:Chinese Xin Shape Jewelry from Ming Dynasty Tombs.jpg|thumb|right|`Xin' Shape Jewellery from [[Ming Dynasty Tombs]], (1368\u20131644)]]\n\nIn China, the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Amulet]]s were common, often with a Chinese symbol or [[dragon]].

Qajar Dynasty. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\n\nThe [[Indian subcontinent]] (encompassing [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and other countries of South Asia) has a long jewellery history, which went through various changes through cultural influence and politics for more than 5,000\u20138,000 years. Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years.<ref name=\"Untracht, Oppi p15\"/> One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic [[bangle]]s. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the [[bead]] trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age.  Persian style also played a big role in India\u2019s jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.\n\nJewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day [[India]], bangles are made out of [[metal]] or glass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/bangles.html |title=Bangles|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=4 March 2013}}</ref> Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, [[choker]]s, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and women\u2019s hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.\n\nA female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. ''Kada'' is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolizes animals like peacock, elephant,<ref>{{cite web|title=When showstopper Juhi walked down the ramp|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-08/bollywood/39833107_1_gehna-jewellers-sunil-datwani-ramp|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> etc.\n\nAccording to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon.  Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality.  Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Untracht|first=Oppi|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=1997|isbn=0-8109-3886-3|pages=278}}</ref> \n[[File:Antique Indian Nose Ring Jewellery.jpg|thumb|right|Antique Pearl & Gold Nose Ring, India, 19th century]]\n\nJewellery had great status with India\u2019s royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals.  Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, [[Maharaja]]s and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The [[Maharaja]]'s role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=Katherine|last2=Adamson|first2=John|title=Maharajas' Jewels|year=2000|publisher=Vendome Press|location=New York|isbn=9780865652187|pages=12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Navaratna-ring.jpg|thumb|upright|A Navaratna ring.]]\n[[Navaratna]] (nine gems)is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a [[Maharaja]] (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cat\u2019s eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, represented the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies. \"Only the emperor himself, his intimate relations, and select members of his entourage were permitted to wear royal turban ornament. As the empire matured, differing styles of ornament acquired the generic name of [[sarpech]], from sar or sir, meaning head, and pech, meaning fastener.\"\n\n[[India]] was the first country to mine [[diamond]]s, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lover\u2019s or ruler\u2019s lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and worldly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes.  Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=2000|publisher=Vendome|location=New York|pages=312}}</ref> \nToday, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and [[Indian wedding|wedding]]s.<ref name=\"vanished\" />\n\n===North and South America===\nJewellery played a major role in the fate of the [[Americas]] when the [[Spain|Spanish]] established an empire to seize [[South America]]n gold.

Large amounts of gold was easily accessible, and the [[Aztec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Maya civilisation|Mayans]], and numerous Andean cultures, such as the Mochica of Peru, created beautiful pieces of jewellery.\n\nWith the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst.

In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige.

At the peak of their civilization, the Maya were making jewellery from jade, gold, silver, [[bronze]], and [[copper]]. Maya designs were similar to those of the Aztecs, with lavish headdresses and jewellery. The Maya also traded in precious gems.

Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. [[Native American tribes]] continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, \"[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information.\" Later, jewellery and personal adornment \"...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity.\"<ref>Dubin, 17</ref>\n\nMetalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.\n\n===Pacific===\n{{Main article|Jewellery in the Pacific}}\nJewellery making in the [[Pacific]] started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.\n\nJewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of [[Papua New Guinea]], wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.\n\nIsland jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"pacific\">Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment.

Other advances, such as the development of improved [[pearl]] harvesting by people such as [[Mikimoto K\u014dkichi]] and the development of improved quality artificial gemstones such as [[moissanite]] (a [[diamond simulant]]), has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.\n\nThe [[Art jewellery|\"jewellery as art\"]] movement was spearheaded by artisans such as [[Robert Lee Morris]] and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is [[bling-bling]] style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. [[Grill (jewelry)|grills]], a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.\n\n[[File:Shraddha Kapoor at IBJA awards and fashion showcase.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Indian actress [[Shraddha Kapoor]] showcasing a modern Indian-style jewelry.]]\nThe late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as [[Mokume-gane]]. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: \"Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic [[raising (metalworking)|raising]], [[fold-forming]], reactive metal anodising, shell forms, [[Metal clay|PMC]], [[photoetching]], and [use of] [[CAD/CAM]].\"<ref>McCrieght, Tim.  \"What's New?\" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, p42\u201345, 4p</ref>\n\nAlso, [[3D printing]] as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for [[prototype]]s, small batch series or unique and [[Personalization|personalized]] designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include [[Polyamide]], [[steel]] and [[wax]] (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using [[3D Modelling Software]].\n\n[[Art jewellery|Artisan jewellery]] continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ajew/hd_ajew.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century American Jewelry|work=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\nThe increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.\n\nMore expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as [[Metal Couture]].<ref>Mohemad, Dena.

For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.\n[[File:Masonic jewels.jpg|thumb|Masonic collar jewels]]\n\n== Body modification ==\n[[File:Karen Padaung Girl Portrait.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] girl in Northern Thailand.]]\n\nJewellery used in [[body modification]] can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates.  Common jewellery pieces such as, earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.\n\n[[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] women in [[Myanmar]] place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves.  At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach {{convert|10|\u2013|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity.<ref name=\"ripleys\">Packard, M. (2002). ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition]]''. Scholastic Inc. p. 22.</ref>  Tribes related to the Paduang, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings.  In the Americas, [[labret]]s have been worn since before [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] by [[Innu]] and [[First Nations]] peoples of the northwest coast.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|jstor=483428|title=George Catlin among the Nayas: Understanding the Practice of Labret Wearing on the Northwest Coast|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref> [[Lip plate]]s are worn by the African [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Sara people]], as well as some South American peoples.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the influence of [[modern primitive|modern primitivism]] led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures.  Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.\n\nIn many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin.  Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture.  Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin.  Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air.  This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.<ref name=\"ripleys\" />\n\n==Jewellery market==\nAccording to a 2007 KPMG study,<ref name = giasummer2007>{{cite journal| last = KPMG India | title= Global Jewelry Consumption | journal= Gems and Gemology | volume= XLIII |issue= Summer 2007| pages=180 |publisher=GIA| year=2007 }}</ref> the largest jewellery market is the United States with a market share of 30.8%, Japan, India, China, and the Middle East each with 8\u20139%, and Italy with 5%.

After completing his studies, Berglin has been living in [[G\u00e4vle]] where he works as a teacher of Swedish and religion. He published his early strips in the local social democratic newspaper ''[[Arbetarbladet]]'', but became known to a wider audience in 1995, when he started to draw for the Stockholm-based but nationally distributed conservative newspaper ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]''. His strips have been collected and republished in several albums.\n\nBerglin's strips, usually in four panels, tend to find their humour in a sometimes absurd mix of everyday situations and literary and philosophical references or reflections. When he was awarded the Alf Henrikson Prize in 2004, the jury's motivation spoke of his renditions of the \"existence of the everyday human between ideals and matter\".\n\nIn later years Berglin has acknowledged the input of his wife Maria Berglin, an artist and literary critic, within his strips by signing them \"Berglins\".\n\n==Albums==\n* ''Samlade serier'' (\"Collected comics\") (1992)\n* ''Avanti! - Serier f\u00f6r f\u00f6rryckta'' (1995)\n* ''Mitt i currykrysset - serier mot sekelslutsleda'' (1997)\n* ''Andra bullar!''

The first vignette, \"Strange to Meet You\", had been shot for and aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1986, and paired Roberto Benigni with comedian [[Steven Wright]]. This had been followed three years later by \"Twins\", a segment featuring actors [[Steve Buscemi]] and [[Joie Lee|Joie]] and [[Cinqu\u00e9 Lee]], and then in 1993 with the [[Short Film Palme d'Or]]-winning \"Somewhere in California\", starring musicians Tom Waits and [[Iggy Pop]].<ref name=rush/>\n\nHe followed ''Coffee and Cigarettes'' in 2005 with ''[[Broken Flowers]]'', which starred [[Bill Murray]] as an early retiree who goes in search of the mother of his unknown son in attempt to overcome a midlife crisis.

It's going to take a few years. There's no rush on it, but it's something that Iggy asked me to do. I'm co-writing an \"opera.\" It won't be a traditional opera, but it'll be about the inventor [[Nikola Tesla]], with the composer Phil Klein. I have a new film project that's really foremost for me that I hope to shoot early next year with Tilda Swinton and Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, who was Alice in Wonderland in Tim Burton's film. I don't have that quite financed yet, so I'm working on that. I'm also making music and hoping to maybe score some silent films to put out. Our band will have an EP that we'll give out at ATP.

''The Salt Lake Tribune'' critic Sean P. Means wrote that Jarmusch blends \"film styles and genres with sharp wit and dark humor\",<ref name=means/> while his style is also defined by a signature deadpan comedic tone.<ref name=tobias/>\n\nThe protagonists of Jarmusch's films are usually lone adventurers.<ref name=nyt/> The director's male characters have been described by critic Jennie Yabroff as \"three time losers, petty thiefs and inept con men, all [...] eminently likeable, if not down right charming\";<ref name=yabroff/> while novelist [[Paul Auster]] described them as \"laconic, withdrawn, sorrowful mumblers\".<ref name=auster/>\n\nJarmusch has revealed that his instinct is a greater influence during the filmmaking process than any cognitive processes. He explained: \"I feel like I have to listen to the film and let it tell me what it wants. Sometimes it mumbles and it isn't very clear.\" Films such as ''Dead Man'' and ''Limits of Control'' have polarized fans and general viewers alike, as Jarmusch's stylistic instinct is embedded in his strong sense of independence.<ref name=\"Jon\" />\n\n===Themes===\n[[File:Jim Jarmusch Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jarmusch at the [[2005 Cannes Film Festival]].]]\nThough his films are predominantly set in the United States, Jarmusch has advanced the notion that he looks at America \"through a foreigner's eyes\", with the intention of creating a form of world cinema that synthesizes European and Japanese film with that of Hollywood.<ref name=bio/> His films have often included foreign actors and characters, and (at times substantial) non-English dialogue. In his two later-nineties films, he dwelt on different cultures' experiences of violence, and on textual appropriations between cultures: a wandering Native American's love of [[William Blake]], a black hitman's passionate devotion to the ''[[Hagakure]]''. The interaction and syntheses between different cultures, the arbitrariness of national identity, and irreverence towards ethnocentric, patriotic or nationalistic sentiment are recurring themes in Jarmusch's work.<ref name=yabroff/><ref name=klein/>\n\nJarmusch's fascination for music is another characteristic that is readily apparent in his work.<ref name=allmovie/><ref name=canby/> Musicians appear frequently in key roles \u2013 [[John Lurie]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Gary Farmer]], [[Youki Kudoh]], [[RZA]] and [[Iggy Pop]] have featured in multiple Jarmusch films, while [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] appear in ''Mystery Train'' and [[GZA]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack]] and [[Meg White]] feature in ''Coffee and Cigarettes''. Hawkins' song \"[[I Put a Spell on You]]\" was central to the plot of ''Stranger than Paradise'', while ''Mystery Train'' is inspired by and named after [[Mystery Train|a song]] popularized by [[Elvis Presley]], who is also the subject of a vignette in ''Coffee and Cigarettes''.<ref name=allmovie/> In the words of critic [[Vincent Canby]], \"Jarmusch's movies have the tempo and rhythm of blues and jazz, even in their use \u2013 or omission \u2013 of language. His films work on the senses much the way that some music does, unheard until it's too late to get it out of one's head.\"<ref name=canby/>\n\nOn his narrative focus, Jarmusch remarked in a 1989 interview, \"I'd rather make a movie about a guy walking his dog than about the emperor of China.\"<ref name=sante/>\n\n===Impact and legacy===\nJarmusch is ascribed as having instigated the American independent film movement with ''Stranger Than Paradise''.<ref name=morned/> In her description of the film in a 2005 profile of the director for ''[[The New York Times]]'', critic Lynn Hirschberg declared that ''Stranger than Paradise'' \"permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant-garde form\".<ref name=last/> The success of the film accorded the director a certain iconic status within [[arthouse cinema]], as an idiosyncratic and uncompromising [[auteur]], exuding the aura of urban cool embodied by [[downtown Manhattan]].<ref name=indians/><ref name=rosenbaum/> Such perceptions were compounded with the release of his subsequent features in the late 1980s, establishing him as one of the generation's most prominent and influential independent filmmakers.<ref name=blair/><ref name=slpd/>\n\nNew York critic and festival director Kent Jones undermined the \"urban cool\" association that Jarmusch has garnered and was quoted in a February 2014 media article, following the release of his eleventh feature film:<blockquote>There's been an overemphasis on the hipness factor \u2013 and a lack of emphasis on his incredible attachment to the idea of celebrating poetry and culture.

It's the type worn by blues musicians, '50s greasers and the downbeat bohemian odd couple Willie and Eddie of Jarmusch's second film ''Stranger than Paradise''. A small triangular silver Triumph motorcycle pin affixed to the lapel is a tip-off to one of Jarmusch's chief recreational passions. Among Jarmusch cognoscenti, the shock of thick, almost white hair that rises from his head in a handsomely shaped post-punk spike is another unmistakable signature.<br/>In the eight years since ''Stranger than Paradise'' became an arthouse hit, Jarmusch has garnered a loyal but limited American audience. Yet abroad, particularly in Japan and Europe, both Jarmusch and his films have achieved cult status. For foreigners, perhaps even more so than for Americans, Jarmusch's films are the sine qua non of post-modern American hipdom. They articulate a distinctly funky, low-tech, outcast vision of American society that in both ethos and esthetics draws upon and amusingly blends the past five decades of postwar culture. While in content his films quietly defy Hollywood's myths of American progress and prosperity, in form (due to their stylistic simplicity and small budgets) they are a retort to the movie industry's bloated excess.<br />Recently, at the Yugoslavian film festival, 6,000 people turned out to fill a 4,000-seat theater for a midnight showing of Jarmusch's latest film, ''Night on Earth'' in wartorn Belgrade. In the past several months a traveling \"Jim Jarmusch Film Festival\" was held in major cities throughout Poland. {{Sic|nolink=y|Czechosl|avakia}} will soon hold such a festival. And in Japan, where the director is a national celebrity, he is offered huge sums to appear in and direct commercials. To date he has turned down all offers.}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=tasker>{{Cite book|last=Tasker|first=Yvonne|title=Fifty Contemporary Filmmakers|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|year=2002|isbn=0-415-18974-8|oclc=47764371|series=Routledge Key Guides|chapter=Stranger than Fiction: The rise and fall of Jim Jarmusch|pages=177\u201378|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=susman>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/movies/reviews/05-09-96/DEAD_BAR.html|first=Gary|last=Susman|accessdate=September 27, 2009|work=[[Boston Phoenix]]|title=''Dead Man'' talking|publisher=Phoenix Media/Communications Group|date=May 9\u201316, 1996|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501164336/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/movies/reviews/05-09-96/DEAD_BAR.html|archivedate=May 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=revisionism>{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Mary Katherine|title=Now You Are a Killer of White Men: Jim Jarmusch's ''Dead Man'' and Traditions of Revisionism in the Western|journal=Journal of Film and Video|volume=52|issue=4|date=Winter 2000|pages=3\u201314|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=rush>{{cite news|title=With 'Coffee', Jim Jarmusch lacks for rush|work=Chicago Tribune|first=Mark|last=Caro|date=May 28, 2004|url=http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-coffee-and/158893/content|accessdate=May 10, 2009|quote=But then 1992's \"Somewhere in California\", which won the Cannes Film Festival's short-film Palme D'Or, offers the delicious spectacle of [Iggy Pop] and [Tom Waits] meeting in some remote dumpy bar, with Iggy playing the shaggy, eager-to-please puppy while the edgy Waits finds ways to take constant umbrage.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817011226/http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/review/movie-review-coffee-and/158893/content|archivedate=August 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dawtrey>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|date=May 17, 2005|last=Dawtrey|first=Adam|publisher=Reed Business Information|quote=Jim Jarmusch, whose latest pic \"Broken Flowers\" premieres in the Cannes competition today, has struck a multi-year first-look deal with Fortissimo Films.<br/>This is the first time Fortissimo has entered a formal long-term relationship with an individual filmmaker, and marks a major step forward by the Hong Kong and Amsterdam-based sales company in its drive for English-language movies.<br/>Fortissimo has agreed to provide financing to upcoming Jarmusch films, including a contribution to the overheads of his New York-based production banner Exoskeleton.|title=Jim Jarmusch}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=rinaldi>{{cite web|url=http://limitedcontrol.posterous.com/behind-jim-jarmusch|work=Limited Control|first=Ludwig|last=Hertzberg|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=August 15, 2009|publisher=Posterous|title=Behind Jim Jarmusch}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=golden>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/jim_jarmusch_2972|title=Jim Jarmusch's Golden Rules|work=[[MovieMaker Magazine]]|publisher=MovieMaker Publishing|accessdate=April 26, 2009|date=January 22, 2004|last=Jarmusch|first=Jim|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506115857/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/jim_jarmusch_2972|archivedate=May 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=burr>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275620,00.html|title=Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 17, 2009|last=Burr|first=Ty|date=March 10, 2000|quote=... minimalist director who found fame with 1984's ''Stranger Than Paradise'' ...}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=tribune>{{Cite news|work=[[The News Tribune]]|date=April 21, 2000|title=Director Jim Jarmusch delivers offbeat mob movie ''Ghost Dog''|quote=Jim Jarmusch makes movies unlike anyone else's.

Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based [[ink]] for printing books;<ref>Soap, Sex, and Cigarettes: A Cultural History of American Advertising By Juliann Sivulka, page 5</ref> adjustable molds;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-4/influential-personalities/gutenbergs-invention|title=Gutenberg\u2019s Invention - Fonts.com|author=|date=|website=Fonts.com}}</ref> mechanical movable type; and the use of a wooden [[printing press]] similar to the agricultural [[screw press]]es of the period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/2569-gutenberg-changed-world.html|title=How Gutenberg Changed the World|author=|date=|website=livescience.com}}</ref> His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg's method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a [[type metal]] alloy and a [[hand mould#Printing|hand mould]] for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and [[antimony]] that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.\n\nIn [[Renaissance]] Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of [[mass communication]] which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information\u2014including revolutionary ideas\u2014transcended borders, captured the masses in the [[Reformation]] and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in [[literacy]] broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging [[middle class]]. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-[[nationalism]], accelerated by the flowering of the European [[Vernacular|vernacular languages]] to the detriment of [[Latin]]'s status as ''[[lingua franca]]''. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by [[steam-powered]] [[rotary press]]es allowed printing on an [[industry|industrial]] scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.\n\nThe use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon [[woodblock printing]], and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg's [[Spread of the printing press|printing technology spread]] rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.\n\nHis major work, the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Johannes Gutenberg.jpg|thumb|Gutenberg in a 16th-century copper engraving]]\n\nGutenberg was born in the German city of [[Mainz]], the youngest son of the [[Patrician_(post-Roman_Europe)#German_cities_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire|patrician]] merchant Friele Gensfleisch zur Laden, and his second wife, Else Wyrich, who was the daughter of a shopkeeper.

In this capacity they doubtless acquired considerable knowledge and technical skill in metal working.

As a result, the Gutenbergs are thought to have moved to [[Eltville am Rhein]] (Alta Villa), where his mother had an inherited estate. According to historian Heinrich Wallau, \"All that is known of his youth is that he was not in Mainz in 1430. It is presumed that he migrated for political reasons to [[Strasbourg]], where the family probably had connections.\"<ref name=CE /> He is assumed to have studied at the [[University of Erfurt]], where there is a record of the enrolment of a student called Johannes de Altavilla in 1418\u2014Altavilla is the Latin form of Eltville am Rhein.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Henri-Jean|authorlink=Henri-Jean Martin|title=The History and Power of Writing|year=1995|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-50836-6|page=217|chapter=The arrival of print}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Leonard|title=Information revolutions in the history of the West|year=2008|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Northampton, MA|isbn=978-1-84720-790-6|page=78|chapter=The Map-maker's son}}</ref>\n\nNothing is now known of Gutenberg's life for the next fifteen years, but in March 1434, a letter by him indicates that he was living in Strasbourg, where he had some relatives on his mother's side. He also appears to have been a goldsmith member enrolled in the Strasbourg [[militia]]. In 1437, there is evidence that he was instructing a wealthy tradesman on polishing gems, but where he had acquired this knowledge is unknown.

When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a \"secret\". It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with [[movable type]]. Also around 1439\u201340, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] came up with the idea of printing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=James|authorlink=James Burke (science historian)|title=Connections|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|year=1978|location=[[London]]|page=101|isbn=0-333-24827-9}}</ref> Legend has it that the idea came to him \"like a ray of light\".<ref name=universe>{{cite book|author=Burke, James|title=The Day the Universe Changed|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=1985|location=[[Boston]], [[Toronto]]|isbn=0-316-11695-5}}</ref>\n\nUntil at least 1444 Gutenberg lived in [[Strasbourg]], most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that he is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled ''Aventur und Kunst'' (enterprise and art). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law [[Arnold Gelthus]], quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper [[engraving]]s with an artist known as the [[Master of Playing Cards]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Lehmann-Haupt, Hellmut|title=Gutenberg and the Master of the Playing Cards|location=[[New Haven]]|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=1966}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|width     = 220px\n|align     = left\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|title     =\n|quote=\"All that has been written to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt {{sic}} is true.

[[Peter Sch\u00f6ffer]], who became Fust's son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Sch\u00f6ffer had worked as a scribe in [[Paris]] and is believed to have designed some of the first [[typeface]]s.\n\nGutenberg's workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of [[indulgence]]s for the church, documented from 1454 to 1455.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelley|first1=Peter|title=Documents that Changed the World: Gutenberg indulgence, 1454|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2012/11/16/documents-that-changed-the-world-gutenberg-indulgence-1454/|website=UW Today|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1455 Gutenberg completed his ''42-line Bible'', known as the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on [[vellum]].\n\n=== Court case ===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}\nSome time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg's debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop's court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a \"project of the books,\" the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.\n\nThus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of [[Bamberg]] around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large [[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|''Catholicon'' dictionary]], 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, was executed in his workshop.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fust\u2013Sch\u00f6ffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer's name and date, the ''[[Mainz Psalter]]'' of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.\n\n=== Later life ===\nIn 1462, during the devastating [[Mainz Diocesan Feud]], Mainz was sacked by archbishop [[Adolph II of Nassau|Adolph von Nassau]], and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to [[Eltville]] where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechterm\u00fcnze.<ref name=CE />\n\nIn January 1465, Gutenberg's achievements were recognized and he was given the title ''Hofmann'' (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a [[stipend]], an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free.<ref name=sumner2009 /> It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.\n\nGutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg's grave is now lost.<ref name=sumner2009 />\n\nIn 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of [[typography]] in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon's biography of famous Germans.<ref name=sumner2009>{{cite book|last1=Sumner|first1=Tracy M.|title=How Did We Get the Bible?|date=2009|publisher=Barbour Publishing|isbn=978-1-60742-349-2|edition=unabridged}}</ref>\n\n== Printed books ==\n{{Main|Gutenberg Bible}}\n[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|''Gutenberg Bible'', [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]\n\nBetween 1450 and 1455, Gutenberg printed several texts, some of which remain unidentified; his texts did not bear the printer's name or date, so attribution is possible only from typographical evidence and external references. Certainly several church documents including a papal letter and two indulgences were printed, one of which was issued in Mainz. In view of the value of printing in quantity, seven editions in two styles were ordered, resulting in several thousand copies being printed.<ref>Meggs, Philip B., Purvis, Alston W.''History of Graphic Design''. Hoboken, N.J: Wiley, 2006. p.71.</ref> Some printed editions of ''Ars Minor'', a schoolbook on Latin grammar by [[Aelius Donatus]] may have been printed by Gutenberg; these have been dated either 1451\u201352 or 1455.\n\nIn 1455, Gutenberg completed copies of a beautifully executed folio [[Bible]] (''Biblia Sacra''), with 42 lines on each page. Copies sold for 30 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] each,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cormack, Lesley B. |author2=Ede, Andrew |title=A History of Science in Society: From Philosophy to Utility|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2004|isbn=1-55111-332-5}}</ref> which was roughly three years' wages for an average clerk. Nonetheless, it was significantly cheaper than a manuscript Bible that could take a single scribe over a year to prepare. After printing, some copies were rubricated or hand-illuminated in the same elegant way as manuscript Bibles from the same period.\n\n48 substantially complete copies are known to survive, including two at the [[British Library]] that can be viewed and compared online.<ref name=britLibrary>{{cite web|url=http://prodigi.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/search.asp|title=Treasures in Full: Gutenberg Bible|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=[[British Library]]}}</ref> The text lacks modern features such as [[pagination]], [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentations]], and [[paragraph break]]s.\n\nAn undated [[36-line Bible|36-line edition of the Bible]] was printed, probably in [[Bamberg]] in 1458\u201360, possibly by Gutenberg. A large part of it was shown to have been set from a copy of Gutenberg's Bible, thus disproving earlier speculation that it was the earlier of the two.<ref name=\"Kapr\">{{cite book|last=Kapr|first=Albert|title=Johannes Gutenberg: the Man and His Invention|publisher=Scolar Press|year=1996|page=322|isbn=1-85928-114-1}}</ref>\n\n== Printing method with movable type ==\n[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|thumb|Movable metal type, and composing stick, descended from Gutenberg's press.]]\n\n[[File:95Thesen.jpg|thumb|Martin Luther's ''[[95 Theses]]'' which sparked off the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in a print edition from 1522.

His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Singer, C.; [[E. Holmyard|Holmyard, E.]]; Hall, A.; Williams, T.|title=A History of Technology, vol.3|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1958}}</ref> Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg\u2013Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.\n\nGutenberg's technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.\n\nIn the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by [[punchcutting]], with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a ''[[matrix (printing)|matrix]]''. This is then placed into a [[hand mould|hand-held mould]] and a piece of type, or \"sort\", is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or [[font]]s. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of \"movable type\". (For details, see [[Typography]].)\n\n[[File:Printing3 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|thumb|left|[[Walk of Ideas|\"Modern Book Printing\"]] \u2212 sculpture commemorating its inventor Gutenberg]]\n\nThe invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg's process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variation due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg's earliest work shows other variations.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn 2001, the physicist [[Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] librarian [[Paul Needham (librarian)|Paul Needham]], used digital scans of a Papal bull in the [[Scheide Library]], Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text.<ref>{{cite conference|first=Blaise|last=Ag\u00fcera y Arcas|author2=Needham, Paul|title=Computational analytical bibliography|booktitle=Proceedings Bibliopolis Conference ''The future history of the book''|publisher=[[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]|date=November 2002|location=[[The Hague]] ([[Netherlands]])}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.open2.net/gberg_synopsis.html |title=What Did Gutenberg Invent?|accessdate=Aug 16, 2011}}</ref> The irregularities in Gutenberg's type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come either from ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. Although some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional [[punchcutting]] techniques. They hypothesized that the method involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in \"cuneiform\" style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.\n\nThus, they speculated that \"the decisive factor for the birth of typography\", the use of reusable moulds for casting type, was a more progressive process than was previously thought.<ref>{{cite book|author = Adams, James L.|title = Flying Buttresses, Entropy and O-Rings: the World of an Engineer|year = 1991|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]|isbn = 0-674-30688-0}}</ref> They suggested that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains uncertain.<ref>Nash, Paul W. \"The 'first' type of Gutenberg: a note on recent research\" in ''The Private Library'', Summer 2004, pp. 86-96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mikl\u00f3s Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]\n\nA 1568 history by [[Hadrianus Junius]] of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from [[Haarlem]] to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the [[Cologne Chronicle]] of 1499 quotes [[Ulrich Zell]], the first printer of [[Cologne]], that printing was performed in [[Mainz]] in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster,<ref name=\"Kapr\" /><ref name=\"Juchhoff 1950, 131f.\">{{harvnb|Juchhoff|1950|pp=131f.}}</ref> while it actually credits Gutenberg as the \"first inventor of printing\" in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471,<ref name=\"Juchhoff 1950, 131f.\" /> and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.<ref>[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_07.html Costeriana]. While the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] had attributed the invention of the printing press to Coster, the more recent editions of the work attribute it to Gutenberg to reflect, as it says, the common consent that has developed in the 20th century. \"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-36788/typography Typography \u2013 Gutenberg and printing in Germany].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 2007.</ref>\n\nThe 19th-century printer and typefounder [[Fournier Le Jeune]] suggested that Gutenberg was not using type cast with a reusable matrix, but wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004.<ref>See Nash (2004).</ref> This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.\n\nIt has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{quote box\n|width     = 230px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|title     =\n|quote=\"What the world is today, good and bad, it owes to Gutenberg.

It fed the growing [[Renaissance]], and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later [[scientific revolution]].\n\nThe capital of printing in Europe shifted to [[Venice]], where visionary printers like [[Aldus Manutius]] ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Additionally, Italy's economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. [[Christopher Columbus]] had a geographical book (printed by movable types) bought by his father. That book is in a Spanish museum. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many (including a number of printers and punch cutters) into exile.\n\nPrinting was also a factor in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. [[Martin Luther]]'s  [[95 Theses]] were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he issued [[broadsheet]]s outlining his anti-[[indulgences]] position (certificates of indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). The broadsheet contributed to development of the [[newspaper]].\n\n[[File:Featherbed Alley Printshop Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|A Gutenberg press replica at the [[Featherbed Alley Printshop]] Museum, in [[Bermuda]]]]\n\nIn the decades after Gutenberg, many conservative patrons looked down on cheap printed books; books produced by hand were considered more desirable.\n\nToday there is a large [[antique]] market for the earliest printed objects. Books printed prior to 1500 are known as ''[[incunabula]]''.\n\nThere are many statues of Gutenberg in Germany, including the famous one by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] (1837) in Mainz, home to the eponymous [[Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz]] and the [[Gutenberg Museum]] on the history of early printing.

Mayol spent his summer vacations in Karatsu (Japan) every year as a child. When he was 7, he would skin dive with his older brother in seas around Nanatsugama (Japan), where he saw a dolphin for the first time. Mayol described the fateful encounter in his book, \"Homo Delphinus: The Dolphin Within Man\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ota|first1=Tomoo|title=Nanatsugama caves were origin of a diving legend|publisher=The Japan News by The Yomiuri Shimbun|date=November 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAt 49, he was the first free diver to descend to 100 meters (330 ft) on November 23, 1976; and when he was 56, he managed to descend to 105 meters. During the scientific research phase of his career, Mayol tried to answer the question of whether man had a hidden aquatic potential that could be evoked by rigorous physiological and psychological training.\n\nMayol\u2019s lifelong passion for diving was based on his love for the ocean, his personal philosophy and his desire to explore his own limits. During his lifetime, he helped introduce the then elitist sport of free-diving into the mainstream. His diving philosophy was to reach a state of mind based on relaxation and [[Yoga]], with which he could accomplish [[apnea]].<ref name=\"apnea\">http://www.apnea.nl/UK-Index.htm</ref> He also contributed to technological advances in the field of free-diving, particularly improving assemblies used by [[free diving|no-limits]] divers. He was also instrumental in the development of [[scuba diving]]'s [[Diving regulator#Secondary demand valve .28Octopus.29|octopus regulator]], which was invented by Dave Woodward at UNEXSO around 1965-6.

Mayol\u2019s last deep dive followed in 1983 when he reached the depth of 105m, at the age of 56.<ref name=\"thejacquesmayol\"/>\n\n== Dolphins ==\nMayol\u2019s fascination with [[dolphin]]s started in 1955 when he was working as a commercial diver at an aquarium in [[Miami, Florida]].<ref name=\"thejacquesmayol\"/> There he met a female dolphin called Clown and formed a close bond with her. Imitating Clown, he learned how to hold his breath longer and how to behave and integrate himself underwater. It is the dolphins that became the foundation of Mayol\u2019s life philosophy of \"Homo Delphinus\".<ref name=\"apnea\"/>\n\nThroughout his book ''L'Homo Delphinus''<ref name=\"apnea\"/> (2000 published in English as ''Homo Delphinus: The Dolphin within Man'' by Idelson Gnocchi Publishers Ltd.) Mayol expounds his theories about man\u2019s relationship with the sea where he explores the questions of whether man really has an [[Aquatic ape hypothesis|aquatic]] origin. And how man could re-awaken his dormant mental and spiritual faculties and the physiological mechanisms from the depths of his psyche and genetic make-up to develop the potential of his aquatic origins, to become a ''Homo delphinus''.\n\nJacques Mayol predicted that, within a couple of generations, some people would be able to dive to 200 m and hold their breath for up to ten minutes. Today the no-limits record stands at 253 m ([[Herbert Nitsch]], June 2012). Serbian Branko Petrovi\u0107 holds the record for [[Static Apnea]] at 11 minutes and 54 seconds (October 2014).<ref>https://www.deeperblue.com/new-guinness-world-record-serbian-freediver-branko-petrovic/</ref> Croatian [[Goran \u010colak]] holds the record for static apnea on pure oxygen at 23 minutes 1 second (June 2014).<ref>http://www.croatiaweek.com/goran-colak-sets-new-guinness-record-after-23-minutes-underwater/</ref>\n\n==Film==\nThe film ''[[The Big Blue]]'', directed by [[Luc Besson]] in 1988, was inspired by his life story and the life story of the Italian diver [[Enzo Maiorca]] and their friendship. Mayol was one of the [[screenwriter]]s.\n\n==Death==\nOn 22 December 2001 at the age of 74, suffering depression, Mayol committed suicide by hanging himself at his villa in [[Elba]], [[Italy]]<ref name=\"BBC\"/>. His ashes were spread over the [[Tuscany]] coast.<ref name=BBC/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal bar|Underwater diving}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.thejacquesmayol.com/MayolBiography.htm Biography from thejacquesmayol.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131206130900/http://www.aida-international.org/aspportal1/code/page.asp?sType=wr&CountryID=4&actID=3&ObjectID=136 Current Freediving World Records]\n* [http://www.manualoffreediving.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050211074322/http://www.hds.org/mayol.html Profile from Historical Diving Association website]\n* [http://www.divernet.com/profs/0302mayol.htm Article from divernet.com]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1726694.stm Obituary from BBC]\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-mayol-729650.html Obituary from ''The Independent''] (2013-04-14 Gone, {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232027/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jacques-mayol-729650.html |date=September 26, 2011 |title=copy }})\n* {{fr icon}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/article/0,5987,3230--255975-,00.html Article by Le Monde]\n\n{{Underwater divers}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mayol, Jacques}}\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:French freedivers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople who committed suicide]]\n[[Category:Suicides by hanging in Italy]]", "sha1": "hl4mhmvec3ygzc4oiu5dj28dg2lkm8n"}}, {"title": "Josef Terboven", "ns": "0", "id": "15747", "revision": {"id": "863545851", "parentid": "860310795", "timestamp": "2018-10-11T13:27:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Roisterer", "id": "61920"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Portrayal in popular culture */ ital", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=March 2011}}\n{{Infobox Officeholder\n|name                = Josef Terboven\n|image               = Terboven statsakten.jpg\n|imagesize           = 200px\n|smallimage          =\n|caption             = Terboven in 1942.\n|order               = Gauleiter of Essen\n|term_start          = 1928\n|term_end            = 8 May 1945\n|successor           = Fritz Schlessmann (acting, 1940\u20131945)\n|order2              = ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' for the [[Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Occupied Norwegian Territories]]\n|term_start2         = 24 April 1940\n|term_end2           = 7 May 1945\n|primeminister2      = [[Vidkun Quisling]] (1942\u20131945)\n|predecessor2        = None\n|successor2          = [[Franz B\u00f6hme]] (acting, 1945)\n|order3                 =  [[Oberpr\u00e4sident]] of [[Rhine Province]]\n|term_start3         = 1940\n|term_end3           = 8 May 1945\n|predecessor3        = Hermann Freiherr von L\u00fcnick\n|successor3          = None\n|birth_date          = 23 May 1898\n|birth_place         = [[Essen]], [[Rhine Province]], [[German Empire|Germany]]\n|death_date          = 8 May 1945 (aged 46)\n|death_place         = [[Asker]], [[Akershus]], [[Norway]]\n|constituency        =\n|party               = [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP)\n|spouse              =\n|children            =\n|profession          =\n|religion            =\n|signature           =\n|footnotes           =\n}}\n\n'''Josef Antonius Heinrich Terboven''' (23 May 1898 \u2013 8 May 1945) was a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] leader, best known as the [[Reichskommissar]] for [[Norway]] during the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation of Norway]] and the [[Quisling regime]].\n\n==Early life==\nTerboven (from the Dutch ''ter Boven'') was born in [[Essen]], Germany, as the son of minor [[landed gentry]] of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] descent. He served in the German [[artillery|field artillery]] and nascent [[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte|air force]] in [[World War I]] and was awarded the [[Iron Cross]], rising to the rank of lieutenant. He studied law and political science at the universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], where he first got involved in politics.\n\n==Nazi Party career==\nDropping out of the university in 1923, Terboven joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] with member number 25247 and participated in the abortive [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in Munich. When the NSDAP was subsequently outlawed, he found work at a bank for a few years before he was laid off in 1925.\n\nHe then went to work full-time for the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party. Terboven helped establish the party in Essen and became [[Gauleiter]] [[Gau Essen|there in 1928]].  From 1925 on he was part of the [[Sturmabteilung]], in which he reached the rank of ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' by 1936.  On 29 June 1934, Terboven married Ilse Stahl, [[Joseph Goebbels]]' former secretary and mistress. [[Adolf Hitler]] was the guest of honour at the wedding. Terboven was made ''[[Oberpr\u00e4sident]] der [[Rheinprovinz]]'' in 1935 and developed a reputation as a petty and ruthless tyrant.\n\n==Rule of Norway==\n{{Main|Reichskommissariat Norwegen}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Moebius-029-12, Norwegen, Besuch Himmler, Terboven und Quisling.jpg|thumb|left|Terboven (seated 2nd from right) with [[Vidkun Quisling|Quisling]], [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst|Falkenhorst]].]]\nTerboven was made [[Reichskommissar]] for [[Norway]] on 24 April 1940, even before the [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|military invasion]] was completed on 7 June 1940. He moved into the Norwegian crown prince's residence at [[Skaugum]] in September 1940 and made his headquarters in [[Stortinget]] (the Norwegian parliament buildings). Ilse and their daughter Inge did not accompany him to Norway, remaining in Germany<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?t=191286|title=Ilse Stahl - Axis History Forum|website=forum.axishistory.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-20}}</ref>.\n\nTerboven only had supervisory authority over the civilian administration in Norway. The German civilian administration did not rule Norway directly, however, and remained relatively small. Daily affairs were managed by the existing Norwegian state administration, headed by an acting cabinet and then by the Quisling cabinet. Terboven did not have authority over the 400,000 regular [[Wehrmacht|German Army forces]] stationed in Norway which were the command of General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]], but he did command a personal force of around 6,000 men, of whom 800 were part of the secret police.\n\nIn contrast to the military forces commanded by Falkenhorst, which aimed to reach an understanding with the Norwegian people and was under orders by Falkenhorst to treat Norwegians with courtesy, Terboven behaved in the same petty and ruthless way he did as governor of the Rheinprovinz, and was widely disliked, not only by the Norwegians, but also by many Germans. From 1941, he increasingly focused on crushing the [[Irregular warfare|irregular]] military resistance against the Germans, declaring [[martial law in Trondheim in 1942]], and ordering the destruction of [[Telav\u00e5g]]. [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] expressed annoyance in [[Goebbels Diaries|his diary]] about what he called Terboven's \"bullying tactics\" against the Norwegians, as they alienated the population against the Germans. Terboven nevertheless remained in ultimate charge of Norway until the end of the war in 1945, even after the proclamation of a Norwegian [[puppet regime]] under [[Vidkun Quisling]], the [[Quisling government]]. On 18 December 1944, Falkenhorst was dismissed from his command for opposing certain radical policies of Terboven.\n\nAs the tide of the war turned against Germany, Terboven's personal aspiration was to organise a \"Fortress Norway\" ([[Festung Norwegen]]) for the Nazi regime's last stand. Hitler's successor, [[Karl D\u00f6nitz|Admiral D\u00f6nitz]], dismissed Terboven from his post as Reichskommissar on 7 May, transferring his powers to General B\u00f6hme.\n\n===Impact of his rule on prison camps===\nTerboven also planned [[concentration camp]]s in Norway, establishing [[Falstad concentration camp]] near [[Levanger]] and [[Bredtvet concentration camp]] in [[Oslo]] in late 1941.\n\nOn 18 July 1942 the [[Beisfjord massacre]] occurred. Terboven ordered the massacre a few days earlier.\n\nIn July 1942 at least one German guard employed by the [[Korgen]] prison camp was killed. The commandant ordered retribution: execution by gunfire for \"39 prisoners at Korgen and 20 at [[Vefsn|Osen]]\"; in the days that followed, Terboven also ordered retribution: around 400 prisoners shot and killed in various camps.<ref>{{Cite web | date=26 October 2016 | title=Da nordmenn myrdet fanger i Korgen &#124; Tekster og slikt |trans-title=| language= | url=https://finnbakk.wordpress.com/2016/10/26/myrdetkrigsfanger/ | website=Finnbakk.Wordpress.com | access-date=25 September 2017 | quote=\"Da to fanger i Korgen drepte en tysk vokter og r\u00f8mte, ga kommandant Hesse ordre om at det som hevn skulle skytes 39 fanger i Korgen og 20 i Osen.

He died alongside the body of ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Rediess]], [[SS and Police Leader]] and commander of all [[SS]] troops in Norway, who had shot himself earlier. His family survived him in West Germany, and Ilse died in 1972<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==Portrayal in popular culture==\nIn the 1965 film ''[[The Heroes of Telemark]]'', Josef Terboven was played by English actor [[Eric Porter]].\n\nHe is portrayed in the 1996 film ''[[Hamsun (film)|Hamsun]]'' by [[Edgar Selge]].\n\n==Sources and references==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Josef Terboven}}\n*

The Flames' dynamic gospel-tinged vocals, polished choreography and timing as well as Brown's energetic dance moves and high-octane singing upstaged the proposed closing act, [[the Rolling Stones]].

By this time Brown's vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] or [[melody]]. This would become a major influence on the techniques of [[rapping]], which would come to maturity along with [[hip hop music]] in the coming decades. Brown's style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: strutting bass lines, syncopated drum patterns, and iconic percusive guitar riffs.<ref>Slutsky, Allan, Chuck Silverman (1997). ''The Funkmasters-the Great James Brown Rhythm Sections''. {{ISBN|1576234436}}.</ref> The main guitar ostinatos for \"[[Ain't It Funky]]\" and \"[[Give It Up or Turn It Loose]]\" (both 1969), are examples of Brown's refinement of [[New Orleans]] funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence. On both recordings the tonal structure is bare bones. The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches. It's as if the guitar is an African drum, or idiophone. Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from \"New Orleans\u2014through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s.\"<ref>Stewart, Alexander (2000: 306). \"Funky Drummer: New Orleans, James Brown and the Rhythmic Transformation of American Popular Music\". ''Popular Music'', v. 19, n. 3. October 2000, pp. 293\u2013318.</ref> Those same tracks were later resurrected by countless hip-hop musicians from the 1970s onward. As a result, James Brown remains to this day the world's most [[sampling (music)|sampled]] recording artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/artist/James%20Brown/ |title=James Brown's Sample-Based Music and Cover Songs |publisher=WhoSampled |accessdate=September 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\n\"Bring it Up\" has an Afro-Cuban [[guajeo]]-like structure. All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure. Stewart states: \"This model, it should be noted, is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.\"<ref>Stewart (2000: 306).</ref>\n\nIt was around this time as the musician's popularity increased that he acquired the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"Soul Brother No. 1\", after failing to win the title \"King of Soul\" from [[Solomon Burke]] during a Chicago gig two years prior.<ref name=\"a1984\">Peter Guralnick, \"Song of Solomon\", ''The Boston Phoenix'' (March 6, 1984), Section 3:3.</ref> Brown's recordings during this period influenced musicians across the industry, most notably groups such as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Funkadelic]], [[Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band]], [[Booker T. & the M.G.s]] as well as vocalists such as [[Edwin Starr]], [[David Ruffin]] and [[Dennis Edwards]] from [[The Temptations]], and [[Michael Jackson]], who, throughout his career, cited Brown as his ultimate idol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/jackson-attends-browns-public-funeral_1017673 |title=James Brown \u2013 Jackson Attends Brown's Public Funeral | accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBrown's band during this period employed musicians and arrangers who had come up through the jazz tradition. He was noted for his ability as a [[bandleader]] and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of [[jazz]]. Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist [[Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis]] (the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones) led the band. Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]] provided percussive, deceptively simple [[riff]]s for each song, and [[Maceo Parker]]'s prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances. Other members of Brown's band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], drummers [[John \"Jabo\" Starks]], [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[Melvin Parker]], saxophonist [[St. Clair Pinckney]], guitarist Alphonso \"Country\" Kellum and bassist [[Bernard Odum]].\n\nIn addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown's output during this period included two more successful live albums, ''[[Live at the Garden (James Brown album)|Live at the Garden]]'' (1967) and ''[[Live at the Apollo, Volume II]]'' (1968), and a 1968 television special, ''[[James Brown: Man to Man]]''. His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene. As Brown's music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well. Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including [[WCHZ (AM)|WRDW]] in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy.<ref name=pc51>{{Pop Chronicles|51|5}}</ref> In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station WGYW in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 ''[[Record World]]'' magazine. The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials. WJBE began on January 15, 1968, and broadcast a Rhythm & Blues format. The station slogan was \"WJBE 1430 Raw Soul\". Brown also bought [[WQLL|WEBB]] in [[Baltimore]] in 1970.\n[[File:James-Brown 1973.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Brown performing in 1973]]\nBrown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band. In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white [[adult contemporary]] audience, Brown recorded ''Gettin' Down To It'' (1969) and ''[[Soul on Top]]'' (1970)\u2014two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits\u2014with the Dee Felice Trio and the [[Louie Bellson]] Orchestra. In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with [[The Dapps]], a white [[Cincinnati]] band, including the hit \"[[I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)|I Can't Stand Myself]]\". He also released three albums of [[Christmas music]] with his own band.\n\n===1970\u20131975: Godfather of Soul===\n{{main|The J.B.'s}}\nIn March 1970, most of Brown's mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to money disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of The Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968. Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd (who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period) subsequently recruited several members of the Cincinnati-based [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]], which included [[Bootsy Collins]] and his brother [[Catfish Collins|Phelps \"Catfish\" Collins]]; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band (including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown's outfit in December 1970) and other newer musicians, they would form the nucleus of [[The J.B.'s]], Brown's new backing ensemble. Shortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, \"[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]\"; the song and other contemporaneous singles would further cement Brown's influence in the nascent genre of funk music. This iteration of the J.B.'s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release ''[[Love Power Peace]]'') due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins' use of [[LSD]]; the Collins brothers would soon become integral members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], while a new lineup of the J.B.'s coalesced around Wesley, St. Clair Pinckney and drummer John Starks.\n\nIn 1971, Brown began recording for [[Polydor Records]] which also took over distribution of Brown's King Records catalog. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s, Bobby Byrd, [[Lyn Collins]], [[Vicki Anderson]] and former rival [[Hank Ballard]], released records on the [[People Records|People]] label, an imprint founded by Brown that was purchased by Polydor as part of Brown's new contract. The recordings on the People label, almost all of which were produced by Brown himself, exemplified his \"house style\". Songs such as \"[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]\" by Bobby Byrd, \"[[Think (About It)|Think]]\" by Lyn Collins and \"[[Doing It to Death]]\" by Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s are considered as much a part of Brown's recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name. That year, he also began touring African countries and was received well by audiences there. During the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]], James Brown openly proclaimed his support of [[Richard Nixon]] for reelection of the presidency over Democratic candidate [[George McGovern]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/james-brown/soul-survivor/532/ |title=James Brown \u2013 Soul Survivor &#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=October 29, 2003 |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref> The decision led to a boycott of his performances and, according to Brown, cost him a big portion of his black audience.<ref>Brown, James, with Bruce Tucker. James Brown: The Godfather of Soul (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company,1986), 233</ref> As a result, Brown's record sales and concerts in the United States reached a lull in 1973 as he failed to land a number-one R&B single that year. Brown relied more on touring outside the United States where he continued to perform for sold-out crowds in cities such as London, Paris and [[Lausanne, Switzerland|Lausanne]]. That year he also faced problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], charging he hadn't paid upwards of $4.5 million; five years earlier, the IRS had claimed he owed nearly $2 million.<ref name=\"jbencyclopedia\" />\n\nIn 1973, Brown provided the score for the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]''. He also recorded another soundtrack for the film, ''[[Slaughter's Big Rip-Off]]''. Following the release of these soundtracks, Brown acquired a self-styled nickname, \"The Godfather of Soul\", which remains his most popular nickname. In 1974 he returned to the No. 1 spot on the R&B charts with \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\", with the [[The Payback|parent album]] reaching the same spot on the album charts; he would reach No. 1 two more times in 1974, with \"[[My Thang]]\" and \"[[Papa Don't Take No Mess]]\". Later that year, he returned to Africa and performed in [[Kinshasa]] as part of the buildup to [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]]. Admirers of Brown's music, including [[Miles Davis]] and other jazz musicians, began to cite him as a major influence on their own styles. However, Brown, like others who were influenced by his music, also \"borrowed\" from other musicians. His 1976 single, \"[[Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved)|Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)]]\" (R&B #31), interpolated the main [[riff]] from \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\" by [[David Bowie]] while omitting any attribution to the latter song's composers (including Bowie, [[John Lennon]] and guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]]), not the other way around as was often believed. The riff was composed by Alomar, who had briefly been a member of Brown's band in the late 1960s.<ref>[http://www.allmovieguide.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=61:P The Whole Note: Under the Radar in '06]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2006).

Among his top ten R&B hits during this latter period included \"[[Funky President (People It's Bad)|Funky President]]\" and \"[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]\", the latter song released in 1976 and aimed at musical rivals such as [[Barry White]], [[The Ohio Players]] and [[K.C. and the Sunshine Band]]. Brown credited his then-wife and two of their children as writers of the song to avoid concurrent tax problems with the IRS. Starting in October 1975, Brown produced, directed, and hosted ''[[Future Shock (TV series)|Future Shock]]'', an Atlanta-based television variety show that ran for three years.\n\n===1975\u20131991: Decline and resurgence===\n[[File:James Brown (1977).jpg|thumb|James Brown (1977)]]\nAlthough his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground [[disco]] scene exemplified by DJs such as [[David Mancuso]] and [[Francis Grasso]] from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975's ''[[Sex Machine Today]]''. By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&B. After \"Get Up Offa That Thing\", thirteen of Brown's late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&B chart, with only \"[[Bodyheat]]\" in 1976 and the disco-oriented \"[[It's Too Funky in Here]]\" in 1979 reaching the R&B Top 15 and the ballad \"[[Kiss in '77]]\" reaching the Top 20. After 1976's \"Bodyheat\", he also failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100. As a result, Brown's concert attendance began dropping and his reported disputes with the IRS caused his business empire to collapse. In addition, Brown's former bandmates, including Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and the Collins brothers, had found bigger success as members of [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective. The emergence of disco also stopped Brown's success on the R&B charts because its slicker, more commercial style had superseded his more raw funk productions.\n\nBy the release of 1979's ''The Original Disco Man'', Brown was not providing much production or writing, leaving most of it to producer [[Brad Shapiro]], resulting in the song \"It's Too Funky in Here\" becoming Brown's most successful single in this period. After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981. It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J.B.'s to the Soul Generals (or Soul G's). The band retained that name until his death. Despite the decline in his record sales Brown enjoyed something of a resurgence in this period, starting with appearances in the feature films ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' and ''[[Rocky IV]]'', as well as guest-starring in the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"Missing Hours\" (1987). In 1984, he teamed with rap musician [[Afrika Bambaattaa]] on the song \"[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]\". A year later he signed with [[Scotti Brothers Records]] and issued the moderately successful album ''[[Gravity (James Brown album)|Gravity]]'' in 1986. It included Brown's final Top 10 pop hit, \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top 10 pop entry since 1968. Produced and written by [[Dan Hartman]], it was also featured prominently on the ''[[Rocky IV]]'' film and soundtrack. Brown performed the song in the film at Apollo Creed's final fight, shot in the Ziegfeld Room at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and was credited in the film as \"The Godfather of Soul\". 1986 also saw the publication of his autobiography, ''James Brown: The Godfather of Soul'', co-written with Bruce Tucker. In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance for \"Living in America\".\n\nIn 1988, Brown worked with the production team [[Full Force]] on the [[new jack swing]]-influenced album ''[[I'm Real (James Brown album)|I'm Real]]''. It spawned his final two Top 10 R&B hits, \"[[I'm Real (James Brown song)|I'm Real]]\" and \"[[Static (song)|Static]]\", which peaked at No. 2 and No. 5, respectively, on the R&B charts. Meanwhile, the [[Break (music)#Break beat (element of music)|drum break]] from the second version of the original 1969 hit \"Give It Up Or Turnit A Loose\" (the recording included on the compilation album ''[[In the Jungle Groove]]'') became so popular at hip hop dance parties (especially for [[break dancing|breakdance]]) during the early 1980s that hip hop founding father [[Kurtis Blow]] called the song \"the national anthem of hip hop\".<ref>[http://www.rhino.com/Features/liners/72851lin.html Liner notes \u2013 \"Kurtis Blow presents: The History of Rap, Volume I\"].

It included the single \"[[(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On]]\", which peaked at No. 48 on the R&B chart. His former record label Polydor also released the four-CD box set ''[[Star Time]]'', spanning Brown's career to date. Brown's release from prison also prompted his former record labels to [[reissue]] his albums on CD, featuring additional tracks and commentary by music critics and historians. That same year, Brown appeared on rapper [[MC Hammer]]'s video for \"[[Too Legit to Quit (song)|Too Legit to Quit]]\". Hammer had been noted, alongside [[Big Daddy Kane]], for bringing Brown's unique stage shows and their own energetic dance moves to the hip-hop generation; both listed Brown as their idol. Both musicians also sampled his work, with Hammer having sampled the rhythms from \"[[Super Bad (song)|Super Bad]]\" for his song \"Here Comes the Hammer\", from his best-selling album ''[[Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em]]''. Big Daddy Kane sampled many times. Before the year was over, Brown\u2013who had immediately returned to work with his band following his release\u2013organized a pay-per-view concert following a show at Los Angeles' [[Wiltern Theatre]], that was well received.\n[[File:James Brown 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown during the [[NBA All-Star Game]] jam session, 2001]]\n\nOn June 10, 1991, James Brown and a star-filled line up performed before a crowd at the Wiltern Theatre for a live pay-per-view at-home audience. ''James Brown: Living in America \u2013 Live!'' was the brainchild of Indiana producer Danny Hubbard. It featured\n[[M.C. Hammer]] as well as [[Bell Biv Devoe]], [[Heavy D|Heavy D & the Boys]], [[En Vogue]], [[C+C Music Factory]], [[Quincy Jones]], [[Sherman Hemsley]] and [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. [[Ice-T]], [[Tone Loc]] and [[Kool Moe Dee]] performed paying homage to Brown. This was Brown's first public performance since his parole from the South Carolina prison system in February. He had served two-and-a-half years of two concurrent six-year sentences for aggravated assault and other felonies.\n\nBrown continued making recordings. In 1993 his album ''Universal James'' was released. It included his final ''Billboard'' charting single, \"[[Can't Get Any Harder]]\", which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of \"I Feel Good\" featuring [[Dakeyne]]. Brown also released the singles \"How Long\" and \"Georgia-Lina\", which failed to chart. In 1995, Brown returned to the [[Apollo Theater|Apollo]] and recorded ''[[Live at the Apollo 1995]]''. It included a studio track titled \"Respect Me\", which was released as a single; again it failed to chart. Brown's final studio albums, ''I'm Back'' and ''[[The Next Step (James Brown album)|The Next Step]]'', were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. ''I'm Back'' featured the song \"[[Funk on Ah Roll]]\", which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. ''The Next Step'' included Brown's final single, \"[[Killing Is Out, School Is In]]\". Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown's concert success, however, remained unabated and he kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, \"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the [[PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' television documentary ''James Brown: Soul Survivor'', which was directed by [[Jeremy Marre]].\n\nBrown celebrated his status as an icon by appearing in a variety of entertainment and sports events, including an appearance on the [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] pay-per-view event, [[SuperBrawl X]], where he danced alongside wrestler [[Ernest Miller|Ernest \"The Cat\" Miller]], who based his character on Brown, during his in-ring skit with [[Robert Kellum|The Maestro]]. Brown then appeared in [[Tony Scott]]'s short film ''[[The Hire: Beat the Devil|Beat the Devil]]'' in 2001. He was featured alongside [[Clive Owen]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Danny Trejo]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]. Brown also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the 2002 [[Jackie Chan]] film ''[[The Tuxedo]]'', in which Chan was required to finish Brown's act after having accidentally knocked out the singer. In 2002, Brown appeared in ''[[Undercover Brother]]'', playing himself.\n\nIn 2004, Brown performed in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London as a support act for [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] concerts.<ref name=\"Fornication\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd1Mfte7wuEC&lpg=PT507&ots=v_RcdmSdrl&dq=red%20hot%20chili%20peppers%20james%20brown%20hyde%20park&pg=PT507#v=onepage&q=red%20hot%20chili%20peppers%20james%20brown%20hyde%20park&f=false | title=Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story | publisher=Omnibus Press | author=Apter, Jeff | year=2004 | location=London | isbn=9781844493814}}</ref> The beginning of 2005 saw the publication of Brown's second book, ''I Feel Good: A Memoir of a Life of Soul'', written with Marc Eliot.

Though he lost interest in the album, which remains unreleased, a track from the sessions, \"[[Gut Bucket (James Brown song)|Gut Bucket]]\", appeared on a compilation CD included with the August 2006 issue of ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charles-thomson.net/worldfunk.html |title=Portfolio \u2013 Features |publisher=Charles Thomson |date= |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105032344/http://www.charles-thomson.net/worldfunk.html |archivedate=November 5, 2013 |df= }}</ref> He appeared at [[Edinburgh 50,000 \u2013 The Final Push]], the final [[Live 8]] concert on July 6, 2005, where he performed a duet with British pop star [[Will Young]] on \"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\". The previous week he had performed a duet with another British pop star, [[Joss Stone]], on the United Kingdom chat show ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]''. In 2006, Brown continued his \"Seven Decades of Funk World Tour\", his last concert tour where he performed all over the world. His final U.S. performances were in San Francisco on August 20, 2006, as headliner at the Festival of the Golden Gate (Foggfest) on the Great Meadow at Fort Mason. The following day, August 21, he performed at [[Humboldt State University]] in Arcata, CA, at a small theatre (800 seats) on campus. His last shows were greeted with positive reviews, and one of his final concert appearances at the Irish [[Oxegen#2006 Festival|Oxegen festival in Punchestown in 2006]] was performed for a record crowd of 80,000 people. He played a full concert as part of the BBC's Electric Proms on October 27, 2006, at The Roundhouse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2006/jamesbrown/ |title=Electric Proms \u2013 James Brown The Godfather of Soul |publisher=BBC |date=October 27, 2006 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref> supported by The Zutons, with special appearances from Max Beasley and The Sugababes.\n\nBrown's last televised appearance was at his induction into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in November 2006, before his death the following month.

His own stated goal was to \"give people more than what they came for&nbsp;\u2014 make them tired, 'cause ''that's'' what they came for.'\"<ref>Guralnick, 231.</ref> Brown's concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&B [[Cover version|covers]] mixed in. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato (dance)|Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and singing group (The Famous Flames) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear [[Tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedoes]] and [[cummerbund]]s long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate [[Conk|processed hairdo]] completed the visual impression. A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or [[Marva Whitney]], and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show.\n\n===Cape routine===\nA trademark feature of Brown's stage shows, usually during the song \"Please, Please, Please\", involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show's longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown's shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] during his performance.

Although audiences thought Brown's dance routine was part of his act, this practice was actually his way of pointing to the offending member of his troupe who played or sang the wrong note or committed some other infraction. Brown used his splayed fingers and hand signals to alert the offending person of the fine that person must pay to him for breaking his rules.<ref>Gottschild, B.D.

As [[Fred Wesley]] recalled of his time as musical director of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to \"undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs. A sure set killer.\"<ref>Fred Wesley's sleevenotes to Honey & the Bees \"Dynamite!\" (Jamie4009) 1999.</ref>\n\n==Social activism==\n\n===Education advocacy and humanitarianism===\nBrown's main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his forced dropping out of the seventh grade for wearing \"insufficient clothes\". Due to heavy [[dropping out|dropout]] rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, \"[[Don't Be a Drop-Out]]\". Royalties of the song were donated to charity used for dropout prevention programs. The success of this led to Brown meeting with President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] at the [[White House]]. Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth. A lifelong Republican, who gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans.<ref name=\"YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto\">{{YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto}}</ref> He was also harassed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and the IRS, probably because Hoover thought it \"dangerous\" that a young \"Black radical\" had the ear of the president.<ref name=\"YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto\"/>\n\nThroughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school. Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the I Feel Good, Inc. Trust to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren. His final single, \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\", advocated against murders of young children in the streets. Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta. A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years.\n\n===Civil rights and self-reliance===\nThough Brown performed at benefit rallies for [[civil rights]] organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs. In 1968, in response to a growing urge of [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War]], Brown recorded the song, \"[[America Is My Home]]\". In the song, Brown performed a [[rapping|rap]], advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to \"stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight.\" At the time of the song's release, Brown had been participating in performing for troops stationed in Vietnam.\n\n====The Boston Garden concert====\nOn April 5, 1968, a day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free citywide televised concert at the [[Boston Garden]] to maintain public order and calm concerned Boston relatives (over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence).<ref name=pc51/> The show was later released on DVD as ''[[Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968]]''. According to the documentary, ''The Night James Brown Saved Boston'', then-mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]] had strongly restrained the Boston police from cracking down on minor violence and protests after the assassination, while religious and community leaders worked to keep tempers from flaring.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/vh1_rock_docs/134183/episode_about.jhtml \"The Night James Brown Saved Boston\"].

Brown received $15,000 from them via the city. White also persuaded management at the Garden to give up their share of receipts to make up the differences.<ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/> Following this successful performance, Brown was cautioned by President Johnson to visit cities ravaged from riots following King's assassination to not resort to violence, telling them to \"cool it, there's another way\".{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=54}}\n\nResponding to pressure from black activists, including [[H. Rap Brown]], to take a bigger stance on their issues and from footage of [[black on black crime]] committed in [[inner city|inner cities]], Brown wrote the lyrics to the song \"[[Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud]]\", which his bandleader [[Alfred \"Pee Wee\" Ellis]] accompanied with a musical composition. Released late that summer, the song's lyrics helped to make it an anthem for the civil rights movement. Brown only performed the song sporadically following its initial release and later stated he had regrets recording it, saying in 1984, \"Now 'Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud' has done more for the black race than any other record, but if I had my choice, I wouldn't have done it, because I don't like defining anyone by race. To teach race is to teach separatism.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=95}} In his autobiography he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe song is obsolete now... But it was necessary to teach pride then, and I think the song did a lot of good for a lot of people... People called \"Black and Proud\" militant and angry \u2013 maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees. But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children's song. That's why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride... The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience. The racial makeup at my concerts was mostly black after that. I don't regret it, though, even if it was misunderstood.<ref>Brown, James, with Bruce Tucker. ''James Brown: The Godfather of Soul'' (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company,1986), 200.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1969, Brown recorded two more songs of social commentary, \"[[World (James Brown song)|World]]\" and \"[[I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing]]\", the latter song pleading for equal opportunity and self-reliance rather than entitlement. In 1970, in response to some black leaders for not being outspoken enough, he recorded \"[[Get Up, Get into It, Get Involved]]\" and \"[[Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing]]\". In 1971, he began touring Africa, including Zambia and Nigeria. He was made \"freeman of the city\" in [[Lagos, Nigeria]], by Oba Adeyinka Oyekan, for his \"influence on black people all over the world.\"<ref>{{\ncite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e7EDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59&dq=James+Brown+in+Nigeria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMIub7J6-6nxwIVlD3bCh3CJwz1#v=onepage&q=James%20Brown%20in%20Nigeria&f=false|pages=57\u201360|title = Jet|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company|date=December 30, 1971}}</ref>{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=59}} With his company, James Brown Enterprises, Brown helped to provide jobs for blacks in business in the communities.{{sfn|Jet|1971|pp=60}} As the 1970s continued, Brown continued to record songs of social commentary, most prominently 1972's \"[[King Heroin]]\" and the two-part ballad \"Public Enemy\", which dealt with [[drug addiction]].\n\n===Political views===\nDuring the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 presidential campaign]], Brown endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Hubert Humphrey]] and appeared with Humphrey at political rallies.

Between 1982 and 1984 Postel co-authored the RFCs which became the foundation of today's [[DNS]] (RFC 819, RFC 881, RFC 882 and RFC 920) which were joined in 1995 by RFC 1591 which he also co-wrote.\nIn total, he wrote or co-authored more than 200 RFCs.\n\nPostel served on the [[Internet Architecture Board]] and its predecessors for many years. He was the Director of the names and number assignment clearinghouse, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), from its inception. He was the first member of the [[Internet Society]], and was on its Board of Trustees. He was the original and long-time [[.us]] [[Top-Level Domain]] administrator.

During the other part of the [[year]], except Easter, it is usually quite difficult to find in stores, but sometimes it is sold at other times of the year under the name ''must''. During [[Easter]] the name is '''''{{lang|sv|p\u00e5skmust}}''''' (from ''{{lang|sv|p\u00e5sk}}'', \"Easter\"). The content is the same regardless of the marketing name, although the length of time it is stored before bottling differs; however, the beverage is more closely associated with Christmas, somewhat less with Easter and traditionally not at all with the summer. 45 million litres of ''julmust'' are consumed during December, which is around 50% of the total soft drink volume in December and 75% of the total yearly must sales.<ref name=\"ab-colamust\"/>\n\nMust was created by [[Harry Roberts (inventor)|Harry Roberts]] and his father [[Robert Roberts (soft drink maker)|Robert Roberts]] in 1910 as a non-alcoholic alternative to [[beer]]. The syrup is still made exclusively by [[Roberts AB]] in [[\u00d6rebro]]. The syrup is sold to different soft drink manufacturers that then make the final product in their own way. This means that the must from two different companies doesn't taste the same, even though they are made of the same syrup.\n\nMust is made of [[carbonated water]], [[sugar]], [[hops|hop]] extract, malt extract, spices, [[caramel color|caramel colouring]], [[citric acid]], and [[preservative]]s. The hops and malt extracts give the must a somewhat [[root beer]]-like taste without the sassafras. It can be aged provided it is stored in a glass bottle.

His collaboration with the publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]] led to the creation of the ''[[Voyages extraordinaires]]'', a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1864), ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870), and ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' (1873).<!--please don't add additional titles to this list; there are MANY Verne titles we could mention, but for the lead paragraph we have to keep things relatively simple-->\n\nVerne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary [[avant-garde]] and on [[surrealism]].{{sfn|Angenot|1973|p=34}} His reputation is markedly different in [[English-speaking world|Anglophone regions]], where he has often been labeled a writer of [[genre fiction]] or [[children's books]], largely because of the highly abridged and altered [[Jules Verne#English translations|translations]] in which his novels are often reprinted.{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=33}}\n\nVerne has been the [[list of most-translated individual authors|second most-translated author in the world]] since 1979, ranking between [[Agatha Christie]] and [[William Shakespeare]].{{sfn|UNESCO |2013}}<!--Butcher 1983 calls Verne \"probably \u2026 the most translated writer in the world over the last two decades\" (presumably 1960s and 1970s), but it's unclear whether the parameters are the same as UNESCO's, so probably best just to cite UNESCO--> He has sometimes been called the \"Father of Science Fiction\", a title that has also been given to [[H.

Three sisters, Anna (1836), Mathilde (1839), and Marie (1842) would follow.{{sfn|Butcher|2007}}\n\nIn 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes.  The teacher, Mme Sambin, was the widow of a naval captain who had disappeared some 30 years before.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=3}} Mme Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like [[Robinson Crusoe]] from his desert island paradise.{{sfn|Allotte de la Fu\u00ffe|1956|p=20}} The theme of the [[Robinsonade]] would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, including ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1874), ''[[Second Fatherland]]'' (1900), and ''[[The School for Robinsons]]'' (1882).\n\nIn 1836, Verne went on to \u00c9cole Saint\u2011Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father. Verne quickly distinguished himself in ''m\u00e9moire'' (recitation from memory), geography, Greek, Latin, and singing.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=9}} In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a [[vacation house]] at 29 Rue des R\u00e9form\u00e9s in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the [[Loire River]].{{sfn|Terres d'\u00e9crivains|2003}} In his brief memoir \"Souvenirs d'enfance et de jeunesse\" (\"Memories of Childhood and Youth\", 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many [[merchant vessel]]s navigating it.{{sfn|Verne|1890|loc=\u00a72}} He also took vacations at [[Brains, Loire-Atlantique|Brains]], in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837. Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the [[Game of the Goose]] with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (''[[The Will of an Eccentric]]'' (1900) and ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' (1886), respectively).{{sfn|Verne|1890|loc=\u00a72}}{{sfn|Comp\u00e8re|1997b|p=35}}\n\nLegend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as [[cabin boy]] on the three-mast ship ''Coralie'' with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline. The evening the ship set out for the Indies, it stopped first at [[Paimboeuf]] where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel \"only in his imagination\".{{sfn|Allotte de la Fu\u00ffe|1956|p=26}} It is now known that the legend is an exaggerated tale invented by Verne's first biographer, his niece Marguerite Allotte de la F\u00fcye, though it may have been inspired by a real incident.{{sfn|P\u00e9rez|de Vries|Margot|2008|loc=[http://jv.gilead.org.il/FAQ/#C9 C9]}}\n[[File:Nantes - lyc\u00e9e Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|The Lyc\u00e9e Royal in Nantes (now the Lyc\u00e9e Georges-Clemenceau), where Jules Verne studied]]\nIn 1840, the Vernes moved again to a large apartment at No. 6 Rue Jean-Jacques-Rousseau, where the family's youngest child, Marie, was born in 1842.{{sfn |Terres d'\u00e9crivains|2003}} In the same year Verne entered another religious school, the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Saint-Donatien, as a lay student. His unfinished novel ''Un pr\u00eatre en 1839'' (''A Priest in 1839''), written in his teens and the earliest of his prose works to survive,{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=17}} describes the seminary in disparaging terms.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=9}} From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lyc\u00e9e Royal (now the Lyc\u00e9e Georges-Clemenceau) in Nantes. After finishing classes in rhetoric and philosophy, he took the [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] at [[Rennes]] and received the grade \"Fairly good\" on 29 July 1846.{{sfn|Comp\u00e8re|1997a|p=20}}\n\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of [[Victor Hugo]], beginning ''Un pr\u00eatre en 1839'' and seeing two verse tragedies, ''Alexandre VI'' and ''La Conspiration des poudres'' (''The Gunpowder Plot''), to completion.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=17}} However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=19}}\n\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in [[law school]], and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=10}}{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=14}} His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to \u00c9mile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.{{sfn|Martin|1973}}\n\nAfter a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year (provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams).{{sfn|Comp\u00e8re|1997c|p=41}} While in Nantes, he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grosseti\u00e8re, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her. He wrote and dedicated some 30 poems to her, including \"La Fille de l'air\" (\"The Daughter of Air\"), which describes her as \"blonde and enchanting / winged and transparent\".{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=14\u201315}} His passion seems to have been reciprocated, at least for a short time,{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=14}} but Grosseti\u00e8re's parents frowned upon the idea of their daughter marrying a young student of uncertain future. They married her instead to Armand Terrien de la Haye, a rich landowner 10 years her senior, on 19 July 1848.{{sfn|Martin|1974}}\n\nThe sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration. He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=24}} This requited but aborted love affair seems to have permanently marked the author and his work, and his novels include a significant number of young women married against their will (G\u00e9rande in \"[[Master Zacharius]]\" (1854), Sava in ''[[Mathias Sandorf]]'' (1885), Ellen in ''[[A Floating City]]'' (1871), etc.), to such an extent that the scholar Christian Chelebourg attributed the recurring theme to a \"Herminie complex\".{{sfn|Chelebourg|1986}} The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem \"La sixi\u00e8me ville de France\" (\"The Sixth City of France\").{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=16}}{{sfn|Verne|2000}}\n\n===Studies in Paris===\nIn July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession. He obtained permission from his father to rent a furnished apartment at 24 Rue de l'Ancienne-Com\u00e9die, which he shared with \u00c9douard Bonamy, another student of Nantes origin.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=24}} (On his 1847 Paris visit, Verne had stayed at 2 Rue Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the house of his aunt Charuel, on the Butte Saint-Roch.){{sfn|Comp\u00e8re|1997c|p=42}}\n\nVerne arrived in Paris during a time of political upheaval: the [[French Revolution of 1848]]. In February, [[Louis Philippe I]] had been overthrown and had fled; on 24 February, a provisional government of the [[French Second Republic]] took power, but political demonstrations continued, and social tension remained. In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent [[Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Cavaignac]] to crush the insurrection. Verne entered the city shortly before the election of [[Napol\u00e9on III|Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte]] as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the [[French coup of 1851]] . In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent [[June Days uprising]] but assured them that the anniversary of [[Bastille Day]] had gone by without any significant conflict.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=12}}\n\n[[File:Aristide Hignard 1880.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Aristide Hignard]]\n\nVerne used his family connections to make an entrance into Paris society. His uncle Francisque de Chat\u00eaaubourg introduced him into [[literary salon]]s, and Verne particularly frequented those of Mme de Barr\u00e8re, a friend of his mother's.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=17}} While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theatre, writing numerous plays. Verne later recalled: \"I was greatly under the influence of [[Victor Hugo]], indeed, very excited by reading and re-reading his works. At that time I could have recited by heart whole pages of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame|Notre Dame de Paris]]'', but it was his dramatic work that most influenced me.\"{{sfn|Sherard|1894|loc=\u00a73}} Another source of creative stimulation came from a neighbor: living on the same floor in the Rue de l'Ancienne-Com\u00e9die apartment house was a young composer, [[Aristide Hignard]], with whom Verne soon became good friends, and Verne wrote several texts for Hignard to set as [[chanson]]s.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=32}}\n\nDuring this period, Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent [[abdominal pain|stomach cramps]],{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=25}} the first of many he would suffer from during his life. (Modern scholars have hypothesized that he suffered from [[colitis]];{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=25}} Verne believed the illness to have been inherited from his mother's side.){{sfn|Dumas|1988|p=372|ps=: \"Je suis bien Allotte sous le rapport de l'estomac.\"}} Rumors of an outbreak of [[cholera]] in March 1849 exacerbated these medical concerns.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=25}} Yet another health problem would strike in 1851, when Verne suffered the first of four attacks of [[facial paralysis]]. These attacks, rather than being [[psychosomatic]], were due to an inflammation in the [[middle ear]], though this cause remained unknown to Verne during his life.\n{{sfn|Dumas|2000|p=51|ps=: \"La paralysie faciale de Jules Verne n'est pas psychosomatique, mais due seulement \u00e0 une inflammation de l'oreille moyenne dont l'\u0153d\u00e8me comprime le nerf facial correspondant. Le m\u00e9diocre chauffage du logement de l'\u00e9tudiant entra\u00eene la fr\u00e9quence de ses refroidissements. L'explication de cette infirmit\u00e9 reste ignor\u00e9e de l'\u00e9crivain ; il vit dans la permanente inqui\u00e9tude d'un d\u00e9r\u00e8glement nerveux, aboutissant \u00e0 la folie.\"}}\n\nIn the same year, Verne was required to enlist in the [[French military]], but the [[sortition]] process spared him, to his great relief. He wrote to his father: \"You should already know, dear papa, what I think of the military life, and of these domestic servants in livery. \u2026 You have to abandon all dignity to perform such functions.\"{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=29}} Verne's strong antiwar sentiments, to the dismay of his father, would remain steadfast throughout his life.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=29}}\n\nThough writing profusely and frequenting the salons, Verne diligently pursued his law studies and graduated with a ''licence en droit'' in January 1851.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=17}}\n\n===Literary debut===\nThanks to his visits to salons, Verne came into contact in 1849 with [[Alexandre Dumas]] through the mutual acquaintance of a celebrated [[chirologist]] of the time, the Chevalier d'Arpentigny.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=17}} Verne became close friends with Dumas' son, [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], and showed him a manuscript for a stage comedy, ''Les Pailles rompues'' (''The Broken Straws''). The two young men revised the play together, and Dumas, through arrangements with his father, had it produced by the [[Op\u00e9ra-National]] at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]] in Paris, opening on 12 June 1850.{{sfn|Dekiss|Dehs|1999|p=29}}\n\n[[File:Le Mus\u00e9e des familles 1854-1855.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Cover of an 1854\u201355 issue of ''Mus\u00e9e des familles'']]\nIn 1851, Verne met with a fellow writer from Nantes, [[Pierre-Michel-Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier]] (known as \"Pitre-Chevalier\"), the editor-in-chief of the magazine ''[[Mus\u00e9e des familles]]'' (''The Family Museum'').{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=37}} Pitre-Chevalier was looking for articles about geography, history, science, and technology, and was keen to make sure that the educational component would be made accessible to large popular audiences using a straightforward prose style or an engaging fictional story. Verne, with his delight in diligent research, especially in geography, was a natural for the job.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=18}} Verne first offered him a short [[historical fiction|historical]] [[adventure story]], \"[[The First Ships of the Mexican Navy]]\", written in the style of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], whose novels had deeply influenced him.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=37}} Pitre-Chevalier published it in July 1851, and in the same year published a second short story, \"[[A Voyage in a Balloon]]\"(August 1851). The latter story, with its combination of adventurous narrative, travel themes, and detailed historical research, would later be described by Verne as \"the first indication of the line of novel that I was destined to follow.\"{{sfn|Sherard|1894|loc=\u00a73}}\n\nDumas fils put Verne in contact with Jules Seveste, a stage director who had taken over the directorship of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Historique and renamed it the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique]]. Seveste offered Verne the job of secretary of the theatre, with little or no salary attached.{{sfn|Butcher|2007}} Verne accepted, using the opportunity to write and produce several comic operas written in collaboration with Hignard and the prolific librettist [[Michel Carr\u00e9]].{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=53, 58}} To celebrate his employment at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique, Verne joined with ten friends to found a bachelors' dining club, the ''Onze-sans-femme'' (Eleven Bachelors).{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=27}}\n\nFor some time, Verne's father pressed him to abandon his writing and begin a business as a lawyer. However, Verne argued in his letters that he could only find success in literature.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=38}} The pressure to plan for a secure future in law reached its climax in January 1852, when his father offered Verne his own Nantes law practice.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=46\u201347}} Faced with this ultimatum, Verne decided conclusively to continue his literary life and refuse the job, writing: \"Am I not right to follow my own instincts? It's because I know who I am that I realize what I can be one day.\"{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=47}}\n\n[[File:Arago, Jacques (colored).jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|left|Jacques Arago]]\nMeanwhile, Verne was spending much time at the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], conducting research for his stories and feeding his passion for science and recent discoveries, especially in [[geography]]. It was in this period that Verne met the illustrious geographer and explorer [[Jacques Arago]], who continued to travel extensively despite his blindness (he had lost his sight completely in 1837). The two men became good friends, and Arago's innovative and witty accounts of his travels led Verne toward a newly developing genre of literature: that of [[travel writing]].{{sfn|Dekiss|Dehs|1999|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nIn 1852, two new pieces from Verne appeared in the ''Mus\u00e9e des familles'': \"[[Martin Paz]]\", a novella set in Lima, which Verne wrote in 1851 and published 10 July through 11 August 1852, and ''Les Ch\u00e2teaux en Californie, ou, Pierre qui roule n'amasse pas mousse'' (''The Castles in California, or, A Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss''), a one-act comedy full of racy [[double entendres]].{{sfn|Margot|2005|p=151}} In April and May 1854, the magazine published Verne's short story \"[[Master Zacharius]]\", an [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]-like fantasy featuring a sharp condemnation of scientific [[hubris]] and ambition,{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=57}} followed soon afterward by \"[[A Winter Amid the Ice]]\", a polar adventure story whose themes closely anticipated many of Verne's novels.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=58}} The ''Mus\u00e9e'' also published some nonfiction [[popular science]] articles which, though unsigned, are generally attributed to Verne.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=18}} Verne's work for the magazine was cut short in 1856, when he had a serious quarrel with Pitre-Chevalier and refused to continue contributing (a refusal he would maintain until 1863, when Pitre-Chevalier died, and the magazine went to new editorship).{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=19}}\n\nWhile writing stories and articles for Pitre-Chevalier, Verne began to form the idea of inventing a new kind of novel, a ''Roman de la Science'' (novel of science), which would allow him to incorporate large amounts of the factual information he so enjoyed researching in the Biblioth\u00e8que. He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, ''Isaac Laquedem'', and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.{{sfn|Evans|1988|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lyrique and by then a good friend.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=58}} Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theatre for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=37}} He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=19}}\n\n===Family===\nIn May 1856, Verne traveled to [[Amiens]] to be the [[best man]] at the wedding of a Nantes friend, Auguste Lelarge, to an Amiens woman named Aim\u00e9e du Fraysse de Viane. Verne, invited to stay with the bride's family, took to them warmly, befriending the entire household and finding himself increasingly attracted to the bride's sister, Honorine de Viane Morel, a widow aged 26 with two young children.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=66\u201367}} Hoping to find a secure source of income, as well as a chance to court Morel in earnest, he jumped at her brother's offer to go into business with a [[brokerage]].{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|pp=42\u201343}} Verne's father was initially dubious but gave in to his son's requests for approval in November 1856.

He also continued to frequent the Biblioth\u00e8que to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use\u2014a system he would continue for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=19}} According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \"did better in repartee than in business\".{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=76\u201378}}\n [[File:Jules Verne Funeral Procession 1905.jpg|thumb|Jules Verne Funeral Procession, headed by his son and grandson, 1905]]\nIn July 1858, Verne and Aristide Hignard seized an opportunity offered by Hignard's brother: a sea voyage, at no charge, from [[Bordeaux]] to [[Liverpool]] and Scotland. The journey, Verne's first trip outside France, deeply impressed him, and upon his return to Paris he fictionalized his recollections to form the backbone of a semi-autobiographical novel, ''[[Backwards to Britain]]'' (written in the autumn and winter of 1859\u20131860 and not published until 1989).{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=79}} A second complementary voyage in 1861 took Hignard and Verne to [[Stockholm]], from where they traveled to [[Oslo|Christiania]] and through [[Telemark]].{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=81|ps=;confusion regarding the year resolved with reference to {{Harvnb|Jules-Verne|1976|p=54}}, {{Harvnb|Butcher|2007}}, and {{Harvnb|P\u00e9rez|de Vries|Margot|2008|loc=[http://jv.gilead.org.il/FAQ/#B6 B6]}}.}} Verne left Hignard in Denmark to return in haste to Paris, but missed the birth on 3 August 1861 of his only biological son, [[Michel Verne|Michel]].{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=54}}\n\nMeanwhile, Verne continued work on the idea of a ''Roman de la Science'', which he developed in a rough draft inspired, according to his recollections, by his \"love for maps and the great explorers of the world\". It took shape as a story of travel across Africa and would eventually become his first published novel, ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]''.{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=19}}\n\n===Hetzel===\n[[File:Pierre-Jules Hetzel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Pierre-Jules Hetzel]]\nIn 1862, through their mutual acquaintance Alfred de Br\u00e9hat, Verne came into contact with the publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], and submitted to him the manuscript of his developing novel, then called ''Voyage en Ballon''.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|pp=54\u201355}} Hetzel, already the publisher of [[Balzac]], [[George Sand]], [[Victor Hugo]], and other well-known authors,<!--this is intended as a very brief summary of Hetzel's importance; if you have other reliably sourced background details or authors, please add them to Hetzel's main article--> had long been planning to launch a high-quality family magazine in which entertaining fiction would combine with scientific education.{{sfn|Evans|1988|pp=23\u201324}} He saw Verne, with his demonstrated inclination toward scrupulously researched adventure stories, as an ideal contributor for such a magazine, and accepted the novel, giving Verne suggestions for improvement. Verne made the proposed revisions within two weeks and returned to Hetzel with the final draft, now titled ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]''.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=56}} It was published by Hetzel on 31 January 1863.<ref name=biblioVE>{{Harvnb|Dehs|Margot|Har'El|2007|loc=[http://jv.gilead.org.il/biblio/voyages.html I]}}</ref>\n\nTo secure his services for the planned magazine, to be called the ''Magasin d'\u00c9ducation et de R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation'' (''Magazine of Education and Recreation''), Hetzel also drew up a long-term contract in which Verne would give him three volumes of text per year, each of which Hetzel would buy outright for a flat fee. Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|pp=56\u201357}} For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's ''Magasin'' before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'' (1864\u201365).<ref name=biblioVE />\n[[File:Hetzel front cover.jpg|thumb|left|A Hetzel edition of Verne's ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'' (cover style \"Aux deux \u00e9l\u00e9phants\")]]\nWhen ''The Adventures of Captain Hatteras'' was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a [[novel sequence]] called the ''[[Voyages extraordinaires]]'' (''Extraordinary Voyages'' or ''Extraordinary Journeys''), and that Verne's aim was \"to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe.\"{{sfn|Evans|1988|pp=29\u201330}} Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: \"My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe\u2026 And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style. It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true.\"{{sfn|Sherard|1894|loc=\u00a74}} However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: \"Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!\"{{sfn|Evans|1988|p=30}}\n\nHetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested. For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of ''Captain Hatteras'', including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived.{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=98\u201399}} Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'', believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|pp=101\u2013103}} (The manuscript, believed [[lost work|lost]] for some time after Verne's death, was finally published in 1994.){{sfn|Evans|1995|p=44}}\n\nThe relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869, when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''. Verne had initially conceived of the submariner [[Captain Nemo]] as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the [[January Uprising|January uprising]]. Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the [[slave trade]], a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero. Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious. After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright.{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=100\u2013101}}\n<!-- the project of expanding and sourcing the biography has gotten as far as here; please help out if you feel like it -->\n\nFrom that point, Verne published two or more volumes a year. The most successful of these are: ''Voyage au centre de la Terre'' (''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', 1864); ''De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune'' (''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'', 1865); ''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers'' (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', 1869); and ''Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours'' (''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]''), which first appeared in ''Le Temps'' in 1872. Verne could now live on his writings. But most of his wealth came from the stage adaptations of ''Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours'' (1874) and ''Michel Strogoff'' (1876), which he wrote with [[Adolphe d'Ennery]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Saint-Michel sketch.jpg|thumb|Sketch by Verne of the ''Saint-Michel'']]\nIn 1867, Verne bought a small ship, the ''Saint-Michel'', which he successively replaced with the ''Saint-Michel II'' and the ''Saint-Michel III'' as his financial situation improved. On board the ''Saint-Michel III'', he sailed around Europe.  After his first novel, most of his stories were first serialised in the ''Magazine d'\u00c9ducation et de R\u00e9cr\u00e9ation'', a Hetzel biweekly publication, before being published in book form. His brother Paul contributed to ''40th French climbing of the Mont-Blanc'' and a collection of short stories \u2013 ''Doctor Ox'' \u2013 in 1874. Verne became wealthy and famous.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nMeanwhile, Michel Verne married an actress against his father's wishes, had two children by an underage mistress, and buried himself in debts.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The relationship between father and son improved as Michel grew older.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===Later years===\nThough he was raised Catholic, Verne became a [[deist]] in his later years, from about 1870 onward.{{sfn|Jules-Verne|1976|p=9|ps=: \"After about 1870, Verne was less and less subservient to the discipline of the Church: his wife went to Mass without him and his views broadened into a kind of Christian-based deism.\"}}{{sfn|Costello|1978|p=34}} Some scholars believe his deist philosophy is reflected in his novels, as they often involve the notion of God or [[divine providence]] but rarely mention the concept of Christ.{{sfn|Verne|2007|p=412}}{{sfn|Oliver|2012|p=22}}\n[[File:Jules Verne and Mrs. Verne ca.1900.jpg|thumb|Jules Verne and Madame Verne ca. 1900]]\nOn 9 March 1886, as Verne was coming home, his twenty-six-year-old nephew, Gaston, shot at him twice with a [[pistol]].

The ''Voyages extraordinaires'' series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year.

The \"Themes\" subsection can include the following entry among others:\n* '''[[Antiwar]] sentiments''': Throughout his life, Verne consistently lampooned and criticized war and the military life.{{sfn|Lottmann|1996|p=29}}\nThe French Wikipedia quotes Chapter XX of ''Five Weeks in a Balloon'' to illustrate the point-->\n\n===Literary reception===\n[[File:1889 Verne poster.jpg|thumb|An 1889 Hetzel poster advertising Verne's works]]\nAfter his [[debut novel|debut]] under Hetzel, Verne was enthusiastically received in France by writers and scientists alike, with [[George Sand]] and [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] among his earliest admirers.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=11\u201312}} Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic [[Jules Claretie]], spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nHowever, Verne's growing popularity among readers and playgoers (due especially to the highly successful stage version of ''Around the World in Eighty Days'') led to a gradual change in his literary reputation.  As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study.{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=14}}\n\nThis denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as [[\u00c9mile Zola]] and the lack of nomination to Verne for membership in the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]],{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=14}} and was recognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: \"The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature.\"{{sfn|Sherard|1894|loc=\u00a71}} To Verne, who considered himself \"a man of letters and an artist, living in the pursuit of the ideal\",{{sfn|Sherard|1894|loc=\u00a76}} this critical dismissal on the basis of literary ideology could only be seen as the ultimate snub.{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=15}}\n\nThis bifurcation of Verne as a popular genre writer but a critical ''[[persona non grata]]'' continued after his death, with early biographies (including one by Verne's own niece, Marguerite Allotte de la Fu\u00ffe) focusing on error-filled and embroidered [[hagiography]] of Verne as a popular figure rather than on Verne's actual working methods or his output.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=22\u201323}} Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place.{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=23}}\n\nHowever, the decades after Verne's death also saw the rise in France of the \"Jules Verne cult\", a steadily growing group of scholars and young writers who took Verne's works seriously as literature and willingly noted his influence on their own pioneering works. Some of the cult founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jules Verne, the first academic society for Verne scholars; many others became highly respected [[avant garde]] and [[surrealist]] literary figures in their own right. Their praise and analyses, emphasizing Verne's stylistic innovations and enduring literary themes, proved highly influential for literary studies to come.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=24\u20136}}\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France.{{sfn|Angenot|1976|p=46}}{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=29}} [[Roland Barthes]]' seminal essay \"Nautilus et Bateau Ivre\" (\"The [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]] and the [[Drunken Boat]]\") was influential in its [[exegesis]] of the ''Voyages extraordinares'' as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Mor\u00e9 and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points.{{sfn|Angenot|1973|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nFrench literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as [[Michel Butor]], [[Georges Borgeaud]], [[Marcel Brion]], [[Pierre Versins]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Ren\u00e9 Barjavel]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], [[Francis Lacassin]], and [[Michel Serres]]; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by [[Livre de Poche]] and \u00c9ditions Rencontre.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=29\u201330}} The wave reached its climax in Verne's [[sesquicentennial]] year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle]], and ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' was accepted for the French university system's [[Agr\u00e9gation]] reading list. Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most Anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a na\u00efve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \"prophet\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[H. G. Wells]] than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality [[Jules Verne#English translations|English translations]] and very loosely adapted [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film]] versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=33}}{{sfn|Butcher|1983}} However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's Anglophone reputation may currently be underway.<ref name=Miller2009 />{{sfn|Evans|2000|p=34}}\n\n===English translations===\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story \"[[A Voyage in a Balloon]]\" (1851) was published in the American journal ''[[Sartain's Magazine|Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art]]'' in a translation by Anne T.

Verne, like [[H. G. Wells]], is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as [[Lucian of Samosata]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Mary Shelley]], have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and [[History of science fiction|history of the genre]].<ref name=\"Roberts48\">{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Adam|title=Science Fiction|publisher=Routledge|publication-place=London|year=2000|page=48}}</ref>\n\nA primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with.

I always was greatly interested in geography and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa.

The party was known for proposing German reunification from 1952 until it was disbanded in 1957.\n\nIn 1958, the pacifist<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/johannes-rau]</ref> Rau and his political mentor, [[Gustav Heinemann]], joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), where he was active in the Wuppertal chapter. He served as deputy chairman of the SPD party of Wuppertal and was elected later on to the City Council (1964\u20131978), where he served as chairman of the SPD Group (1964\u20131967) and later as Mayor (1969\u20131970).\n\nIn 1958, Rau was elected for the first time as member of the ''Landtag'' (state parliament) of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (NRW). In 1967, he became chairman of the SPD fraction in the Landtag, and in 1970, he was Minister of Science and Education in the cabinet of Minister President [[Heinz K\u00fchn]]. He soon gained a reputation as a reformer. As part of the mass education campaign of the 1970s, he founded five universities, each at different sites, in North Rhine-Westphalia and initiated Germany\u2019s first [[distance learning]] university at [[Hagen]] (modelled on the ''[[Open University]]'').\n\nIn 1977, Rau became Chairman of the North Rhine-Westphalia SPD and, in 1978, Minister President of the state, where he remained until 1998, with four successful elections for the SPD, which became strongest party in the Landtag each time and gained an absolute majority three times, in 1980, 1985, 1990 and finally 1995. From 1995 onwards, Rau led an SPD-[[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]] coalition in NRW.\n\nIn 1987, Rau tried to become chancellor of Germany for the SPD, but his refusal to contemplate forming a coalition with the Green Party meant he could not win the elections against [[Helmut Kohl]]\u2019s [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democrats]] (CDU). In 1994, Rau tried for the first time to become Federal President but lost to [[Roman Herzog]].\n\nRau twice served as [[President of the German Bundesrat|President]] of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] in 1982 and 1983 and 1994 and 1995 and thus deputised for the Federal President. In 1998, Rau stepped down from his positions as SPD Chairman and Minister President, and on 23 May 1999, he was elected [[President of Germany|Federal President]] by the [[Federal Assembly of Germany]] to succeed [[Roman Herzog]] (CDU). On 1 July 2004, he was succeeded by [[Horst K\u00f6hler]]. In common with all other Federal Presidents except for Heinemann, who had not wished to be seen off in this manner, Rau was honored by a [[Gro\u00dfer Zapfenstreich]] which, at his request, included the hymn \"Jesus bleibet meine Freude\" ([[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]).\n\nDuring 2000, Rau became the first German head of state to address the [[Knesset]], the Israeli parliament, in German. The controversial step prompted some Israeli delegates to walk out. However, Israeli President [[Moshe Katsav]] supported and praised him for bridging the gap between the two states. Rau had a deep and lifelong commitment to bringing reconciliation between Germany and its past.\n\nFollowing a long history of heart disease, he died a few days after his 75th birthday on 27 January 2006. The funeral took place on 7 February following a funeral act of state  on the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] in Berlin in the closest of family and friends.\n\n[[File:Rau grab.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rau's grave the day after his burial.]]\n[[File:Johannes Rau 2002.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Johannes Rau at [[Schloss Bellevue]] in 2002.]]\n\n==Motto and maxim==\nThe maxim of Rau was \"to reconcile, not divide\".\n\nAs his personal motto, Rau adopted the [[Confessing Church]] dictum \"teneo, quia teneor\" (I hold because I am held).\n\nIn his acceptance speech after his election, Rau claimed \"A patriot I will be\" because \"a patriot is someone who loves his fatherland, a nationalist is someone who despises the fatherlands of the others\". The quote can be attributed to the French writer [[Romain Gary]].\n\n==Prizes and medals==\nRau was awarded fifteen honorary [[doctorate]]s. \nIn 2001, he received the [[Leo Baeck Institute|Leo Baeck Medal]] for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice.\n\n==Private life==\nRau was known as a practising Christian (and sometimes titled {{lang|de|Bruder Johannes}}, \"Brother John\", to ridicule his intense Christian position; however, he sometimes used this term himself). He held lay positions in, and was a member of, the [[Synod]] of the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]], a member church of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]].\n\nOn 9 August 1982, Rau married the political scientist, Christina Delius (born 1956). Christina Rau is a granddaughter of her husband's mentor, [[Gustav Heinemann]], former [[President of Germany]]. The couple had three children: Anna Christina, born 1983, Philip Immanuel, born 1985 and Laura Helene, born 1986. \nSince 1995 Rau was aware of his dangerous [[aneurysm]] in the [[abdominal aorta]], but declined an operation out of respect for his office and the upcoming election as president. On 23 July 2000 the operation took place at the University Hospital of Essen. On 18 August 2004, he had to undergo serious heart surgery, in which an [[artificial heart valve]] was inserted. Only two months later (19 October 2004) a [[hematoma]] in the [[abdominal cavity]] was surgically removed.\n\nAfter leaving office, Rau lived with his family in the federal capital, [[Berlin]]. However, they also kept a house in Wuppertal.\n\n== Honours ==\n* {{flag|Germany}} : Grand Cross Special Class of the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n\n=== Foreign honours

He was one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s close associates and most devoted followers, and was known for his skills in [[public speaking]] and his deep, virulent [[antisemitism]], which was evident in his publicly voiced views. He advocated progressively harsher discrimination, including the extermination of the Jews in [[the Holocaust]].\n\nGoebbels, who aspired to be an author, obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree from the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1921. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1924, and worked with [[Gregor Strasser]] in their northern branch. He was appointed as ''[[Gauleiter]]'' (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to take an interest in the use of [[propaganda]] to promote the party and its programme. After the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. Topics for party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.\n\nIn 1943, Goebbels began to pressure Hitler to introduce measures that would produce ''[[total war]]'', including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the [[Wehrmacht]]. Hitler finally appointed him as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War on 23 July 1944, whereby Goebbels undertook largely unsuccessful measures to increase the number of people available for armaments production and the Wehrmacht.\n\nAs the war drew to a close and Nazi Germany faced defeat, [[Magda Goebbels]] and the [[Goebbels children]] joined him in Berlin. They moved into the underground ''[[Vorbunker]]'', part of Hitler's underground bunker complex, on 22 April 1945. [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler committed suicide]] on 30 April. In accordance with [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's will]], Goebbels succeeded him as [[Chancellor of Germany]]; he served one day in this post. The following day, Goebbels and his wife committed suicide, after poisoning their six children with cyanide.\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Joseph Goebbels was born on 29 October 1897 in [[Rheydt]], an industrial town south of [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]] near [[D\u00fcsseldorf]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} Both of his parents were [[Roman Catholics]] with modest family backgrounds.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} His father Fritz was a factory clerk; his mother Katharina (''n\u00e9e'' Odenhausen) was ethnically [[Dutch people|Dutch]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=2}} Goebbels had five siblings: Konrad (1893\u20131947), Hans (1895\u20131949), Maria (1896\u20131896), Elisabeth (1901\u20131915), and Maria (1910\u20131949),{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} who married the German filmmaker [[Max W. Kimmich]] in 1938.{{sfn|Hull|1969|p=149}} In 1932, Goebbels published a pamphlet of his family tree to refute the rumours that his grandmother was of Jewish ancestry.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=299}}\n\nDuring childhood, Goebbels suffered from ill health, which included a long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a [[clubfoot|deformed right foot]] that turned inwards, due to a [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformity]]. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=5}} He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=6}} Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and walked with a limp. He was rejected for military service in [[World War I]] due to his deformity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=14}}\n\n[[File:Goebbels 1916.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goebbels in 1916]]\nGoebbels was educated at a Christian ''[[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', where he completed his ''[[Abitur]]'' (university entrance examination) in 1917.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=7}} He was the top student of his class and was given the traditional honour to speak at the awards ceremony.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=10}} His parents initially hoped that he would become a Catholic priest, and Goebbels seriously considered it.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=6}} He studied literature and history at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]], [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]],{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=10\u201311, 14}} aided by a scholarship from the [[Albertus Magnus]] Society.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=6\u20137}} By this time Goebbels had begun to distance himself from the church.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=14}}\n\nHistorians, including [[Richard J.

The break-up filled Goebbels with thoughts of suicide.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=20, 21}}{{efn|name=letters}}\n\nAt the [[University of Heidelberg]], Goebbels wrote his [[doctoral thesis]] on [[Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz]], a minor 19th century romantic dramatist.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=17}} He had hoped to write his thesis under the supervision of [[Friedrich Gundolf]], who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. Gundolf was no longer teaching, so directed Goebbels to associate professor [[Max Freiherr von Waldberg]]. Waldberg, also Jewish, recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Sch\u00fctz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his [[PhD]] in 1921.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=21, 22}} By 1940 he had written 14 books.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=66}}\n\nGoebbels then returned home and worked as a private tutor. He also found work as a journalist and was published in the local newspaper. His writing during that time reflected his growing [[antisemitism]] and dislike for modern culture. In the summer of 1922, he met and began a love affair with Else Janke, a schoolteacher.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=22\u201325}} After she revealed to him that she was half-Jewish, Goebbels stated the \"enchantment [was] ruined.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=24}} Nevertheless, he continued to see her on and off until 1927.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=72, 88}}\n\nHe continued for several years to try to become a published author.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=32\u201333}} His [[Goebbels Diaries|diaries]], which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=3}} The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=32}}) forced him to take jobs as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in [[Cologne]], a job he detested.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=33}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=25\u201326}} He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=27}} During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], the British-born German writer whose book ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]'' (1899) was one of the standard works of the [[far-right politics|extreme right]] in Germany.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24\u201326}} He also began to study the \"social question\" and read the works of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[August Bebel]] and [[Gustav Noske]].{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=28}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=43}} According to German historian [[Peter Longerich]], [[Goebbels Diaries|Goebbels' diary]] entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied by \"religious-philosophical\" issues, and lacked a sense of direction.

Kaufmann put him in touch with [[Gregor Strasser]], a leading Nazi organiser in northern Germany, who hired him to work on their weekly newspaper and to do secretarial work for the regional party offices.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=40\u201341}} He was also put to work as party speaker and representative for [[Rhineland]]-[[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=46}} Members of Strasser's northern branch of the NSDAP, including Goebbels, had a more socialist outlook than the rival Hitler group in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=167}} Strasser disagreed with Hitler on many parts of the party platform, and in November 1926 began working on a revision.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}}\n\nHitler viewed Strasser's actions as a threat to his authority, and summoned 60&nbsp;''Gauleiters'' and party leaders, including Goebbels, to a [[Bamberg Conference|special conference in Bamberg]], in Streicher's ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of [[Franconia]], where he gave a two-hour speech repudiating Strasser's new political programme.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=168\u2013169}} Hitler was opposed to the socialist leanings of the northern wing, stating it would mean \"political bolshevization of Germany.\" Further, there would be \"no princes, only Germans,\" and a legal system with no \"...&nbsp;Jewish system of exploitation&nbsp;... for plundering of our people.\" The future would be secured by acquiring land, not through expropriation of the estates of the former nobility, but through colonising territories to the east.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=169}} Goebbels was horrified by Hitler's characterisation of socialism as \"a Jewish creation\" and his assertion that a Nazi government would not expropriate private property. He wrote in his diary: \"I no longer fully believe in Hitler. That's the terrible thing: my inner support has been taken away.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=66}}\n\nAfter reading Hitler's book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', Goebbels found himself agreeing with Hitler's assertion of a \"Jewish doctrine of [[Marxism]]\".{{sfn|Reuth|1994|p=66}} In February 1926 Goebbels gave a speech titled \"Lenin or Hitler?\" in which he asserted that communism or Marxism could not save the German people, but he believed it would cause a \"socialist nationalist state\" to arise in Russia.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=63}} In 1926, Goebbels published a pamphlet titled \"''Nazi-Sozi''\" which attempted to explain how National Socialism differed from Marxism.{{sfn|Goebbels|1927}}\n\nIn hopes of winning over the opposition, Hitler arranged meetings in Munich with the three Greater Ruhr ''Gau'' leaders, including Goebbels.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} Goebbels was impressed when Hitler sent his own car to meet them at the railway station. That evening Hitler and Goebbels both gave speeches at a beer hall rally.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=67}} The following day, Hitler offered his hand in reconciliation to the three men, encouraging them to put their differences behind them.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=68}} Goebbels capitulated completely, offering Hitler his total loyalty. He wrote in his diary: \"I love him&nbsp;... He has thought through everything,\" \"Such a sparkling mind can be my leader. I bow to the greater one, the political genius.\" He later wrote: \"Adolf Hitler, I love you because you are both great and simple at the same time. What one calls a genius.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}} As a result of the Bamberg and Munich meetings, Strasser's new draft of the party programme was discarded. The original [[National Socialist Program]] of 1920 was retained unchanged, and Hitler's position as party leader was greatly strengthened.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=171}}\n\n==Propagandist in Berlin==\nAt Hitler's invitation, Goebbels spoke at party meetings in Munich and at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Party Congress]], held in Weimar in 1926.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=61, 64}} For the following year's event, Goebbels was involved in the planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=94}} Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolise him even more.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=62}}\n\nGoebbels was first offered the position of party ''Gauleiter'' for the [[Gau Berlin|Berlin]] section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and by the middle of October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern ''Gauleiters'' group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=71, 72}} Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the ''Gau''. Goebbels was given control over the local ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) and ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) and answered only to Hitler.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=75}} The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=75}} Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the [[Communist Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201377}} Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=81}} His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=76, 80}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = Bundesarchiv Bild 119-2406-01, Berlin-Lustgarten, Rede Joseph Goebbels.jpg\n | width1 = 174\n | caption1 = Goebbels speaks at a political rally (1932).

Meetings were preceded by ceremonial marches and singing, and the venues were decorated with party banners. His entrance (almost always late) was timed for maximum emotional impact. Goebbels usually meticulously planned his speeches ahead of time, using pre-planned and choreographed inflection and gestures, but he was also able to improvise and adapt his presentation to make a good connection with his audience.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=75\u201379}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} He used loudspeakers, fire decorations, uniforms, and marches to attract attention to speeches.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nGoebbels' tactic of using provocation to bring attention to the NSDAP, along with violence at the public party meetings and demonstrations, led the Berlin police to ban the NSDAP from the city on 5 May 1927.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=79}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=93, 94}} Violent incidents continued, including young Nazis randomly attacking Jews in the streets.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=82}} Goebbels was subjected to a public speaking ban until the end of October.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=84}} During this period, he founded the newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]'' (''The Attack'') as a propaganda vehicle for the Berlin area, where few supported the party. It was a modern-style newspaper with an aggressive tone;{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=89}} 126 libel suits were pending against Goebbels at one point.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} To his disappointment, circulation was initially only 2,000. Material in the paper was highly anti-communist and antisemitic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=82}} Among the paper's favourite targets was the Jewish Deputy Chief of the Berlin Police [[Bernhard Wei\u00df (police executive)|Bernhard Wei\u00df]]. Goebbels gave him the derogatory nickname \"Isidore\" and subjected him to a relentless campaign of Jew-baiting in the hope of provoking a crackdown he could then exploit.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=80\u201381}} Goebbels continued to try to break into the literary world, with a revised version of his book ''Michael'' finally being published, and the unsuccessful production of two of his plays (''Der Wanderer'' and ''Die Saat'' (''The Seed'')). The latter was his final attempt at playwriting.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=95, 98}} During this period in Berlin he had relationships with many women, including his old flame Anka Stalherm, who was now married and had a small child. He was quick to fall in love, but easily tired of a relationship and moved on to someone new. He worried too about how a committed personal relationship might interfere with his career.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=108\u2013112}}\n\nThe ban on the NSDAP was lifted before the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections on 20 May 1928.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=99\u2013100}} The NSDAP lost nearly 100,000 voters and earned only 2.6 per cent of the vote nationwide. Results in Berlin were even worse, where they attained only 1.4 per cent of the vote.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} Goebbels was one of 12 NSDAP members to gain election to the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This gave him immunity from prosecution for a long list of outstanding charges, including a three-week jail sentence he received in April for insulting the deputy police chief Wei\u00df.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=94}} The Reichstag changed the immunity regulations in February 1931, and Goebbels was forced to pay fines for libellous material he had placed in ''Der Angriff'' over the course of the previous year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nIn his newspaper ''Berliner Arbeiterzeitung'' (''Berlin Workers Newspaper''), Gregor Strasser was highly critical of Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=100\u2013101}} However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent of the vote in some regions.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=209}} This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=189}} After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=209, 211}} In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=116}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-043-14, Horst Wessel.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels used the death of [[Horst Wessel]] (pictured) in 1930 as a propaganda tool{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}} against \"Communist subhumans\".{{sfn|Siemens|2013|p=143}}]]\n\nBy 1930 Berlin was the party's second-strongest base of support after Munich.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}} That year the violence between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader [[Horst Wessel]] being shot by two members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]. He later died in hospital.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=123}} Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march ''Die Fahne hoch'' (''Raise the flag''), renamed as the ''[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]'', to be the NSDAP anthem.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=124}}\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] greatly impacted Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=127}} During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new daily newspaper in Berlin, the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers' own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=200}} Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler, and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be \"pushed to the wall\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=125, 126}} In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser and appointed Goebbels to replace him as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=128}} One of Goebbels' first acts was to ban the evening edition of the ''Nationaler Sozialist''.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=129}} Goebbels was also given control of other Nazi papers across the country, including the party's national newspaper, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (''People's Observer''). He still had to wait until 3 July for Otto Strasser and his supporters to announce they were leaving the NSDAP. Upon receiving the news, Goebbels was relieved the \"crisis\" with the Strassers was finally over and glad that Otto Strasser had lost all power.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=130}}\n\nThe rapid deterioration of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and [[Paul von Hindenburg]] used his power as president to govern via [[emergency powers|emergency decrees]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=249\u2013250}} He appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] as [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=199}} Goebbels took charge of the NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the [[Weimar Republic]], particularly its adherence to the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes nationwide and took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1202-500, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, Tochter.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Goebbels and his daughter Helga with [[Adolf Hitler]] ]]\n\nIn late 1930 Goebbels met [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Quandt]], a divorc\u00e9e who had joined the party a few months earlier.

Goebbels was also involved in the production of a small collection of [[silent film]]s that could be shown at party meetings, though they did not yet have enough equipment to widely use this medium.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=172, 173, 184}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=125}} Many of Goebbels' campaign posters used violent imagery such as a giant half-clad male destroying political opponents or other perceived enemies such as \"International High Finance\".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=290\u2013291}} His propaganda characterised the opposition as \"[[November criminals]]\", \"Jewish wire-pullers\", or a communist threat.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=293}} Support for the party continued to grow, but neither of these elections led to a majority government. In an effort to stabilise the country and improve economic conditions, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Reich chancellor on 30 January 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=307}}\n\n==Propaganda Minister==\nTo celebrate Hitler's appointment as chancellor, Goebbels organised a torchlight parade in Berlin on the night of 30 January of an estimated 60,000 men, many in the uniforms of the SA and SS. The spectacle was covered by a live state radio broadcast, with commentary by longtime party member and future Minister of Aviation [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=310\u2013311}} Goebbels was disappointed not to be given a post in Hitler's new cabinet. [[Bernhard Rust]] was appointed as [[Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture|Minister of Culture]], the post Goebbels was expecting to receive.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=206}} Like other NSDAP officials, Goebbels had to deal with Hitler's leadership style of giving contradictory orders to his subordinates, while placing them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=131}} In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=323}} The NSDAP took advantage of the [[Reichstag fire]] of 27 February 1933, with Hindenburg passing the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] the following day at Hitler's urging. This was the first of several pieces of legislation that dismantled democracy in Germany and put a totalitarian dictatorship\u2014headed by Hitler\u2014in its place.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=332\u2013333}} On 5 March, yet another Reichstag election took place, the last to be held before the defeat of the Nazis at the end of the Second World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=339}} While the NSDAP increased their number of seats and percentage of the vote, it was not the landslide expected by the party leadership.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=212}} Goebbels finally received Hitler's appointment to the cabinet, officially becoming head of the newly created [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] on 14 March.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=121}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, B\u00fccherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|287px|[[Nazi book burning]], 10 May 1933 ]]\n\nThe role of the new ministry, which set up its offices in the 18th-century [[Ordenspalais]] across from the Reich Chancellery, was to centralise Nazi control of all aspects of German cultural and intellectual life.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=212\u2013213}} Goebbels hoped to increase popular support of the party from the 37 per cent achieved at the last free election held in Germany on 25 March 1933 to 100 per cent support. An unstated goal was to present to other nations the impression that the NSDAP had the full and enthusiastic backing of the entire population.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=121}} One of Goebbels' first productions was staging the Day of Potsdam, a ceremonial passing of power from Hindenburg to Hitler, held in [[Potsdam]] on 21 March.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=214}} He composed the text of Hitler's decree authorising the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], held on 1 April.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=218}} Later that month, Goebbels travelled back to Rheydt, where he was given a triumphal reception. The townsfolk lined the main street, which had been renamed in his honour. On the following day, Goebbels was declared a local hero.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=221}}\n\nGoebbels converted the 1 May holiday from a celebration of workers' rights (observed as such especially by the communists) into a day celebrating the NSDAP. In place of the usual ad hoc labour celebrations, he organised a huge party rally held at Tempelhof Field in Berlin. The following day, all trade union offices in the country were forcibly disbanded by the SA and SS, and the Nazi-run [[German Labour Front]] was created to take their place.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=128\u2013129}} \"We are the masters of Germany,\" he commented in his diary entry of 3 May.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=358}} Less than two weeks later, he gave a speech at the [[Nazi book burning]] in Berlin on 10 May,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=224}} a ceremony he suggested.{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=67}}\n\nMeanwhile, the NSDAP began passing laws to marginalise Jews and remove them from German society. The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-[[Aryan]]s to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} The first [[Nazi concentration camps]] (initially created to house political dissenters) were founded shortly after Hitler seized power.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=344}} In a process termed ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (co-ordination), the NSDAP proceeded to rapidly bring all aspects of life under control of the party. All civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members. By June 1933, virtually the only organisations not in the control of the NSDAP were the army and the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}} In a move to manipulate Germany's middle class and shape popular opinion, the regime passed on 4 October 1933 the ''Schriftleitergesetz'' (Editor's Law), which became the cornerstone of the Nazi Party's control of the popular press.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=83\u201384}} Modeled to some extent on the system in [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy, the law defined a ''Schriftleiter'' as anyone who wrote, edited, or selected texts and/or illustrated material for serial publication. Individuals selected for this position were chosen based on experiential, educational, and racial criteria.{{sfn|Hale|1973|pp=85\u201386}} The law required journalists to \"regulate their work in accordance with National Socialism as a philosophy of life and as a conception of government.\"{{sfn|Hale|1973|p=86}}\n\nAt the end of June 1934, top officials of the SA and opponents of the regime, including Gregor Strasser, were arrested and killed in a purge later called the [[Night of Long Knives]]. Goebbels was present at the arrest of SA leader [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] in Munich.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=132\u2013134}} On 2 August 1934, President von Hindenburg died. In a radio broadcast, Goebbels announced that the offices of president and chancellor had been combined, and Hitler had been formally named as ''[[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'' (leader and chancellor).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=137}}\n\n===Workings of the Ministry===\nThe propaganda ministry was organised into seven departments: administration and legal; mass rallies, public health, youth, and race; radio; national and foreign press; films and film [[censorship]]; art, music, and theatre; and protection against counter-propaganda, both foreign and domestic.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=140\u2013141}} Goebbels style of leadership was tempestuous and unpredictable. He would suddenly change direction and shift his support between senior associates; he was a difficult boss and liked to berate his staff in public.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=370}} Goebbels was successful at his job, however; ''Life'' wrote in 1938 that \"[p]ersonally he likes nobody, is liked by nobody, and runs the most efficient Nazi department.\"{{sfn|LIFE Magazine|1938}} [[John Gunther]] wrote in 1940 that Goebbels \"is the cleverest of all the Nazis\", but could not succeed Hitler because \"everybody hates him\".{{sfn|Gunther|1940|p=19}}\n\nThe Reich Film Chamber, which all members of the film industry were required to join, was created in June 1933.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=224\u2013225}} Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained subliminal or overt propaganda messages.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=157}} Under the auspices of the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=142}} As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had to be a member of the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=138}} In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=142\u2013143}} Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=140}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H14243, Berlin, Verteilung von 500 Radios (Volksempf\u00e4nger).jpg|thumb|Free radios were distributed in Berlin on Goebbels' birthday in 1938.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-504, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Hitler was the focal point at the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally]].

Loudspeakers were placed in public areas, factories, and schools, so that important party broadcasts would be heard live by nearly all Germans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=127}} On 2 September 1939 (the day after the start of the war), Goebbels and the Council of Ministers proclaimed it illegal to listen to foreign radio stations. Disseminating news from foreign broadcasts could result in the death penalty.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=434}} [[Albert Speer]], Hitler's architect and later Minister for Armaments and War Production, later said the regime \"made the complete use of all technical means for domination of its own country. Through technical devices like the radio and loudspeaker, 80 million people were deprived of independent thought.\"{{sfn|Snell|1959|p=7}}\n\nA major focus of Nazi propaganda was Hitler himself, who was glorified as a heroic and infallible leader and became the focus of a [[cult of personality]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=292\u2013293}} Much of this was spontaneous, but some was stage-managed as part of Goebbels' propaganda work.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=122\u2013123}} Adulation of Hitler was the focus of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, where his moves were carefully choreographed. The rally was the subject of the film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'', one of several Nazi propaganda films directed by [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. It won the Gold Medal at the 1935 [[Venice Film Festival]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=123\u2013127}} At the 1935 Nazi party congress rally at Nuremberg, Goebbels declared that \"Bolshevism is the declaration of war by Jewish-led international subhumans against culture itself.\"{{sfn|Goebbels|1935}}\n\nGoebbels was involved in planning the staging of the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started having an affair with the actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]], whom he continued to see until 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=184, 201}} A major project in 1937 was the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}} A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=351}} Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=346, 350}}\n\n===Church struggle===\n{{see also|Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany}}\nIn 1933, Hitler signed the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' (Reich Concordat), a treaty with the Vatican that required the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=234\u2013235}} However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches and to try to weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offences.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}}{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=382}} Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=189}} Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|name=crucifixes}} Hitler often vacillated on whether or not the ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue;{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=382}} in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the [[Protestant]] church.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=223}}\n\nIn response to the persecution, [[Pope Pius XI]] had the ''\"[[Mit brennender Sorge]]\"'' (\"With Burning Concern\") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for [[Passion Sunday]] 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=234\u2013235}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=241\u2013243}} In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=244}} His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As a result of the propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=245\u2013247}} Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling back of the church struggle by the end of July 1937.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=334}}\n\n==World War II==\nAs early as February 1933, Hitler announced that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as to do so was in violation of the Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=338\u2013339}} Goebbels was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of Hitler aggressively pursuing Germany's expansionist policies sooner rather than later. At the time of the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936, Goebbels summed up his general attitude in his diary: \"[N]ow is the time for action. Fortune favors the brave! He who dares nothing wins nothing.\"{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=352, 353}} In the lead-up to the [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland crisis]] in 1938, Goebbels took the initiative time and again to use propaganda to whip up sympathy for the [[Sudetenland|Sudeten Germans]] while campaigning against the Czech government.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=380\u2013382}} Still, Goebbels was well aware there was a growing \"war panic\" in Germany and so by July had the press conduct propaganda efforts at a lower level of intensity.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=381, 382}} After the western powers acceded to Hitler's demands concerning Czechoslovakia in 1938, Goebbels soon redirected his propaganda machine against Poland. From May onwards, he orchestrated a campaign against Poland, fabricating stories about atrocities against ethnic Germans in [[Danzig]] and other cities. Even so, he was unable to persuade the majority of Germans to welcome the prospect of war.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=696}} He privately held doubts about the wisdom of risking a protracted war against Britain and France by attacking Poland.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=212}}\n\nAfter the [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Goebbels used his propaganda ministry and the Reich chambers to control access to information domestically. To his chagrin, his rival [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals for the remainder of the Nazi era.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=155, 180}} Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=422, 456\u2013457}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0415-500, PK-Filmberichter an Kamera.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Production of a [[newsreel]] at the front lines, January 1941]]\n\nThe Propaganda Ministry took over the broadcasting facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers as a way to gain the trust of the citizens.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|pp=185\u2013186}} Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=693}}{{efn|name=other departments}} The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=181}} Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for the German people.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=188}} From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' which were later read aloud over the radio.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=470}} He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=190}} At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the [[Wehrmacht]]).{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=468\u2013469}}\n\nGoebbels became preoccupied with morale and the efforts of the people on the home front. He believed that the more the people at home were involved in the war effort, the better their morale would be.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} For example, he initiated a programme for the collection of winter clothing and ski equipment for troops on the eastern front.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=509}} At the same time, Goebbels implemented changes to have more \"entertaining material\" in radio and film produced for the public, decreeing in late 1942 that 20 per cent of the films should be propaganda and 80 per cent light entertainment.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=510, 512}} As ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin, Goebbels dealt with increasingly serious shortages of necessities such as food and clothing, as well as the need to ration beer and tobacco, which were important for morale. Hitler suggested watering the beer and degrading the quality of the cigarettes so that more could be produced, but Goebbels refused, saying the cigarettes were already of such low quality that it was impossible to make them any worse.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=235\u2013236}} Through his propaganda campaigns, he worked hard to maintain an appropriate level of morale among the public about the military situation, neither too optimistic nor too grim.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=502\u2013504}} The series of military setbacks the Germans suffered in this period \u2013 the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|thousand-bomber raid]] on Cologne (May 1942), the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] (November 1942), and especially the catastrophic defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] (February 1943) \u2013 were difficult matters to present to the German public, who were increasingly weary of the war and sceptical that it could be won.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=246\u2013251}} On 15 January 1943, Hitler appointed Goebbels as head of the newly created Air Raid Damage committee, which meant Goebbels was nominally in charge of nationwide civil air defences and shelters as well as the assessment and repair of damaged buildings.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=567}} In actuality, the defence of areas other than Berlin remained in the hands of the local ''Gauleiters'', and his main tasks were limited to providing immediate aid to the affected civilians and using propaganda to improve their morale.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=615}}{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=269\u2013270}}\n\nBy early 1943, the war produced a labour crisis for the regime. Hitler created a three-man committee with representatives of the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were [[Hans Lammers]] (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]], chief of the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and [[Martin Bormann]], who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the ''Dreierausschu\u00df'' (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance by September 1943.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=749\u2013753}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J05235, Berlin, Gro\u00dfkundgebung im Sportpalast.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Sportpalast speech]], 18 February 1943. The banner says ''\"TOTALER KRIEG \u2013 K\u00dcRZESTER KRIEG\"'' (\"Total War \u2013 Shortest War\")]]\n\nPartly in response to being excluded from the Committee of Three, Goebbels pressured Hitler to introduce measures that would produce \"[[total war]]\", including closing businesses not essential to the war effort, conscripting women into the labour force, and enlisting men in previously exempt occupations into the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=549\u2013550}} Some of these measures were implemented in an edict of 13 January, but to Goebbels' dismay, G\u00f6ring demanded that his favourite restaurants in Berlin should remain open, and Lammers successfully lobbied Hitler to have women with children exempted from conscription, even if they had child care available.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=553\u2013554}} After receiving an enthusiastic response to his speech of 30 January 1943 on the topic, Goebbels believed he had the support of the German people in his call for total war.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=555}} His next speech, the [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943, was a passionate demand for his audience to commit to total war, which he presented as the only way to stop the [[Bolshevik]] onslaught and save the German people from destruction. The speech also had a strong antisemitic element and hinted at the extermination of the Jewish people that was already underway.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=255}} The speech was presented live on radio and was filmed as well.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=256}} During the live version of the speech, Goebbels accidentally begins to mention the \"extermination\" of the Jews; this is omitted in the published text of the speech.{{sfn|Goebbels|1944}}\n\nGoebbels' efforts had little impact for the time being, as while Hitler was in principle in favour of total war, he was not prepared to implement changes over the objections of his ministers.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=577}} The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\n==Plenipotentiary for total war==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J31305, Auszeichnung des Hitlerjungen Willi H\u00fcbner.jpg|thumb|left|9 March 1945: Goebbels awards 16-year-old [[Hitler Youth]] Willi H\u00fcbner the [[Iron Cross]] for the defence of [[Lauban]] ]]\n\nAfter the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] (July 1943) and the strategic Soviet victory in the [[Battle of Kursk]] (July\u2013August 1943), Goebbels began to recognise that the war could no longer be won.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=594}} Following the Allied invasion of Italy and the fall of Mussolini in September, he raised with Hitler the possibility of a separate peace, either with the Soviets or with Britain.

Over the objections of G\u00f6ring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=643}} Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=282}} However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=651}} Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=660 }}\n\nAt Hitler's behest, the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' (People's Storm) \u2013 a nationwide militia of men previously considered unsuitable for military service \u2013 was formed on 18 October 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=675}} Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his ''Gau'' alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve on the front lines against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=284}}{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=676}}\n\n==Defeat and death==\nIn the last months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and articles took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=292}} By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the [[Oder|Oder River]] and the Western Allies preparing to cross the [[Rhine|Rhine River]], he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=892, 893, 897}} Berlin had little in the way of fortifications or artillery (or even ''Volkssturm'' units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} Goebbels noted in his diary on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=288}} He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his F\u00fchrer.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=897, 898}}\n\nWhen other Nazi leaders urged Hitler to leave Berlin and establish a new centre of resistance in the [[Alpine Fortress|National Redoubt]] in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=924, 925, 929, 930}} His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who had served in the Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=290}} He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=289}} He knew how the outside world would view the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the \"debacle\" of a trial.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=291}} He burned his private papers on the night of 18 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=295}}\n\nGoebbels knew how to play on Hitler's fantasies, encouraging him to see the hand of providence in the death of United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on 12 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=918}} Whether Hitler really saw this event as a turning point as Goebbels proclaimed is not known.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=918, 919}} By this time, Goebbels had gained the position he had wanted so long&nbsp;\u2013 at the side of Hitler. G\u00f6ring was utterly discredited, although he was not stripped of his offices until 23 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=913, 933}} Himmler, whose appointment as commander of [[Army Group Vistula]] had led to disaster on the Oder, was also in disgrace with Hitler.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=891, 913\u2013914}} Most of Hitler's inner circle, including G\u00f6ring, Himmler, Ribbentrop, and Speer, prepared to leave Berlin immediately after Hitler's birthday celebration on 20 April.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=296}} Even Bormann was \"not anxious\" to meet his end at Hitler's side.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=932}} On 22 April, Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=929}} Goebbels moved with his family into the ''[[Vorbunker]]'', connected to the lower ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' under the Reich Chancellery garden in central Berlin, that same day.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=298}} He told Vice-Admiral [[Hans-Erich Voss]] that he would not entertain the idea of either surrender or escape.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=154}} On 23 April, Goebbels made the following proclamation to the people of Berlin:\n\n{{quote|I call on you to fight for your city. Fight with everything you have got, for the sake of your wives and your children, your mothers and your parents. Your arms are defending everything we have ever held dear, and all the generations that will come after us. Be proud and courageous! Be inventive and cunning! Your ''Gauleiter'' is amongst you. He and his colleagues will remain in your midst. His wife and children are here as well. He, who once captured the city with 200 men, will now use every means to galvanize the defense of the capital. The [[battle for Berlin]] must become the signal for the whole nation to rise up in battle&nbsp;...\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=231}} }}\n\nAfter midnight on 29 April, with the Soviets advancing ever closer to the bunker complex, Hitler married [[Eva Braun]] in a small civil ceremony within the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=342, 343}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}} Hitler then took secretary [[Traudl Junge]] to another room and dictated [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|his last will and testament]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=343, 344}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Goebbels and Bormann were two of the witnesses.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=950}}\n\nIn his last will and testament, Hitler named no successor as F\u00fchrer or leader of the Nazi Party. Instead, he appointed Goebbels as Reich Chancellor; Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who was at [[Flensburg]] near the Danish border, as Reich President; and Bormann as Party Minister.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=949, 950}} Goebbels wrote a postscript to the will stating that he would disobey Hitler's order to leave Berlin: \"For reasons of humanity and personal loyalty\", he had to stay.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}} Further, his wife and children would be staying, as well. They would end their lives \"side by side with the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nIn the mid-afternoon of 30 April, Hitler [[Death of Adolf Hitler|shot himself]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=955}} Goebbels was depressed, and stated that he would walk around the Chancellery garden until he was killed by the Russian shelling.{{sfn|Misch|2014|p=173}} Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: \"It is a great pity that such a man (Hitler) is not with us any longer. But there is nothing to be done. For us, everything is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example.\"{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=157}}\n\nOn 1 May, Goebbels completed his sole official act as Chancellor. He dictated a letter to General [[Vasily Chuikov]] and ordered German General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] to deliver it under a [[white flag]]. Chuikov, as commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=324}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-086-03, Joseph Goebbels mit Familie.jpg|thumb|The Goebbels family.

But he replied: 'The captain must not leave his sinking ship. I have thought about it all and decided to stay here. I have nowhere to go because with little children I will not be able to make it, especially with a leg like mine...' \"{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=156}} On the evening of 1 May, Goebbels arranged for an SS dentist, [[Helmut Kunz]], to inject [[Goebbels children|his six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} According to Kunz's later testimony, he gave the children morphine injections but it was Magda Goebbels and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]], Hitler's personal doctor, who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}}\n\nAt around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda left the bunker and walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann]] testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Rochus Misch]] and [[Johannes Hentschel]]'s singular conflicting story states that Goebbels killed himself in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', in the early hours of 2 May. {{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}}\n\nThe bodies were then doused with petrol, but they were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} A few days later, Voss was brought back to the bunker by the Soviets to identify the partly burned bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their children. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Braun, General Krebs, and [[Blondi|Hitler's dogs]] were repeatedly buried and exhumed.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=111, 333}} The last burial was at the [[SMERSH]] facility in [[Magdeburg]] on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director [[Yuri Andropov]] authorised an operation to destroy the remains.{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|p=333}} On 4 April 1970, a Soviet [[KGB]] team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg SMERSH facility. Those were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby [[Elbe]].{{sfn|Vinogradov|2005|pp=335, 336}}\n\n==Antisemitism and the Holocaust==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-099-63, M\u00fcnchen, zerst\u00f6rte Ohel-Jakob-Synagoge.jpg|thumb|A ruined synagogue in Munich after [[Kristallnacht]]]]\nLike many Germans of that time, Goebbels was antisemitic from a young age.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=24\u201325}} After joining the NSDAP and meeting Hitler, his antisemitism grew and became more radical. He began to see the Jews as a destructive force with a negative impact on German society.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=39\u201340}} After the Nazis seized power, he repeatedly urged Hitler to take action against the Jews.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=145}} Despite his extreme antisemitism, Goebbels spoke of the \"rubbish of race-materialism\" and of the unnecessity of [[biological racism]] for the Nazi ideology.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}} He also described Himmler's ideology as \"in many regards, mad\" and thought [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s theories were ridiculous.{{sfn|Michael|2006|p=177}}\n\nThe Nazi party's goal was to remove Jews from German cultural and economic life, and eventually to remove them from the country altogether.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=454\u2013455}} In addition to his propaganda efforts, Goebbels actively promoted the persecution of the Jews through [[pogrom]]s, legislation, and other actions.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=156}} Discriminatory measures he instituted in Berlin in the early years of the regime included bans against their using public transport and requiring that Jewish shops be marked as such.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=454}}\n\nIn November 1938, the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] was killed in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels arranged for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, and the result was the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by the German people. At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalised in an event called ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=455\u2013459}} The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where G\u00f6ring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=400\u2013401}}\n\nGoebbels continued his intensive antisemitic propaganda campaign that culminated in Hitler's 30 January 1939 Reichstag speech, which Goebbels helped to write:{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=205}}\n[[File:Judenstern JMW.jpg|thumb|upright|Goebbels ordered all German Jews to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]].]]\n\n{{quote|If international finance Jewry in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thereby the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=469}} }}\n\nWhile Goebbels had been pressing for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, there were still 62,000 living in the city in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the armaments industry.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=464\u2013466}} Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as [[Riga]] and [[Kaunas]].{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=236}} In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews were required by law to wear an identifying [[yellow badge]] as of 5 September 1941.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=235}} On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the [[Wannsee Conference]].{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=513}} The document made the Nazi policy clear: the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to [[extermination camp]]s in occupied areas of Poland and killed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=309\u2013310}} His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. \"In general, it can probably be established that 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 percent can be put to work.&nbsp;... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved,\" he wrote on 27 March 1942.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=514}}\n\nGoebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject they discussed almost every time they met.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=328}} He was aware throughout that the Jews were being exterminated, and completely supported this decision.

Set in Texas, the film tells the tale of a shifty, sleazy bar owner who hires a private detective to kill his wife and her lover. The film contains elements that point to their future direction: distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case [[film noir|noir]] and [[horror film|horror]]), [[plot twist]]s layered over a simple story, dark humor, and ''[[mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]''. The film starred [[Frances McDormand]], who went on to feature in many of the Coen brothers' films (and marry Joel). Upon release the film received much praise and won awards for Joel's direction at both the [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] and [[Independent Spirit]] awards.<ref name=\"BloodSimpleAwards\">{{cite web|title=Blood Simple \u2013 Cast, Crew, Directors and Awards|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/6128/Blood-Simple/details|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTheir next project was ''[[Crimewave]]'' (1985), directed by Sam Raimi and written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel and Raimi also made [[cameo appearance]]s in ''[[Spies Like Us]]'' (1985).\n\nThe brothers' next film was ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' (1987), the story of an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. ([[Nicolas Cage]]) and police officer Ed ([[Holly Hunter]]), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When a local furniture tycoon ([[Trey Wilson]]) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they \"are more than we can handle\", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. The film featured Frances McDormand, [[John Goodman]], [[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]], [[Sam McMurray]], and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\n''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', released in 1990, starred [[Albert Finney]], [[Gabriel Byrne]], and [[John Turturro]]. The film is about feuding gangsters in the [[Prohibition]] era, inspired by [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novels ''[[Red Harvest]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Glass Key]]'' (serialized in 1930).\n\nThe following year, they released ''[[Barton Fink]]'' (1991); set in 1941, in which a New York playwright (the eponymous Barton Fink played by John Turturro) moves to Los Angeles to write a [[B-movie]]. He settles down in his hotel room to commence writing but suffers [[writer's block]] until he is invaded by the man next door (John Goodman). ''Barton Fink'' was a critical success, earning Oscar nominations and winning three major awards at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]], including the [[Palme d'Or]].<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com Barton Fink\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/79/year/1991.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Barton Fink |accessdate=August 9, 2009|publisher=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> It was their first film with cinematographer [[Roger Deakins]], a key collaborator for the next 25 years.\n\n''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' (co-written with Raimi) was released in 1994. In it, the board of a large corporation in 1958 New York City appoints a naive [[schmo]] as president ([[Tim Robbins]]) for underhanded reasons. The film [[box office bomb|bombed at the box office]] ($30 million budget, $3 million gross in the USA), even though it featured [[Paul Newman]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. [[Frances McDormand]] appears in a brief uncredited role.\n\nThe Coens wrote and directed the crime thriller ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996), set in their home state of [[Minnesota]]. Jerry Lundegaard ([[William H. Macy]]), who has serious financial problems, has his wife kidnapped so that his wealthy father-in-law will pay the ransom. His plan goes wrong when the kidnappers deviate from the plan and local cop [[Marge Gunderson (Fargo character)|Marge Gunderson]] (McDormand) starts to investigate.

The only exception to this rule is if the co-directors are an \"established duo\". Now that they were able to share the director credit the Coen brothers have become only the third duo to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. The first two pairs to achieve this were [[Robert Wise]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] (who won for ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'' in 1961), and [[Warren Beatty]] and [[Buck Henry]] (who were nominated for ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' in 1978).\n\nOnly six other directors have won three Oscars for the same film, a distinction the duo shares with [[Billy Wilder]], [[James L. Brooks]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[James Cameron]], and [[Peter Jackson]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWith eight Academy Award nominations for ''No Country for Old Men'', including Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, and Film Editing the Coen brothers have tied the record for the most nominations by a single nominee (counting an \"established duo\" as one nominee) for the same film. [[Orson Welles]] set the record in 1941 with ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' being nominated for Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Screenplay (with [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]]). [[Warren Beatty]] received the same nominations, first for ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1978 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'' in 1978 and again in 1981 with ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. [[Alan Menken]] also then achieved the same feat when he was nominated for [[Academy Award for Original Music Score|Best Score]] and triple-nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]] for ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991.\n\n== Collaborators ==\n{{See also|List of frequent Coen Brothers collaborators}}\n[[File:Frances McDormand 2015 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Joel's wife [[Frances McDormand]] is their most frequent acting collaborator]]\nThe Coen brothers frequently cast certain actors in their films, most frequently [[Frances McDormand]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[John Goodman]], [[Jon Polito]], [[George Clooney]], and [[John Turturro]].

They used cinematographer [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] on their first three films, through ''Miller's Crossing'', until Sonnenfeld left to pursue his own directing career. Deakins has been the Coen brothers' cinematographer for all their subsequent films except ''Burn After Reading'', on which they employed [[Emmanuel Lubezki]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Burn After Reading: The Coens go back to their kooky roots|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=December 2007|page=30\n}}</ref> and ''Inside Llewyn Davis'', on which they employed [[Bruno Delbonnel]].<ref>{{cite news|last= Desowitz| first= Bill| url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/nyfcc-cinematography-winner-delbonnel-goes-inside-llewyn-davis |title=New York Film Critics' Cinematography Winner Delbonnel Goes 'Inside Llewyn Davis'|work= [[Indiewire]]|location= New York City|date= December 4, 2013| accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] is another frequent collaborator.

They were in comfortable circumstances but not wealthy enough to live in downtown [[Buenos Aires]] so the family resided in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]], then a poorer suburb. Borges's mother, [[Leonor Acevedo Su\u00e1rez]], came from a traditional Uruguayan family of [[Criollo people|criollo]] (Spanish) origin. Her family had been much involved in the European settling of South America and the [[Argentine War of Independence]], and she spoke often of their heroic actions.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nHis 1929 book, ''Cuaderno San Mart\u00edn'', includes the poem \"Isidoro Acevedo\", commemorating his grandfather, Isidoro de Acevedo Laprida, a soldier of the Buenos Aires Army. A descendant of the Argentine lawyer and politician [[Francisco Narciso de Laprida]], de Acevedo Laprida fought in the battles of [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)|Cepeda]] in 1859, [[Battle of Pav\u00f3n|Pav\u00f3n]] in 1861, and [[Battle of Los Corrales|Los Corrales]] in 1880. De Acevedo Laprida died of pulmonary congestion in the house where his grandson Jorge Luis Borges was born.\n\nBorges's own father, [[Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam]] (24 February 1874 \u2013 14 February 1938)<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/25607035|title=Biography|publisher=[[Find a Grave]]|accessdate=4 July 2013}}</ref> was a lawyer, and wrote a novel ''El caudillo'' in 1921. Borges Haslam was born in [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]] of Spanish, Portuguese, and English descent, the son of Francisco Borges Lafinur, a colonel, and Frances Ann Haslam, an Englishwoman. Borges Haslam grew up speaking English at home. The family frequently traveled to Europe. Borges Haslam wed [[Leonor Acevedo Suarez]] in 1898 and was also father of the painter [[Norah Borges]], sister of Jorge Luis Borges.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nAt age nine, Jorge Luis Borges translated [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales#\"The Happy Prince\"|The Happy Prince]]'' into Spanish. It was published in a local journal, but Borges' friends thought the real author was his father.<ref>[[Harold Bloom]] (2004) ''Jorge Luis Borges'', Infobase Publishing; {{ISBN|0-7910-7872-8}}</ref> Borges Haslam was a lawyer and psychology teacher who harboured literary aspirations. Borges said his father \"tried to become a writer and failed in the attempt\", despite the 1921 opus ''El caudillo''. Jorge Luis Borges wrote, \"as most of my people had been soldiers and I knew I would never be, I felt ashamed, quite early, to be a bookish kind of person and not a man of action.\"<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nJorge Luis Borges was taught at home until the age of 11, was bilingual in Spanish and English, reading Shakespeare in the latter at the age of twelve.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> The family lived in a large house with an English library of over one thousand volumes; Borges would later remark that \"if I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say my father's library.\"<ref>Borges, Jorge Luis, \"Autobiographical Notes\", ''The New Yorker'', 19 September 1970.</ref>\n\nHis father gave up practicing law due to the failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son. In 1914, the family moved to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> Borges Haslam was treated by a Geneva eye specialist, while Jorge Luis and his sister Norah attended school; there Jorge Luis learned French. He read [[Thomas Carlyle]] in English, and he began to read philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met writer Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that would last for the remainder of his life.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> He received his [[baccalaur\u00e9at]] from the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Gen\u00e8ve]] in 1918.<ref>Gene H.

(He was never to finish his high school education, in fact).\"</ref> The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war. After [[World War I]], the family spent three years living in various cities: [[Lugano]], Barcelona, [[Majorca]], Seville, and Madrid.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> They remained in Europe until 1921.\n\nAt that time, Borges discovered the writings of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Gustav Meyrink]]'s ''[[The Golem (Meyrink)|The Golem]]'' (1915) which became influential to his work. In Spain, Borges fell in with and became a member of the [[avant-garde]], anti-[[Modernismo]] [[Ultraism|Ultraist]] literary movement, inspired by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], close to the [[Imagist]]s. His first poem, \"Hymn to the Sea,\" written in the style of [[Walt Whitman]], was published in the magazine ''Grecia''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Jason|title=Jorge Luis Borges|page=37|isbn=1-86189-286-1|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2006}}</ref> While in Spain, he met such noted Spanish writers as [[Rafael Cansinos Assens]] and [[Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65768057|title=Jorge Luis Borges|last=1944-|first=Wilson, Jason,|date=2006|publisher=Reaktion|year=|isbn=1861892861|location=London|pages=45\u201347|oclc=65768057}}</ref>\n[[File:Borges 1921.jpg|thumb|right|Borges in 1921.]]\n\n===Early writing career===\nIn 1921, Borges returned with his family to Buenos Aires. He had little formal education, no qualifications and few friends. He wrote to a friend that Buenos Aires was now \"overrun by arrivistes, by correct youths lacking any mental equipment, and decorative young ladies\".<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> He brought with him the doctrine of [[Ultraist movement|Ultraism]] and launched his career, publishing surreal poems and essays in literary journals. Borges published his first published collection of poetry, ''Fervor de Buenos Aires'', in 1923 and contributed to the avant-garde review ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro (magazine)|Mart\u00edn Fierro]]''.\n\nBorges co-founded the journals ''Prisma'', a broadsheet distributed largely by pasting copies to walls in Buenos Aires, and ''Proa''. Later in life, Borges regretted some of these early publications, attempting to purchase all known copies to ensure their destruction.<ref>[http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exboroth.html ''Borges: Other Inquisitions 1937\u20131952''. Full introduction by James Irby]. University of Texas, {{ISBN|978-0-292-76002-8}}; accessed 16 August 2010.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1930s, he began to explore existential questions and fiction. He worked in a style that Argentine critic Ana Mar\u00eda Barrenechea has called \"Irreality\". Many other Latin American writers, such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Arreola]], and [[Alejo Carpentier]], were investigating these themes, influenced by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]], and the [[existentialism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In this vein, his biographer Edwin Williamson underlines the danger in inferring an autobiographically-inspired basis for the content or tone of certain of his works: books, philosophy and imagination were as much a source of real inspiration to him as his own lived experience, if not more so.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> \n[[File:Bioy Casares, Ocampo y Borges.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], [[Victoria Ocampo]] and Borges in 1935]]\nFrom the first issue, Borges was a regular contributor to ''[[Sur (magazine)|Sur]]'', founded in 1931 by [[Victoria Ocampo]]. It was then Argentina's most important literary journal and helped Borges find his fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villaocampo.org/ing/historico/cultura_1.htm|title=Ivonne Bordelois, \"The Sur Magazine\" Villa Ocampo Website|publisher=Villaocampo.org|accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref> Ocampo introduced Borges to [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]], another well-known figure of [[Argentine literature]], who was to become a frequent collaborator and close friend. They wrote a number of works together, some under the ''nom de plume'' [[H. Bustos Domecq]], including a parody detective series and fantasy stories. During these years, a family friend, [[Macedonio Fern\u00e1ndez]], became a major influence on Borges. The two would preside over discussions in caf\u00e9s, country retreats, or Fernandez's tiny apartment in the [[Balvanera]] district. He appears by name in Borges's ''Dialogue about a Dialogue'',<ref>Borges, Jorge Luis. Trans. Mildred Boyer and Harold Morland. ''Dreamtigers'', University of Texas Press, 1985, p. 25.</ref> in which the two discuss the immortality of the soul. In 1933, Borges gained an editorial appointment at ''Revista Multicolor de los S\u00e1bados'' (the literary supplement of the Buenos Aires newspaper ''Cr\u00edtica''), where he first published the pieces collected as ''Historia universal de la infamia'' (''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]'') in 1935.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nThe book includes two types of writing: the first lies somewhere between non-fictional essays and short stories, using fictional techniques to tell essentially true stories. The second consists of literary forgeries, which Borges initially passed off as translations of passages from famous but seldom-read works. In the following years, he served as a literary adviser for the publishing house [[Emec\u00e9 Editores]], and from 1936-39 wrote weekly columns for ''El Hogar''. In 1938, Borges found work as first assistant at the Miguel Can\u00e9 Municipal Library. It was in a working class area<ref>Boldy (2009) p. 32</ref> and there were so few books that cataloguing more than one hundred books per day, he was told, would leave little to do for the other staff and so look bad. The task took him about an hour each day and the rest of his time he spent in the basement of the library, writing and translating.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:JorgeLuisBorges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Borges in the 1940s]]\nBorges's father died in 1938, shortly before his 64th birthday. On Christmas Eve that year, Borges suffered a severe head injury; during treatment, he nearly died of [[septicemia]]. While recovering from the accident, Borges began playing with a new style of writing for which he would become famous. His first story written after his accident, \"[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote|Pierre Menard, Author of the ''Quixote'']]\", came out in May 1939. One of his most famous works, \"Menard\", examines the nature of authorship, as well as the relationship between an author and his historical context. His first collection of short stories, ''El jard\u00edn de senderos que se bifurcan'' (''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]''), appeared in 1941, composed mostly of works previously published in ''Sur''.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nThe title story concerns a Chinese professor in England, Dr. Yu Tsun, who spies for Germany during World War I, in an attempt to prove to the authorities that an Asian person is able to obtain the information that they seek. A combination of book and maze, it can be read in many ways. Through it, Borges arguably invented the [[hypertext fiction|hypertext]] novel and went on to describe a theory of the universe based upon the structure of such a novel.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Bolter|first1=Jay David|last2=Joyce|first2=Michael|title=Hypertext and Creative Writing|booktitle=Hypertext '87 Papers|year=1987|publisher=ACM|pages=41\u201350|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=317431}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Moulthrop|first=Stuart|editor1-last=Delany|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Landow|editor2-first=George P.|title=Hypermedia and Literary Studies|chapter=Reading From the Map: Metonymy and Metaphor in the Fiction of 'Forking Paths'|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1991|place=Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England}}</ref>\n\nEight stories taking up over sixty pages, the book was generally well received, but ''El jard\u00edn de senderos que se bifurcan'' failed to garner for him the literary prizes many in his circle expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/borges-jorge-luis|title=Borges, Jorge Luis (Vol.32)|publisher=enotes|accessdate=3 December 2008}}</ref><ref>Wardrip-Fruin, Noah & Montfort, Nick (2003).

While Beckett had garnered a distinguished reputation in Europe and America, Borges had been largely unknown and untranslated in the English-speaking world and the prize stirred great interest in his work. The Italian government named Borges ''Commendatore'' and the [[University of Texas at Austin]] appointed him for one year to the Tinker Chair. This led to his first lecture tour in the United States. In 1962, two major anthologies of Borges's writings were published in English by New York presses: ''[[Ficciones]]'' and ''[[Labyrinths]]''. In that year, Borges began lecture tours of Europe.  Numerous honors were to accumulate over the years such as a Special [[Edgar Award|Edgar Allan Poe Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] \"for distinguished contribution to the mystery genre\" (1976),<ref>[http://theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php Edgar Awards]</ref> the [[Balzan Prize]] (for Philology, Linguistics and literary Criticism) and the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]], the [[Cervantes Prize]] (all 1980), as well as the French [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] (1983) and the Diamond [[Konex Award]] for Literature Arts as the most important writer in the last decade in his country.\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|At [[L'H\u00f4tel]], Paris, 1968]]\nIn 1967, Borges began a five-year period of collaboration with the American translator [[Norman Thomas di Giovanni]], through whom he became better known in the English-speaking world.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He continued to publish books, among them ''El libro de los seres imaginarios'' (''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', 1967, co-written with Margarita Guerrero), ''El informe de Brodie'' (''Dr. Brodie's Report'', 1970), and ''El libro de arena'' (''[[The Book of Sand (book)|The Book of Sand]]'', 1975).

In April 1986, a few months before his death, he married her via an attorney in [[Paraguay]], in what was then a common practice among Argentines wishing to circumvent the Argentine laws of the time regarding divorce.

Although calm and collected about his own death, Borges began probing Kodama as to whether she inclined more towards the [[Shinto]] beliefs of her father or the [[Catholicism]] of her mother. Kodama \"had always regarded Borges as an Agnostic, as she was herself\", but given the insistence of his questioning, she offered to call someone more \"qualified\".<ref name=\"Williamson 2004, page 489\">Williamson (2004), p. 489.</ref> Borges responded, \"You are asking me if I want a priest.\" He then instructed her to call two clergymen, a Catholic priest, in memory of his mother, and a Protestant minister, in memory of his English grandmother. He was visited first by Father Pierre Jacquet and by Pastor Edouard de Montmollin.<ref name=\"Williamson 2004, page 489\"/>\n\nBorges died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] on 14 June 1986, aged 86, in Geneva. His burial was preceded by an ecumenical service at the Protestant Cath\u00e9drale de Saint Pierre on 18 June. With many Swiss and Argentine dignitaries present, Pastor de Montmollin read the First Chapter of [[St John's Gospel]]. He then preached that \"Borges was a man who had unceasingly searched for the right word, the term that could sum up the whole, the final meaning of things.\" He explained, however, that no man can reach that word through his own efforts and in trying becomes lost in a labyrinth. Pastor de Montmollin concluded, \"It is not man who discovers the word, it is the Word that comes to him.\"<ref>Williamson (2005), p. 490.</ref>\n\nFather Jacquet also preached, saying that, when visiting Borges before his death, he had found \"a man full of love, who received from the Church the forgiveness of his sins\".<ref>Williamson (2004), p. 490.</ref><ref>[https://www.religionenlibertad.com/movil/articulo_rel.asp?idarticulo=50249]</ref> After the funeral, Borges was laid to rest in Geneva's [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Plainpalais]].

Her assertive administration of his estate resulted in a bitter dispute with the French publisher [[Gallimard]] regarding the republication of the complete works of Borges in French, with [[Pierre Assouline]] in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]'' (August 2006) calling her \"an obstacle to the dissemination of the works of Borges\".

During a 1971 conference at [[Columbia University]], a creative writing student asked Borges what he regarded as \"a writer's duty to his time\". Borges replied, \"I think a writer's duty is to be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings\u2014except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the [[Six-Day War]].

He further recalled that his opposition to [[Marxism]] and [[communism]] was absorbed in his childhood. \"Well, I have been brought up to think that the individual should be strong and the State should be weak. I couldn't be enthusiastic about theories where the State is more important than the individual.\"<ref>Burgin (1968). p. 104.</ref></ref> He labeled himself a ''[[Herbert Spencer|Spencerian]] [[Anarchism|anarchist]]'', following his father.<ref>{{cite book | last = Yudin | first = Florence | title = Nightglow: Borges' Poetics of Blindness|publisher=Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca|location=City|year=1997|isbn=84-7299-385-X|page=31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bell-Villada|first=Gene|title=Borges and His Fiction|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|year=1981|isbn=0-8078-1458-X|page=13}}</ref> After the overthrow via coup d'\u00e9tat of President [[Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n]] in 1955, Borges supported efforts to purge Argentina's Government of Peronists and dismantle the former President's welfare state. He was enraged that the [[Communist Party of Argentina]] opposed these measures and sharply criticized them in lectures and in print. Borges's opposition to the Party in this matter ultimately led to a permanent rift with his longtime lover, Argentine Communist [[Estela Canto]].<ref>Edwin Williamson, ''Borges: A Life'', pp.&nbsp;332\u2013333.</ref>\n\nIn a 1956 interview given to ''El Hogar'', \"[Communists] are in favor of totalitarian regimes and systematically combat freedom of thought, oblivious of the fact that the principal victims of dictatorships are, precisely, intelligence and culture.\"<ref>Williamson (2004), p. 334.</ref>\n\nHe elaborated, \"Many people are in favor of dictatorships because they allow them to avoid thinking for themselves. Everything is presented to them ready-made. There are even agencies of the State that supply them with opinions, passwords, slogans, and even idols to exalt or cast down according to the prevailing wind or in keeping with the directives of the thinking heads of the [[one-party state|single party]].\"<ref>Williamson (2004), pp. 334\u2013335.</ref>\n\nIn later years, Borges frequently expressed contempt for Marxist and Communist authors, poets, and intellectuals. In an interview with Burgin, Borges referred to Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]] as \"a very fine poet\" but a \"very mean man\" for unconditionally supporting the Soviet Union and demonizing the United States. Borges commented about Neruda, \"Now he knows that's rubbish.\"<ref>Burgin (1968) pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\nIn the same interview, Borges also criticized famed Marxist poet and playwright [[Federico Garcia Lorca]], who was abducted by Nationalist soldiers and executed without trial during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In Borges' opinion, Lorca's poetry and plays, when examined against his tragic death, appeared better than they actually were.<ref>Burgin (1969), pages 93-95.</ref>\n\n===Anti-fascism===\nIn 1934, Argentine [[ultra-nationalist]]s, sympathetic to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], asserted Borges was secretly Jewish, and by implication, not a true Argentine. Borges responded with the essay \"Yo, Jud\u00edo\" (\"I, a Jew\"), a reference to the old \"Yo, Argentino\" (\"I, an Argentine\"), a defensive phrase used during [[pogrom]]s of Argentine Jews to make it clear to attackers that an intended victim was not Jewish.<ref Name=\"Humor\">De Costa, Ren\u00e9 (2000) ''Humor in Borges (Humor in Life & Letters)''. Wayne State University Press p. 49 {{ISBN|0-8143-2888-1}}</ref> In the essay he says that he would be proud to be a Jew, with a backhanded reminder that any pure Castilian might be likely to have Jewish ancestry from a millennium ago.<ref Name=\"Humor\"/>\n\nBoth before and during the [[Second World War]], Borges regularly published essays attacking the Nazi police state and its racist ideology. His outrage was fueled by his deep love for [[German literature]]. In an essay published in 1937, Borges attacked the Nazi Party's use of children's books to inflame antisemitism. He wrote, \"I don't know if the world can do without German civilization, but I do know that its corruption by the teachings of hatred is a crime.\"<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', p 200.</ref>\n\nIn a 1938 essay, Borges reviewed an anthology which rewrote German authors of the past to fit the Nazi party line. He was disgusted by what he described as Germany's \"chaotic descent into darkness\" and the attendant rewriting of history. He argued that such books sacrificed the German people's culture, history and integrity in the name of restoring their national honour. Such use of children's books for propaganda he writes, \"perfect the criminal arts of barbarians.\"<ref>''Selected Nonfictions'', p. 201.</ref>\n\nIn a 1944 essay, Borges postulated,{{quote|text=Nazism suffers from unreality, like [[Erigena]]'s hell. It is uninhabitable; men can only die for it, lie for it, wound and kill for it. No one, in the intimate depths of his being, can wish it to triumph. I shall risk this conjecture: ''Hitler wants to be defeated''. Hitler is blindly collaborating with the inevitable armies that will annihilate him, as the metal vultures and the dragon (which must have known that they were monsters) collaborated, mysteriously, with [[Hercules]].\"<ref>Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', p. 211.</ref>}}\n\nIn 1946, Borges published the short story \"[[Deutsches Requiem (short story)|Deutsches Requiem]]\", which masquerades as the last testament of a condemned [[Nazi war criminal]] named Otto Dietrich zur Linde.\n\nIn a 1971 conference at [[Columbia University]], Borges was asked about the story by a student from the creative writing program. He recalled, \"When the Germans were defeated I felt great joy and relief, but at the same time I thought of the German defeat as being somehow tragic, because here we have perhaps the most educated people in Europe,  who have a fine literature, a fine tradition of philosophy and poetry. Yet these people were bamboozled by a madman named [[Adolf Hitler]], and I think there is tragedy there.\"<ref>''Borges on Writing'' (1970), pages 60-61.</ref>\n\nIn a 1967 interview with Burgin, Borges recalled how his interactions with Argentina's Nazi sympathisers led him to create the story. He recalled, \"And then I realized that those people that were on the side of Germany, that they never thought of German victories or the German glory. What they really liked was the idea of the [[Blitzkrieg]], of London being on fire, of the country being destroyed. As to the German fighters, they took no stock in them. Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis. And then I created the ideal Nazi.\"<ref>Burgin (1968), pp 331\u2013332.</ref>\n\nAt Columbia University in 1971, Borges further elaborated on the story's creation, \"I tried to imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this [[archetype]] of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for the fact that there was something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one. They were all feeling sorry for themselves and wanted me to feel sorry for them as well.\"<ref>''Borges on Writing'' (1970), page 61.</ref>\n\n===Anti-Peronism===\nIn 1946, Argentine President [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] began transforming Argentina into a [[one-party state]] with the assistance of his wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n|Evita]]. Almost immediately, the [[spoils system]] was the rule of the day, as ideological critics of the ruling ''[[Partido Justicialista]]'' were fired from government jobs. During this period, Borges was informed that he was being \"promoted\" from his position at the Miguel Can\u00e9 Library to a post as inspector of poultry and rabbits at the Buenos Aires municipal market. Upon demanding to know the reason, Borges was told, \"Well, you were on the side of the Allies, what do you expect?\"<ref>Williamson (2004) p. 292</ref> Borges resigned the following day.\n\nPer\u00f3n's treatment of Borges became a [[wikt:cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre|cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]] for the Argentine intelligentsia. The Argentine Society of Writers (SADE) held a formal dinner in his honour. At the dinner, a speech was read which Borges had written for the occasion. It said:{{quote|text=Dictatorships breed oppression, dictatorships breed servility, dictatorships breed cruelty; more loathsome still is the fact that they breed idiocy. Bellboys babbling orders, portraits of [[caudillo]]s, prearranged cheers or insults, walls covered with names, unanimous ceremonies, mere discipline usurping the place of clear thinking&nbsp;... Fighting these sad monotonies is one of the duties of a writer. Need I remind readers of ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'' or ''[[Don Segundo Sombra|Don Segundo]]'' that individualism is an old Argentine virtue.<ref>Williamson (2004) p. 295</ref>}}\n\nIn the aftermath, Borges found himself much in demand as a lecturer and one of the intellectual leaders of the Argentine opposition. In 1951 he was asked by anti-Peronist friends to run for president of SADE. Borges, then suffering from depression caused by a failed romance, reluctantly accepted. He later recalled that he would awake every morning and remember that Per\u00f3n was President and feel deeply depressed and ashamed.<ref>Williamson (2004) p. 312</ref> Per\u00f3n's government had seized control of the Argentine mass media and regarded SADE with indifference. Borges later recalled, however, \"Many distinguished men of letters did not dare set foot inside its doors.\"<ref Name=\"Williamson313\">Williamson (2004) p. 313</ref> Meanwhile, SADE became an increasing refuge for critics of the regime. SADE official Luisa Mercedes Levinson noted, \"We would gather every week to tell the latest jokes about the ruling couple and even dared to sing the songs of the [[French Resistance]], as well as '[[La Marseillaise]]'\".<ref Name=\"Williamson313\"/>\n\nAfter Evita Per\u00f3n's death on 26 July 1952, Borges received a visit from two policemen, who ordered him to put up two portraits of the ruling couple on the premises of SADE. Borges indignantly refused, calling it a ridiculous demand. The policemen replied that he would soon face the consequences.<ref>Williamson (2004) p. 320.</ref> The Justicialist Party placed Borges under 24-hour surveillance and sent policemen to sit in on his lectures; in September they ordered SADE to be permanently closed down. Like much of the Argentine opposition to Per\u00f3n, SADE had become marginalized due to persecution by the State, and very few active members remained.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAccording to Edwin Williamson,{{quote|text=Borges had agreed to stand for the presidency of the SADE in order [to] fight for intellectual freedom, but he also wanted to avenge the humiliation he believed he had suffered in 1946, when the Peronists had proposed to make him an inspector of chickens. In his letter of 1950 to [[Attilio Rossi]], he claimed that his infamous promotion had been a clever way the Peronists had found of damaging him and diminishing his reputation. The closure of the SADE meant that the Peronists had damaged him a second time, as was borne out by the visit of the Spanish writer [[Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas]], who arrived in Buenos Aires shortly after the closure of the SADE. It was impossible for Borges, as president, to hold the usual reception for the distinguished visitor; instead, one of Borges' friends brought a lamb from his ranch, and they had it roasted at a tavern across the road from the SADE building on Calle Mexico. After dinner, a friendly janitor let them into the premises, and they showed Mar\u00edas around by candlelight. That tiny group of writers leading a foreign guest through a dark building by the light of guttering candles was vivid proof of the extent to which the SADE had been diminished under the rule of Juan Per\u00f3n.<ref>Williamson (2004) pp. 320\u201321.</ref>}}\n\nOn 16 September 1955, General [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]]'s ''[[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora]]'' toppled the ruling party and forced Per\u00f3n into exile. Borges was overjoyed and joined demonstrators marching through the streets of Buenos Aires. According to Williamson, Borges shouted, \"Viva la Patria\", until his voice grew hoarse. Due to the influence of Borges' mother and his own role on the opposition to Peron, the provisional government appointed Borges as the Director of the [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|National Library]].<ref>{{es icon}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416034854/http://www.bibnal.edu.ar/paginas/galeriadirec.htm#borges|date=16 April 2008|title=Jorge Luis Borges.

(archived from the [http://www.bibnal.edu.ar/paginas/galeriadirec.htm#borges original], on 16 April 2008.)</ref>\n\nIn his essay ''L'Illusion Comique'', Borges wrote there were two histories of Peronism in Argentina. The first he described as \"the criminal one\", composed of the [[police state]] tactics used against both real and imagined anti-Peronists. The second history was, according to Borges, \"the theatrical one\" composed of \"tales and fables made for consumption by dolts.\" He argued that, despite their claims to detest capitalism, Juan and Eva Per\u00f3n \"copied its methods, dictating names and slogans to the people\" in the same way that multi-national corporations \"impose their razor blades, cigarettes, and washing machines.\" Borges then listed the numerous [[conspiracy theories]] the ruling couple dictated to their followers and how those theories were accepted without question.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', pp. 409\u201310.</ref>\n\nBorges concluded:{{quote|text=It is useless to list the examples; one can only denounce the duplicity of the fictions of the former regime, which can't be believed and were believed. It will be said that the public's lack of sophistication is enough to explain the contradiction; I believe that the cause is more profound. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] spoke of the \"willing [[suspension of disbelief]],\" that is, poetic faith; [[Samuel Johnson]] said, in defense of Shakespeare, that the spectators at a tragedy do not believe they are in [[Alexandria]] in the first act and Rome in the second but submit to the pleasure of a fiction. Similarly, the lies of a dictatorship are neither believed nor disbelieved; they pertain to an intermediate plane, and their purpose is to conceal or justify sordid or atrocious realities. They pertain to the pathetic or the clumsily sentimental. Happily, for the enlightenment and security of the Argentines, the current regime has understood that the function of government is not to inspire pathos.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''Selected Nonfictions'', p. 410.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1967 interview, Borges said, \"Per\u00f3n was a humbug, and he knew it, and everybody knew it. But Per\u00f3n could be very cruel. I mean, he had people tortured, killed. And his wife was a common prostitute.\"<ref>Burgin (1969), p. 121</ref>\n\nWhen Per\u00f3n returned from exile in 1973 and regained the Presidency, Borges was enraged. In a 1975 interview for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', he said \"Damn, the snobs are back in the saddle. If their posters and slogans again defile the city, I'll be glad I've lost my sight. Well, they can't humiliate me as they did before my books sold well.\"<ref Name=\"Natgeo303\">''National Geographic'', p. 303. (March 1975).</ref>\n\nAfter being accused of being unforgiving, Borges quipped, \"I resented Per\u00f3n's making Argentina look ridiculous to the world&nbsp;... as in 1951, when he announced control over [[thermonuclear fusion]], which still hasn't happened anywhere but in the sun and the stars. For a time, Argentines hesitated to wear band aids for fear friends would ask, 'Did the atomic bomb go off in your hand?' A shame, because Argentina really has world-class scientists.\"<ref Name=\"Natgeo303\"/>\n\nAfter Borges' death in 1986, the Peronist ''[[Partido Justicialista]]'' declined to send a delegate to the writer's memorial service in Buenos Aires. A spokesman for the Party said that this was in reaction to \"certain declarations he had made about the country.\"<ref Name=\"William491\">Williamson (2004), p. 491</ref> Later, at the City Council of Buenos Aires, Peronist politicians refused to honor Borges as an Argentine, commenting that he \"chose to die abroad.\" When infuriated politicians from the other parties demanded to know the real reason, the Peronists finally explained that Borges had made statements about Evita Per\u00f3n which they called \"unacceptable\".<ref Name=\"William491\"/>\n\n===Military junta===\nDuring the 1970s, Borges at first expressed support for Argentina's [[military junta]], but was scandalized by the junta's actions during the [[Dirty War]]. In protest against their support of the regime, Borges ceased publishing in the newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]''.<ref>[[Willis Barnstone]], ''With Borges on an Ordinary Evening in Buenos Aires'', [[University of Illinois]] Press, 1993, pp. 30\u201331.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn 1985, he wrote a short poem about the [[Falklands War]] called ''Juan L\u00f3pez y John Ward'', about two fictional soldiers (one from each side), who died in the Falklands, in which he refers to \"islands that were too famous\". He also said about the war: \"The Falklands thing was a fight between two bald men over a comb.\"<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/19/falkland-islands-editorial Falkland Islands: Imperial pride], theguardian.com, 19 February 2010.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n{{Main article|Jorge Luis Borges bibliography}}\n[[Noah Wardrip-Fruin|Wardrip-Fruin]] and [[Nick Montfort|Montfort]] argue that Borges \"may have been the most important figure in Spanish-language literature since [[Cervantes]].

(2003). ''The New Media Reader'', Cambridge: The MIT Press, p. 29; {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to short stories for which he is most noted, Borges also wrote poetry, essays, screenplays, literary criticism, and edited numerous anthologies. His longest work of fiction is a fourteen-page story, \"The Congress\", first published in 1971.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/> His late-onset blindness strongly influenced his later writing. Borges wrote: \"When I think of what I've lost, I ask, 'Who know themselves better than the blind?' \u2013 for every thought becomes a tool.\"<ref>Borges, Jorge Luis. (1994) ''Siete Noches''.

As his eyesight waned (it came and went, with a struggle between advancing age and advances in eye surgery), he increasingly focused on writing poetry, since he could memorize an entire work in progress.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/31/reviews/borges-brodie.html \"The Other Borges Than the Central One\"], nytimes.com; accessed 1 April 2016.\n</ref>\n\nHis poems embrace the same wide range of interests as his fiction, along with issues that emerge in his critical works and translations, and from more personal musings. For example, his interest in [[idealism]] runs through his work, reflected in the fictional world of Tl\u00f6n in \"[[Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]\" and in his essay \"[[A New Refutation of Time]]\".<ref>Kate Jenckes, ''Reading Borges After Benjamin: Allegory, Afterlife, and the Writing of History'' (2008), SUNY Press, pp. 101, 117, 136; {{ISBN|9780791469903}}</ref> It also appears as a theme in \"[[On Exactitude in Science]]\" and in his poems \"Things\" and \"[[El Golem]]\" (\"The Golem\") and his story \"[[The Circular Ruins]]\".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nBorges was a notable translator. He translated works of literature in English, French, German, [[Old English language|Old English]], and [[Old Norse]] into Spanish. His first publication, for a Buenos Aires newspaper, was a translation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s story \"[[The Happy Prince and Other Stories|The Happy Prince]]\" into Spanish when he was nine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kristal|first=Efra\u00edn|title=Invisible Work|publisher=Vanderbilt University Press|location=Nashville, TN|year=2002|isbn=0-8265-1408-1|page=37}}</ref> At the end of his life he produced a Spanish-language version of a part of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Prose Edda]]''. He also translated (while simultaneously subtly transforming) the works of, among others, [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Walt Whitman]], and [[Virginia Woolf]].<ref group='Notes' name='c'>Notable translations also include work by [[Herman Melville|Melville]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]], Sir [[Thomas Browne]], and [[G. K. Chesterton]].</ref> Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation, holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges, ''This Craft of Verse'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2000. pp. 57\u201376. ''Word Music and Translation'', Lecture, Delivered 28 February 1968.</ref> Borges employed the devices of literary forgery and the review of an imaginary work, both forms of modern [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudo-epigrapha]].\n\n===Hoaxes and forgeries===\nBorges's best-known set of [[Literary forgery|literary forgeries]] date from his early work as a translator and literary critic with a regular column in the Argentine magazine ''El Hogar''. Along with publishing numerous legitimate translations, he also published original works, for example, in the style of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]<ref group='Notes' name='d'/> or '' [[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', originally claiming them to be translations of works he had chanced upon.  In another case, he added three short, falsely attributed pieces into his otherwise legitimate and carefully researched anthology ''El matrero''.<ref group='Notes' name='d'/> Several of these are gathered in the ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]''.\n\nWhile Borges was the great popularizer of the review of an imaginary work, he had developed the idea from [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'', a book-length review of a non-existent German [[transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In ''This Craft of Verse'', Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva \"[I] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read ''[[Sartor Resartus]]'', and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart.\"<ref>Borges ''This Craft of Verse'' (p. 104)</ref>\n\nIn the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, ''The Garden of Forking Paths'', Borges remarks, \"It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.\" He then cites both ''Sartor Resartus'' and [[Samuel \"Erewhon\" Butler|Samuel Butler]]'s ''The Fair Haven'', remarking, however, that \"those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write ''notes'' on imaginary books.\"<ref>Borges ''Collected Fictions'', p67</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Borges was wrongly attributed some works, like the poem [[Moments (poem)|\"Instantes\"]].<ref>[http://www.borges.pitt.edu/bsol/iainst.php University of Pittsburgh, Borges Center] ''Jorge Luis Borges, autor del poema \"Instantes\"'', by Iv\u00e1n Almeida.

In the post-Peronist Argentina of the early 1960s, ''Contorno'' met with wide approval from the youth who challenged the authenticity of older writers such as Borges and questioned their legacy of experimentation.

Williamson writes, \"His basic contention was that fiction did not depend on the illusion of reality; what mattered ultimately was an author's ability to generate \"poetic faith\" in his reader.\"<ref Name=\"LRB\"/>\n\nHis stories often have fantastical themes, such as a library containing every possible 410-page text (\"[[The Library of Babel]]\"), a man who [[Eidetic memory|forgets nothing]] he experiences (\"[[Funes, the Memorious]]\"), an artifact through which the user can see everything in the universe (\"The Aleph\"), and a year of still time given to a man standing before a firing squad (\"The Secret Miracle\"). Borges told realistic stories of South American life, of folk heroes, streetfighters, soldiers, [[gaucho]]s, detectives, and historical figures. He mixed the real and the fantastic, fact with fiction. His interest in compounding fantasy, philosophy, and the art of translation are evident in articles such as \"The Translators of ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights''\". In the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', a thoroughly researched [[bestiary]] of mythical creatures, Borges wrote, \"There is a kind of lazy pleasure in useless and out-of-the-way erudition.\"<ref Name=\"Beings\">Borges, Luis Borges (1979) ''Book of Imaginary Beings'' Penguin Books Australia, p. 11; {{ISBN|0-525-47538-9}}</ref> Borges's interest in fantasy was shared by Bioy Casares, with whom he coauthored several collections of tales between 1942 and 1967.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOften, especially early in his career, the mixture of fact and fantasy crossed the line into the realm of hoax or literary forgery.<ref group='Notes' name='d'>His imitations of Swedenborg and others were originally passed off as translations, in his literary column in ''Cr\u00edtica''. \"El te\u00f3logo\" was originally published with the note \"Lo anterior&nbsp;... es obra de Manuel Swedenborg, eminente ingeniero y hombre de ciencia, que durante 27 a\u00f1os estuvo en comercio l\u00facido y familiar con el otro mundo.\" (\"The preceding [...] is the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, eminent engineer and man of science, who during 27 years was in lucid and familiar commerce with the other world.\") See \"Borges y Revista multicolor de los s\u00e1bados: confabulados en una escritura de la infamia\" by Raquel Atena Green, ''Wor(l)ds of Change: Latin American and Iberian Literature'', volume 32, (2010) Peter Lang Publishing; {{ISBN|978-0-8204-3467-4}}</ref>\n\n\"The Garden of Forking Paths\" (1941) presents the idea of forking paths through networks of time, none of which is the same, all of which are equal.

After reviewing works that were written before those of Kafka, Borges wrote:{{quote|text=If I am not mistaken, the heterogeneous pieces I have enumerated resemble Kafka; if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other. The second fact is the more significant. In each of these texts we find Kafka's idiosyncrasy to a greater or lesser degree, but if Kafka had never written a line, we would not perceive this quality; in other words, it would not exist. The poem [[s:Fears and Scruples|\"Fears and Scruples\"]] by [[Robert Browning|Browning]] foretells Kafka's work, but our reading of Kafka perceptibly sharpens and deflects our reading of the poem. Browning did not read it as we do now. In the critics' vocabulary, the word 'precursor' is indispensable, but it should be cleansed of all connotation of polemics or rivalry. The fact is that every writer creates his own precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Labyrinths: Selected Stories & Other Writings|author=Jorge Luis Borges|page=201|date=1988|publisher=New Direction Books}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>}}\n\n==Culture and Argentine literature==\n===''Mart\u00edn Fierro'' and Argentine tradition===\n{{main article|Borges on Mart\u00edn Fierro}}\n[[File:Borges 001.JPG|thumb|right|Borges in 1976]]\nAlong with other young Argentine writers of his generation, Borges initially rallied around the fictional character of Mart\u00edn Fierro. ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]'', a poem by [[Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez (writer)|Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez]], was a dominant work of 19th century [[Argentine literature]].Its eponymous hero became a symbol of Argentine sensibility, untied from European values \u2013 a [[gaucho]], free, poor, ''[[pampas]]''-dwelling.<ref Name=\"Irreverence\"/>\n\nThe character Fierro is illegally drafted to serve at a border fort to defend it against the indigenous population but ultimately deserts to become a ''gaucho matrero'', the Argentine equivalent of a North American western outlaw. Borges contributed keenly to the avant garde ''[[Mart\u00edn Fierro (magazine)|Mart\u00edn Fierro magazine]]'' in the early 1920s.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAs Borges matured, he came to a more nuanced attitude toward the Hern\u00e1ndez poem. In his book of essays on the poem, Borges separates his admiration for the aesthetic virtues of the work from his mixed opinion of the moral virtues of its protagonist.<ref>Borges and Guerrero (1953) ''El \"Mart\u00edn Fierro'' {{ISBN|84-206-1933-7}}</ref> In his essay \"The Argentine Writer and Tradition\" (1951), Borges celebrates how Hern\u00e1ndez expresses the Argentine character. In a key scene in the poem, Mart\u00edn Fierro and El Moreno compete by improvising songs on universal themes such as time, night, and the sea, reflecting the real-world gaucho tradition of ''payadas'', improvised musical dialogues on philosophical themes.<ref Name=\"Irreverence\">Gabriel Waisman, Sergio (2005) ''Borges and Translation: The Irreverence of the Periphery'', Bucknell University Press, pp. 126\u201329; {{ISBN|0-8387-5592-5}}</ref><ref Name=\"Argentine\">Borges, Jorge Luis and Lanuza, Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez (1961) \"The Argentine writer and tradition\" Latin American and European Literary Society</ref> Borges points out that Hern\u00e1ndez evidently knew the difference between actual gaucho tradition of composing poetry versus the \"gauchesque\" fashion among Buenos Aires literati.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn his works he refutes the arch-nationalist interpreters of the poem and disdains others, such as critic Eleuterio Tiscornia, for their Europeanising approach. Borges denies that Argentine literature should distinguish itself by limiting itself to \"local colour\", which he equates with cultural nationalism.<ref Name=\"Argentine\"/> [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Shakespeare]]'s work, he says, looked beyond their countries' borders. Neither, he argues, need the literature be bound to the heritage of old world Spanish or European tradition. Nor should it define itself by the conscious rejection of its colonial past. He asserts that Argentine writers need to be free to define Argentine literature anew, writing about Argentina and the world from the point of view of those who have inherited the whole of world literature.<ref Name=\"Argentine\"/> Williamson says \"Borges's main argument is that the very fact of writing from the margins provides Argentine writers with a special opportunity to innovate without being bound to the canons of the centre,&nbsp;... at once a part of and apart from the centre, which gives them much potential freedom\".<ref Name=\"Irreverence\"/>\n\n===Argentine culture===\nBorges focused on universal themes, but also composed a substantial body of literature on themes from Argentine folklore and history. His first book, the poetry collection ''Fervor de Buenos Aires'' (''Passion for Buenos Aires''), appeared in 1923. Borges's writings on things Argentine, include Argentine culture (\"History of the Tango\"; \"Inscriptions on Horse Wagons\"), folklore (\"Juan Mura\u00f1a\", \"Night of the Gifts\"), literature (\"The Argentine Writer and Tradition\", \"Almafuerte\"; \"[[Evaristo Carriego]]\"), and national concerns (\"Celebration of the Monster\", \"Hurry, Hurry\", \"The Mountebank\", \"Pedro Salvadores\"). Ultranationalists, however, continued to question his Argentine identity.<ref Name=\"Butterflies\"/>\n\nBorges's interest in Argentine themes reflects, in part, the inspiration of his family tree. Borges had an English paternal grandmother who, around 1870, married the ''criollo'' Francisco Borges, a man with a military command and a historic role in the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] in what is now Argentina and [[Uruguay]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nSpurred by pride in his family's heritage, Borges often used those civil wars as settings in fiction and quasi-fiction (for example, \"The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz,\" \"The Dead Man,\" \"Avelino Arredondo\") as well as poetry (\"General Quiroga Rides to His Death in a Carriage\"). Borges's maternal great-grandfather, [[Manuel Isidoro Su\u00e1rez]], was another military hero, whom Borges immortalized in the poem \"A Page to Commemorate Colonel Su\u00e1rez, Victor at Jun\u00edn\".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nHis non-fiction explores many of the themes found in his fiction. Essays such as \"The History of the [[Tango (dance)|Tango]]\" or his writings on the epic poem \"[[Mart\u00edn Fierro]]\" explore Argentine themes, such as the identity of the Argentine people and of various Argentine subcultures. The varying genealogies of characters, settings, and themes in his stories, such as \"La muerte y la br\u00fajula\", used Argentine models without pandering to his readers or framing Argentine culture as \"exotic\".<ref Name=\"Butterflies\"/>\n\nIn fact, contrary to what is usually supposed, the geographies found in his fictions often do not correspond to those of real-world Argentina.<ref>David Boruchoff (1985), \"In Pursuit of the Detective Genre: \u2018La muerte y la br\u00fajula\u2019 of Jorge Luis Borges,\" ''Inti: Revista de Literatura Hisp\u00e1nica'' no. 21, pp. 13\u201326.</ref> In his essay \"El escritor argentino y la tradici\u00f3n\", Borges notes that the very absence of camels in the [[Qur'an]] was proof enough that it was an [[Arabs|Arabian]] work (despite the fact that camels are, in fact, mentioned in the Qur'an). He suggested that only someone trying to write an \"Arab\" work would purposefully include a camel.<ref Name=\"Butterflies\">Takolander, Maria, (2007) ''Catching butterflies: bringing magical realism to ground'' Peter Lang Pub Inc pp. 55\u201360; {{ISBN|3-03911-193-0}}</ref> He uses this example to illustrate how his dialogue with universal existential concerns was just as Argentine as writing about gauchos and tangos.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Multicultural influences===\nAt the time of the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816, the population was predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' (of Spanish ancestry). From the mid-1850s on waves of immigration from Europe, especially Italy and Spain, arrived in the country, and in the following decades the Argentine national identity diversified.<ref Name=\"LRB\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1990/1/90.01.06.x.html|title=Velez, Wanda (1990) \"South American Immigration: Argentina\"|publisher=Yale.edu|accessdate=24 August 2011}}</ref> Borges was writing in a strongly European literary context, immersed in Spanish, English, French, German, Italian, [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] literature.

As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in [[Geneva]] where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism.<ref Name=\"Butterflies\"/> Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book ''Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi'' (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and ''[[Death and the Compass]]''. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist [[Alfonso Reyes]] to be \"the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time.\"<ref>Borges, ''Siete Noches'', p. 156</ref>\n\nBorges was also an admirer of some Oriental culture, e.g. the ancient Chinese board game of [[Go (game)|Go]], about which he penned some verses,<ref>{{cite web|title=El Go|url=http://gobase.org/reading/stories/?id=12|publisher=GoBase|accessdate=26 August 2011}}</ref> while [[The Garden of Forking Paths]] had a strong oriental theme.\n\n==Influences==\n\n===Modernism===\n[[File:Plaque Jorge Luis Borges, 13 rue des Beaux-Arts, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|left|Plaque, 13 rue des Beaux-Arts, Paris]]\n\nBorges was rooted in the [[Literary modernism|Modernism]] predominant in its early years and was influenced by [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3726707|last=Britton|first=R|date=July 1979|title=History, Myth, and Archetype in Borges's View of Argentina|journal=The Modern Language Review|publisher=Modern Humanities Research Association|volume=74|issue=3|pages=607\u201316|jstor=3726707}}</ref> Like [[Vladimir Nabokov]] and [[James Joyce]], he combined an interest in his native culture with broader perspectives, also sharing their multilingualism and inventiveness with language. However, while Nabokov and Joyce tended toward progressively larger works, Borges remained a miniaturist. His work progressed ''away'' from what he referred to as \"the baroque\": his later style is far more transparent and naturalistic than his earlier works. Borges represented the humanist view of media that stressed the social aspect of art driven by emotion. If art represented the tool, then Borges was more interested in how the tool could be used to relate to people.<ref Name=\"Media\"/>\n\n[[Existentialism]] saw its apogee during the years of Borges's greatest artistic production. It has been argued that his choice of topics largely ignored existentialism's central tenets. Critic [[Paul de Man]] notes, \"Whatever Borges's existential anxieties may be, they have little in common with Sartre's robustly prosaic view of literature, with the earnestness of Camus' moralism, or with the weighty profundity of German existential thought. Rather, they are the consistent expansion of a purely poetic consciousness to its furthest limits.\"<ref>de Man, Paul. \"A Modern Master\", ''Jorge Luis Borges'', Ed.

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism.<ref>Grundy (2014), 195\u2013197</ref>{{efn|Oliver MacDonagh says that ''Sense and Sensibility'' \"may well be the first English realistic novel\" based on its detailed and accurate portrayal of what he calls \"getting and spending\" in an English gentry family.<ref name=\"MacDonagh 1991, 65, 136\u2013137\">MacDonagh (1991), 65, 136\u2013137.</ref>}} Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among critics, scholars, and popular audiences alike.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|page=2|isbn=1421422824}}</ref>\n\nWith the publications of ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811),  ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'' (1814) and ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'' (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'' and ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled ''[[Sanditon]]'', but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript, a short [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Lady Susan]]'', and another unfinished novel, ''[[The Watsons]]''. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Looser|first=Devoney|title=The Making of Jane Austen|location=Baltimore, MD|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2017|isbn=1421422824}}</ref> They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' to more recent productions like ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), ''[[Emma (1996 theatrical film)|Emma]]'' (1996), ''[[Mansfield Park (film)|Mansfield Park]]'' (1999), ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005), and  ''[[Love & Friendship]]'' (2016).\n\n==Biographical sources==\n[[File:Letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra, 1799 June 11. Page 4 (NLA).tiff|thumb|upright=.91|Last page of letter from Austen to her sister, Cassandra, 11 June 1799]]\nThere is little biographical information about Jane Austen's life except the few letters that survive and the biographical notes her family members wrote.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff>Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref> During her lifetime, Austen wrote approximately 3,000 letters but only about 160 survived.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 33</ref> Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister [[Cassandra Austen|Cassandra]], who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly, Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbours or family members\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 270; Nokes (1998), 1; Le Faye (2005), 33</ref>{{efn| Important details about the Austen family were almost certainly elided by intention, such as mention of Austen's brother George, whose undiagnosed developmental challenges led the family to send him away from home; the two brothers sent away to the navy at an early age; or mention of the sisters' wealthy Aunt Leigh-Perrot, arrested and tried on charges of larceny.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\">Nokes (1998), 1\u20132; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134</ref>}} Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little to work with.<ref name=\"Nokes 1998 1 2 Fergus 2005 3 4\"/>\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral [[Francis Austen]], destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be {{cl-span|elided|date=February 2018|reason= what?}} or embellished in her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'', published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography ''Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters'', published in 1913.<ref>Nokes (1998), 2\u20134; Fergus (2005), 3\u20134; Le Faye (2004), 279</ref> The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life.<ref name=Fergus(2005)3ff/> Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family\".<ref>Fergus (2005), 4</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Life==\n{{further|Timeline of Jane Austen}}\n\n===Family===\nJane Austen was born in [[Steventon, Hampshire]], on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\".<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27; Nokes (1998), 51</ref> The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 27</ref>\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731\u20131805) served as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[parish]]es at Steventon and at nearby [[Deane, Hampshire|Deane]].<ref>Todd (2015), 2</ref>{{efn|Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families.<ref>Collins (1994), 86</ref>}} He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were  orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered [[St John's College, Oxford]] on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739\u20131827).<ref>Le Faye (2004), 3\u20135, 11</ref> She came from the prominent [[Baron Leigh|Leigh]] family; her father was rector at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he [[Name change#Historical usage|change his name]] to Leigh-Perrot.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 8; Nokes (1998), 51</ref>\n\n[[File:Chawton Church, Steventon, Hampshire.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.20|[[Steventon, Hampshire|Steventon]] Church, as depicted in ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]''<ref name=\"Le Faye 2004 20\">Le Faye (2004), 20</ref>]]\n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11</ref> George received the [[Benefice|living]] for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 6</ref> Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at [[Church of St Swithin, Bath|St Swithin's Church]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 11; Nokes (1998), 24, 26</ref>\n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small ''per annum'' living; Cassandra brought to the marriage the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death.<ref>Le Faye (2004), 12; Nokes (1998), 24</ref> The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations.

Austen biographer [[Claire Tomalin]] describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n<blockquote style=\"border-left: 3px solid #ccc;\">\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration dramatists]] who may have provided some of her inspiration&nbsp;...

He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a [[barrister]]. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved.

However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him.<ref name = \"halperin721\"/> The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xviii; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 112\u2013120, 159; Honan (1987), 105\u2013111.</ref> In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.<ref name = \"halperin722\">Halperin (1985), 722</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Early manuscripts (1796\u20131798)===\nAfter finishing ''Lady Susan'', Austen began her first full-length novel ''Elinor and Marianne''. Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]''.<ref>Sutherland (2005), 16\u201318; LeFaye (2014), xviii; Tomalin (1997), 107, 120, 154, 208.</ref>\n\nAusten began a second novel, ''First Impressions'' (later published as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''), in 1796.

As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive \u2013 he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance.<ref>Le Faye (2014), xxi; Fergus (2005), 7\u20138; Tomalin (1997), 178\u2013181; Honan (1987), 189\u2013198.</ref> No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal.<ref>Le Faye (2005), 51.</ref> Irvine described Bigg-Wither as a somebody who \"...seems to have been a man very hard to like, let alone love\".<ref>Irvine (2005), 3</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him.

Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the \u00a310 he had paid her and find another publisher.

Through her brother Henry, the publisher [[Thomas Egerton (publisher)|Thomas Egerton]] agreed to publish ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', which, like all of Jane Austen's novels except ''Pride and Prejudice'', was published \"on commission\", that is, at the author's financial risk. When publishing on commission, publishers would advance the costs of publication, repay themselves as books were sold and then charge a 10% commission for each book sold, paying the rest to the author. If a novel did not recover its costs through sales, the author was responsible for them.<ref>Fergus (2014), 6; Raven (2005), 198; Honan (1987), 285\u2013286.</ref> The alternative to selling via commission was the selling the copyright, where an author received a one-time payment from the publisher for the manuscript, which occurred with ''Pride and Prejudice''.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\">Irvine, 2005 13.</ref> Austen's experience with ''Susan'' (the manuscript that became ''Northanger Abbey'') where she sold the copyright to the publisher Crosby & Sons for \u00a310, who did not publish the book, forcing her to buy back the copyright in order to get her work published, left Austen leery of this method of publishing.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>  The final alternative, of selling by subscription, where a group of people would agree to buy a book in advance, was not an option for Austen as only authors who were well known or had an influential aristocratic patron who would recommend an up-coming book to their friends, could sell by subscription.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 13\"/>  ''Sense and Sensibility'' appeared in October 1811, and was described as being written \"By a Lady\".<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> As it was sold on commission, Egerton used expensive paper and set the price at 15 shillings.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/>\n\n[[File:SenseAndSensibilityTitlePage.jpg|left|upright=.85|thumb|First edition title page from ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'', Austen's first published novel (1811)]]\nReviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers;<ref name=\"Honan 1987, 289\u2013290\">Honan (1987), 289\u2013290.</ref> the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's novels were published in larger editions than was normal for this period. The small size of the novel-reading public and the large costs associated with hand production (particularly the cost of handmade paper) meant that most novels were published in editions of 500 copies or less to reduce the risks to the publisher and the novelist. Even some of the most successful titles during this period were issued in editions of not more than 750 or 800 copies and later reprinted if demand continued. Austen's novels were published in larger editions, ranging from about 750 copies of ''Sense and Sensibility'' to about 2,000 copies of ''Emma''. It is not clear whether the decision to print more copies than usual of Austen's novels was driven by the publishers or the author. Since all but one of Austen's books were originally published \"on commission\", the risks of overproduction were largely hers (or Cassandra's after her death) and publishers may have been more willing to produce larger editions than was normal practice when their own funds were at risk. Editions of popular works of non-fiction were often much larger.<ref>For more information and a discussion of the economics of book publishing during this period, see Fergus (2014), 6\u20137, and Raven (2005), 196\u2013203.</ref>\n\nAusten made \u00a3140 from ''Sense and Sensibility'',<ref>Irvine (2005) p.15</ref>  which provided her with some financial and psychological independence.<ref>Honan (1987), 290, Tomalin (1997), 218.</ref> After the success of ''Sense and Sensibility'', all of Austen's subsequent books were billed as written \"By the author of ''Sense and Sensibility''\" and Austen's name never appeared on her books during her lifetime.<ref name=\"Irvine, 2005 15\"/> Egerton then published ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', a revision of ''First Impressions'', in January 1813.

However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as [[Homer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.<ref>Waldron (2005), 89\u201390; Duffy (1986), 97; Watt (1963), 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Pickering - Greatbatch - Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice - She then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.jpg|thumb|upright=.80|left|One of the first two published illustrations of ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'', from the [[Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley]] edition.<ref>Gilson (2005), 127.</ref> Caption reads: \"She then told him [Mr Bennett] what Mr Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia.

Walton \"Recollecting Jane Austen\" pages 669\u2013682 from ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 1, No. 3, March 1975 page 672.</ref>  Though Scott was positive, Austen's work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic zeitgeist.<ref name=\"Litz, A pages 669\"/> Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold at a steady rate, but they were not bestsellers.<ref>Johnson (2014), 232; Gilson (2005), 127.</ref> The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was [[Philar\u00e8te Chasles]] who completely dismissed her as a writer, giving her two sentences in an 1842 essay on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, calling her a boring, imitative writer who wrote nothing of substance.<ref name=\"auto\">King, Noel \"Jane Austen in France\" from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' pages 1\u201328, Vol. 8, No. 1, June 1953 page 23.</ref> Apart from Chasles, Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAusten had many admiring readers in the 19th century, who considered themselves part of a literary elite. Philosopher and literary critic [[George Henry Lewes]] expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s.<ref>Southam (1968), 152; Southam (1987), 20\u201321.</ref> This theme continued later in the century with novelist [[Henry James]], who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], and [[Henry Fielding]] as among \"the fine painters of life\".<ref>Southam (1987), 70.</ref>\n\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the ''Memoir'' spurred the reissue of Austen's novels \u2013 the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed.<ref>Southam (1987), 58\u201362.</ref> Author and critic [[Leslie Stephen]] described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". In 1878, the French critic L\u00e9on Boucher published the essay ''Le Roman Classique en Angleterre'', where he called Austen a \"genius\", which was the first time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen.<ref name=\"auto1\">King, Noel \"Jane Austen in France\" from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' pages 1\u201328, Vol. 8, No. 1, June 1953 page 24.</ref> The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when [[F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on]] translated ''Northanger Abbey'' into French as ''Catherine Moreland''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as ''[[Janeite]]s'' in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\".<ref>Southam (1987), 46\u201347, 230 (for the quote from James); Johnson (2014), 234.</ref> The American literary critic [[A. Walton Litz]] noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relatively untouched\".<ref>Litz, A.

The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University.<ref>Devoney Looser, The Making of Jane Austen (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), 185\u2013196.</ref> The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar [[A. C. Bradley]].<ref>Trott (2005), 92.</ref> In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today.<ref>Southam (1987), 79.</ref> The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was ''Jane Austen'' by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The same year, L\u00e9onie Villard published ''Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres'', which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.<ref>Southam (1987), 99\u2013100; see also Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Gilson (2005), 149\u201350; Johnson (2014), 239.</ref>\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of [[Mary Lascelles (literary scholar)|Mary Lascelles's]] ''Jane Austen and Her Art'', the academic study of Austen took hold.<ref>Southam (1987), 107\u2013109, 124.</ref> Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.<ref>Southam (1986), 108; Watt (1963), 10\u201311; Stovel (2014), 248; Southam (1987), 127</ref>\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including [[feminist theory]], and perhaps most controversially, [[postcolonialism|postcolonial theory]]. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern [[Janeite]]s, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably.<ref>Rajan (2005), 101\u2013110</ref> After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pages 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 page 210.</ref> As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966\u201369, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pages 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 page 212.</ref> In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes.<ref>Zhu Hong \"Nineteenth-Century British Fiction in New China: A Brief Report\" pages 207\u2013213 from ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'', Volume 37, No. 2. September 1982 page 213.</ref> A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative.<ref name=\"Koppel\">{{cite web\n  | last =  Koppel\n  | first = Gene\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Pride and Prejudice: Conservative or Liberal Novel \u2013 Or Both?

June contains the [[summer solstice]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], the day with the most daylight hours, and the [[winter solstice]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], the day with the fewest daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases). June in the Northern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent to [[December]] in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. In the Northern Hemisphere, the beginning of the traditional astronomical [[summer]] is 21 June (meteorological summer begins on 1 June). In the Southern Hemisphere, meteorological winter begins on 1 June.<ref>''Holidays and Lore, Spells, Rituals and Meditations'' {{ISBN|978-0-738-72159-0}} p. 111</ref>\n\nAt the start of June, the sun rises in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]; at the end of June, the sun rises in the constellation of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]]. However, due to the [[precession]] of the equinoxes, June begins with the sun in the [[astrology|astrological]] sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], and ends with the sun in the [[astrological sign]] of [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Etymology and history==\n[[File:Flaming_June,_by_Frederic_Lord_Leighton_(1830-1896).jpg|thumb|''[[Flaming June]]'' (1895) by Lord Leighton]]\nThe [[Latin]] name for June is ''[[Iunius (month)|Junius]]''. [[Ovid]] offers multiple etymologies for the name in the ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', a poem about the [[Roman calendar]]. The first is that the month is named after the [[List of Roman deities|Roman goddess]] [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], the goddess of marriage and the wife of the supreme deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]];  the second is that the name comes from the Latin word ''iuniores'', meaning \"younger ones\", as opposed to ''maiores'' (\"elders\") for which the preceding month May ''([[Maius]])'' may be named.<ref>Ovid, ''Fasti'' VI.1\u201388; [[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), p. 126.</ref>\nAnother source claims June is named after [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], founder of the roman Republic and ancestor of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Junia (gens)|gens Junia]] <ref>Almanach g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Saint-Domingue, pour l'ann\u00e9e 1790, http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1203334d/f27, Mozard, p. 13, 1791 </ref>.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the period from mid-May through mid-June was considered inauspicious for marriage. Ovid says that he consulted the [[Flaminica Dialis]], the high priestess of Jupiter, about setting a date for his daughter's wedding, and was advised to wait till after June 15.<ref>Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies'', p. 126.</ref> [[Plutarch]], however, implies that the entire month of June was more favorable for weddings than May.<ref>Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 47.</ref>\n\nCertain [[meteor showers]] take place in June. The [[Arietids]]  takes place May 22 to July 2 each year, and peaks on June 7. The [[Beta Taurids]] June 5 to July 18. The [[June Bootids]] take place roughly between 26 June and 2 July each year.\n\n===Ancient Roman observances===\nUnder the calendar of ancient Rome, the festival of [[Rosalia (festival)#Military Rosaliae|Ludi Fabarici]] took place on May 29 \u2013 June 1, [[Rosalia (festival)#Military Rosaliae|Kalendae Fabariae]] took place on June 1, the [[Bellona (goddess)|Festival to Bellona]] took place on June 3, [[Ludi Piscatorii]] took place on June 7, and [[Vestalia]] took place from June 7 \u2013 June 15. A [[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]] was held on June 20. The [[Secular Games]] were held roughly every 100 years in either May or June.

of the year (between [[June]] and [[August]]) in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian Calendar]]s and the fourth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. It was named by the Roman Senate in honour of Roman general [[Julius Caesar]], it being the month of his birth. Prior to that, it was called [[Quintilis]], being the fifth month of the 10-month calendar.\n\nIt is on average the warmest month in most of the [[Northern hemisphere]], where it is the second month of summer, and the coldest month in much of the [[Southern hemisphere]], where it is the second month of winter. The second half of the year commences in July. In the Southern hemisphere, July is the seasonal equivalent of January in the Northern hemisphere.\n\n\"[[Dog days]]\" are considered to begin in early July in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], when the hot sultry weather of summer usually starts. [[Lamb and mutton#Classifications|Spring lambs]] born in late winter or early spring are usually sold before 1 July.\n\nJuly is the traditional period known as \"fence month,\" the closed season for [[Deer hunting#United Kingdom|deer]] in England.  The end of England's High Court of Justice [[Trinity Term]] takes place on 31 July. July is also the time in which the elections take place for the Japanese [[House of Councillors]], held every three years and replacing half of its seats.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Poplifugia]] was celebrated on 5 July, and [[Ludi Apollinares]] was held on 13 July and for several days afterwards. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\n==July symbols==\n*[[File:Ruby gem.JPG|alt=Ruby gemstone|thumb|[[Ruby]] gemstone]]July's [[birthstone]] is the [[ruby]], which symbolizes contentment.\n*Its [[Birth flower|birth flowers]] are the [[Delphinium|Larkspur]] or the [[Nymphaeaceae|Water Lily]].\n*The [[zodiac]] signs for the month of July are [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] (until July 22) and [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (July 23 onwards).\n\n==Observances==\n''This list does not necessarily imply either official status nor general

[[Gregorian Calendar]]. There are 364 days remaining until the end of the year (365 in leap years). This day is known as [[New Year's Day]] since the day marks the beginning of the year.

Eastern European countries (most of them with populations showing allegiance to the [[orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]]) began their numbered year on September 1 from about 988.{{citation_needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn England, January 1 was celebrated as the New Year festival, but from the 12th century to 1752 the year in England began on March 25 ([[Lady Day]]). So, for example, the Parliamentary record notes the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] as occurring on January 30, 1648, (as the year did not end until March 24), although modern histories adjust the start of the year to January 1 and record the execution as occurring in 1649.\n\nMost western European countries changed the start of the year to January 1 before they adopted the [[Gregorian calendar]]. For example, Scotland changed the start of the Scottish New Year to January 1 in 1600. England, Ireland and the British colonies changed the start of the year to January 1 in 1752. Later that year in September, the Gregorian calendar was introduced throughout Britain and the British colonies. These two reforms were implemented by the [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750]].\n\nJanuary 1 became the official start of the year as follows:\n*[[1362]] [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]\n*[[1522]] [[Republic of Venice]]\n*[[1544]] [[Holy Roman Empire]] (Germany)\n*[[1556]] Spain, Portugal\n*[[1559]] [[Prussia]], Sweden\n*[[1564]] France\n*[[1576]] [[Southern Netherlands]]\n*[[1579]] [[Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine]]\n*[[1583]] [[Dutch Republic|Northern Netherlands]]\n*[[1600]] Scotland\n*[[1700]] Russia\n*[[1721]] [[Tuscany]]\n*[[1752]] Great Britain (excluding Scotland) and its [[British Empire|colonies]]\n\n==Events==\n*[[153 BC]] &ndash; [[Roman consul]]s begin their year in office.\n*[[45 BC]] &ndash; The [[Julian calendar]] takes effect as the civil calendar of the Roman Empire, establishing January 1 as the new date of the new year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Origines Kalendariae Italicae Nundinal Calendars of Ancient Italy, Nundinal of Calendar of Romulus, Calendar of Numa Pompilius, Calendar of the Decemvirs, Irregular Roman Calendar, and Julian Correctio Tables of the Roman Calendar, from V.
