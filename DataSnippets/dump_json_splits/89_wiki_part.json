Growing from a few [[Northern Germany |North German]] towns in the late 1100s, the league came to dominate [[Baltic maritime trade (c. 1400\u20131800)| Baltic maritime trade for three centuries]] along the coasts of Northern Europe. Hansa territories stretched from the [[Baltic Sea| Baltic]] to the [[North Sea]] and inland during the [[Late Middle Ages]], and diminished slowly after 1450.\n\n''Hanse'', later spelled as ''Hansa'',<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lexikus.de/bibliothek/Hansa-Hanse |title= Hansa - Hanse |publisher= Lexikus |date= |accessdate= 9 June 2018}}</ref> was the [[Old High German]] word for a convoy, and this word was applied to bands of merchants traveling between the Hanseatic cities - whether by land or by sea.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.planet-wissen.de/geschichte/mittelalter/hanse/index.html |title= Hanse |publisher= Planet Wissen |date= |accessdate =9 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nMerchant circles established the league to protect the guilds' economic interests and diplomatic privileges in their affiliated cities and countries, as well as along the trade routes which the merchants used.  The Hanseatic cities had their own legal system and operated their own armies for mutual protection and aid. Despite this, the organization was not a state, nor could it be called a confederation of city-states; only a very small number of the cities within the league enjoyed autonomy and liberties comparable to those of a [[free imperial city]].<ref>\n{{cite book |title= A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation |last= Hansen |first= Mogens Herman |year= 2000 |publisher= Copenhagen Polis Centre (Historisk-filosofiske Skrifter 21) |location= Royal Danish Academy of Sciences & Letters |isbn= |page= 305 |url= \n}}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorians generally trace the origins of the Hanseatic League to the rebuilding of the north German town of [[L\u00fcbeck]] in 1159 by the powerful [[Henry the Lion]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], after he had captured the area from [[Adolf II of Holstein|Adolf II]], [[Count of Schauenburg]] and [[County of Holstein|Holstein]]. Exploratory trading adventures, raids, and piracy had occurred earlier throughout the Baltic region\u2014the sailors of [[Gotland]] sailed up rivers as far away as [[Novgorod]], for example\u2014but the scale of international trade in the Baltic area remained insignificant before the growth of the Hanseatic League.{{Citation needed |date=November 2010}}\n\nGerman cities achieved domination of [[Baltic maritime trade (c. 1400\u20131800)|trade in the Baltic]] with striking speed during the 13th century, and L\u00fcbeck became a central node in the seaborne trade that linked the areas around the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea|Baltic seas]]. The hegemony of L\u00fcbeck peaked during the 15th century.\n\n=== Foundation and formation ===\n[[File:Stadtrecht P.Schiffrecht.MHG.ajb.jpg|thumb|Foundation of the alliance between L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg]]\n\nL\u00fcbeck became a base for merchants from Saxony and [[Westphalia]] trading eastward and northward.  Well before the term ''Hanse'' appeared in a document in 1267,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} merchants in different cities began to form [[guilds]], or ''Hansa'', with the intention of trading with towns overseas, especially in the economically less-developed eastern Baltic. This area was a source of timber, wax, amber, [[resin]]s, and furs, along with rye and wheat brought down on barges from the hinterland to port markets. The towns raised their own armies, with each guild required to provide [[Conscription#Medieval levies|levies]] when needed. The Hanseatic cities came to the aid of one another, and commercial ships often had to be used to carry soldiers and their arms.\n\n[[Visby]] functioned as the leading centre in the Baltic before the Hansa.  Sailing east, Visby merchants established a trading post at [[Novgorod]] called Gutagard (also known as Gotenhof) in 1080.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.european-heritage.org/germany/m%C3%BCnster/hanseatic/cronicle-hanse |title=The Cronicle of the Hanseatic League |access-date=10 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307230219/http://www.european-heritage.org/germany/m%C3%BCnster/hanseatic/cronicle-hanse |archive-date=7 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Merchants from northern Germany also stayed in the early period of the Gotlander settlement.

Before the official foundation of the league in 1356, the word ''Hanse'' did not occur in the Baltic language. Gotlanders used the word ''varjag''. The earliest remaining documentary mention, although without a name, of a specific German commercial federation is from London in 1157.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} That year, the merchants of the Hansa in [[Imperial Free City of Cologne|Cologne]] convinced [[Henry II of England|Henry II, King of England]], to free them from all tolls in London and allow them to trade at fairs throughout England.  The \"Queen of the Hansa\", L\u00fcbeck, where traders were required to trans-ship goods between the North Sea and the Baltic, gained imperial privileges to become a [[free imperial city]] in 1226, as its potential trading partner [[Hamburg]] had in 1189.\n\nIn 1241, L\u00fcbeck, which had access to the Baltic and North seas' fishing grounds, formed an alliance\u2014a precursor to the league\u2014with Hamburg, another trading city, that controlled access to salt-trade routes from [[L\u00fcneburg]]. The allied cities gained control over most of the [[curing (food preservation)|salt-fish]] trade, especially the [[Scania Market]]; [[Imperial Free City of Cologne|Cologne]] joined them in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] of 1260. In 1266, [[Henry III of England]] granted the L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg Hansa a charter for operations in England, and the Cologne Hansa joined them in 1282 to form the most powerful Hanseatic colony in London. Much of the drive for this co-operation came from the fragmented nature of existing territorial governments, which failed to provide security for trade. Over the next 50 years the Hansa itself emerged with formal agreements for confederation and co-operation covering the west and east [[trade route]]s. The principal city and linchpin remained L\u00fcbeck; with the first general diet of the Hansa held there in 1356, the Hanseatic League acquired an official structure.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Atat\u00fcre |first=S\u00fcha |year=2008 |title=The Historical Roots of European Union: Integration, Characteristics, and Responsibilities for the 21st Century |journal=European Journal of Social Sciences |publisher=Eurojournal |issue=2 |volume=7 |url=http://www.eurojournals.com/ejss_7_2_02.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219225411/http://eurojournals.com/ejss_7_2_02.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial expansion ===\n[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League]]\n\n[[L\u00fcbeck]]'s location on the Baltic provided access for trade with [[Scandinavia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], putting it in direct competition with the Scandinavians who had previously controlled most of the Baltic trade routes.  A treaty with the Visby Hansa put an end to this competition: through this treaty the [[L\u00fcbeck]] merchants also gained access to the inland Russian port of [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], where they built a trading post or ''[[Kontor]]'' (literally: \"office\").  Although such alliances formed throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the league never became a closely managed formal organisation.  Assemblies of the Hanseatic towns met irregularly in L\u00fcbeck for a ''Hansetag'' (Hanseatic diet), from 1356 onwards, but many towns chose not to attend nor to send representatives and decisions were not binding on individual cities.{{Citation needed |date=February 2008}} Over the period, a network of alliances grew to include a flexible roster of 70 to 170 cities.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Perspective of the World |others=Volume 3: ''Civilization and Capitalism, 15th\u201318th century'' |last=Braudel |first=Fernand |authorlink=Fernand Braudel |date=17 January 2002 |publisher=Phoenix Press |isbn=1-84212-289-4 }}</ref>\n\nThe league succeeded in establishing additional ''Kontors'' in [[Bruges]] ([[County of Flanders|Flanders]]), [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] (Norway), and London (England).  These [[trading post]]s became significant [[enclave]]s.  The London ''Kontor'', established in 1320, stood west of [[London Bridge]] near Upper Thames Street, the site now occupied by [[Cannon Street station]].  It grew into a significant walled community with its own warehouses, weighhouse, church, offices and houses, reflecting the importance and scale of trading activity on the premises.  The first reference to it as the [[Steelyard]] (''der Stahlhof'') occurs in 1422.\n\n{| class= \"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Imports and exports, 18 Mar 1368 \u2013 10 Mar 1369 <br /> (in thousands of Port L\u00fcbeck marks)\n|-\n!Imports!!  !!Origin, Destination!!Exports!! !!Total!!%\n|-\n|150|| ||London/Hamburg|| 38 || ||188 || 34.4\n|-\n|44|| ||Livonian towns:|| 51 ||  || 95 || 17.4\n|-\n| || 10 || Riga ||  || 14 || ||\n|-\n|  || 34 || Reval (Tallinn) || || 14.3 || ||\n|-\n|  || -||Pernau|| || 22.7 || ||\n|-\n|49.4 || || Skania || 32.6 ||  || 82|| 15\n|-\n|52 || || Gotland, Sweden|| 29.4|| || 81.4|| 14.9\n|-\n|19 || || Prussian towns:|| 29.5|| || 48.5|| 8.9\n|-\n| || 16|| Danzig|| || 22.8|| ||\n|-\n| || 3||  Elbing|| ||  6.6|| ||\n|-\n|17.2|| ||Wendish & Pomeranian <br>towns:|| 25.2|| ||42.4|| 7.8\n|-\n| ||5.5|| Stettin|| || 7|| ||\n|-\n| || 4|| Stralsund|| || 7.5|| ||\n|-\n| || 2.2|| Rostock|| || 4.6|| ||\n|-\n| || 5.5|| Wismar || || 6.1|| ||\n|-\n|4.3 || || Bergen|| \u2013 || || 4.3|| 0.8\n|-\n|3 || || Small Baltic ports|| 1.2|| || 4.2|| 0.8\n|-\n|338.9||  || Total || 206.9 || || 545.8 || 100<ref>Hanseatic League, p.198, App.IV p.431</ref>\n|}\n\nStarting with trade in coarse woollen fabrics, the Hanseatic League had the effect of bringing both commerce and industry to northern Germany.<ref name=\"Frederick Engels p. 400\">Frederick Engels \"The Peasant War in Germany\" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10'' (International Publishers: New York, 1978) p. 400.</ref>  As trade increased, newer and finer woollen and linen fabrics, and even silks, were manufactured in northern Germany.  The same refinement of products out of cottage industry occurred in other fields, e.g. etching, wood carving, armour production, engraving of metals, and [[Woodturning|wood-turning]].  The century-long monopolization of sea navigation and trade by the Hanseatic League ensured that the [[Renaissance]] arrived in northern Germany long before the rest of Europe.<ref name=\"Frederick Engels p. 400\"/>\n\nIn addition to the major ''Kontors'', individual Hanseatic ports had a representative merchant and warehouse.  In England this happened in [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], Bristol, Bishop's Lynn (now [[King's Lynn]], which features the sole remaining Hanseatic warehouse in England), [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Ipswich]], [[Norwich]], Yarmouth (now [[Great Yarmouth]]), and [[York]].\n\nThe league primarily traded timber, furs, resin (or tar), flax, honey, wheat, and rye from the east to Flanders and England with cloth (and, increasingly, [[final good|manufactured goods]]) going in the other direction.  Metal ore (principally copper and iron) and herring came southwards from Sweden.\n\nGerman colonists in the 12th and 13th centuries settled in numerous cities on and near the east Baltic coast, such as Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]), Thorn ([[Toru\u0144]]), Reval ([[Tallinn]]), [[Riga]], and Dorpat ([[Tartu]]), which became members of the Hanseatic League, and some of which still retain many Hansa buildings and bear the style of their Hanseatic days.  Most were granted [[L\u00fcbeck law]] (''L\u00fcbisches Recht''), after the league's most prominent town.  The law provided that they had to appeal in all legal matters to L\u00fcbeck's city council.  The [[Livonian Confederation]] incorporated modern-day [[Estonia]] and parts of [[Latvia]] and had its own Hanseatic parliament (diet); all of its major towns became members of the Hanseatic League.  The dominant language of trade was [[Middle Low German]], a dialect with significant impact for countries involved in the trade, particularly the larger [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].\n\n=== Zenith ===\nThe league had a fluid structure, but its members shared some characteristics; most of the Hansa cities either started as [[Independent city|independent cities]] or gained independence through the collective bargaining power of the league, though such independence remained limited.  The Hanseatic [[Free Imperial City|free cities]] owed allegiance directly to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], without any intermediate family tie of obligation to the local nobility.\n\n[[File:Tallinn Town Hall edit.jpg|thumb|[[Tallinn Town Hall|Town Hall of Reval]] (now [[Tallinn]], Estonia)]]\n[[File:Stargard Szczec Brama Mlynska (1).jpg|thumb|[[Stargard Mill Gate]], [[Pomerania]], Poland]]\n\nAnother similarity involved the cities' strategic locations along trade routes.  At the height of its power in the late 14th century, the merchants of the Hanseatic League succeeded in using their economic clout, and sometimes their military might\u2014trade routes required protection and the league's ships sailed well-armed\u2014to influence imperial policy.\n\nThe league also wielded power abroad. Between 1361 and 1370, it waged war against Denmark. Initially unsuccessful, Hanseatic towns in 1368 allied in the [[Confederation of Cologne]], sacked [[Copenhagen]] and [[Helsingborg]], and forced [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV, King of Denmark]], and his son-in-law [[Haakon VI of Norway|Haakon VI, King of Norway]], to grant the league 15% of the profits from Danish trade in the subsequent [[Treaty of Stralsund (1370)|peace treaty of Stralsund]] in 1370, thus gaining an effective trade and economic monopoly in Scandinavia.  This favourable treaty marked the height of Hanseatic power. After the [[Danish-Hanseatic War (1426\u20131435)]] and the [[Bombardment of Copenhagen (1428)]], the commercial privileges were renewed in the [[Treaty of Vordingborg]] in 1435.<ref name=\"Pulsiano & Wolf\">{{cite book |title=Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia |last=Pulsiano |first=Phillip |author2=Kirsten Wolf |year=1993 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=0-8240-4787-7 |page=265 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stearns & Langer\">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, Chronologically Arranged |last=Stearns |first=Peter N |author2=William Leonard Langer |year=2001 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-395-65237-5 |page=265 }}</ref><ref name=\"MacKay & Ditchburn\">{{cite book |title=Atlas of Medieval Europe |last=MacKay |first=Angus |author2=David Ditchburn |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-01923-0 |page=171 }}</ref>\n\nThe Hansa also waged a vigorous campaign against pirates. Between 1392 and 1440, maritime trade of the league faced danger from raids of the [[Victual Brothers]] and their descendants, [[privateer]]s hired in 1392 by [[Albert, King of Sweden|Albert of Mecklenburg, King of Sweden]], against [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I, Queen of Denmark]]. In the [[Dutch\u2013Hanseatic War]] (1438\u201341), the merchants of [[Amsterdam]] sought and eventually won free access to the Baltic and broke the Hanseatic monopoly.  As an essential part of protecting their investment in the ships and their cargoes, the League trained [[pilot (harbour)|pilots]] and erected lighthouses.\n\nMost foreign cities confined the Hanseatic traders to certain trading areas and to their own trading posts. They seldom interacted with the local inhabitants, except when doing business. Many locals, merchant and noble alike, envied the power of the league and tried to diminish it. For example, in London, the local merchants exerted continuing pressure for the revocation of privileges. The refusal of the Hansa to offer reciprocal arrangements to their English counterparts exacerbated the tension. King [[Edward IV of England]] reconfirmed the league's privileges in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1474)]] despite the latent hostility, in part thanks to the significant financial contribution the league made to the Yorkist side during [[the Wars of the Roses]].  In 1597, Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]] expelled the league from London, and the Steelyard closed the following year. [[Ivan III of Russia]] closed the Hanseatic ''Kontor'' at Novgorod in 1494.  The very existence of the league and its privileges and monopolies created economic and social tensions that often crept over into rivalries between league members.<ref name=\"Dollinger2000 tensions\">{{cite book |title=The German Hansa |last=Dollinger |first=Philippe |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-19073-2 |pages=341\u201343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbompf7OyYwC&pg=PA341#v=twopage&q&f=false |accessdate=30 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== Rise of rival powers ===\nThe economic crises of the late 15th century did not spare the Hansa.  Nevertheless, its eventual rivals emerged in the form of the [[nation state|territorial states]], whether new or revived, and not just in the west: Poland triumphed over the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1466; [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow]], ended the entrepreneurial independence of Hansa's Novgorod ''Kontor'' in 1478\u2014it closed completely and finally in 1494.<ref>{{cite book |first=Dirk |last=Meier |title=Seafarers, Merchants and Pirates in the Middle ages| year=2009 |publisher=Boyden Press |isbn=978-1-84383-5-127}}, 145.</ref> New [[medium of exchange|vehicles of credit]] were imported from Italy, where double-entry booking was invented in 1492, and outpaced the Hansa economy, in which [[silver coin]]s changed hands rather than [[bills of exchange]].\n\n[[File:Hans Holbein der J\u00fcngere - Der Kaufmann Georg Gisze - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georg Giese]] from Danzig, 34-year-old German Hanseatic merchant at the [[Steelyard]], painted in London by [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]]]\n\nIn the 15th century, tensions between the [[Prussia (region)|Prussian region]] and the \"Wendish\" cities (L\u00fcbeck and its eastern neighbours) increased.  L\u00fcbeck was dependent on its role as centre of the Hansa, being on the shore of the sea without a major river.  It was on the entrance of the land route to Hamburg, but this land route could be bypassed by sea travel around Denmark and through the [[Kattegat]].  Prussia's main interest, on the other hand, was the export of bulk products like grain and timber, which were very important for England, the [[Low Countries]], and, later on, also for Spain and Italy.\n\nIn 1454, the year of the marriage of [[Elisabeth of Austria (1436\u20131505)|Elisabeth of Austria]] to the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellonian]] king, the towns of the [[Prussian Confederation]] rose up against the dominance of the Teutonic Order and asked [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV, King of Poland]], for help. [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig), Thorn and Elbing became part of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], (from 1466\u20131569 referred to as [[Royal Prussia]], region of Poland) by the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]].  Poland in turn was heavily supported by the Holy Roman Empire through family connections and by military assistance under the [[Habsburg]]s. [[Krak\u00f3w]], then the capital of Poland, had a loose association with the Hansa.<ref name=\"Blum\u00f3wna\">{{cite book |title=Krak\u00f3w jego dzieje i sztuka: Praca zbiorowa |trans-title=Krakow's history and art: Collective work |last=Blum\u00f3wna |first=Helena |publisher=1966 |location=Katowice |page=93 |url= }}</ref> The lack of customs borders on the River [[Vistula]] after 1466 helped to gradually increase Polish grain exports, transported to the sea down the Vistula, from {{convert|10000|ST}} per year, in the late 15th century, to over {{convert|200000|ST}} in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=God's playground.

When pressed by the King of [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian union|Poland\u2013Lithuania]], Danzig remained neutral and would not allow ships running for Poland into its territory. They had to anchor somewhere else, such as at [[Puck, Poland|Pautzke]] (Puck).\n\n[[File:Pl gdansk zuraw dlugiepobrzeze2006.jpg|thumb|The old and rich port city of [[Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk) in Poland. View of the ''Krantor'' (crane gate)]]\n[[File:Hanseatic museum Bergen.jpg|thumb|Hanseatic museum in [[Bergen]], Norway]]\n\nA major economic advantage for the Hansa was its control of the shipbuilding market, mainly in L\u00fcbeck and in Danzig.  The Hansa sold ships everywhere in Europe, including Italy.  They drove out the Dutch, because Holland wanted to favour Bruges as a huge staple market at the end of a trade route.  When the Dutch started to become competitors of the Hansa in shipbuilding, the Hansa tried to stop the flow of shipbuilding technology from Hanseatic towns to Holland.  Danzig, a trading partner of Amsterdam, attempted to forestall the decision.  Dutch ships sailed to Danzig to take grain from the city directly, to the dismay of L\u00fcbeck.  Hollanders also circumvented the Hanseatic towns by trading directly with north German princes in non-Hanseatic towns.  Dutch freight costs were much lower than those of the Hansa, and the Hansa were excluded as middlemen.\n\nWhen Bruges, Antwerp and Holland all became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Duchy of Burgundy]] they actively tried to take over the [[monopoly of trade]] from the Hansa, and the staples market from Bruges was transferred to Amsterdam.  The Dutch merchants aggressively challenged the Hansa and met with much success. Hanseatic cities in Prussia, Livonia, supported the Dutch against the core cities of the Hansa in northern Germany.  After several naval wars between Burgundy and the Hanseatic fleets, Amsterdam gained the position of leading port for Polish and Baltic grain from the late 15th century onwards.  The Dutch regarded Amsterdam's grain trade as the mother of all trades (''Moedernegotie'').\n\n[[Nuremberg]] in [[Franconia]] developed an overland route to sell formerly Hansa-monopolised products from [[Frankfurt]] via Nuremberg and [[Leipzig]] to Poland and Russia, trading Flemish cloth and [[French wine]] in exchange for grain and furs from the east.  The Hansa profited from the Nuremberg trade by allowing Nurembergers to settle in Hanseatic towns, which the Franconians exploited by taking over trade with Sweden as well.  The Nuremberger merchant [[Albrecht Moldenhauer]] was influential in developing the trade with Sweden and Norway, and his sons [[Wolf Moldenhauer]] and [[Burghard Moldenhauer]] established themselves in Bergen and Stockholm, becoming leaders of the local Hanseatic activities.\n\n=== End of the Hansa ===\n[[File:Heinrich Sudermann.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heinrich Sudermann]]]]\n\nAt the start of the 16th century, the league found itself in a weaker position than it had known for many years.  The rising [[Swedish Empire]] had taken control of much of the Baltic Sea.  Denmark had regained control over its own trade, the ''Kontor'' in Novgorod had closed, and the ''Kontor'' in [[Bruges]] had become effectively moribund. The individual cities making up the league had also started to put self-interest before their common Hanseatic interests. Finally, the political authority of the German princes had started to grow, constraining the independence of the merchants and Hanseatic towns.\n\nThe league attempted to deal with some of these issues: it created the post of [[Syndic]] in 1556 and elected [[Heinrich Sudermann]] as a permanent official with legal training, who worked to protect and extend the diplomatic agreements of the member towns.  In 1557 and 1579 revised agreements spelled out the duties of towns and some progress was made.  The Bruges ''Kontor'' moved to Antwerp and the Hansa attempted to pioneer new routes.  However the league proved unable to prevent the growing mercantile competition, and so a long decline commenced.  The Antwerp ''Kontor'' closed in 1593, followed by the London ''Kontor'' in 1598.  The Bergen ''Kontor'' continued until 1754; of all the ''Kontore'', only its buildings, the ''[[Bryggen]]'', survive.\n\n[[File:Adler von L\u00fcbeck.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern, faithful painting of the ''[[Adler von L\u00fcbeck]]''&nbsp;\u2013 the world's largest ship in its time]]\n\nThe gigantic warship ''[[Adler von L\u00fcbeck]]'' was constructed for military use against Sweden during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] (1563\u201370) but was never put to military use, epitomizing the vain attempts of L\u00fcbeck to uphold its long-privileged commercial position in a changing economic and political climate.\n\nBy the late 16th century, the league had imploded and could no longer deal with its own internal struggles. The social and political changes that accompanied the [[Protestant Reformation]] included the rise of Dutch and English merchants and the incursion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] upon the Holy Roman Empire and its trade routes. Only nine members attended the last formal meeting in 1669 and only three (L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg and Bremen) remained as members until its demise in 1862, in the wake of the creation of the [[German Empire]] under [[William I, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm I]].<ref>[http://www.exulanten.com/hansa.html hansa.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/hanseaticcities.cfm GermanFoods.org \u2013 Bremen, Hamburg and Luebeck: Culinary Treasures From The Hanseatic Cities]</ref> Hence, only L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg, and Bremen retain the words \"Hanseatic City\" in their official German titles.\n\n==Modern Hanseatic connections==\nDespite its collapse, several cities still maintained the link to the Hanseatic League.  Dutch cities including [[Groningen]], [[Deventer]], [[Kampen (Overijssel)|Kampen]], [[Zutphen]] and [[Zwolle]], and a number of German cities including [[Bremen]], [[Demmin]], [[Greifswald]], Hamburg, L\u00fcbeck, [[L\u00fcneburg]], Rostock, [[Stade]], [[Stralsund]] and [[Wismar]] still call themselves ''Hanse'' cities (their car license plates are prefixed ''H'', e.g. \u2013''HB''\u2013 for \"Hansestadt Bremen\").  Hamburg and Bremen continue to style themselves officially as \"free Hanseatic cities\", with L\u00fcbeck named \"Hanseatic City\" (Rostock's football team is named [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]] in memory of the city's trading past). For L\u00fcbeck in particular, this anachronistic tie to a glorious past remained especially important in the 20th century. In 1937, the [[Nazi Party]] removed this privilege through the [[Greater Hamburg Act]] possibly because the ''Senat'' of L\u00fcbeck did not permit [[Adolf Hitler]] to speak in L\u00fcbeck during his 1932 election campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europealacarte.co.uk/Germany/lubeck.html |title=Guide to L\u00fcbeck |work=Europe \u00e0 la Carte |accessdate=20 July 2009 }}</ref> He held the speech in [[Bad Schwartau]], a small village on the outskirts of L\u00fcbeck. Subsequently, he referred to L\u00fcbeck as \"the small city close to Bad Schwartau.\"\n\nAfter the EU enlargement to the East in May 2004 there were some experts who wrote about the resurrection of the Baltic Hansa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarussia.com/books/viaggio_nellhansa_baltica/travel-to-the-baltic-hansa |title=Travel to the Baltic Hansa |work=Europa Russia }}</ref>\n\nThe legacy of the Hansa is remembered today in several names:  the German airline [[Lufthansa]] (i.e., \"Air Hansa\"); [[F.C. Hansa Rostock]]; [[Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen]], Netherlands; Hanze oil production platform, Netherlands; the [[Hansa Brewery]] in Bergen and the [[Hanse Sail]] in Rostock. [[DDG Hansa]] was a major German shipping company from 1881 until its bankruptcy in 1980. [[Hansabank]] in the [[Baltic states]] has been rebranded into [[Swedbank]]).\n\nThere are two museums in Europe dedicated specifically to the history of the Hanseatic League: the [[European Hansemuseum]] in L\u00fcbeck and the [[Hanseatic Museum and Sch\u00f8tstuene]] in Bergen.\n\n== Organization ==\n[[File:Siegel Elbing 1350.jpg|thumb|upright|Hanseatic Seal of Elbing (now [[Elbl\u0105g]])]]\n[[File:Siegel Stralsund 1329.preview.png|thumb|upright|Hanseatic Seal of [[Stralsund]]]]\n\nThe members of the Hanseatic League were Low German merchants, whose towns were, with the exception of [[Dinant]], where these merchants held citizenship.  Not all towns with Low German merchant communities were members of the league (e.g., [[Emden]], Memel (today [[Klaip\u0117da]]), Viborg (today [[Vyborg]]) and [[Narva]] never joined). However, Hanseatic merchants could also come from settlements without [[German town law]]\u2014the premise for league membership was birth to German parents, subjection to German law, and a commercial education.  The league served to advance and defend the common interests of its heterogeneous members: commercial ambitions such as enhancement of trade, and political ambitions such as ensuring maximum independence from the noble territorial rulers.<ref name=\"Hammel-Kiesow\">{{cite book |last=Hammel-Kiesow |first=Rolf |title=Die Hanse |publisher=Beck |year=2008 |isbn=3-406-58352-0 |language=German}}</ref>{{rp|10\u201311}}\n\nDecisions and actions of the Hanseatic League were the consequence of a consensus-based procedure. If an issue arose, the league's members were invited to participate in a central meeting, the ''Tagfahrt'' (\"meeting ride\", sometimes also referred to as ''Hansetag'', since 1358).  The member communities then chose envoys (''Ratssendeboten'') to represent their local consensus on the issue at the ''Tagfahrt''.  Not every community sent an envoy, delegates were often entitled to represent a set of communities.  Consensus-building on local and ''Tagfahrt'' levels followed the Low Saxon tradition of ''Einung'', where consensus was defined as absence of protest: after a discussion, the proposals which gained sufficient support were dictated aloud to the scribe and passed as binding ''Rezess'' if the attendees did not object; those favouring alternative proposals unlikely to get sufficient support were obliged to remain silent during this procedure.  If consensus could not be established on a certain issue, it was found instead in the appointment of a number of league members who were then empowered to work out a compromise.<ref name=\"Hammel-Kiesow\"/>{{rp|70\u201372}}\n\nThe Hanseatic ''Kontore'', which operated like an early [[stock exchange]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n| orig-year = 2005\n| chapter = Hanseatic Leage\n| editor1-last = Northrup\n| editor1-first = Cynthia Clark\n| title = Encyclopedia of World Trade: From Ancient Times to the Present\n| volume = 2\n| edition = Reprint\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 444\n| isbn = 9781317471530\n| access-date = 2018-02-19\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1317471539\n| quote = To facilitate trade in foreign countries, the Hansa established counters (Kontore) [...].

Like the guilds, the ''Kontore'' were led by ''\u00c4lterm\u00e4nner'' (\"eldermen\", or English [[aldermen]]).  The [[Stalhof]] ''Kontor'', as a special case, had a Hanseatic and an English ''\u00c4ltermann''.  In 1347 the ''Kontor'' of Brussels modified its statute to ensure an equal representation of the league's members.  To that end, member communities from different regions were pooled into three circles (''Drittel'' (\"third [part]\"): the [[Germania Slavica|Wendish]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] Drittel, the [[Westphalia]]n and [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] Drittel as well as the [[Gothland]]ian, [[Livonia]]n and [[History of Sweden|Swedish]] Drittel.  The merchants from their respective ''Drittel'' would then each choose two ''\u00c4lterm\u00e4nner'' and six members of the Eighteen Men's Council (''Achtzehnm\u00e4nnerrat'') to administer the ''Kontor'' for a set period of time.  In 1356, during a Hanseatic meeting in preparation of the first ''Tagfahrt'', the league confirmed this statute.  The league in general gradually adopted and institutionalized the division into ''Drittel'' (see table).<ref name=\"Hammel-Kiesow\"/>{{rp|62\u201363}}<ref name=\"Pfeiffer\">{{cite book |last= Pfeiffer |first= Hermannus |title= Seemacht Deutschland.

The revolt by the [[Goths]], the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] believers of [[Gothic paganism]], earned them a reputation amongst several early writers and their texts, such as Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Gallienii.<ref>Scriptores Historiae Augustae, Vita Gallienii, 13.8</ref> The earliest recording of an official accusation of [[Satanism]] by the [[Roman Catholics]] took place in [[Toulouse]] in 1022 A.D. against a couple of clerics.<ref>Van Luijk, Ruben (2016).

[[Anonymous work|Anonymous writers]] penned two werewolf stories, \"Biclarel\" and \"[[Melion]]\".  Much of horror fiction derived itself from the cruelest faces in world history, particularly those who lived in the fifteenth-century. \"[[Dracula]]\" can be traced to the Prince of [[Wallachia]] [[Vlad III]] whose alleged [[war crimes]] were published in [[German language|German]] pamphlets in the late Fifteenth Century. The 1499 pamphlet published by Markus Ayrer is most notable for its [[woodcut]] imagery.<ref>Raymond T. McNally and Radu R. Florescu (1972). \"In Search of Dracula.\" Houghton Milton.

This marked the first incorporated elements of the [[supernatural]] instead of pure [[Literary realism|realism]]. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator.<ref name=\"Walpole\"/> Once revealed as contemporary, many found it [[anachronism|anachronistic]], [[reactionary]], or simply in poor taste\u2014but it proved to be immediately popular.<ref name=\"Walpole\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 \"The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction\"].

Influential works and characters that continue resonating with film and cinema today saw their genesis in such works as the [[Brothers Grimm]]'s \"[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]\" (1812), [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818), [[Washington Irving]]'s ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' (1820), [[Jane C.

G. Wells]]' ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897), and [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897). Each of these novels and [[novella]]s created an enduring icon of horror seen in modern re-imaginings on the stage and screen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Christopher Frayling |year=1996|title=''Nightmare: The Birth of Horror''|place=London|publisher=BBC Books}}</ref>\n\n===Horror in the 20th century===\nThe proliferation of cheap periodicals, as early as the turn of the century, led to a boom in horror writing. For example, [[Gaston Leroux]] serialized his \"[[Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra]]\" before it was a novel in 1910. One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps such as ''[[Argosy (magazine)|All-Story Magazine]]'' was [[Tod Robbins]], whose fiction dealt with themes of madness and cruelty.<ref>[[Brian Stableford]], \"Robbins, Tod\", in [[David Pringle]], ed., ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers'' (London: St. James Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1558622063}} (pp. 480\u20131).</ref><ref>[[Lee Server]]. ''Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers''. New York: Facts On File, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-4578-5}} (pp. 223\u2013224).</ref> Later, specialist publications emerged to give horror writers an outlet, including ''[[Weird Tales]]''<ref>[[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]], \"Weird Tales\" in M.B Tymn and Mike Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines''. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1985.{{ISBN|0-313-21221-X}} (pp. 727\u2013736).</ref> and ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]''.<ref>\"Unknown\". in: M.B. Tymn and Mike Ashley, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Weird Fiction Magazines. Westport: Greenwood, 1985. pp.694-698. {{ISBN|0-313-21221-X}}</ref>\n\nInfluential horror writers of the early 20th century made inroads in these mediums. Particularly, the venerated horror author [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and his enduring [[Cthulhu Mythos]] pioneered the genre of [[cosmic horror]], and [[M. R. James]] is credited with redefining the [[ghost story]] in that era.\n\nThe [[serial murderer]] became a recurring theme in horror fiction. [[Yellow journalism]] and [[sensationalism]] of various murderers, such as [[Jack the Ripper]], and lesser so, [[Carl Panzram]], [[Fritz Haarman]], and [[Albert Fish]], all perpetuated this phenomenon. An example of this is found in [[Charles S. Belden]]'s unpublished 1932 short story, \"The Wax Works\". The trend continued in the postwar era, partly renewed after the murders committed by [[Ed Gein]]. In 1959, [[Robert Bloch]], inspired by the murders, wrote ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''. The murders committed by [[Charles Schmid]] inspired [[Joyce Carol Oates]] to publish the short story, \"[[Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?]]\" In 1969, the crimes of the [[Manson family]] further influenced the slasher theme in horror fiction of the 1970s. In 1981, [[Thomas Harris]] wrote ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' as the first novel to introduce [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]]. The character is said to be based on the real life Dr. Alfredo Balli Trevino. In 1988, Harris wrote the sequel, ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.\n\nEarly cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and early horror cinema started a strong tradition of [[horror film]]s and subgenres based on horror fiction that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with the 1960s and 1970s [[slasher film]]s and [[splatter film]]s, [[comic books]] such as those published by [[EC Comics]] (famous for series such as ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comics)|Tales From The Crypt]]'') in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the [[silver screen]] could not provide.<ref name=\"Hutchings 2009\">{{cite book|last1=Hutchings|first1=Peter|title=The A to Z of Horror Cinema|series=The A to Z Guide Series|volume=100|year=2008|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-6887-8|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_5DPHOVG7YC|accessdate=29 October 2015}}</ref> This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence they were frequently censored.\n\nMany modern novels claim an early description of the living dead in a precursor to the modern [[zombie]] tale, including [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s \"Strange Conflict\" (1941), H.P. Lovecraft stories such as \"Cool Air,\" (1925) \"In The Vault,\" (1926) and \"The Outsider,\" (1926). [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'' (1954) would also influence an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie fiction emblematic of the films of [[George A. Romero]].\n\n===Contemporary horror fiction===\n[[File:Stephen King, Comicon.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Stephen King|[[Stephen King]]]]\nOne of the best-known contemporary horror writers is [[Stephen King]], known for writing ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'' and many more.<ref>[[Richard Bleiler]], \"Stephen King\" in: Bleiler, Ed.

Stine]]. Elements of the horror genre continue to expand outside the genre. The [[alternate history]] of more traditional historical horror in a novel such as ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' exists on bookstore shelves next to genre [[Mashup (book)|mash up]]s such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]]'' and the [[historical fantasy]] and [[horror comics]] such as ''[[Hellblazer]]'' and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy]]. Horror serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as [[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'', a finalist for the [[National Book Award]]. There are also horror novels for teens, such as [[The Monstrumologist]] by [[Rick Yancey]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nOne of the defining traits of the genre of horror is that it provokes a response; emotional, [[psychology|psychological]] or physical, within readers that causes them to react with fear. One of H.P. Lovecraft's most famous quotes about the genre is that: \"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenproverbs.com/au_lovecraft.html|title=Golden Proverbs|accessdate = 15 December 2012}}</ref> the first sentence from his seminal essay, \"[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]\".\n\nIn her essay \"Elements of Aversion\", Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world:\n{{quote|text=The old \"fight or flight\" reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human. Our ancestors lived and died by it. Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization, and things began to calm down. Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands. War, crime, and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other, but by and large daily life calmed down. We began to feel restless, to feel something missing: the excitement of living on the edge, the tension between hunter and hunted. So we told each other stories through the long, dark nights...when the fires burned low, we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other. The rush of adrenaline feels good. Our hearts pound, our breath quickens, and we can imagine ourselves on the edge. Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror. Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust, but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency. It makes us think, forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore, and challenges preconceptions of all kinds. Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems, which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horror.fictionfactor.com/articles/aversion.html |title=Elements of Aversion |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nIn a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a [[roller coaster]], readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement. However, she adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they \"might rather ignore ... [to challenge] preconceptions of all kinds.\"\n\nOne can see the confrontation of ideas readers and characters would \"rather ignore\" throughout literature, in famous moments such as [[Hamlet]]'s musings about the skull of [[Yorick]] and its implications of the mortality of humanity and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to. In horror fiction, the confrontation with the gruesome is often a [[metaphor]] for the problems facing the current generation of the author.\n\nStephanie Demetrakopoulos illustrates a common interpretation of one of the benchmarks of the canon of horror literature.<ref name=\"Demetrakopoulos\">{{cite journal|title=Feminism, Sex Role Exchanges, and Other Subliminal Fantasies in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\"\n|author=Stephanie Demetrakopoulos\n|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies\n|volume= 2|issue= 3|date=Autumn 1977|pages= 104\u2013113|publisher= University of Nebraska Press\n|jstor=3346355}}</ref> Tina Broussard in an [[annotated bibliography]] of [[Dracula]] surmises Demetrakopoulos' thesis:\n\n{{quote|text=This scholarly journal article explores sexuality in ''Dracula'', including overtones of sexuality in the typical aggressive male and female sexuality which is either reflective of the chaste woman or the sexually aggressive female vampire.

Judith Halberstam postulates many of these in her essay ''Technologies of Monstrosity: Bram Stoker's Dracula''. She writes:\n\n{{quote|text=[The] image of dusty and unused gold, coins from many nations and old unworn jewels, immediately connects Dracula to the old money of a corrupt class, to a kind of piracy of nations and to the worst excesses of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/30740375/913659240/name/halberstam%2Bdracula.pdf |title=Technologies of Monstrosity |accessdate = 2 November 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Punch Anti-Irish propaganda (1882) Irish Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration from an 1882 issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'': An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [[Fenian|Fenian movement]] as akin to Frankenstein's monster, in the wake of the [[Phoenix Park killings]]. <br> Menacing villains and monsters in horror literature can often be seen as metaphors for the fears [[incarnate]] of a society.]]\n\nHalberstram articulates a view of Dracula as manifesting the growing perception of the [[aristocracy]] as an evil and outdated notion to be defeated. The depiction of a multinational band of [[protagonists]] using the latest [[technologies]] (such as a [[telegraph]]) to quickly share, collate, and act upon new information is what leads to the destruction of the Vampire.

In 1826, the gothic novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction, \"terror\" and \"horror.\" Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens, horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened.<ref>[[Anne Radcliffe]], \"On the Supernatural in Poetry\", ''[[The New Monthly Magazine]]'' 7 (1826): 145\u201352.</ref> Radcliffe describes terror as that which \"expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life,\" whereas horror is described as that which \"freezes and nearly annihilates them.\"\n\nModern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources. In their historical studies of the gothic novel, both Devandra Varma<ref>Devandra Varma, ''The Gothic Flame'' (New York: Russell & Russell, 1966.</ref> and S.L. Varnado<ref>S.L.

The existence of a complex derivative in a neighborhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually [[infinitely differentiable function|infinitely differentiable]] and equal to its own [[Taylor series]] (''analytic''). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in [[complex analysis]].\n\nThough the term ''[[analytic function]]'' is often used interchangeably with \"holomorphic function\", the word \"analytic\" is defined in a broader sense to denote any function (real, complex, or of more general type) that can be written as a convergent power series in a neighborhood of each point in its [[domain of a function|domain]]. The fact that all holomorphic functions are complex analytic functions, and vice versa, is a [[Holomorphic functions are analytic|major theorem in complex analysis]].<ref>''[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Analytic_function#Analytic_functions_of_one_complex_variable Analytic functions of one complex variable]'', Encyclopedia of Mathematics.

In particular, the limit is taken as the complex number ''z'' approaches ''z''<sub>0</sub>, and must have the same value for any sequence of complex values for ''z'' that approach ''z''<sub>0</sub> on the complex plane. If the limit exists, we say that ''f'' is '''complex-differentiable''' at the point ''z''<sub>0</sub>.

That is, a holomorphic function ''f'' has derivatives of every order at each point ''a'' in its domain, and it coincides with its own [[Taylor series]] at ''a'' in a neighborhood of ''a''. In fact, ''f'' coincides with its Taylor series at ''a'' in any disk centered at that point and lying within the domain of the function.\n\nFrom an algebraic point of view, the set of holomorphic functions on an open set is a [[commutative ring]] and a [[complex vector space]]. Additionally, the set of holomorphic functions in an open set U is an [[integral domain]] if and only if the open set U is connected. <ref name=Gunning /> In fact, it is a [[locally convex topological vector space]], with the [[norm (mathematics)|seminorms]] being the [[suprema]] on [[compact subset]]s.\n\nFrom a geometric perspective, a function ''f'' is holomorphic at ''z''<sub>0</sub> if and only if its [[exterior derivative]] ''df'' in a neighborhood ''U'' of ''z''<sub>0</sub> is equal to ''f''\u2032(''z'') ''dz'' for some continuous function ''f''\u2032. It follows from\n\n:<math>\\textstyle 0 = d^2 f = d(f^\\prime dz) = df^\\prime \\wedge dz</math>\n\nthat ''df''\u2032 is also proportional to ''dz'', implying that the derivative ''f''\u2032 is itself holomorphic and thus that ''f'' is infinitely differentiable. Similarly, the fact that {{nowrap|1=''d''(''f dz'') = ''f''\u2032 ''dz'' \u2227 ''dz'' = 0}} implies that any function ''f'' that is holomorphic on the simply connected region ''U'' is also integrable on ''U''. (For a path \u03b3 from ''z''<sub>0</sub> to ''z'' lying entirely in ''U'', define\n\n:<math>\\textstyle F_\\gamma(z) = F_0 + \\int_\\gamma f dz</math>;\n\nin light of the [[Jordan curve theorem]] and the [[Stokes' theorem|generalized Stokes' theorem]], ''F''<sub>\u03b3</sub>(''z'') is independent of the particular choice of path \u03b3, and thus ''F''(''z'') is a well-defined function on ''U'' having {{nowrap|1=''F''(''z''<sub>0</sub>) = ''F''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{nowrap|1=''dF'' = ''f dz''}}.)\n\n== Examples ==\nAll [[polynomial]] functions in ''z'' with complex [[coefficient]]s are holomorphic on '''C''', and so are [[sine]], [[cosine]] and the [[exponential function]]. (The trigonometric functions are in fact closely related to and can be defined via the exponential function using [[Euler's formula]]). The principal branch of the [[complex logarithm]] function is holomorphic on the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{nowrap|1='''C''' \u2216 {''z'' \u2208 '''R''' : z \u2264 0}.}} The [[square root]] function can be defined as\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{z} = e^{\\frac{1}{2}\\log z}</math>\n\nand is therefore holomorphic wherever the logarithm log(''z'') is. The function 1/''z'' is holomorphic on {{nowrap|{''z'' : ''z'' \u2260 0}.}}\n\nAs a consequence of the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]], a real-valued holomorphic function must be constant. Therefore, the absolute value of ''z'', the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of ''z'', the [[real part]] of ''z'' and the [[imaginary part]] of ''z'' are not holomorphic. Another typical example of a continuous function which is not holomorphic is the complex conjugate {{overline|''z''}} formed by [[complex conjugation]].\n\n== Several variables ==\nThe definition of a holomorphic function generalizes to several complex variables in a straightforward way.  Let ''D'' denote an open subset of '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''D'' \u2192 '''C'''}}.  The function ''f'' is '''analytic''' at a point ''p'' in ''D'' if there exists an open neighborhood of ''p'' in which ''f'' is equal to a convergent power series in ''n'' complex variables.<ref>Gunning and Rossi, ''Analytic Functions of Several Complex Variables'', p. 2.</ref>  Define ''f'' to be '''holomorphic''' if it is analytic at each point in its domain.  [[Osgood's lemma]] shows (using the multivariate Cauchy integral formula) that, for a continuous function ''f'', this is equivalent to ''f'' being holomorphic in each variable separately (meaning that if any {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} coordinates are fixed, then the restriction of ''f'' is a holomorphic function of the remaining coordinate).  The much deeper [[Hartogs' theorem]] proves that the continuity hypothesis is unnecessary: ''f'' is holomorphic if and only if it is holomorphic in each variable separately.\n\nMore generally, a function of several complex variables that is [[square integrable]] over every [[compact set|compact subset]] of its domain is analytic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations in the sense of distributions.\n\nFunctions of several complex variables are in some basic ways more complicated than functions of a single complex variable.  For example, the region of convergence of a power series is not necessarily an open ball; these regions are [[Reinhardt domain]]s, the simplest example of which is a [[polydisk]].  However, they also come with some fundamental restrictions.  Unlike functions of a single complex variable, the possible domains on which there are holomorphic functions that cannot be extended to larger domains are highly limited.  Such a set is called a [[domain of holomorphy]].\n\n== Extension to functional analysis ==\n{{Main article|infinite-dimensional holomorphy}}\nThe concept of a holomorphic function can be extended to the infinite-dimensional spaces of [[functional analysis]]. For instance, the [[Fr\u00e9chet derivative|Fr\u00e9chet]] or [[G\u00e2teaux derivative]] can be used to define a notion of a holomorphic function on a [[Banach space]] over the field of complex numbers.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Antiderivative (complex analysis)]]\n* [[Antiholomorphic function]]\n* [[Biholomorphy]]\n* [[Holomorphic separability]]\n* [[Meromorphic function]]\n* [[Quadrature domains]]\n* [[Harmonic map]]s\n* [[Harmonic morphism]]s\n* [[Wirtinger derivatives]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |title=University Mathematics |last=Blakey |first=Joseph |publisher=Blackie and Sons |location=London |edition=2nd |year=1958 |oclc=2370110 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Analytic function|id=p/a012240}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Analytic functions]]", "sha1": "dkdikqmgd3ohuzhd06hvmbqycey2x3n"}}, {"title": "History of Algeria", "ns": "0", "id": "14113", "revision": {"id": "860955885", "parentid": "860929476", "timestamp": "2018-09-24T05:43:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnomieBOT", "id": "7611264"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Dating maintenance tags: {{When?}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{History of Algeria}}\nMuch of the '''history of [[Algeria]]''' has taken place \non the fertile [[coastal plain]] of [[North Africa]], which is often called the [[Maghreb]] (or Maghrib).

The region was conquered by the Muslims in the early 8th century AD, but broke off from the Umayyad Caliphate after the Berber Revolt of 740. Later, various Berbers, Arabs, Persian Muslim states, Sunni, Shia or Ibadi communities were established that ruled parts of modern-day of Algeria: including the [[Rustamids]], [[Banu Ifran|Ifranids]], [[Fatimids]], Maghrawas, [[Zirids]], [[Hammadids]], [[Almoravid]], [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], and Ziyyanids. During the Ottoman period, Algiers was the center of the [[Barbary slave trade]] which led to many naval conflicts.

[[Neolithic]] civilization (marked by animal [[domestication]] and [[subsistence agriculture]]) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghrib between 6000 and 2000 BC. This type of economy, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] [[cave paintings]] in southeastern Algeria, predominated in the Maghrib until the classical period. The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population, the Berbers lacked a written language and hence tended to be overlooked or marginalized in historical accounts.\n\nSince 4000 BC, the [[indigenous peoples]] of [[northern Africa]] successfully{{citation needed | date=September 2018}} resisted [[Phoenicia]]n, [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Vandal]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], and French invaders but finally{{when?|date=September 2018}} submitted to [[Islam]], and Arabic is now the language spoken by a majority in the country.\n\n==Carthage==\n{{main|North Africa during Antiquity}}\n[[Phoenicia]]n traders arrived on the North African coast around 900 BC and established [[Carthage]] (in present-day [[Tunisia]]) around 800 BC. During the classical period, Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.\n\nThe Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]], and in 146 BC, the city of Carthage was destroyed.

The [[Umayyads]] (a Muslim dynasty based in Damascus from 661 to 750) recognised that the strategic necessity of dominating the Mediterranean dictated a concerted military effort on the North African front. By 711 Umayyad forces helped by Berber converts to Islam had conquered all of North Africa. In 750 the [[Abbasids]] succeeded the Umayyads as Muslim rulers and moved the [[caliphate]] to [[Baghdad]]. Under the Abbasids, Berber [[Kharijites]] [[Sufri]] [[Banu Ifran]] were opposed to [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbasids]]. After, the [[Rustumids]] (761\u2013909) actually ruled most of the central Maghrib from [[Tahirt]], southwest of Algiers. The imams gained a reputation for honesty, piety, and justice, and the court of Tahirt was noted for its support of scholarship. The Rustumid imams failed, however, to organise a reliable standing army, which opened the way for Tahirt's demise under the assault of the [[Fatimid dynasty]].\n\nWith their interest focused primarily on Egypt and Muslim lands beyond, the Fatimids left the rule of most of Algeria to the [[Zirids]] and [[Hammadid]] (972\u20131148), a Berber dynasty that centered significant local power in Algeria for the first time, but who were still at war with [[Banu Ifran]] (kingdom of [[Tlemcen]]) and [[Maghrawa|Maghraoua]] (942-1068).<ref>Ibn Khaldun, History of Berber, party Zenata and Sanhadja</ref> This period was marked by constant conflict, political instability, and economic decline. Following a large incursion of Arab Bedouin from Egypt beginning in the first half of the 11th century, the use of Arabic spread to the countryside, and sedentary Berbers were gradually Arabised.\n\nThe [[Almoravid]] (\"those who have made a religious retreat\") movement developed early in the 11th century among the Sanhaja Berbers of southern Morocco. The movement's initial impetus was religious, an attempt by a tribal leader to impose moral discipline and strict adherence to Islamic principles on followers. But the Almoravid movement shifted to engaging in military conquest after 1054. By 1106, the Almoravids had conquered the Maghreb as far east as Algiers and [[Morocco]], and Spain up to the [[Ebro River]].\n\nLike the Almoravids, the [[Almohads]] (\"unitarians\") found their inspiration in [[Almohad reforms|Islamic reform]]. The Almohads took control of Morocco by 1146, captured Algiers around 1151, and by 1160 had completed the conquest of the central Maghrib. The zenith of Almohad power occurred between 1163 and 1199. For the first time, the Maghrib was united under a local regime, but the continuing wars in Spain overtaxed the resources of the Almohads, and in the Maghrib their position was compromised by factional strife and a renewal of tribal warfare.\n\nIn the central Maghrib, the [[Abdalwadid]] founded a dynasty that ruled the [[Kingdom of Tlemcen]] in Algeria. For more than 300 years, until the region came under Ottoman suzerainty in the 16th century, the Zayanids kept a tenuous hold in the central Maghrib. Many coastal cities asserted their autonomy as municipal republics governed by merchant oligarchies, tribal chieftains from the surrounding countryside, or the privateers who operated out of their ports. Nonetheless, [[Tlemcen]], the \"pearl of the Maghrib,\" prospered as a commercial center.\n\n===Christian reconquest of Spain===\n{{main|Reconquista}}\nThe final triumph of the 700-year [[Reconquista|Christian reconquest of Spain]] was marked by the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492. Christian Spain imposed its influence on the Maghrib coast by constructing fortified outposts and collecting tribute. But Spain never sought to extend its North African conquests much beyond a few modest enclaves. Privateering was an age-old practice in the Mediterranean, and North African rulers engaged in it increasingly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries because it was so lucrative. Algeria became the privateering city-state par excellence, and two privateer brothers were instrumental in extending Ottoman influence in Algeria. At about the time Spain was establishing its presidios in the Maghrib, the Muslim privateer brothers [[Aruj]] and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Khair ad Din]]\u2014the latter known to Europeans as [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]], or Red Beard\u2014were operating successfully off Tunisia. In 1516 Aruj moved his base of operations to Algiers but was killed in 1518. Khair ad Din succeeded him as military commander of Algiers, and the Ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey (provincial governor).\n\n== Spanish enclaves ==\n{{see also|Oran Spanish period|Spanish Empire}}\nThe Spanish expansionist policy in North Africa begun with the Catholic Monarchs and the regent [[Cardinal Cisneros|Cisneros]], once the ''Reconquista'' in the Iberian Peninsula was finished. That way, several towns and outposts in the Algerian coast were conquered and occupied: [[Mers El K\u00e9bir]] (1505), [[Oran]] (1509), [[Algiers]] (1510) and [[Bejaia|Bugia]] (1510). The Spaniards left Algiers in 1529, Bujia in 1554, Mers El K\u00e9bir and Oran in 1708. The Spanish returned in 1732 when the armada of the [[Jos\u00e9 Carrillo de Albornoz, 1st Duke of Montemar|Duke of Montemar]] was victorious in the [[Battle of A\u00efn-el-Turk]] and took again Oran and Mers El K\u00e9bir. Both cities were held until 1792, when they were sold by the king [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] to the [[History of Ottoman Algeria|Bey of Algiers]].\n\n== Ottoman rule ==\n{{main|History of Ottoman Algeria}}\n\nUnder Khair ad Din's regency, Algiers became the center of Ottoman authority in the Maghrib. For 300 years, [[Algeria]] was a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]] under a regency that had [[Algiers]] as its [[Capital (political)|capital]] (see [[Dey]]). Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled. Turkish was the official language, and Arabs and Berbers were excluded from government posts. In 1671 a new leader took power, adopting the title of dey. In 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the pasha in that role.\n\nAlthough Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there. European maritime powers paid the tribute demanded by the rulers of the [[privateering]] states of North Africa (Algiers, Tunis, [[Tripoli]], and Morocco) to prevent attacks on their shipping. The Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century diverted the attention of the maritime powers from suppressing piracy. But when peace was restored to Europe in 1815, Algiers found itself at war with Spain, the Netherlands, Prussia, Denmark, Russia, and Naples. Algeria and surrounding areas, collectively known as the [[Barbary States]], were responsible for [[piracy]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], as well as the enslaving of [[Christian]]s, actions which brought them into the [[First Barbary War|First]] and [[Second Barbary War]] with the United States of America.\n\n== French rule ==\n{{main|French rule in Algeria}}\n\n=== 19th century colonialism ===\n[[File:French Algeria evolution 1830-1962 map-fr.svg|thumbnail|Chronological map of the conquest of Algeria (1830-1956)]]\n\nNorth African boundaries have shifted during various stages of the conquests. The borders of modern Algeria were created by the French, whose [[colonization]] began in 1830 (French invasion began on July 5). To benefit French colonists (many of whom were not in fact of French origin but Italian, Maltese, and Spanish) and nearly the entirety of whom lived in urban areas, northern Algeria was eventually organized into overseas departments of France, with representatives in the [[French National Assembly]]. France controlled the entire country, but the traditional Muslim population in the rural areas remained separated from the modern economic infrastructure of the European community.\n\nAs a result of what the French considered an insult to the French consul in Algiers by the Day in 1827, France blockaded Algiers for three years. In 1830, France invaded and occupied the coastal areas of Algeria, citing a diplomatic incident as [[casus belli]]. [[Hussein Dey]] went into exile. French [[colonialism|colonization]] then gradually penetrated southwards, and came to have a profound impact on the area and its populations. The European conquest, initially accepted in the Algiers region, was soon met by a rebellion, led by [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abdel Kadir]], which took roughly a decade for the French troops to put down.\nBy 1848 nearly all of northern Algeria was under French control, and the new government of the Second Republic declared the occupied lands an integral part of France. Three \"civil territories\"\u2014Algiers, Oran, and Constantine\u2014were organized as French d\u00e9partements (local administrative units) under a civilian government.\n\nIn addition to enduring the affront of being ruled by a foreign, non-Muslim power, many Algerians lost their lands to the new government or to colonists. Traditional leaders were eliminated, coopted, or made irrelevant, and the traditional educational system was largely dismantled; social structures were stressed to the breaking point. From 1856, native Muslims and [[Jews]] were viewed as French subjects, but not French ''citizens''.\n\nHowever, in 1865, [[Napoleon III]] allowed them to apply for full French citizenship, a measure that few took, since it involved renouncing the right to be governed by ''[[sharia]]'' law in personal matters, and was considered a kind of [[apostasy]]; in 1870, French citizenship was made automatic for Jewish natives, a move which largely angered many Muslims, which resulted in the Jews being seen as the accomplices of the colonial power by anti-colonial Algerians. Nonetheless, this period saw progress in health, some infrastructures, and the overall expansion of the [[economy of Algeria]], as well as the formation of new social classes, which, after exposure to ideas of equality and political liberty, would help propel the country to independence.\n\n=== Rise of Algerian nationalism and French resistance ===\n{{main|Nationalism and resistance in Algeria}}\n\nA new generation of [[Islamic]] leadership emerged in Algeria at the time of [[World War I]] and grew to maturity during the 1920s and 1930s. Various groups were formed in opposition to French rule, most notable the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|National Liberation Front]] (FLN) and the [[National Algerian Movement]].\n\n''Colons'' (colonists), or, more popularly, ''pieds noirs'' (literally, black feet) dominated the government and controlled the bulk of Algeria's wealth. Throughout the colonial era, they continued to block or delay all attempts to implement even the most modest reforms. But from 1933 to 1936, mounting social, political, and economic crises in Algeria induced the indigenous population to engage in numerous acts of political protest. The government responded with more restrictive laws governing public order and security. Algerian Muslims rallied to the French side at the start of [[World War II]] as they had done in [[World War I]]. But the colons were generally sympathetic to the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime established following France's defeat by [[Nazi Germany]]. After the fall of the Vichy regime in Algeria (November 11, 1942) as a result of [[Operation Torch]], the [[Free French Forces|Free French]] commander in chief in North Africa slowly rescinded repressive Vichy laws, despite opposition by colon extremists.\n\n[[File:Alg\u00e9rie La France vous parle.jpg|left|thumb|Poster to garner Algerian support for the struggle in France during World War 2. \"France is speaking to you\" with clippings from French Resistance newspapers from 1942 and 1943]]\n\nIn March 1943, Muslim leader [[Ferhat Abbas]] presented the French administration with the Manifesto of the Algerian People, signed by 56 Algerian nationalist and international leaders. The manifesto demanded an Algerian constitution that would guarantee immediate and effective political participation and legal equality for Muslims. Instead, the French administration in 1944 instituted a reform package, based on the 1936 Viollette Plan, that granted full French citizenship only to certain categories of \"meritorious\" Algerian Muslims, who numbered about 60,000. In April 1945 the French had arrested the Algerian nationalist leader [[Messali Hadj]]. On May 1 the followers of his [[Parti du Peuple Alg\u00e9rien]] (PPA) participated in [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] which were violently put down by the police. Several Algerians were killed. The tensions between the Muslim and colon communities exploded on May 8, 1945, [[V-E Day]]. When a Muslim march was met with violence, marchers rampaged. The army and police responded by conducting a prolonged and systematic ratissage (literally, raking over) of suspected centers of dissidence. According to official French figures, 1,500 Muslims died as a result of these countermeasures. Other estimates vary from 6,000 to as high as 45,000 killed. Many nationalists drew the conclusion that independence could not be won by peaceful means, and so started organizing for violent rebellion.\n\nIn August 1947, the [[French National Assembly]] approved the government-proposed [[Organic Statute of Algeria]]. This law called for the creation of an Algerian Assembly with one house representing Europeans and \"meritorious\" Muslims and the other representing the remaining 8 million or more Muslims. Muslim and colon deputies alike abstained or voted against the statute but for diametrically opposed reasons: the Muslims because it fell short of their expectations and the colons because it went too far.\n\n=== Algerian War of Independence (1954\u20131962) ===\n{{main|Algerian War of Independence}}\n\nThe [[Algerian War of Independence]] (1954\u20131962), brutal and long, was the most recent major turning point in the country's history. Although often fratricidal, it ultimately united Algerians and seared the value of independence and the philosophy of [[anticolonialism]] into the national consciousness. Abusive tactics of the [[French Army]] remains a controversial subject in France to this day.\n\nIn the early morning hours of November 1, 1954, the National Liberation Front ([[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale]]\u2014FLN) launched attacks throughout Algeria in the opening salvo of a [[Algerian War of Independence|war of independence]]. An important watershed in this war was the massacre of civilians by the FLN near the town of Philippeville in August 1955. The government claimed it killed 1,273 guerrillas in retaliation; according to the FLN, 12,000 Muslims perished in an orgy of bloodletting by the armed forces and police, as well as colon gangs. After Philippeville, all-out war began in Algeria. The FLN fought largely using guerrilla tactics whilst the French counter-insurgency tactics often included severe reprisals and repression.\n\nEventually, protracted negotiations led to a cease-fire signed by France and the FLN on March 18, 1962, at [[Evian, France]]. The [[Evian accords]] also provided for continuing economic, financial, technical, and cultural relations, along with interim administrative arrangements until a [[referendum]] on self-determination could be held. The Evian accords guaranteed the religious and property rights of French settlers, but the perception that they would not be respected led to the exodus of one million ''pieds-noirs'' and ''harkis''.\n\nBetween 350,000 and 1 million Algerians are estimated to have died during the war, and more than 2 million, out of a total [[Muslim]] population of 9 or 10 million, were made into refugees or forcibly relocated into government-controlled camps. Much of the countryside and [[agriculture]] was devastated, along with the modern [[Economic system|economy]], which had been dominated by urban European [[settler]]s (the ''[[pied-noir]]s''). French sources estimated that at least 70,000 Muslim civilians were killed or abducted and presumed killed, by the FLN during the [[Algerian War]]. Nearly one million people of mostly French, Spanish and Italian<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kimmelman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/world/europe/05iht-kimmel.4.20622745.html?pagewanted=all |title=Footprints of pieds-noirs reach deep into France |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2017-06-24}}</ref> descent were forced to flee the country at independence due to the unbridgeable rifts opened by the civil war and threats from units of the victorious FLN; along with them fled most Algerians of [[Jew]]ish descent and those Muslim Algerians who had supported a French Algeria (''[[harki]]s''). 30\u2013150,000 pro-French Muslims were also killed in Algeria by FLN in post-war reprisals.<ref>Alistair Horne, A Savage War of Peace (1977)</ref>\n\n== Independent Algeria ==\n{{main|History of Algeria since 1962}}\n\n=== Ben Bella presidency (1962\u201365) ===\nThe [[Algerian \u00c9vian Accords referendum, 1962|referendum]] was held in Algeria on 1 July 1962, and France declared Algeria independent on 3 July. On 8 September 1963, a [[Constitution of Algeria|constitution]] was adopted by [[Algerian constitutional referendum, 1963|referendum]], and later that month, [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] was formally elected the first president. The war for independence and its aftermath had severely disrupted Algeria's society and economy. In addition to the physical destruction, the exodus of the ''colons'' deprived the country of most of its managers, civil servants, engineers, teachers, physicians, and skilled workers. The homeless and displaced numbered in the hundreds of thousands, many suffering from illness, and some 70 percent of the workforce was unemployed.<ref>Ruedy, John. ''Modern Algeria: The Origins and Development of a Nation'' (2nd ed. 2005)</ref>\n\nThe months immediately following independence witnessed the pell-mell rush of Algerians, their government, and its officials to claim the property and jobs left behind by the Europeans. In the 1963 March Decrees, Ben Bella declared that all agricultural, industrial, and commercial properties previously owned and operated by Europeans were vacant, thereby legalizing confiscation by the state. A new constitution drawn up under close FLN supervision was approved by nationwide referendum in September 1963, and Ben Bella was confirmed as the party's choice to lead the country for a five-year term.\n\nUnder the new constitution, Ben Bella as president combined the functions of [[chief of state]] and [[head of government]] with those of supreme commander of the armed forces. He formed his government without needing legislative approval and was responsible for the definition and direction of its policies. There was no effective institutional check on its powers. Opposition leader [[Hocine A\u00eft-Ahmed]] quit the National Assembly in 1963 to protest the increasingly dictatorial tendencies of the regime and formed a clandestine resistance movement, the Front of Socialist Forces ([[Front des Forces Socialistes]]\u2014FFS) dedicated to overthrowing the Ben Bella regime by force.\n\nLate summer 1963 saw sporadic incidents attributed to the FFS. More serious fighting broke out a year later. The army moved quickly and in force to crush the rebellion. As minister of defense, [[Houari Boum\u00e9dienne]] had no qualms about sending the army to put down regional uprisings because he felt they posed a threat to the state. However, when Ben Bella attempted to co-opt allies from among some of those regionalists, tensions increased between Houari Boum\u00e9dienne and [[Ahmed Ben Bella]]. In 1965 the military toppled Ahmed Ben Bella, and Houari Boumedienne became head of state. The military has dominated Algerian politics until today.\n\n=== The 1965 coup and the Boum\u00e9dienne military regime ===\n[[File:Algerian Economy 1972.ogv|thumb|Newsreel film about the Algerian economy in 1972]]\n\nOn 19 June 1965, [[Houari Boum\u00e9dienne]] deposed Ahmed Ben Bella in a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] that was both swift and bloodless. Ben Bella \"[[forced disappearance|disappeared]]\", and would not be seen again until he was released from house arrest in 1980 by Boum\u00e9dienne's successor, Colonel [[Chadli Bendjedid]]. Boum\u00e9dienne immediately dissolved the National Assembly and suspended the 1963 constitution. Political power resided in the [[Council of the Revolution]], a predominantly military body intended to foster cooperation among various factions in the army and the party.\n\nHouari Boum\u00e9dienne's position as head of government and of state was initially not secure partly because of his lack of a significant power base outside the armed forces; he relied strongly on a network of former associates known as the Oujda group (after his posting as [[Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale|ALN]] leader in the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] border town of [[Oujda]] during the war years), but he could not fully dominate the fractious regime. This situation may have accounted for his deference to collegial rule.\n\nFollowing attempted coups\u2014most notably that of chief-of-staff [[Col.]] [[Tahar Zbiri]] in December 1967\u2014and a failed [[assassination]] attempt in (April 25, 1968), Boum\u00e9dienne consolidated power and forced military and political factions to submit. He took a systematic, authoritarian approach to state building, arguing that Algeria needed stability and an economic base before any political institutions.\n\nEleven years after [[Houari Boum\u00e9dienne]] took power, after much public debate, a long-promised new constitution was promulgated in November 1976, and Boum\u00e9dienne was elected president with 95 percent of the cast votes.\n\n=== Bendjedid rule (1978\u201392) and the rise of the civil war ===\nBoum\u00e9dienne's death on December 27, 1978 set off a struggle within the FLN to choose a successor. To break a deadlock between two candidates, Colonel [[Chadli Bendjedid]], a moderate who had collaborated with Boum\u00e9dienne in deposing [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], was sworn in on February 9, 1979. He was re-elected in 1984 and 1988. After the violent [[1988 October Riots]], a new constitution was adopted in 1989 that allowed the formation of political associations other than the FLN. It also removed the [[armed forces]], which had run the government since the days of Boum\u00e9dienne, from a role in the operation of the government.\n\nAmong the scores of parties that sprang up under the new constitution, the militant [[Islamic Salvation Front]] (FIS) was the most successful, winning more than 50% of all votes cast in [[municipal]] elections in June 1990 as well as in first stage of national legislative elections held in December 1991.\n\nThe surprising first round of success for the fundamentalist FIS party in the December 1991 balloting caused the army to intervene, crack down on the FIS, and postpone subsequent elections. The fundamentalist response has resulted in a continuous low-grade, conflict, the [[Algerian Civil War]], with the secular state apparatus, which nonetheless has allowed elections featuring pro-government and moderate religious-based parties. This civil war lasted until 2002.\n\n=== Normalization under Bouteflika (1999) ===\nIn 1996 a referendum introduced changes to the constitution, enhancing presidential powers and banning Islamist parties. Presidential elections were held in April 1999. Although seven candidates qualified for election, all but [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]], who appeared to have the support of the military as well as the FLN, withdrew on the eve of the election amid charges of electoral fraud. Bouteflika went on to win with 70 percent of the cast votes.\n\nFollowing his election to a five-year term, Bouteflika concentrated on restoring security and stability to the strife-ridden country. As part of his endeavor, he successfully campaigned to provide amnesty to thousands of members of the banned FIS. The so-called Civil Concord was approved in a nationwide referendum in September 2000. The [[:wikt:reconciliation|reconciliation]] by no means ended all violence, but it reduced violence to manageable levels. An estimated 80% of those fighting the regime accepted the amnesty offer.\n\nThe president also formed national commissions to study reforms of the education system, judiciary, and state bureaucracy. President Bouteflika was rewarded for his efforts at stabilizing the country when he was elected to another five-year term in April 2004, in an election contested by six candidates without military interference. In September 2005, another referendum\u2014this one to consider a proposed Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation\u2014passed by an overwhelming margin. The charter coupled another amnesty offer to all but the most violent participants in the Islamist uprising with an implicit pardon for security forces accused of abuses in fighting the rebels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Culture of Algeria]]\n* [[Colonial Heads of Algeria]]\n* [[Heads of Government of Algeria]]\n* [[History of Africa]]\n* [[History of North Africa]]\n* [[List of Presidents of Algeria]]\n* [[Politics of Algeria]]\n* [[Prime Minister of Algeria|Prime Ministers of Algeria]]\n* History of cities in Algeria:\n** Algiers [[Algiers#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Algiers|timeline]]\n** Oran [[Oran#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Oran|timeline]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n1.{{note|a}} The indigenous peoples of northern Africa were identified by the Romans as ''Berbers'', a word derived from the word ''Barbare'' or ''Barbarian'', but they prefer being called \"Imazighen\".\n2. {{note|b}} On the Banu Hilal invasion, see Ibn Khaldoun (v.1).\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ageron, Charles Robert, and Michael Brett.

In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including, the imposition of economic sanctions by western countries led by the United Kingdom, and also due to wide spread corruption in government. Economic instability caused a lot of Zimbabweans to move overseas or to neighboring countries. Prior to its recognized independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the nation had been known by several names: [[Rhodesia]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] and [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]].\n\n== Pre-Colonial era (1000\u20131887) ==\n\n{{main|Pre-colonial history of Zimbabwe}} {{See also|Bantu expansion}}\n[[File:San-Paintings Murewa ZW.jpg|thumb|Stoneage paintings by the San located near [[Murewa]], Zimbebwe.]]\nPrior to the arrival of Bantu speakers in present-day Zimbabwe the region was populated by ancestors of the [[San people]].

Many fragments of ceramic figurines have been recovered from there, figures of animals and birds, and also fertility dolls. The inhabitants produced ivory bracelets and other ivory goods. Imported beads found there and at other Zhizo sites, are evidence of trade, probably of ivory and skins, with traders on the Indian Ocean coast.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=P. Mitchell |author2=G.

The terms eastern and western streams represent the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples in terms of their culture. Another question is the branches of the Bantu languages which they spoke. It seems that the makers of the Ziwa/Gokomere wares were not the ancestral speakers of the [[Shona languages]] of today's Zimbabwe, who did not arrive in there until around the tenth century, from south of the Limpopo river, and whose ceramic culture belonged to the western stream. The linguist and historian Ehret believes that in view of the similarity of the Ziwa/Gokomere pottery to the Nkope of the ancestral [[Nyasa languages|Nyasa]] language speakers, the Ziwa/Gokomere people spoke a language closely related to the Nyasa group. Their language, whatever it was, was superseded by the ancestral Shona languages, although Ehret says that a set of Nyasa words occur in central Shona dialects today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ehret|first=C.|title=An African Classical Age|year=2001|publisher=University Press of Virginia|pages=239}}</ref>\n\nThe evidence that the ancestral Shona speakers came from South Africa is that the ceramic styles associated with Shona speakers in Zimbabwe from the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries can be traced back to western stream (Kalunndu) pottery styles in South Africa.

While it may well be the case that the people of the western stream spoke a language belonging to a wider Eastern Bantu division, it is a puzzle which remains to be resolved that they spoke a language most closely related to the languages just mentioned, all of which are today spoken in southeastern Africa.\n\nAfter the Shona speaking people moved into the present day Zimbabwe many different dialects developed over time in the different parts of the country. Among these was [[Kalanga language|Kalanga]].\n\n[[File:Tower, Great Zimbabwe1.jpg|thumb|Towers of [[Great Zimbabwe]].]]\nIt is believed that Kalanga speaking societies first emerged in the middle Limpopo valley in the 9th century before moving on to the Zimbabwean highlands. The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Kalanga states. The [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] was the first in a series of sophisticated trade states developed in Zimbabwe by the time of the first European explorers from Portugal. They traded in gold, [[ivory]] and copper for cloth and glass. From about 1250 until 1450, Mapungubwe was eclipsed by the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]]. This Kalanga state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of [[Great Zimbabwe]]. From circa 1450\u20131760, Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. This Kalanga state ruled much of the area that is known as Zimbabwe today, and parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as Mwenemutapa was known for its gold trade routes with [[Arabs]] and the Portuguese. However, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] settlers destroyed the trade and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historical Archaeology |last=Hall |first=Martin |authorlink= |author2=Stephen W. Silliman |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location= |isbn=978-1-4051-0751-8 |page= |pages=241\u2013244 |url= }}</ref> As a direct response to Portuguese aggression in the interior, a new Kalanga state emerged called the [[Rozwi Empire]]. Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (which means \"destroyers\") removed the Portuguese from the Zimbabwe plateau by force of arms. The Rozwi continued the stone building traditions of the Zimbabwe and Mapungubwe kingdoms while adding guns to its arsenal and developing a professional army to protect its trade routes and conquests. Around 1821, the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] general [[Mzilikazi]] of the Khumalo clan successfully rebelled from King [[Shaka]] and created his own clan, the [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]]. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers|trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, along with the other petty Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to [[vassal]]dom.\n\nAfter losing their remaining South African lands in 1840, Mzilikazi and his tribe permanently settled the southwest of present-day Zimbabwe in what became known as [[Matabeleland]], establishing [[Bulawayo]] as their capital. Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868 and, following a violent power struggle, was succeeded by his son, [[Lobengula]].\n\n== Colonial era (1888\u20131980) ==\n\n{{Main|Southern Rhodesia|Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland}}\n\nIn the 1880s, the British arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]' [[British South Africa Company]].

As colonial rule was ending throughout the continent and as African-majority governments assumed control in neighbouring [[Northern Rhodesia]] and in [[Nyasaland]], the [[white minority rule|white-minority]] Rhodesian government led by [[Ian Smith]] made a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI)]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The United Kingdom deemed this an act of rebellion, but did not re-establish control by force. The white minority government declared itself a republic in 1970. A civil war ensued, with [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[ZAPU]] and [[Robert Mugabe]]'s [[ZANU]] using assistance from the governments of [[Zambia]] and [[Mozambique]]. Although Smith's declaration was not recognised by the United Kingdom nor any other foreign power, Southern Rhodesia dropped the designation \"Southern\", and claimed nation status as the [[Rhodesia|Republic of Rhodesia]] in 1970<ref name=\"declaration\">Judd, Denis.

The government held independence celebrations in Rufaro stadium in [[Harare|Salisbury]], the capital. Lord [[Christopher Soames]], the last [[Governor of Southern Rhodesia]], watched as [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], gave a farewell salute and the Rhodesian Signal Corps played \"[[God Save the Queen]]\". Many foreign dignitaries also attended, including Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] of India, President [[Shehu Shagari]] of Nigeria, President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of Zambia, President [[Seretse Khama]] of Botswana, and Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] of Australia, representing the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. [[Bob Marley]] sang 'Zimbabwe', a song he wrote, at the government's invitation in a concert at the country's independence festivities.<ref name=g>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Lizzie|year=2005|title=Africa Overland|pages=169\u2013170}}</ref><ref name=h>{{cite book|last=Pakenham|first=Thomas|year=1992|title=Scramble for Africa: White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876 to 1912|page=669}}</ref>\n\nPresident Shagari pledged $15 million at the celebration to train Zimbabweans in Zimbabwe and [[expatriates]] in Nigeria. Mugabe's government used part of the money to buy newspaper companies owned by South Africans, increasing the government's control over the media. The rest went to training students in Nigerian universities, government workers in the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria in [[Badagry]], and soldiers in the Nigerian Defence Academy in [[Kaduna]]. Later that year Mugabe commissioned a report by the BBC on [[press freedom]] in Zimbabwe. The BBC issued its report on 26 June, recommending the privatisation of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation and its independence from political interests.<ref name=i>{{cite book|last=Abegunrin|first=Olayiwola|year=2003|title=Nigerian Foreign Policy Under Military Rule, 1966\u20131999|page=89}}</ref><ref name=j>{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline Audrey|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|page=711}}</ref> ''See also:'' [[Foreign relations of Zimbabwe]]\n\nMugabe's government changed the capital's name from Salisbury to [[Harare]] on 18 April 1982 in celebration of the second anniversary of independence.<ref name=k>{{cite book|last=Kalley|first=Jacqueline Audrey|year=1999|title=Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997|page=718}}</ref> The government renamed the main street in the capital, Jameson Avenue, in honour of [[Samora Machel]], [[President of Mozambique]].\n\nThe new Constitution provided for an executive{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} President as Head of State with a Prime Minister as Head of Government. Reverend [[Canaan Banana]] served as the first President. In government amended the Constitution in 1987 to provide for an Executive President and abolished the office of Prime Minister. The constitutional changes came into effect on 1 January 1988 with Robert Mugabe as President. The bicameral [[Parliament of Zimbabwe]] had a directly elected House of Assembly and an indirectly elected Senate, partly made up of tribal chiefs. The Constitution established two separate voters rolls, one for the black majority, who had 80% of the seats in Parliament, and the other for whites and other ethnic minorities, such as [[Coloured]]s, people of mixed race, and Asians, who held 20%. The government amended the Constitution in 1986, eliminating the voter rolls and replacing the white seats with seats filled by nominated members. Many white MPs joined ZANU which then reappointed them. In 1990 the government abolished the Senate and increased the House of Assembly's membership to include members nominated by the President.\n\nPrime Minister Mugabe kept [[Peter Walls]], the head of the army, in his government and put him in charge of integrating the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA), [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA), and the [[Rhodesian Army]]. While Western media outlets praised Mugabe's efforts at reconciliation with the [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white minority]], tension soon developed.<ref name=b>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,921868,00.html Walls: \"We will make it work\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930072147/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,921868,00.html |date=30 September 2007 }} TIME magazine and CNN</ref> On 17 March 1980, after several unsuccessful assassination attempts Mugabe asked Walls, \"Why are your men trying to kill me?\" Walls replied, \"If they were my men you would be dead.\"<ref name=c>Raymond, Walter John.

Mugabe, returning from a visit with United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] in New York City, said, \"One thing is quite clear\u2014we are not going to have disloyal characters in our society.\" Walls returned to Zimbabwe after the interview, telling Peter Hawthorne of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"To stay away at this time would have appeared like an admission of guilt.\" Mugabe drafted legislation that would exile Walls from Zimbabwe for life and Walls moved to South Africa.<ref name=e>[http://www.dispatch.co.za/2000/12/21/foreign/DBACKFIR.HTM Zanu-PF's Walls 'manhunt' backfires] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031130204757/http://www.dispatch.co.za/2000/12/21/foreign/DBACKFIR.HTM |date=30 November 2003 }} Dispatch</ref><ref name=f>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,922125,00.html A soldier faces his critics] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130204124312/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,922125,00.html |date=4 February 2013 }} TIME magazine and CNN</ref>\n\nEthnic divisions soon came back to the forefront of national politics. Tension between ZAPU and ZANU erupted with guerrilla activity starting again in [[Matabeleland]] in south-western Zimbabwe. Nkomo (ZAPU) left for exile in Britain and did not return until Mugabe guaranteed his safety. In 1982 government security officials discovered large caches of arms and ammunition on properties owned by ZAPU, accusing Nkomo and his followers of plotting to overthrow the government. Mugabe fired Nkomo and his closest aides from the cabinet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Seven MPs, members of the Rhodesian Front, left Smith's party to sit as \"independents\" on 4 March 1982, signifying their dissatisfaction with his policies.<ref name=k/> As a result of what they saw as persecution of Nkomo and his party, PF-ZAPU supporters, army deserters began a campaign of dissidence against the government. Centring primarily in Matabeleland, home of the Ndebeles who were at the time PF-ZAPU's main followers, this dissidence continued through 1987. It involved attacks on government personnel and installations, armed banditry aimed at disrupting security and economic life in the rural areas, and harassment of ZANU-PF members.<ref name=l>{{cite news|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ad28|title=HISTORY OF ZIMBABWE|work=History World|date=4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the unsettled security situation immediately after independence and democratic sentiments, the government kept in force a \"state of emergency\". This gave the government widespread powers under the \"Law and Order Maintenance Act,\" including the right to detain persons without charge which it used quite widely. In 1983 to 1984 the government declared a curfew in areas of Matabeleland and sent in the army in an attempt to suppress members of the Ndebele tribe. The pacification campaign, known as the Gukuruhundi, or strong wind, resulted in at least 20,000 civilian deaths perpetrated by an elite, North Korean-trained brigade, known in Zimbabwe as the [[Gukurahundi]].\n\nZANU-PF increased its majority in the 1985 elections, winning 67 of the 100 seats. The majority gave Mugabe the opportunity to start making changes to the constitution, including those with regard to land restoration. Fighting did not cease until Mugabe and Nkomo reached an agreement in December 1987 whereby ZAPU became part of ZANU-PF and the government changed the constitution to make Mugabe the country's first executive president and Nkomo one of two vice-presidents.\n\n==1990s==\nElections in March 1990 resulted in another overwhelming victory for Mugabe and his party, which won 117 of the 120 election seats. Election observers estimated [[voter turnout]] at only 54% and found the campaign neither free nor fair{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}, though balloting met international standards. Unsatisfied with a ''de facto'' [[one-party state]], Mugabe called on the ZANU-PF Central Committee to support the creation of a ''[[de jure]]'' one-party state in September 1990 and lost. The government began further amending the constitution. The judiciary and human rights advocates fiercely criticised the first amendments enacted in April 1991 because they restored corporal and capital punishment and denied recourse to the courts in cases of compulsory purchase of land by the government. The general health of the civilian population also began to significantly flounder and by 1997 25% of the population of Zimbabwe had been infected by HIV, the [[AIDS virus]].\n\nDuring the 1990s students, trade unionists, and workers often demonstrated to express their discontent with the government. Students protested in 1990 against proposals for an increase in government control of universities and again in 1991 and 1992 when they clashed with police. Trade unionists and workers also criticised the government during this time. In 1992 police prevented trade unionists from holding anti-government demonstrations. In 1994 widespread industrial unrest weakened the economy. In 1996 civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues.\n\nOn 9 December 1997 a national strike paralysed the country. Mugabe was panicked by demonstrations by [[Zanla]] ex-combatants, war veterans, who had been the heart of incursions 20 years earlier in the Bush War. He agreed to pay them large gratuities and pensions, which proved to be a wholly unproductive and unbudgeted financial commitment. The discontent with the government spawned draconian government crackdowns which in turn started to destroy both the fabric of the state and of society. This in turn brought with it further discontent within the population. Thus a vicious downward spiral commenced.<ref name=\"Polsci\">{{cite news|url=http://ips.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/91|title=From Corporatism to Liberalization in Zimbabwe: Economic Policy Regimes and Political Crisis, 1980\u201397|work=[[International Political Science Review]]|volume=26|issue=1|pages=91\u2013106|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nAlthough many whites had left Zimbabwe after independence, mainly for neighbouring South Africa, those who remained continued to wield disproportionate control of some sectors of the economy, especially agriculture. In the late-1990s whites accounted for less than 1% of the population but owned 70% of [[arable land]]. Mugabe raised this issue of land ownership by white farmers. In a calculated move, he began forcible land redistribution, which brought the government into headlong conflict with the International Monetary Fund. Amid a severe drought in the region, the police and military were instructed not to stop the invasion of white-owned farms by the so-called 'war veterans' and youth militia. This has led to a mass migration of White Zimbabweans out of Zimbabwe. At present almost no arable land is in the possession of white farmers.\n\n===The economy during the 1980s and 1990s===\n{{Main|Economic history of Zimbabwe}}\nThe economy was run along corporatist lines with strict governmental controls on all aspects of the economy. Controls were placed on wages, prices and massive increases in government spending resulting in significant [[budget deficits]]. This experiment met with very mixed results and Zimbabwe fell further behind the first world and unemployment. Some market reforms in the 1990s were attempted. A 40 per cent devaluation of the [[Zimbabwean dollar]] was allowed to occur and price and wage controls were removed. These policies also failed at that time. Growth, employment, wages, and social service spending contracted sharply, inflation did not improve, the deficit remained well above target, and many industrial firms, notably in textiles and footwear, closed in response to increased competition and high real interest rates. The incidence of poverty in the country increased during this time.\n\n==1999 to 2000==\n{{See also|Land reform in Zimbabwe}}\nHowever, Zimbabwe began experiencing a period of considerable political and economic upheaval in 1999. Opposition to President Mugabe and the ZANU-PF government grew considerably after the mid-1990s in part due to worsening economic and human rights conditions brought about by crippling economic sanctions imposed by western countries led by Britain in response to land seizures from the White minority farmers.<ref name=\"Zimonline1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=633 |title=REPORT: Policing the State \u2013 an evaluation of 1,981 political arrests in Zimbabwe: 2000\u20132005 |work=zimonline.co.za |date=15 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081905/http://www.zimonline.co.za/Article.aspx?ArticleId=633 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Movement for Democratic Change (pre-2005)|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC) was established in September 1999 as an opposition party founded by trade unionist [[Morgan Tsvangirai]].\n\nThe MDC's first opportunity to test opposition to the Mugabe government came in February 2000, when a referendum was held on a draft constitution proposed by the government. Among its elements, the new constitution would have permitted President Mugabe to seek two additional terms in office, granted government officials immunity from prosecution, and authorised government seizure of white-owned land. The referendum was handily defeated. Shortly thereafter, the government, through a loosely organised group of war veterans,some of the so-called war veterans judging from their age were not war veterans as they were too young to have fought in the chimurenga, sanctioned an aggressive land redistribution program often characterised by forced expulsion of white farmers and violence against both farmers and farm employees.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n[[Zimbabwean parliamentary election, 2000|Parliamentary elections held in June 2000]] were marred by localised violence, and claims of electoral irregularities and government intimidation of opposition supporters.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Nonetheless, the MDC succeeded in capturing 57 of 120 seats in the National Assembly.\n\n==2002==\nPresidential elections were held in March 2002. In the months leading up to the poll, ZANU-PF, with the support of the army, security services, and especially the so-called 'war veterans',  \u2013 very few of whom actually fought in the [[Second Chimurenga]] against the Smith regime in the 1970s \u2013 set about wholesale intimidation and suppression of the MDC-led opposition{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}.

The government's behaviour drew strong criticism from the EU and the USA, which imposed limited sanctions against the leading members of the Mugabe regime. Since the 2002 election, Zimbabwe has suffered further economic difficulty and growing political chaos.\n\n==2003\u20132005==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}\n[[Image:Zimbabwe \u00a38 in local currency in 2003.jpg|thumb|[[GBP]] 8 worth of [[Zimbabwean dollar]]s in 2003]]\nDivisions within the opposition MDC had begun to fester early in the decade, after Morgan Tsvangirai (the president of the MDC) was lured  {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} into a government sting operation that videotaped him talking of Mr. Mugabe's removal from power. He was subsequently arrested and put on trial on treason charges. This crippled his control of party affairs and raised questions about his competence. It also catalysed a major split within the party. In 2004 he was acquitted, but not until after suffering serious abuse and mistreatment in prison. {{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The opposing faction was led by [[Welshman Ncube]] who was the general secretary of the party. In mid-2004, vigilantes loyal to Mr. Tsvangirai began attacking members who were mostly loyal to Ncube, climaxing in a September raid on the party's Harare headquarters in which the security director was nearly thrown to his death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/world/africa/09zimbabwe.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin|title=Opposition Splits While Zimbabwe Slips|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 May 2007 | first=Michael | last=Wines | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn internal party inquiry later established that aides to Tsvangirai had tolerated, if not endorsed, the violence. Divisive as the violence was, it was a debate over the rule of law that set off the party's final break-up in November 2005. These division severely weakened the opposition.

Ncube's supporters argued that the M.D.C. should field a slate of candidates; Tsvangirai's argued for a boycott.

As a result, the elections for a new Senate in November 2005 were largely boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe's party won 24 of the 31 constituencies where elections were held amid low voter turnout.

This converted all ownership rights into leases. The amendments also ended the right of landowners to challenge government expropriation of land in the courts and marked the end of any hope of returning any land that had been hitherto grabbed by armed land invasions. Elections for the senate in November resulted in a victory for the government. The MDC split over whether to field candidates and partially boycotted the vote. In addition to low turnout there was widespread government intimidation. The split in the MDC hardened into factions, each of which claimed control of the party. The early months of 2006 were marked by food shortages and mass hunger. The sheer extremity of the siltation was revealed by the fact that in the courts, state witnesses said they were too weak from hunger to testify.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1580389,00.html|title=Zimbabwe's economic crisis drives it back into steam age|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 September 2005 | location=London | first=Andrew | last=Meldrum | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==2006 to 2007==\nIn August 2006 runaway inflation forced the government to replace its existing currency with a revalued one.

The state [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire]] in 988, beginning the synthesis of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures that defined [[Orthodox Slavs|Orthodox Slavic]] culture for the next millennium. Kievan Rus' ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasions]] in 1237\u20131240 along with the resulting deaths of about half the population of Rus'.\n\nAfter the 13th century, Moscow became a cultural center, and by the 18th century, the [[Tsardom of Russia]] had grown to become the [[Russian Empire]], stretching from eastern Poland to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Peasant revolts were common, and all were fiercely suppressed. [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfdom]] was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished in 1861]], but the peasants fared poorly and often turned to revolutionary pressures. In the following decades, reform efforts such as the [[Stolypin reform]]s, the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|constitution of 1906]], and the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]] attempted to open and liberalize the economy and political system, but the tsars refused to relinquish autocratic rule or share their power.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 was triggered by a combination of economic breakdown, war-weariness, and discontent with the autocratic system of government. It initially brought to power a coalition of liberals and moderate socialists, but their failed policies led to seizure of power by the [[Communism|communist]] [[Bolsheviks]] on 25 October. Between 1922 and 1991, the history of Russia is essentially the [[history of the Soviet Union]], effectively an ideologically based state which was roughly conterminous with the Russian Empire before the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The approach to the building of socialism, however, varied over different periods in Soviet history, from the mixed economy and diverse society and culture of the 1920s to the command economy and repressions of the [[Joseph Stalin]] era to the \"era of stagnation\" in the 1980s. From its first years, government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communists, as the Bolsheviks called themselves, beginning in March 1918.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, with the weaknesses of its economic and political structures becoming acute, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] embarked on major reforms, which led to the overthrow of the communist party and the breakup of the USSR, leaving Russia again on its own and marking the start of the [[History of Russia (1991\u2013present)|history of post-Soviet Russia]]. The Russian Federation began in January 1992 as the legal successor to the USSR. Russia retained its nuclear arsenal but lost its superpower status.

Refusing further tribute to the Tatars, Ivan initiated a series of attacks that opened the way for the complete defeat of the declining [[Golden Horde]], now divided into several [[Khanate]]s and hordes. Ivan and his successors sought to protect the southern boundaries of their domain against attacks of the [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimean Tatars]] and other hordes.<ref>[http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=The_Crimean_Khanate The Tatar Khanate of Crimea]</ref> To achieve this aim, they sponsored the construction of the [[Great Abatis Belt]] and granted manors to nobles, who were obliged to serve in the military. The manor system provided a basis for an emerging cavalry based army.\n\nIn this way, internal consolidation accompanied outward expansion of the state. By the 16th century, the rulers of Moscow considered the entire Russian territory their collective property. Various semi-independent princes still claimed specific territories,<ref name=\"EB_IvanIII\"/> but Ivan III forced the lesser princes to acknowledge the grand prince of Moscow and his descendants as unquestioned rulers with control over military, judicial, and foreign affairs.

The [[Romanov]] dynasty ruled Russia until 1917.\n\nThe immediate task of the new dynasty was to restore peace. Fortunately for Moscow, its major enemies, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Sweden]], were engaged in a bitter conflict with each other, which provided Russia the opportunity to make peace with Sweden in 1617 and to sign a truce with the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1619.\n\nRecovery of lost territories began in the mid-17th century, when the [[Chmielnicki Uprising|Khmelnitsky Uprising]] (1648\u201357) in Ukraine against Polish rule brought about the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], concluded between Russia and the [[Ukrainian Cossacks]]. According to the treaty, Russia granted protection to the [[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossacks state]] in [[Left-bank Ukraine]], formerly under Polish control. This triggered a prolonged [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)]], which ended with the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], where Poland accepted the loss of Left-bank Ukraine, [[Kiev]] and [[Smolensk]].<ref name = Curtis2/>\n\nRather than risk their estates in more civil war, the boyars cooperated with the first Romanovs, enabling them to finish the work of bureaucratic centralization. Thus, the state required service from both the old and the new nobility, primarily in the military. In return, the tsars allowed the boyars to complete the process of enserfing the peasants.\n\n[[File:surikov1906.jpg|thumb|[[Stenka Razin]] Sailing in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]]]]\n\nIn the preceding century, the state had gradually curtailed peasants' rights to move from one landlord to another. With the state now fully sanctioning [[Russian serfdom|serfdom]], runaway peasants became state fugitives, and the power of the landlords over the peasants \"attached\" to their land had become almost complete. Together the state and the nobles placed an overwhelming burden of taxation on the peasants, whose rate was 100 times greater in the mid-17th century than it had been a century earlier. In addition, middle-class urban tradesmen and craftsmen were assessed taxes, and, like the serfs, they were forbidden to change residence. All segments of the population were subject to military levy and to special taxes.<ref>For a discussion of the development of the class structure in Tsarist Russia see [[Theda Skocpol|Skocpol, Theda]].

However, a population of only 14 million was stretched across this vast landscape. With a short growing season grain yields trailed behind those in the West and potato farming was not yet widespread. As a result, the great majority of the population workforce was occupied with agriculture.  Russia remained isolated from the sea trade and its internal trade, communication and manufacturing were seasonally dependent.<ref>[http://bookz.ru/authors/milov-lv/milovlv01/1-milovlv01.html Milov L.V. \u00abRussian peasant and features of the Russian historical process\u00bb, the research of Russian economic history of 15th\u201318th centuries.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Russia 1533-1896.gif|thumb|left|Russian expansion in Eurasia between 1533\u20131896]]\n\nPeter's first military efforts were directed against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]].  His aim was to establish a Russian foothold on the [[Black Sea]] by taking the town of [[Azov]].<ref>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire'' (1979) p. 353.</ref> His attention then turned to the north. Peter still lacked a secure northern seaport except at [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] on the [[White Sea]], whose harbor was frozen nine months a year. Access to the Baltic was blocked by Sweden, whose territory enclosed it on three sides. Peter's ambitions for a \"window to the sea\" led him in 1699 to make a secret alliance with the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Denmark against Sweden resulting in the [[Great Northern War]].\n\nThe war ended in 1721 when an exhausted Sweden sued for peace with Russia. Peter acquired four provinces situated south and east of the Gulf of Finland, thus securing his coveted access to the sea. There, in 1703, he had already founded the city that was to become Russia's new capital, [[Saint Petersburg]], as a \"window opened upon Europe\" to replace Moscow, long Russia's cultural center. Russian intervention in the Commonwealth marked, with the [[Silent Sejm]], the beginning of a 200-year domination of that region by the Russian Empire.  In celebration of his conquests, Peter assumed the title of emperor, and the Russian Tsardom officially became the [[Russian Empire]] in 1721.\n\n[[File:Lomonosov Poltava 1762 1764.jpg|thumb|Peter the Great leading the Russian army in the [[Battle of Poltava]]]]\n\nPeter reorganized his government based on the latest Western models, molding Russia into an [[political absolutism|absolutist]] state. He replaced the old ''boyar'' [[Duma]] (council of nobles) with a nine-member senate, in effect a supreme council of state. The countryside was also divided into new [[Guberniya|provinces]] and districts. Peter told the senate that its mission was to collect tax revenues. In turn tax revenues tripled over the course of his reign.<ref>Lindsey Hughes, ''Russia in the Age of Peter the Great'' (1998)</ref>\n\nAdministrative [[Collegium (ministry)|Collegia]] (ministries) were established in St. Petersburg, to replace the old governmental departments. In 1722 Peter promulgated his famous [[Table of ranks]]. As part of the government reform, the Orthodox Church was partially incorporated into the country's administrative structure, in effect making it a tool of the state. Peter abolished the [[patriarchate]] and replaced it with a collective body, the [[Holy Synod]], led by a lay government official. Peter continued and intensified his predecessors' requirement of state service for all nobles.\n\nBy this same time, the once powerful Persian [[Safavid Empire]] to the south was heavily declining. Taking advantage of the profitable situation, Peter launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], known as \"The Persian Expedition of Peter the Great\" by Russian histographers, in order to be the first Russian emperor to establish Russian influence in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Caspian Sea]] region. After considerable success and the capture of many provinces and cities in the Caucasus and northern mainland Persia, the Safavids were forced to hand over the territories to Russia. However, by twelve years later, all the territories were ceded back to Persia, which was now led by the charismatic military genius [[Nader Shah]], as part of the [[Treaty of Resht]] and [[Treaty of Ganja]] and the Russo-Persian alliance against the Ottoman Empire,<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

While revenue rose from 9 million rubles in 1724 to 40 million in 1794, expenses grew more rapidly, reaching 49 million in 1794. The budget was allocated 46 percent to the military, 20 percent to government economic activities, 12 percent to administration, and nine percent for the Imperial Court in St. Petersburg. The deficit required borrowing, primarily from Amsterdam; five percent of the budget was allocated to debt payments. Paper money was issued to pay for expensive wars, thus causing inflation. For its spending, Russia obtained a large and glorious army, a very large and complex bureaucracy, and a splendid court that rivaled Paris and London. However, the government was living far beyond its means, and 18th-century Russia remained \"a poor, backward, overwhelmingly agricultural, and illiterate country.\"<ref>Nicholas Riasanovsky, ''A History of Russia'' (4th ed. 1984), p 284</ref>\n\nPeter I was succeeded by his second wife, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]] (1725\u20131727), who was merely a figurehead for a powerful group of high officials, then by his minor grandson, [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]] (1727\u20131730), then by his niece, [[Anna of Russia|Anna]] (1730\u20131740), daughter of Tsar [[Ivan V]].\n\n===Catherine the Great===\nNearly forty years were to pass before a comparably ambitious ruler appeared on the Russian throne.

To the south-west, Russia attempted to expand at the expense of the [[Ottoman Empire]], using Georgia at its base for the Caucasus and Anatolian front.\n\nIn European policy, Alexander I switched Russia back and forth four times in 1804\u20131812 from neutral peacemaker to anti-Napoleon to an ally of Napoleon, winding up in 1812 as Napoleon's enemy. In 1805, he joined Britain in the [[War of the Third Coalition]] against Napoleon, but after the massive defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] he switched and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] (1807) and joined Napoleon's [[Continental System]]. He fought [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u201312)|a small-scale naval war against Britain, 1807\u201312]]. He and Napoleon could never agree, especially about Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810.\n\nFurthermore, Russia's economy had been hurt by Napoleon's Continental System, which cut off trade with Britain.

He presided over the redrawing of the map of Europe at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which made him the king of [[Congress Poland]]. He formed the [[Holy Alliance]] with Austria and Prussia, to suppress revolutionary movements in Europe that he saw as immoral threats to legitimate Christian monarchs. He helped Austria's [[Klemens von Metternich]] in suppressing all national and liberal movements.\n\nAlthough the Russian Empire would play a leading political role as late as 1848, its retention of serfdom precluded economic progress of any significant degree. As West European economic growth accelerated during the Industrial Revolution, sea trade and colonialism which had begun in the second half of the 18th century, Russia began to lag ever farther behind, undermining its ability to field strong armies.\n\n===Nicholas I and the Decembrist Revolt===\n[[File:Kolman decembrists.jpg|thumb|The Decembrists at the [[Decembrists Square|Senate Square]].]]\n\nRussia's great power status obscured the inefficiency of its government, the isolation of its people, and its economic backwardness.<ref>Riasonovsky ''A History of Russia'' (fifth ed.) pp.302\u20133; Charques ''A Short History of Russia'' (Phoenix, second ed. 1962) p.125</ref> Following the defeat of Napoleon, Alexander I was willing to discuss constitutional reforms, and though a few were introduced, no thoroughgoing changes were attempted.<ref>Riasonovsky p.302-307</ref>\n\nThe tsar was succeeded by his younger brother, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1825\u20131855), who at the onset of his reign was confronted with an uprising. The background of this revolt lay in the Napoleonic Wars, when a number of well-educated Russian officers traveled in Europe in the course of the military campaigns, where their exposure to the liberalism of Western Europe encouraged them to seek change on their return to autocratic Russia. The result was the [[Decembrist Revolt]] (December 1825), the work of a small circle of liberal nobles and army officers who wanted to install Nicholas' brother as a constitutional monarch. But the revolt was easily crushed, leading Nicholas to turn away from liberal reforms and champion the reactionary doctrine \"[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Christopher Browning|author2=Marko Lehti|title=The Struggle for the West: A Divided and Contested Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a86NAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA36|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|page=36}}</ref>\n\nIn 1826\u20131828 Russia fought another war [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|against Persia]].

They had outdated equipment and tactics, but the tsar, who dressed like a soldier and surrounded himself with officers,  gloried in the victory over Napoleon in 1812 and took enormous pride in its smartness on parade.  The cavalry horses, for example, were only trained in parade formations, and did poorly in battle. The glitter and braid masked profound weaknesses that he did not see. He put generals in charge of most of his civilian agencies regardless of their qualifications. An agnostic who won fame in cavalry charges was made supervisor of  Church affairs. The Army became the vehicle of upward social mobility for noble youths from non-Russian areas, such as Poland, the Baltic, Finland and Georgia.  On the other hand, many miscreants, petty criminals and undesirables were punished by local officials by enlisting them for life in the  Army.  The conscription system was highly unpopular with people, as was the practice of forcing peasants to house the soldiers for six months of the year. Curtiss finds that \"The pedantry of Nicholas' military system, which stressed unthinking obedience and parade ground evolutions rather than combat training, produced ineffective commanders in time of war.\" His commanders in the Crimean War were old and incompetent, and indeed so were his muskets as the colonels sold the best equipment and the best food.<ref>{{cite journal |first=John Shelton |last=Curtiss |title=The Army of Nicholas I: Its Role and Character |journal=[[American Historical Review]] |year=1958 |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=880\u2013889 [quote p. 886] |jstor=1848945 }}</ref>\n\nFinally the Crimean war at the end of his reign demonstrated to the world what no one had previously realized: Russia was militarily weak, technologically backward, and administratively incompetent.  Despite his grand ambitions toward the south and Ottoman Empire, Russia had not built its railroad network in that direction, and communications were bad.  The bureaucracy was riddled with graft, corruption and inefficiency and was unprepared for war.  The Navy was weak and technologically backward; the Army, although very large, was good only for parades, suffered from colonels who pocketed their men's pay, poor morale, and was even more out of touch with the latest technology as developed by Britain and France.

Some favored imitating Europe while others renounced the West and called for a return of the traditions of the past. The latter path was championed by [[Slavophile]]s, who heaped scorn on the \"decadent\" West. The Slavophiles were opponents of bureaucracy and preferred the [[collectivism]] of the medieval Russian ''[[mir (social)|mir]]'', or [[obshchina|village community]], to the individualism of the West.<ref>Tim Chapman, ''Imperial Russia: 1801\u20131905'' (2001) pp 60\u201365  [https://www.questia.com/library/107435912/imperial-russia-1801-1905 online]</ref>\n\nSince the war against Napoleon, Russia had become deeply involved in the affairs of Europe, as part of the \"Holy Alliance.\" The Holy Alliance was formed to serve as the \"policeman of Europe.\" However, to be the policeman of Europe and maintain the alliance required large armies. Prussia, Austria, Britain and France (the other members of the alliance) lacked large armies and needed Russia to supply the required numbers, which fit the philosophy of Nicholas I. When the Revolutions of 1848 swept Europe, however, Russia was quiet. The Tsar sent his army into Hungary in 1849 at the request of the Austrian Empire and broke the revolt there, while preventing its spread to Russian Poland. The Tsar cracked down on any signs of internal unrest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Kort|title=A Brief History of Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i8_RH3hhsAMC&pg=PA92|year=2008|publisher=Infobase |page=92}}</ref>\n\nRussia expected that in exchange for supplying the troops to be the policeman of Europe, it should have a free hand in dealing with the decaying Ottoman Empire\u2014the \"sick man of Europe.\" In 1853 Russia invaded the Crimea peninsula and other regions, leading to the [[Crimean War]], and Britain and France came to the rescue of the Ottomans.<ref>Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp 84\u201394</ref><ref>Orlando Figes, ''The Crimean War: A History'' (2011)</ref> As Fuller notes, \"Russia had been beaten on the Crimean peninsula, and the military feared that it would inevitably be beaten again unless steps were taken to surmount its military weakness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=William C.

The freed peasants had to buy land, allotted to them, from the landowners with the state assistance. The Government issued special bonds to the landowners for the land that they had lost, and collected a special tax from the peasants, called redemption payments, at a rate of 5% of the total cost of allotted land yearly. All the land turned over to the peasants was owned collectively by the ''mir'', the village community, which divided the land among the peasants and supervised the various holdings.\n\n[[File:The defeat of Shipka Peak, Bulgarian War of Independence.JPG|thumb|The Russian and Bulgarian [[Battle of Shipka Pass|defence of Shipka Pass]] against Turkish troops was crucial for the independence of [[Bulgaria]].]]\n\nAlexander was the most successful Russian reformer since [[Peter the Great]], and was responsible for numerous reforms besides abolishing serfdom.

He joined with Germany and Austria in the League of the Three Emperors that stabilized the European situation. The Russian Empire expanded in Siberia and in the Caucasus and made gains at the expense of China.  Faced with an uprising in Poland in 1863, he stripped that land of its separate Constitution and incorporated it directly into Russia.

A term originally coined by [[Ivan Turgenev]] in his 1862 novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'', Nihilists favoured the destruction of human institutions and laws, based on the assumption that such institutions and laws are artificial and corrupt. At its core, Russian nihilism was characterized by the belief that the world lacks comprehensible meaning, objective truth, or value. For some time many Russian liberals had been dissatisfied by what they regarded as the empty discussions of the [[intelligentsia]]. The Nihilists questioned all old values and shocked the Russian establishment.<ref>Riasonovsky pp.381\u20132, 447\u20138</ref> They moved beyond being purely philosophical to becoming major political forces after becoming involved in the cause of reform. Their path was facilitated by the previous actions of the Decembrists, who revolted in 1825, and the financial and political hardship caused by the Crimean War, which caused large numbers of Russian people to lose faith in political institutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe Nihilists first attempted to convert the aristocracy to the cause of reform.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Failing there, they turned to the peasants.

The Industrial Revolution, which began to exert a significant influence in Russia, was meanwhile creating forces that would finally overthrow the tsar. Politically, these opposition forces organized into three competing parties: The liberal elements among the industrial capitalists and nobility, who believed in peaceful social reform and a constitutional monarchy, founded the [[Constitutional Democratic party]] or ''Kadets'' in 1905. Followers of the Narodnik tradition established the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] or ''Esers'' in 1901, advocating the distribution of land among those who actually worked it\u2014the peasants.  A third radical group founded the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] or ''RSDLP'' in 1898; this party was the primary exponent of [[Marxism]] in Russia. Gathering their support from the radical intellectuals and the urban working class, they advocated complete social, economic and political revolution.<ref>Hugh Seton-Watson, ''The Russian Empire 1801\u20131917'' (Oxford History of Modern Europe) (1967), pp 598\u2013627</ref>\n\n[[File:Repin 17October.jpg|thumb|The [[October Manifesto]] granting [[civil liberties]] and establishing first [[State Duma|parliament]].]]\n\nIn 1903 the RSDLP split into two wings: the radical [[Bolshevik]]s, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the relatively moderate [[Menshevik]]s, led by Yuli Martov. The Mensheviks believed that Russian socialism would grow gradually and peacefully and that the tsar's regime should be succeeded by a democratic republic in which the socialists would cooperate with the liberal bourgeois parties. The Bolsheviks advocated the formation of a small elite of professional revolutionists, subject to strong party discipline, to act as the vanguard of the proletariat in order to seize power by force.<ref>For an analysis of the reaction of the elites to the revolutionaries see Roberta Manning, ''The Crisis of the Old Order in Russia: Gentry and Government''.

Nevertheless, the Russian army fought on, and tied down large numbers of Germans and Austrians.

After the rapid succession of former [[KGB]] Chief [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], transitional figures with deep roots in Brezhnevite tradition, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced [[perestroika]] in an attempt to modernize Soviet communism, and made significant changes in the party leadership.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} However, [[Perestroika|Gorbachev's social reforms]] led to [[unintended consequence]]s. Because of his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'', which facilitated public access to information after decades of government repression, social problems received wider public attention, undermining the Communist Party's authority. In the [[revolutions of 1989]] the USSR lost its allies in Eastern Europe. ''Glasnost'' allowed ethnic and nationalist disaffection to reach the surface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Many constituent republics, especially the [[Baltic republics]], [[Georgian SSR]] and [[Moldavian SSR]], sought greater autonomy, which Moscow was unwilling to provide. Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not sufficient, and the Soviet government left intact most of the fundamental elements of communist economy. Suffering from low pricing of petroleum and natural gas, ongoing [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]], outdated industry and pervasive corruption, the Soviet [[planned economy]] proved to be ineffective, and by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Due to [[price control]], there were shortages of almost all products, reaching their peak in the end of 1991, when people had to stand in long lines and to be lucky enough to buy even the essentials. Control over the constituent republics was also relaxed, and they began to assert their national sovereignty over Moscow.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin 4 April 1996.jpg|thumb|Boris Yeltsin on election rally in [[Belgorod]], 1996]]\nThe tension between Soviet Union and Russian SFSR authorities came to be personified in the bitter power struggle between Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmZjYmUzZmQ1ZmFlMTc5NjA1ZWZiZTgwMTM1ZDVkOTk=|title=Boris on a Pedestal|quote=In the process he engaged in a power struggle with Mikhail Gorbachev... |author=David Pryce-Jones|work=National Review Online|accessdate=22 July 2007|date=20 March 2000}}</ref> Squeezed out of Union politics by Gorbachev in 1987, Yeltsin, who represented himself as a committed democrat, presented a significant opposition to Gorbachev authority.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In a remarkable reversal of fortunes, he gained election as chairman of the Russian republic's new Supreme Soviet in May 1990.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Boris Yeltsin|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/yeltsin/|quote=The first-ever popularly elected leader of Russia, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mikhail Gorbachev's.|accessdate=22 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613043952/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/yeltsin/|archivedate=13 June 2008}}</ref> The following month, he secured legislation [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|giving Russian laws priority over Soviet laws]] and withholding two-thirds of the budget.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In the [[Russian presidential election, 1991|first Russian presidential election]] in 1991 Yeltsin became president of the Russian SFSR.\nAt last Gorbachev [[New Union Treaty|attempted to restructure]] the Soviet Union into a less centralized state.

The coup faced wide popular opposition and collapsed in three days, but disintegration of the Union became imminent. The Russian government took over most of the Soviet Union government institutions on its territory. Because of the dominant position of Russians in the Soviet Union, most gave little thought to any distinction between Russia and the [[Soviet Union]] before the late 1980s. In the Soviet Union, only Russian SFSR lacked even the paltry instruments of statehood that the other republics possessed, such as its own republic-level Communist Party branch, [[trade union]] councils, [[Academy of Sciences]], and the like.<ref>{{cite web|quote=Because of the Russians' dominance in the affairs of the union, the RSFSR failed to develop some of the institutions of governance and administration that were typical of public life in the other republics: a republic-level communist party, a Russian academy of sciences, and Russian branches of trade unions, for example.|work=Country Studies|title=Government|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/68.htm|accessdate=22 July 2007}}</ref> The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] was banned in Russia in 1991\u20131992, although no [[lustration]] has ever taken place, and many of its members became top Russian officials.

The reforms immediately devastated the living standards of much of the population.

During 1993, Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|September\u2013October 1993 constitutional crisis]]. The crisis climaxed on 3 October, when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the [[White House of Russia|Russian White House]], blasting out his opponents. As Yeltsin was taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came close to a serious civil conflict. Yeltsin was then free to impose the [[constitution of the Russian Federation|current Russian constitution]] with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. The cohesion of the Russian Federation was also threatened when the republic of [[Chechnya]] attempted to break away, leading to the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s.\n[[File:2012-10-20 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0446\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|[[Boris Nemtsov]] was killed on 27 February 2015 on a bridge near the Kremlin]]\n\nEconomic reforms also consolidated a semi-criminal oligarchy with roots in the old Soviet system.

In other words, Jesus preached to the Jewish people and called from them his first disciples, see for example [[Matthew 10]]. However, the Great Commission is specifically directed at \"all nations\", and an early difficulty arose concerning the matter of Gentile (non-Jewish) converts as to whether they had to \"become Jewish\" (usually referring to [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]] and adherence to [[Kashrut|dietary law]]), as part of becoming Christian.

[[Biblical law in Christianity|Related issues are still debated today]].\n\nThe doctrines of the apostles brought the Early Church into conflict with some Jewish religious authorities. This eventually led to their expulsion from the [[synagogues]], according to one theory of the [[Council of Jamnia]].

This involved even death for Christians such as [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] ({{bibleverse||Acts|7:59}}) and [[James, son of Zebedee]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Acts|12:2}}). Larger-scale persecutions followed at the hands of the authorities of the [[Roman Empire]], beginning with the year 64, when, as reported by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] historian [[Tacitus]], the [[Emperor Nero]] blamed them for that year's [[Great Fire of Rome]].\n\nAccording to Church tradition, it was under Nero's persecution that [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] were each martyred in Rome. Similarly, several of the [[New Testament]] writings mention persecutions and stress endurance through them.\n\nEarly Christians suffered sporadic persecutions as the result of local pagan populations putting pressure on the imperial authorities to take action against the Christians in their midst, who were thought to bring misfortune by their refusal to honour the gods.<ref>\"As the existence of the Christians became more widely known, it became increasingly clear that they were (''a'') antisocial, in that they did not participate in the normal social life of their communities; (''b'') sacrilegious, in that they refused to worship the gods; and (''c'') dangerous, in that the gods did not take kindly to communities that harbored those who failed to offer them cult. By the end of the second century, the Christian apologist (literally, 'defender' of the faith) Tertullian complained about the widespread perception that Christians were the source of all disasters brought against the human race by the gods. 'They think the Christians the cause of every public disaster, of every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway the cry is, \"Away with the Christians to the lion!\"' (Apology 40)\" \u2013 [https://books.google.com/books?ei=6MOpTbCjLIywhQfep9jUCQ&ct=result&id=NrRBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Ehrman%2C+Bart+D.+%282004%29.+A+Brief+Introduction+to+the+New+Testament.&q=Tertullian#search_anchor Bart D.

In ''[[The Rise of Christianity]]'', [[Rodney Stark]] argues that Christianity triumphed over [[paganism]] chiefly because it improved the lives of its adherents in various ways.<ref>Rodney Stark. ''The Rise of Christianity.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press 1996.</ref>\n\nAnother factor was the way in which Christianity combined its promise of a general [[resurrection of the dead]] with the [[Resurrection#Ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek belief]] that true [[Eternal life (Christianity)|immortality]] depended on the survival of the body, with Christianity adding practical explanations of how this was going to actually happen at the [[End time|end of the world]].<ref>Dag \u00d8istein Endsj\u00f8.

Rivington, London, 1845, p. 106</ref>\n\n[[Edward Gibbon]] in his ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' discusses the topic in considerable detail in his famous Chapter Fifteen, summarizing the historical causes of the early success of Christianity as follows: \"(1) The inflexible, and, if we may use the expression, the intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial spirit which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles from embracing the law of Moses. (2) The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that important truth. (3) The miraculous powers ascribed to the primitive church. (4) The pure and austere morals of the Christians. (5) The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart of the Roman empire.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/search.php?query=decline%20and%20fall%20of%20the%20roman%20empire Gibbon, Edward, ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter Fifteen.] in 6 volumes at the [[Internet Archive]].</ref>\n\n====Structure and the episcopacy====\nIn the post-Apostolic church, bishops emerged as overseers of urban Christian populations, and a hierarchy of clergy gradually took on the form of ''[[bishop|episkopos]]'' (overseers, in-spectors; and the origin of the term [[bishop]]) and ''[[presbyter]]s'' ([[Elder (Christianity)|elders]]; and the origin of the term [[Priest#Christianity|priest]]), and then ''[[deacons]]'' (servants). But this emerged slowly and at different times for different locations. Clement, a 1st-century bishop of Rome, refers to the leaders of the Corinthian church in [[First Epistle of Clement|his epistle to Corinthians]] as bishops and presbyters interchangeably. The New Testament writers also use the terms overseer and elders interchangeably and as synonyms.<ref>Philip Carrington, ''The Early Christian Church'' (2 vol. 1957) [https://www.questia.com/read/13569586?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%201) online edition vol 1]; [https://www.questia.com/read/23514152?title=The%20Early%20Christian%20Church%20(Vol.%202) online edition vol 2]</ref>\n\nPost-apostolic bishops of importance include [[Polycarp|Polycarp of Smyrna]], [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]], and [[Ignatius of Antioch]]. These men reportedly knew and studied under the apostles personally and are therefore called [[Apostolic Fathers]]. Each Christian community also had [[presbyter]]s, as was the case with Jewish communities, who were also ordained and assisted the bishop. As Christianity spread, especially in rural areas, the presbyters exercised more responsibilities and took distinctive shape as priests. Lastly, [[deacon]]s also performed certain duties, such as tending to the poor and sick. In the 2nd century, an episcopal structure becomes more visible, and in that century this structure was supported by teaching on [[apostolic succession]], where a bishop becomes the spiritual successor of the previous bishop in a line tracing back to the apostles themselves.\n\nThe diversity of early Christianity can be documented from the New Testament record itself. The [[Book of Acts]] admits conflicts between Hebrews and Hellenists, and Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians, and [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic speakers]] and [[Greek Primacy|Greek speakers]]. The letters of Paul, Peter, John, and Jude all testify to intra-Church conflicts over both leadership and theology. In a response to the [[Gnostic]] teaching, [[Irenaeus]] created the first document describing what is now called [[apostolic succession]].<ref name=langan107>Langan, ''The Catholic Tradition'' (1998), p. 107/</ref>\n\n====Early Christian writings====\n{{Main article|Ante-Nicene Fathers}}\nAs Christianity spread, it acquired certain members from well-educated circles of the Hellenistic world; they sometimes became bishops, but not always. They produced two sorts of works: theological and \"[[Christian apologetics|apologetic]]\", the latter being works aimed at defending the faith by using reason to refute arguments against the veracity of Christianity. These authors are known as the [[Church Fathers]], and study of them is called [[patristics]]. Notable early Fathers include [[Ignatius of Antioch]], [[Polycarp]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus of Lyons]], [[Tertullian]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]].\n\n====Early art====\n[[File:VirgenNino.jpg|thumb|250px|Virgin and Child. Wall painting from the early [[catacombs]], Rome, [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].]]\n{{Main article|Early Christian art}}\nChristian art only emerged relatively late, and the first known Christian images emerge from about 200 AD,<ref>\"The earliest Christian images appeared somewhere about the year 200.\" Andre Grabar, p. 7</ref> though there is some literary evidence that small domestic images were used earlier. The oldest known Christian paintings are from the Roman [[Catacombs]], dated to about AD 200, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from [[sarcophagi]], dating to the beginning of the 3rd century.<ref name = \"Grabar-p7\"/>\n\nAlthough many Hellenised Jews seem, as at the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], to have had images of religious figures, the [[Ten Commandments#Idolatry|traditional Mosaic prohibition of \"graven images\"]] no doubt retained some effect, although never proclaimed by theologians. This early rejection of images, and the necessity to hide Christian practise from persecution, leaves us with few archaeological records regarding early Christianity and its evolution.<ref name = \"Grabar-p7\">Andre Grabar, p. 7</ref>\n\n====Early heresies====\n{{Main article|Christian heresy#Early Christian heresies}}\nThe [[New Testament]] itself speaks of the importance of maintaining correct ([[Orthodoxy|orthodox]]) doctrine and refuting heresies, showing the antiquity of the concern.<ref>e.g., {{bibleverse-nb||2Corinthians|11:13\u201315}}; {{bibleverse-nb||2Peter|2:1\u201317}}; {{bibleverse-nb||2John|7\u201311}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Jude|4\u201313}}, and the Epistle of James in general.</ref> Because of the [[Bible|biblical]] proscription against [[false prophet]]s, Christianity has always been occupied with the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretation of the faith. Indeed, one of the main roles of the [[bishop]]s in the early Church was to determine and retain important correct beliefs, and refute contrarian opinions, known as [[heresy|heresies]]. As there were sometimes differing opinions among the bishops on new questions, defining orthodoxy would occupy the Church for some time.\n\nThe earliest controversies were often [[Christology|Christological]] in nature; that is, they were related to Jesus's divinity or humanity. [[Docetism]] held that Jesus's humanity was merely an illusion, thus denying the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] (God becoming human). [[Arianism]] held that Jesus, while not merely mortal, was not eternally divine and was, therefore, of lesser status than [[God the Father|the Father]].<ref>{{bibleverse||John|14:28}}</ref> [[Trinitarianism]] held that the Father, [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]] were all strictly one being with three [[Hypostatic union|hypostases]] or persons. Many groups, such as the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], held [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic beliefs]], maintaining that reality was composed into two radically opposing parts: matter, seen as evil, and spirit, seen as good. Such views gave rise to some theology of the \"incarnation\" that were declared heresies. Most scholars agree that the Bible teaches that both the material and the spiritual worlds were created by God and were therefore both good.<ref>R. Gerberding and J. H. Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 58</ref>\n\nThe development of doctrine, the position of orthodoxy, and the relationship between the various opinions is a matter of continuing academic debate. Since most Christians today subscribe to the doctrines established by the [[Nicene Creed]], modern Christian theologians tend to regard the early debates as a [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|unified orthodox position]] against a minority of heretics. Other scholars, drawing upon distinctions between [[Jewish Christians]], [[Pauline Christianity]], and other groups such as [[Marcionites]] and [[Montanism|Montanists]], argue that [[early Christianity]] was always fragmented, with contemporaneous competing beliefs.<ref>e.g., {{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Walter|title=Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity|year=1971|isbn= 0-8006-1363-5}}; {{cite book|last=Pagels|first=Elaine|authorlink=Elaine Pagels|title=The Gnostic Gospels|year=1979|isbn= 0-679-72453-2}}; {{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

Though the Early Church used the Old Testament according to the canon of the [[Septuagint]] (LXX), the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new [[scriptures]]; instead the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament developed over time]].\n\nThe writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities. The [[Pauline epistles]] were circulating in collected form by the end of the 1st century AD.

Moran Cruz, ''Medieval Worlds'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004) p. 56</ref> In accordance with a prevailing custom, Constantine was baptised on his deathbed.\n\nConstantine also played an active role in the leadership of the Church. In 316, he acted as a judge in a North African dispute concerning the [[Donatism|Donatist]] controversy. More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], the first [[Ecumenical Council]]. Constantine thus established a precedent for the emperor as responsible to [[God]] for the spiritual health of their subjects, and thus with a duty to maintain orthodoxy. The emperor was to enforce doctrine, root out heresy, and uphold ecclesiastical unity.<ref>Richards, Jeffrey.

Some, such as [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], suffered exile, persecution, or martyrdom from Arian [[Byzantine Emperors]].\n\n===Arianism and the first Ecumenical Councils===\n[[File:Christian states 495 AD (en).svg|thumb|Spread of Arianism in the Western Europe]]\n{{Main article|Arianism|First seven Ecumenical Councils}}\n{{Further information|Germanic Christianity}}\nA popular doctrine of the 4th century was [[Arianism]], the denial of the divinity of Christ, as propounded by [[Arius]]. Though this doctrine was condemned as heresy and eventually eliminated by the Roman Church it remained popular underground for some time. In the late 4th century [[Ulfilas]], a Roman bishop and an Arian, was appointed as the first bishop to the [[Goths]], the Germanic peoples in much of Europe at the borders of and within the Empire. Ulfilas spread Arian Christianity among the Goths firmly establishing the faith among many of the Germanic tribes, thus helping to keep them culturally distinct.<ref name=\"Padberg 1998, 26\">Padberg 1998, 26</ref>\n\nDuring this age, the first Ecumenical Councils were convened. They were mostly concerned with Christological disputes. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381) resulted in condemning Arian teachings as heresy and producing the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\n===Christianity as Roman state religion (380)===\n{{Further information|State church of the Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Orient m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en de l'Empire romain - Mosa\u00efque byzantine -2.JPG|thumb|An [[Eastern Roman]] [[mosaic]] showing a [[basilica]] with towers, mounted with [[Christian cross]]es, 5th century AD, [[Louvre]]]]\nOn 27 February 380, with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] put forth under [[Theodosius I]], the Roman Empire officially adopted [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] Christianity as its state religion. Prior to this date, [[Constantius II#Christianity under Constantius|Constantius II]] (337-361) and [[Valens#Struggles with the religious nature of the Empire|Valens]] (364\u2013378) had personally favoured Arian or [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] forms of Christianity, but Valens' successor [[Theodosius I]] supported the Trinitarian doctrine as expounded in the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nAfter its establishment, the Church adopted the same organisational boundaries as the Empire: geographical provinces, called dioceses, corresponding to imperial governmental territorial division. The bishops, who were located in major urban centres as per pre-legalisation tradition, thus oversaw each diocese. The bishop's location was his \"seat\", or \"see\". Among the sees, [[Pentarchy|five]] came to hold special eminence: [[Pope|Rome]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]], [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], and [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]]. The prestige of most of these sees depended in part on their apostolic founders, from whom the bishops were therefore the spiritual successors. Though the bishop of Rome was still held to be the [[First among equals]], Constantinople was second in precedence as the new capital of the empire.\n\nTheodosius I decreed that others not believing in the preserved \"faithful tradition\", such as the Trinity, were to be considered to be practitioners of illegal [[heresy]],<ref>It is our desire that all the various nations... should continue to profess that religion which... has been preserved by faithful tradition, and which is now professed by the Pontiff Damasus and by Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness.

A particular consequence of this perspective was that Mary could not be properly called the mother of God, but could only be considered the mother of Christ. The most widely known proponent of this viewpoint was the Patriarch of Constantinople [[Nestorius]]. Since referring to Mary as the mother of God had become popular in many parts of the Church this became a divisive issue.\n\nThe Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II|Theodosius&nbsp;II]] called for the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431), with the intention of settling the issue. The councils ultimately rejected Nestorius' view. Many churches who followed the Nestorian viewpoint broke away from the Roman Church, causing a major schism. The Nestorian churches were persecuted and many followers fled to the Sasanian Empire where they were accepted.\n\nThe [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian (Persian) Empire]] had many Christian converts early in its history tied closely to the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] branch of Christianity. The Empire was officially [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and maintained a strict adherence to this faith in part to distinguish itself from the religion of the Roman Empire (originally the pagan Roman religion and then Christianity). Christianity became tolerated in the Sasanian Empire and as the Roman Empire increasingly exiled ''heretics'' during the 4th and 6th centuries, the Sasanian Christian community grew rapidly.<ref name=\"culture-61\">''Culture and customs of Iran'', p. 61</ref> By the end of the 5th century the Persian Church was firmly established and had become independent of the Roman Church. This church evolved into what is today known as the [[Church of the East]].\n\n===Miaphysitism===\n{{Further information|Oriental Orthodoxy}}\nIn 451 the [[Council of Chalcedon]] was held to further clarify the Christological issues surrounding Nestorianism. The council ultimately stated that Christ's divine and human nature were separate but both part of a single entity, a viewpoint rejected by many churches who called themselves [[miaphysites]]. The resulting schism created a communion of churches, including the Armenian, Syrian, and Egyptian churches.<ref>Bussell (1910), p. 346.</ref> Though efforts were made at reconciliation in the next few centuries the schism remained permanent resulting in what is today known as [[Oriental Orthodoxy]].\n\n===Monasticism===\n{{Main article|Christian monasticism}}\n\n[[Christian monasticism|Monasticism]] is a form of asceticism whereby one renounces worldly pursuits and goes off alone as a hermit or joins a tightly organized community. It began early in the Church as a family of similar traditions, modelled upon Scriptural examples and ideals, and with roots in certain strands of Judaism. [[John the Baptist]] is seen as an archetypical monk, and monasticism was also inspired by the organisation of the Apostolic community as recorded in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts 2]].\n\nEremetic monks, or [[hermit]]s, live in solitude, whereas [[cenobitic]]s live in communities, generally in a [[monastery]], under a rule (or code of practice) and are governed by an [[abbot]]. Originally, all Christian monks were hermits, following the example of [[Anthony the Great]]. However, the need for some form of organised spiritual guidance lead [[Pachomius]] in 318 to organise his many followers in what was to become the first monastery. Soon, similar institutions were established throughout the Egyptian desert as well as the rest of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Women were especially attracted to the movement.<ref>Jeffrey F. Hamburger et al. ''Crown and Veil: Female Monasticism from the Fifth to the Fifteenth Centuries'' (2008)</ref>\n\nCentral figures in the development of monasticism were [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]] in the East and, in the West, [[Benedict of Nursia|Benedict]], who created the famous [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], which would become the most common rule throughout the Middle Ages, and starting point for other monastic rules.<ref>Marilyn Dunn, ''Emergence of Monasticism: From the Desert Fathers to the Early Middle Ages'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Early Middle Ages (476\u2013799)==\n[[File:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 004.jpg|thumb|180px|A [[mosaic]] of [[Justinian I]] in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, Italy.]]\n{{Main article|History of Christianity of the Middle Ages}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 6th century|Christianity in the 7th century|Christianity in the 8th century}}\nThe transition into the Middle Ages was a gradual and localised process. Rural areas rose as power centres whilst urban areas declined. Although a greater number of Christians remained in the [[Orthodox Church|East]] (Greek areas), important developments were underway in the [[Western Christianity|West]] (Latin areas) and each took on distinctive shapes.\n\nThe [[Bishop of Rome|Bishops of Rome]], the Popes, were forced to adapt to drastically changing circumstances. Maintaining only nominal allegiance to the Emperor, they were forced to negotiate balances with the \"barbarian rulers\" of the former Roman provinces. In the East the Church maintained its structure and character and evolved more slowly.\n\n===Western missionary expansion===\nThe stepwise loss of [[Western Roman Empire]] dominance, replaced with [[foederati]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas not controlled by the collapsing empire.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''A history of the expansion of Christianity: vol. 2, The thousand years of uncertainty: A.D. 500 \u2013 A.D. 1500''</ref> Already as early as in the 5th century, missionary activities from [[Roman Britain]] into the Celtic areas (current [[Scotland]], Ireland and [[Wales]]) produced competing early traditions of [[Celtic Christianity]], that was later reintegrated under the [[Holy See|Church in Rome]].\n\nProminent missionaries were Saints [[Saint Patrick|Patrick]], [[Columba]] and [[Columbanus]]. The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribes that invaded southern Britain some time after the Roman abandonment, were initially pagan, but converted to Christianity by [[Augustine of Canterbury]] on the mission of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. Soon becoming a missionary centre, missionaries such as [[Wilfrid]], [[Willibrord]], [[Lullus]] and [[Boniface]] would begin converting their [[Saxons|Saxon]] relatives in [[Germania]].\n\nThe largely Christian Gallo-Roman inhabitants of [[Gaul]] (modern France) were overrun by the [[Franks]] in the early 5th century. The native inhabitants were persecuted until the Frankish king [[Clovis I]] converted from paganism to [[Roman Catholic]]ism in 496. Clovis insisted that his fellow nobles follow suit, strengthening his newly established kingdom by uniting the faith of the rulers with that of the ruled.<ref name=\"Janet L. Nelson 1996\">Janet L. Nelson, ''The Frankish world, 750\u2013900'' (1996)</ref>\n\nAfter the rise of the [[Frankish Kingdom]] and the stabilizing political conditions, the Western part of the Church increased the missionary activities, supported by the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] kingdom as a means to pacify troublesome neighbour peoples. After the foundation of a church in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] by [[Willibrord]], backlashes occurred when the pagan [[Frisians|Frisian]] king [[Radbod, king of the Frisians|Radbod]] destroyed many Christian centres between 716 and 719. In 717, the English missionary [[Boniface]] was sent to aid Willibrord, re-establishing churches in Frisia continuing missions in Germany.<ref name=\"Janet L.

In the 720s the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] banned the pictorial representation of Christ, saints, and biblical scenes. In the West, [[Pope Gregory III]] held two synods at Rome and condemned Leo's actions. The Byzantine [[Council of Hieria|Iconoclast Council]], held at [[Hieria]] in 754, ruled that holy portraits were heretical.<ref>Epitome, Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754</ref>\n\nThe movement destroyed much of the Christian church's early artistic history. The iconoclastic movement itself was later defined as heretical in 787 under the [[Second Council of Nicaea|Seventh Ecumenical Council]], but enjoyed a brief resurgence between 815 and 842.\n\n==High Middle Ages (800\u20131299)==\n{{Main article|Medieval history of Christianity#High Middle Ages (800\u20131300)}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 9th century|Christianity in the 10th century|Christianity in the 11th century|Christianity in the 12th century|Christianity in the 13th century}}\n\n===Carolingian Renaissance===\nThe [[Carolingian Renaissance]] was a period of intellectual and cultural revival of literature, arts, and scriptural studies during the late [[Christianity in the 8th century|8th]] and [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th centuries]], mostly during the reigns of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Louis the Pious]], [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers. To address the problems of illiteracy among clergy and court scribes, Charlemagne founded schools and attracted the most learned men from all of Europe to his court.\n\n===Monastic Reform===\n[[File:Clocher abbaye cluny 2.JPG|right|125px|thumb|A view of the Abbey of Cluny.]]\n\n====Cluny====\nFrom the [[Christianity in the 6th century|6th century]] onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the [[Benedictine Order]]. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed [[Rule of St Benedict|Benedictine rule]], the abbey of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. Cluny created a large, federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. The Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church, at its height from the second half of the [[Christianity in the 10th century|10th centuries]] through the early [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th]].\n\n====C\u00eeteaux====\nThe next wave of monastic reform came with the [[Cistercians|Cistercian Movement]]. The first Cistercian [[abbey]] was founded in 1098, at [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]]. The keynote of Cistercian life was a return to a literal observance of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine rule]], rejecting the developments of the [[Benedictines]]. The most striking feature in the reform was the return to manual labour, and especially to field-work.\n\nInspired by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], the primary builder of the Cistercians, they became the main force of technological diffusion in medieval Europe. By the end of the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]] the Cistercian houses numbered 500, and at its height in the [[Christianity in the 15th century|15th century]] the order claimed to have close to 750 houses. Most of these were built in wilderness areas, and played a major part in bringing such isolated parts of Europe into economic cultivation\n<gallery>\nFile:Mapa cister.svg|The spread of the Cistercians from their original sites during the Middle Ages\nFile:Bernhard von Clairvaux (Initiale-B).jpg|[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]]\n</gallery>\n====Mendicant orders====\nA third level of monastic reform was provided by the establishment of the [[Mendicant orders]]. Commonly known as friars, mendicants live under a monastic rule with traditional vows of [[poverty, chastity, and obedience]], but they emphasise preaching, missionary activity, and education, in a secluded monastery. Beginning in the [[Christianity in the 12th century|12th century]], the [[Franciscan]] order was instituted by the followers of [[Francis of Assisi]], and thereafter the [[Dominican order]] was begun by [[Saint Dominic|St. Dominic]].\n\n===Investiture Controversy===\n{{Main article|Investiture Controversy}}\n[[File:Canossa-gate.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at the gate of Canossa, by August von Heyden.]]\n\nThe [[Investiture Controversy]], or Lay investiture controversy, was the most significant [[Separation of church and state (medieval)|conflict between secular and religious]] powers in [[medieval Europe]]. It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Pope Gregory VII]] concerning who would appoint bishops ([[investiture]]). The end of lay investiture threatened to undercut the power of the Empire and the ambitions of noblemen.\n\nBishops collected revenues from estates attached to their bishopric. Noblemen who held lands (fiefdoms) hereditarily passed those lands on within their family. However, when a bishop died it was the king's right to appoint a successor. So, while a king had little recourse in preventing noblemen from consolidating power via inheritance and [[dynastic marriage]]s, he could keep control of the domain of his bishops.\n\nKings would bestow bishoprics to members of noble families whose friendship he wished to secure. Furthermore, if a king left a bishopric vacant, he collected the estates' revenues until a bishop was appointed, when in theory he was to repay the earnings. The infrequent nature of this repayment was an obvious source of dispute. The Church wanted to end lay investiture because of this practice and others such as [[simony]]. Thus, the Investiture Contest was part of the Church's attempt to reform the episcopate and provide better [[pastoral care]].\n\nPope Gregory VII issued the ''[[Dictatus Papae]]'', which declared that the pope alone could appoint or depose bishops, or translate them to other sees. Henry IV's rejection of the decree lead to his excommunication and a ducal revolt. Eventually Henry received absolution after dramatic public penance barefoot in Alpine snow and cloaked in a hair-shirt (see [[Road to Canossa]]), though the revolt and conflict of investiture continued.\n\nA similar controversy occurred in England between [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], Archbishop of Canterbury, over investiture and ecclesiastical revenues during an episcopal vacancy. The English dispute was resolved by the Concordat of London, 1107, where the king renounced his claim to invest bishops but continued to require an oath of fealty from them.\n\nThis was a partial model for the [[Concordat of Worms]] (''Pactum Calixtinum''), which resolved the Imperial investiture controversy with a compromise that allowed secular authorities some measure of control but granted the selection of bishops to their [[canon (priest)|cathedral canons]]. As a symbol of the compromise, lay authorities invested bishops with their secular authority symbolised by the lance, and ecclesiastical authorities invested bishops with their spiritual authority symbolised by the [[Ecclesiastical ring|ring]] and the [[Crozier|staff]].\n\n===Medieval Inquisition===\n{{Main article|Medieval Inquisition}}\n\nThe [[Medieval Inquisition]] is a series of Inquisitions ([[Roman Catholic]] Church bodies charged with suppressing [[heresy]]) from around 1184, including the Episcopal Inquisition (1184\u20131230s) and later the Papal Inquisition (1230s). It was in response to movements within Europe considered [[apostasy|apostate]] or [[Christian heresy|heretical]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]], in particular the [[Catharism|Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]] in southern France and northern Italy. These were the first inquisition movements of many that would follow. The inquisitions in combination with the [[Albigensian Crusade]] were fairly successful in ending heresy. Historian Thomas F. Madden has written about popular myths regarding the Inquisition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731045745/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Conversion of the Scandinavians===\n{{main|Christianization of Scandinavia}}\nEarly evangelisation in Scandinavia was begun by [[Ansgar]], [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishop of Bremen]], \"Apostle of the North\". Ansgar, a native of [[Amiens]], was sent with a group of monks to Jutland Denmark in around 820 at the time of the pro-Christian Jutish king Harald Klak. The mission was only partially successful, and Ansgar returned two years later to Germany, after Harald had been driven out of his kingdom.\n\nIn 829 Ansgar went to [[Birka]] on [[Lake M\u00e4laren]], Sweden, with his aide friar Witmar, and a small congregation was formed in 831 which included the king's own steward Hergeir. Conversion was slow, however, and most Scandinavian lands were only completely Christianised at the time of rulers such as [[Saint Canute IV]] of Denmark and [[Olaf I of Norway]] in the years following AD&nbsp;1000.\n\n===Conversion of the Slavs===\n{{main article|Christianization of the Slavs}}\n[[File:Sevastopol Chersonesus Saint Vladimir Cathedral IMG 0723 1725.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of Korsun ([[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]) [[Crimea]], a place where the East Slavic Christianity was born.]]\n[[File:Cyril Metodej.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Saint Cyril the Philosopher|St. Cyril]] and [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|St. Methodius]] monument on [[Radho\u0161\u0165|Mt. Radho\u0161\u0165]].]]\nThough by 800 Western Europe was ruled entirely by Christian kings, East and Central Europe remained an area of missionary activity. For example, in the 9th century SS. [[Cyril and Methodius]] had extensive missionary success in the region among the [[Slavic peoples]], translating the Bible and liturgy into [[Old Church Slavonic|Slavonic]]. The [[Baptism of Kiev]] in 988 spread Christianity throughout [[Kievan Rus']], establishing Christianity among [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and Russia.\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Christianity made great inroads into [[Eastern Europe]], including Bulgaria and [[Kievan Rus']]. The evangelisation, or Christianisation, of the Slavs was initiated by one of Byzantium's most learned churchmen\u2014the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople]] (Photius). The Byzantine emperor Michael III chose Cyril and Methodius in response to a request from Rastislav, the king of Moravia who wanted missionaries that could minister to the Moravians in their own language.\n\nThe two brothers spoke the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular and translated the Bible and many of the prayer books.<ref name=Pravmir>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravmir.com/article_39.html |title=Sts.

In a short time the disciples of Cyril and Methodius managed to prepare and instruct the future Slavic clergy into the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and the biblical texts.\n\nBulgaria was officially recognised as a patriarchate by Constantinople in 927, Serbia in 1346, and Russia in 1589. All these nations, however, had been converted long before these dates.\n\nThe missionaries to the East and South Slavs had great success in part because they used the people's native language rather than [[Latin]] as the Roman priests did, or Greek.\n\n==== Mission to Great Moravia ====\n[[File:Kop\u010dany kostol - sever.JPG|thumb|240px|left|[[Church of St. Margaret of Antioch, Kop\u010dany]] ([[Kop\u010dany]], [[Slovakia]], 9th\u201310th century) \u2013 the only preserved building from the time of Great Moravia.]]\n[[Image:Central europe 9th century.png|thumb|right|240px|alt=Map of Moravia under Rastislav|Conversion of Moravia (under Ratislav)]]\nWhen king [[Rastislav of Moravia]] asked Byzantium for teachers who could minister to the Moravians in their own language, Byzantine emperor Michael III chose two brothers, [[Cyril and Methodius]]. As their mother was a Slav from the hinterlands of Thessaloniki, the two brothers had been raised speaking the local [[Slavonic languages|Slavonic]] vernacular. Once commissioned, they immediately set about creating an alphabet, the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]. They then translated the Scripture and the liturgy into Slavonic.\n\nThis Slavic dialect became the basis of [[Old Church Slavonic]] which later evolved into [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] which is the common liturgical language still used by the Russian Orthodox Church and other Slavic Orthodox Christians.\n\n====Conversion of Bulgaria====\n {{main article|Christianization of Bulgaria}}\nBulgaria was a pagan country since its establishment in 681 until 864 when [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (852\u2013889) converted to Christianity. The reasons for that decision were complex; the most important factors were that Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and [[East Francia]]; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth, while Boris also saw it as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs.<ref>Andreev, J., ''The Bulgarian Khans and Tsars'', Veliko Tarnovo, 1996, pp. 73\u201374</ref><ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans. A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century.'', 1983, p. 118</ref>\n\nIn 885 some of the disciples of Cyril and Methodius, including [[Clement of Ohrid]], [[Saint Naum|Naum of Preslav]] and Angelaruis, returned to Bulgaria where they were welcomed by Boris I who viewed the Slavonic liturgy as a way to counteract Byzantine influence in the country. In a short time they managed to prepare and instruct the future Bulgarian clergy into the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] and the biblical texts. As a result of the [[Council of Preslav]] in AD&nbsp;893, Bulgaria expelled its Greek clergy and proclaimed the [[Bulgarian language|Old Bulgarian language]] as the official language of the church and the state.\n<gallery>\nFile:Bulgaria under rule of Boris I.png|Bulgaria under Boris I (who was converted to Christianity)\nFile:Kievan-rus-1015-1113-(en).png|Conversion of the Kievan Rus', the unified Rus' empire\n</gallery>\n====Conversion of the Rus'====\n\n[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|250px|thumb|The Baptism of Vladimir.]]\nThe success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of other East [[Slavic peoples]], most notably the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']], predecessors of [[Belarusians]], Russians, and Ukrainians, as well as [[Rusyns]]. By the beginning of the 11th century most of the pagan Slavic world, including Rus', Bulgaria and Serbia, had been converted to Byzantine Christianity. The traditional event associated with the conversion of Rus' is the baptism of Vladimir of Kiev in 989. However, Christianity is documented to have predated this event in the city of Kiev and in Georgia. Today the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is the largest of the Orthodox Churches.\n\n==Controversy and Crusades dividing East and West==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 11th century|Christianity in the 12th century|Christianity in the 13th century|Christianity in the 14th century}}\n\n===Growing tensions between East and West===\nThe cracks and fissures in Christian unity which led to the [[East-West Schism]] started to become evident as early as the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. Cultural, political, and linguistic differences were often mixed with the theological, leading to schism.\n\nThe transfer of the Roman capital to Constantinople inevitably brought mistrust, rivalry, and even jealousy to the relations of the two great sees, Rome and Constantinople. It was easy for Rome to be jealous of Constantinople at a time when it was rapidly losing its political prominence. Estrangement was also helped along by the German invasions in the West, which effectively weakened contacts. The rise of Islam with its conquest of most of the Mediterranean coastline (not to mention the arrival of the pagan Slavs in the Balkans at the same time) further intensified this separation by driving a physical wedge between the two worlds. The once homogeneous unified world of the Mediterranean was fast vanishing. Communication between the [[Greek East and Latin West]] by the 7th century had become dangerous and practically ceased.<ref>[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/greatschism.aspx The Great Schism: The Estrangement of Eastern and Western Christendom]</ref>\n\nTwo basic problems were involved: the nature of the [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|primacy of the bishop of Rome]] and the theological implications of adding a clause to the [[Nicene Creed]], known as the ''[[Filioque]]'' clause. These doctrinal issues were first openly discussed in Photius's patriarchate.\n\nBy the 5th century, Christendom was divided into a pentarchy of five sees with Rome accorded a primacy. The four Eastern sees of the pentarchy considered this determined by canonical decision and not entailing hegemony of any one local church or patriarchate over the others. However, Rome began to interpret her primacy in terms of sovereignty, as a God-given right involving universal jurisdiction in the Church. The collegial and conciliar nature of the Church, in effect, was gradually abandoned in favour of supremacy of unlimited papal power over the entire Church. These ideas were finally given systematic expression in the West during the [[Gregorian Reform]] movement of the 11th century.\n\nThe Eastern churches viewed Rome's understanding of the nature of episcopal power as being in direct opposition to the Church's essentially conciliar structure and thus saw the two ecclesiologies as mutually antithetical. For them, specifically, [[primacy of Simon Peter|Simon Peter's primacy]] could never be the exclusive prerogative of any one bishop. All bishops must, like St. Peter, confess Jesus as the Christ and, as such, all are Peter's successors. The churches of the East gave the Roman See primacy but not supremacy, the Pope being the first among equals but not infallible and not with absolute authority.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Orthodox Church London |last=Ware |first=Kallistos |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-913836-58-3}}</ref>\n\nThe other major irritant to Eastern Christendom was the Western use of the ''Filioque'' clause\u2014meaning \"and the Son\"\u2014in the Nicene Creed . This too developed gradually and entered the Creed over time. The issue was the addition by the West of the Latin clause ''Filioque'' to the Creed, as in \"the Holy Spirit... who proceeds from the Father ''and the Son''\", where the original Creed, sanctioned by the councils and still used today by the Eastern Orthodox simply states \"the Holy Spirit, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds from the Father.\" The Eastern Church argued that the phrase had been added unilaterally, and therefore illegitimately, since the East had never been consulted.<ref>History of Russian Philosophy by Nikolai Lossky {{ISBN|978-0-8236-8074-0}} Quoting [[Aleksey Khomyakov]] p. 87.</ref>\n\nIn the final analysis, only another ecumenical council could introduce such an alteration. Indeed, the councils, which drew up the original Creed, had expressly forbidden any subtraction or addition to the text. In addition to this ecclesiological issue, the Eastern Church also considered the'' Filioque'' clause unacceptable on dogmatic grounds. Theologically, the Latin interpolation was unacceptable since it implied that the Spirit now had two sources of origin and procession, the Father and the Son, rather than the Father alone.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church by [[Vladimir Lossky]], SVS Press, 1997.

({{ISBN|0-227-67919-9}})</ref>\n\n===Photian schism===\n{{Main article|Photian schism}}\n\nIn the 9th century AD, a controversy arose between Eastern (Byzantine, Greek Orthodox) and Western (Latin, Roman Catholic) Christianity that was precipitated by the opposition of the Roman [[Pope John VII]] to the appointment by the Byzantine [[emperor Michael III]] of [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photios I]] to the position of patriarch of Constantinople. Photios was refused an apology by the pope for previous points of dispute between the East and West. Photios refused to accept the supremacy of the pope in Eastern matters or accept the ''Filioque'' clause. The Latin delegation at the council of his consecration pressed him to accept the clause in order to secure their support.\n\nThe controversy also involved Eastern and Western ecclesiastical jurisdictional rights in the Bulgarian church, as well as a doctrinal dispute over the ''Filioque'' (\"and from the Son\") clause. That had been added to the [[Nicene Creed]] by the Latin church, which was later the theological breaking point in the ultimate Great [[East-West Schism]] in the 11th century.\n\nPhotios did provide concession on the issue of jurisdictional rights concerning Bulgaria and the papal legates made do with his return of Bulgaria to Rome. This concession, however, was purely nominal, as Bulgaria's return to the Byzantine rite in 870 had already secured for it an autocephalous church. Without the consent of [[Boris I of Bulgaria]], the papacy was unable to enforce any of its claims.\n\n===East-West Schism (1054)===\n{{Main article|East-West Schism}}\n[[File:Great Schism 1054 with former borders.png|thumb|The East-West Schism]]\nThe [[East-West Schism]], or Great Schism, separated the Church into Western (Latin) and Eastern (Greek) branches, i.e., Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. It was the first major division since certain groups in the East rejected the decrees of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (see [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]), and was far more significant. Though normally dated to 1054, the East-West Schism was actually the result of an extended period of estrangement between Latin and Greek Christendom over the nature of papal primacy and certain doctrinal matters like the ''Filioque'', but intensified by cultural and linguistic differences.\n\nThe \"official\" schism in 1054 was the excommunication of Patriarch [[Michael Cerularius]] of Constantinople, followed by his excommunication of papal legates. Attempts at reconciliation were made in 1274 (by the [[Second Council of Lyon]]) and in 1439 (by the [[Council of Basel]]), but in each case the eastern hierarchs who consented to the unions were repudiated by the Orthodox as a whole, though reconciliation was achieved between the West and what are now called the \"[[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches]]\". More recently, in 1965 [[Catholic-Orthodox joint declaration of 1965|the mutual excommunications were rescinded]] by the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople, though schism remains.\n\nBoth groups are descended from the Early Church, both acknowledge the [[apostolic succession]] of each other's bishops, and the validity of each other's [[sacrament]]s. Though both acknowledge the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, Eastern Orthodoxy understands this as a primacy of honour with limited or no ecclesiastical authority in other dioceses.\n\nThe Orthodox East perceived the Papacy as taking on monarchical characteristics that were not in line with the church's tradition.\n\nThe final breach is often considered to have arisen after the capture and sacking of Constantinople by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Crusades against Christians in the East by Roman Catholic crusaders was not exclusive to the Mediterranean though (see also the [[Northern Crusades]] and the [[Battle of the Ice]]). The sacking of [[Constantinople]] and the [[Hagia Sophia|Church of Holy Wisdom]] and establishment of the [[Latin Empire]] as a seeming attempt to supplant the Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] in 1204 is viewed with some rancour to the present day.\n\nMany in the East saw the actions of the West as a prime determining factor in the weakening of Byzantium. This led to the Empire's eventual conquest and fall to Islam. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]] extended a formal apology for the sacking of Constantinople in 1204; the apology was formally accepted by [[Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople]]. Many things that were stolen during this time: holy [[relic]]s, riches, and many other items, are still held in various Western European cities, particularly [[Venice]], Italy.\n\n=== Crusades ===\n{{Main article|Crusades}}\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|thumb|The Crusader states of Jerusalem]]\nGenerally, the Crusades refer to the campaigns in the Holy Land against Muslim forces sponsored by the Papacy. There were other crusades against Islamic forces in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily, as well as the campaigns of [[Teutonic Knights]] against pagan strongholds in North-eastern Europe (see [[Northern Crusades]]).  A few crusades were waged within Christendom against groups that were considered heretical and schismatic (also see the [[Battle of the Ice]] and the [[Albigensian Crusade]]).\n\n[[File:Crac des chevaliers syria.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Krak des Chevaliers]] was built in the [[County of Tripoli]] by the [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the Crusades.]]\n\nThe Holy Land had been part of the Roman Empire, and thus Byzantine Empire, until the Islamic conquests of the 7th and 8th centuries. Thereafter, Christians had generally been permitted to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land until 1071, when the [[Seljuk Turks]] closed Christian pilgrimages and assailed the Byzantines, defeating them at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].\n\nEmperor [[Alexius I]] asked for aid from [[Pope Urban II]] (1088\u20131099) for help against Islamic aggression. He probably expected money from the pope for the hiring of mercenaries. Instead, Urban II called upon the knights of Christendom in a speech made at the [[Council of Clermont]] on 27 November 1095, combining the idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land with that of waging a holy war against infidels.\n\nThe [[First Crusade]] captured Antioch in 1099 and then Jerusalem. The [[Second Crusade]] occurred in 1145 when [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] was retaken by Islamic forces. Jerusalem would be held until 1187 and the [[Third Crusade]], famous for the battles between [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[Saladin]]. \n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]], begun by [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in 1202, intended to retake the Holy Land but was soon subverted by Venetians who used the forces to sack the Christian city of [[Zadar|Zara]].<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\">For such an analysis, see Brian Tierney and Sidney Painter, ''Western Europe in the Middle Ages 300\u20131475''. 6th ed. (McGraw-Hill 1998)</ref> When the crusaders arrived in Constantinople, they sacked the city and other parts of Asia Minor and established the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople in Greece and Asia Minor.  This was effectively the last crusade sponsored by the papacy, with later crusades being sponsored by individuals.<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\"/>\n\nJerusalem was held by the crusaders for nearly a century, and other strongholds in the Near East would remain in Christian possession much longer. The crusades in the Holy Land ultimately failed to establish permanent Christian kingdoms. Islamic expansion into Europe would renew and remain a threat for centuries culminating in the campaigns of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\"/>\n\nCrusades in southern Spain, southern Italy, and Sicily eventually lead to the demise of Islamic power in Europe.<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\"/> The Teutonic Knights expanded Christian domains in Eastern Europe, and the much less frequent crusades within Christendom, such as the [[Albigensian Crusade]], achieved their goal of maintaining doctrinal unity.<ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1998\"/>\n\n===Hesychast Controversy===\n{{Main article|Hesychast controversy}}\n[[File:Gregor Palamas.jpg|thumb|160px|Gregory Palamas.]]\nIn 1337 [[Hesychasm]]\u2014a mystical teaching at [[Mount Athos]] came under attack from [[Barlaam of Calabria]], an abbot in Constantinople. Barlaam propounded a more intellectual and propositional approach to the knowledge of God than the Hesychasts taught. Hesychasm is a form of constant purposeful prayer or experiential prayer, explicitly referred to as [[Theoria|contemplation]] focusing on the idea of stillness and the characteristic mystical idea of light as the vehicle for knowing God.\n\n[[Gregory Palamas]], afterwards Archbishop of [[Thessalonica]], defended Hesychasm. Several synods took one position or the other until in 1351 at a synod under the presidency of the Emperor [[John VI Cantacuzenus]], Hesychast doctrine was established as the doctrine of the Orthodox Church. the theology was especially attractive in the East because it validated the use of icons as a vehicle for contemplation of divine light.<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years'' (2010) pp. 486\u201391</ref>\n\n==Eastern Orthodox captivity (1453\u20131850)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 15th century|Christianity in the 16th century|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century}}\n\n===Fall of Constantinople===\nIn 1453, Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. By this time Egypt had been under Muslim control for some seven centuries, but Orthodoxy was very strong in Russia which had recently acquired an [[autocephalous]] status; and thus Moscow called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of Constantinople.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] acquired substantial power as an autonomous ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]''. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \"Greek Orthodox nation\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire.\n\nEastern Christians fleeing Constantinople, and the Greek manuscripts they carried with them, is one of the factors that prompted the literary [[renaissance]] in the West at about this time.\n\n===Isolation from the West===\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIt is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\n===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===\n{{Further information|Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Persecution of Christians#Ottoman Empire|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[Image:Gennadios.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]] receives [[Gennadius II Scholarius]] ([[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] from 1454 to 1464)]]\nThe new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] that conquered the Byzantine Empire followed Islamic law when dealing with the conquered Christian population. Christians were officially tolerated as [[People of the Book]]. As such, the Church's canonical and hierarchical organisation were not significantly disrupted and its administration continued to function. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]].\n\nBecause [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest-ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. This meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. However, these rights and privileges, including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. Christians were viewed as [[Dhimmitude|second-class citizens]], and the legal protections they depended upon were subject to the whims of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]].<ref name=\"AIHG-NYT\">[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=7 June 2007 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref>\n\nUnder Ottoman occupation the Church could no longer bear witness to Christ. Christian missionary work among Muslims was illegal and dangerous, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements. Violent persecutions of Christians were common, and reached their climax in the [[Armenian Genocide|Armenian]], [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]], and [[Greek Genocide|Greek]] genocides.\n\n===Corruption===\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy.\n\nFew patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. The hierarchy's positions were often dangerous as well. The hanging of patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops.\n\n==Late Middle Ages and the early Renaissance (1300\u20131520)==\n{{Main article|Medieval history of Christianity#Late Middle Ages (1300\u20131499)}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 14th century|Christianity in the 15th century|Renaissance}}\n\n===Avignon Papacy (1309\u20131378)===\nThe [[Avignon Papacy]], sometimes referred to as the Babylonian Captivity, was a period from 1309 to 1378 during which seven [[Pope]]s resided in [[Avignon]], in modern-day France.<ref>Morris, Colin, ''The papal monarchy: the Western church from 1050 to 1250 '', (Oxford University Press, 2001), 271.</ref> The period was one of conflict and controversy during which French Kings held considerable sway over the Papacy and rulers across Europe felt sidelined by the new French-centric papacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nTroubles reached their peak in 1378 when, [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]] died while visiting Rome. A [[papal conclave]] met in Rome and elected [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], an Italian. Urban soon alienated the French cardinals, and they held a second conclave electing [[Antipope Clement VII|Robert of Geneva]] to succeed Gregory XI, beginning the Western Schism.\n\n===Western Schism (1378\u20131416)===\n[[File:Western schism 1378-1417.svg|thumb|Map showing support for Avignon (red) and Rome (blue) during the Western Schism; this breakdown is accurate until the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409), which created a third line of claimants.]]\nThe [[Western Schism]], or Papal Schism, was a prolonged period of crisis in Latin Christendom from 1378 to 1416, when there were two or more claimants to the See of Rome and there was conflict concerning the rightful holder of the papacy. The conflict was political, rather than doctrinal, in nature.\n\nIn 1309, [[Pope Clement V]], due to political considerations, moved to Avignon in southern France and exercised his pontificate there. For sixty-nine years popes resided in Avignon rather than Rome. This was not only an obvious source of confusion but of political animosity as the prestige and influence of city of Rome waned without a resident pontiff. Though [[Pope Gregory XI]], a Frenchman, returned to Rome in 1378, the strife between Italian and French factions intensified, especially following his subsequent death.\n\nIn 1378 the conclave, elected an Italian from Naples, [[Pope Urban VI]]; his intransigence in office soon alienated the French cardinals, who withdrew to a conclave of their own, asserting the previous election was invalid since its decision had been made under the duress of a riotous mob. They elected one of their own, Robert of Geneva, who took the name [[Pope Clement VII]]. By 1379, he was back in the palace of popes in Avignon, while Urban VI remained in Rome.\n\nFor nearly forty years, there were two papal curias and two sets of cardinals, each electing a new pope for Rome or Avignon when death created a vacancy. Each pope lobbied for support among kings and princes who played them off against each other, changing allegiance according to political advantage. In 1409, a council was convened at Pisa to resolve the issue. The council declared both existing popes to be schismatic (Gregory XII from Rome, Benedict XIII from Avignon) and appointed a new one, Alexander V. The existing popes refused to resign and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]].\n\nIn March 1415 the Pisan pope John XXIII fled from Constance in disguise. He was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance, nor would he consider resignation. The council deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, .\n\n===John Wycliff and Jan Hus===\n[[File:Bro\u017e\u00edk, V\u00e1clav - Hus p\u0159ed koncilem 6. \u010dervence 1415.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Painting of [[Jan Hus]] in Council of Constance by [[V\u00e1clav Bro\u017e\u00edk]].]]\n[[File:Hussites.gif|thumb|250px|Evolution of the Hussite movements]]\n[[John Wycliffe]] (or Wyclif) (1330\u20131384) was an English scholar and heretic best known for denouncing the corruptions of the Church, and his sponsoring the first translation of the Bible from Latin into English. He was a precursor of the Protestant Reformation. He emphasized the supremacy of the Bible, and called for a direct relationship between man and God, without interference by priests and bishops. His followers, called [[Lollards]], faced persecution by the Church of England. They went underground for over a century and played a role in the English Reformation.<ref>G. R.

Hus was executed in 1415, but his followers organized a peasants' war, 1419\u20131436, that was put down by the Empire with great brutality.

The City of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church pardoned such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\nIn addition to being the head of the Church, the Pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers, and pontiffs such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] often waged campaigns to protect and expand their temporal domains. Furthermore, the popes, in a spirit of refined competition with other Italian lords, spent lavishly both on private luxuries but also on public works, repairing or building churches, bridges, and a magnificent system of [[aqueducts in Rome]] that still function today.\n\nFrom 1505 to 1626, [[St. Peter's Basilica]], perhaps the most recognised Christian church, was built on the site of the old Constantinian basilica. It was also a time of increased contact with Greek culture, opening up new avenues of learning, especially in the fields of [[philosophy]], poetry, [[classics]], [[rhetoric]], and [[political science]], fostering a spirit of [[humanism]]\u2013all of which would influence the Church.\n\n==Reformation and Counter-Reformation==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century}}\n\n===Protestant Reformation (1521\u20131610)===\n{{Main article|Protestant Reformation|Protestantism}}\n[[File:Reformation.gif|thumb|Approximate spread of Protestantism after the Reformation, and following the Counter-Reformation.]]\nIn the early 16th century, movements were begun by two theologians, [[Martin Luther]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]], that aimed to reform the Church; these reformers are distinguished from previous ones in that they considered the root of corruptions to be doctrinal (rather than simply a matter of moral weakness or lack of ecclesiastical discipline) and thus they aimed to change contemporary doctrines to accord with what they perceived to be the \"true gospel.\" The word ''Protestant'' is derived from the Latin ''protestatio'' meaning ''declaration'' which refers to the [[Protestation at Speyer|letter of protestation]] by [[Lutheran]] princes against the decision of the [[Second Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the [[Diet of Worms]] against the Reformation.<ref name=\"TECGlossary\">[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm Definition of Protestantism at the Episcopal Church website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815180519/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19625_15125_ENG_HTM.htm |date=15 August 2007 }}</ref> Since that time, the term has been used in many different senses, but most often as a general term refers to [[Western Christianity]] that is not subject to papal authority.<ref name=\"TECGlossary\" /> The term \"Protestant\" was not originally used by Reformation era leaders; instead, they called themselves \"evangelical\", emphasising the \"return to the true gospel (Greek: ''euangelion'').\"<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. xx</ref>\n\nThe beginning of the Protestant Reformation is generally identified with [[Martin Luther]] and the posting of the [[The 95 Theses|95 Theses]] on the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany. Early protest was against corruptions such as [[simony]], episcopal vacancies, and the sale of [[indulgence]]s. The Protestant position, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as [[sola scriptura]] and [[sola fide]]. The three most important traditions to emerge directly from the Protestant Reformation were the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]], [[Presbyterian]], etc.), and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] traditions, though the latter group identifies as both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\", and some subgroups reject the classification as \"Protestant.\"\n\nThe Protestant Reformation may be divided into two distinct but basically simultaneous movements, the [[Magisterial Reformation]] and the [[Radical Reformation]]. The Magisterial Reformation involved the alliance of certain theological teachers (Latin: ''magistri'') such as Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, Cranmer, etc. with secular magistrates who cooperated in the reformation of Christendom. Radical Reformers, besides forming communities outside state sanction, often employed more extreme doctrinal change, such as the rejection of tenets of the Councils of Nicaea and Chalcedon. Often the division between magisterial and radical reformers was as or more violent than the general Catholic and Protestant hostilities.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation spread almost entirely within the confines of Northern Europe, but did not take hold in certain northern areas such as Ireland and parts of Germany. By far the magisterial reformers were more successful and their changes more widespread than the radical reformers. The Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation is known as the Counter Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, which resulted in a reassertion of traditional doctrines and the emergence of new religious orders aimed at both moral reform and new missionary activity. The Counter Reformation reconverted approximately 33% of Northern Europe to Catholicism and initiated missions in South and Central America, Africa, Asia, and even China and Japan. Protestant expansion outside of Europe occurred on a smaller scale through colonisation of North America and areas of Africa.\n\n====Martin Luther====\n{{Main article|Martin Luther}}\n{{See also|Theology of Martin Luther}}\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Martin Luther, by Lucas Cranach the Elder]]\n\nMartin Luther was an Augustinian friar and professor at the [[University of Wittenberg]]. In 1517, he published a list of [[95 Theses]], or points to be debated, concerning the illicitness of selling indulgences. Luther had a particular disdain for Aristotelian philosophy, and as he began developing his own theology, he increasingly came into conflict with [[Thomism|Thomistic]] scholars, most notably [[Thomas Cajetan|Cardinal Cajetan]].<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 124\u201325</ref> Soon, Luther had begun to develop his theology of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], or process by which one is \"made right\" (righteous) in the eyes of God. In Catholic theology, one is made righteous by a progressive infusion of grace accepted through faith and cooperated with through good works. Luther's doctrine of justification differed from Catholic theology in that justification rather meant \"the declaring of one to be righteous\", where God imputes the merits of Christ upon one who remains without inherent merit.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 119</ref> In this process, good works are more of an unessential byproduct that contribute nothing to one's own state of righteousness. Conflict between Luther and leading theologians lead to his gradual rejection of authority of the Church hierarchy. In 1520, he was condemned for heresy by the papal bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'', which he burned at Wittenberg along with books of [[canon law]].<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 128</ref>\n\n====Ulrich Zwingli====\n{{Main article|Huldrych Zwingli}}\n\n[[File:Ulrich Zwingli.jpg|thumb|left|Ulrich Zwingli, wearing the scholar's cap.]]\n\nUlrich Zwingli was a Swiss scholar and parish priest who was likewise influential in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. Zwingli claimed that his theology owed nothing to Luther, and that he had developed it in 1516, before Luther's famous protest, though his doctrine of justification was remarkably similar to that of the German friar.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 137\u201338</ref> In 1518, Zwingli was given a post at the wealthy collegiate church of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]], where he would remain until his death at a relatively young age. Soon he had risen to prominence in the city, and when political tension developed between most of Switzerland and the Catholic [[Habsburg]] [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. In this environment, Zwingli began preaching his version of reform, with certain points as the aforementioned doctrine of justification, but others (with which Luther vehemently disagreed) such as the position that veneration of icons was actually idolatry and thus a violation of the first commandment, and the denial of the [[real presence]] in the [[Eucharist]].<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 146\u201348</ref> Soon the city council had accepted Zwingli's doctrines and Zurich became a focal point of more radical reforming movements, and certain admirers and followers of Zwingli pushed his message and reforms far further than even he had intended, such as rejecting infant baptism.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) pp. 148\u201349</ref> This split between Luther and Zwingli formed the essence of the Protestant division between Lutheran and Reformed theology. Meanwhile, political tensions increased; Zwingli and the Zurich leadership imposed an economic blockade on the inner Catholic states of Switzerland, which led to a [[Second War of Kappel|battle]] in which Zwingli, in full armor, was slain along with his troops.\n\n====John Calvin====\n{{Main article|John Calvin}}\n{{See also|Calvinism}}\nJohn Calvin was a French cleric and doctor of law turned Protestant reformer. He belonged to the second generation of the Reformation, publishing his theological tome, the ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'', in 1536 (later revised), and establishing himself as a leader of the Reformed church in [[Geneva]], which became an \"unofficial capital\" of Reformed Christianity in the second half of the 16th century. He exerted a remarkable amount of authority in the city and over the city council, such that he has (rather ignominiously) been called a \"Protestant pope.\" Calvin established an eldership together with a \"[[Consistory (Protestantism)#Reformed usage|consistory]]\", where pastors and the elders established matters of religious discipline for the Genevan population.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 238</ref> [[Calvin's theology]] is best known for his doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|(double) predestination]], which held that God had, from all eternity, [[Divine Providence|providentially]] foreordained who would be saved ([[unconditional election|the elect]]) and likewise who would be damned ([[reprobation|the reprobate]]). Predestination was not the dominant idea in Calvin's works, but it would seemingly become so for many of his Reformed successors.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 243</ref>\n\n====English Reformation====\n{{See also|English Civil War}}\n[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|150px|Statue of [[Richard Hooker]], whose emphases on reason, tolerance and inclusiveness influenced [[Anglicanism]].]]\n\nUnlike other reform movements, the [[English Reformation]] began by royal influence. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] considered himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther in a book he commissioned entitled, ''[[Defence of the Seven Sacraments|The Defence of the Seven Sacraments]]'', for which [[Leo X|Pope Leo X]] awarded him the title ''[[Fidei Defensor]]'' (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with [[Catherine of Aragon]], for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from Rome and the declaration of the King of England as head of the [[Church of England|English Church]]. England would later experience periods of frenetic and eclectic reforms contrasted by periods led by staunch conservatives. Monarchs such as [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] such as [[Thomas Cranmer]] and [[William Laud]] pushed the Church of England in many directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was a state church that considered itself both \"Reformed\" and \"Catholic\" but not \"Roman\" (and hesitated from the title \"Protestant\"), and other \"unofficial\" more radical movements such as the [[Puritan]]s.\n\n===Counter-Reformation (1545\u20131610)===\n{{Main article|Counter-Reformation}}\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the response of the Catholic Church to the Protestant Reformation. The essence of the Counter-Reformation was a renewed conviction in traditional practices and the upholding of Catholic doctrine as the source of ecclesiastic and moral reform, and the answer to halt the spread of Protestantism. Thus it experienced the founding of new religious orders, such as the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the establishment of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests, renewed worldwide missionary activity, and the development of new yet orthodox forms of spirituality, such as that of the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. The entire process was spearheaded by the [[Council of Trent]], which clarified and reasserted doctrine, issued dogmatic definitions, and produced the ''[[Roman Catechism]]''.\n\nThough Ireland, Spain, France, and elsewhere featured significantly in the Counter-Reformation, its heart was Italy and the various popes of the time, who established the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (the list of prohibited books) and the [[Roman Inquisition]], a system of juridical tribunals that prosecuted heresy and related offences. The Papacy of [[Pope Pius V|St. Pius V]] (1566\u20131572) was known not only for its focus on halting heresy and worldly abuses within the Church, but also for its focus on improving popular piety in a determined effort to stem the appeal of Protestantism. Pius began his pontificate by giving large alms to the poor, charity, and hospitals, and the pontiff was known for consoling the poor and sick, and supporting missionaries. The activities of these pontiffs coincided with a rediscovery of the ancient Christian catacombs in Rome. As [[Diarmaid MacCulloch]] stated, \"Just as these ancient martyrs were revealed once more, Catholics were beginning to be martyred afresh, both in mission fields overseas and in the struggle to win back Protestant northern Europe: the catacombs proved to be an inspiration for many to action and to heroism.\"<ref>[[Diarmaid MacCulloch|MacCulloch, Diarmaid]], ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 404</ref>\n\n====The Council of Trent====\n{{Main article|Council of Trent}}\n[[File:Council of Trent.JPG|thumb|right|225px|The Council in [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] church; Museo Diocesiano Tridentino, Trento]]\n\nThe [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563), initiated by [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) addressed issues of certain ecclesiastical corruptions such as [[simony]], [[absenteeism]], [[nepotism]], and other abuses, as well as the reassertion of traditional practices and the dogmatic articulation of the traditional doctrines of the Church, such as the episcopal structure, clerical celibacy, the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|seven Sacraments]], [[transubstantiation]] (the belief that during mass the consecrated bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ), the veneration of relics, icons, and saints (especially the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]), the necessity of both faith and good works for salvation, the existence of purgatory and the issuance (but not the sale) of indulgences, etc. In other words, all Protestant doctrinal objections and changes were uncompromisingly rejected. The Council also fostered an interest in education for parish priests to increase pastoral care. [[Milan]]'s Archbishop [[Saint Charles Borromeo]] (1538\u20131584) set an example by visiting the remotest parishes and instilling high standards.\n\n====Catholic missions====\nCatholic missions were carried to new places beginning with the new [[Age of Discovery]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] in the Americas and other colonies in order to spread Christianity in the New World and to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such as [[Francis Xavier]] as well as other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. While some of these missions were associated with imperialism and oppression, others (notably [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China) were relatively peaceful and focused on integration rather than [[cultural imperialism]].\n\n==Church and the Enlightenment (1610\u20131800)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}\n\n===Trial of Galileo===\n[[File:Galileo before the Holy Office.jpg|thumb|350px|''Galileo before the Holy Office'', a 19th-century painting by [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]]]]\nThe [[Galileo affair]], in which [[Galileo Galilei]] came into conflict with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over his support of [[heliocentrism|Copernican astronomy]], is often considered a defining moment in the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]].\n\nIn 1610, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]] (Starry Messenger)'', describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new [[telescope]]. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the [[Heaven]]s that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] theory of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].\n\nIn reaction, many scholars maintained that the motion of the Earth and immobility of the Sun were [[heresy|heretical]], as they contradicted some accounts given in the [[Bible]] as understood at that time. Galileo's part in the controversies over [[theology]], astronomy and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633, on a grave suspicion of heresy.\n\n===Puritans in North America===\n{{Main article|Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)}}\n{{See also|History of the Puritans}}\nThe most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540</ref> The Puritans, or [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, and thus they set out for the New World and the hopes of a Puritan utopia.\n\n==Early Modern era==\nThis is the period from the [[Industrial revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]] until the mid 19th century.\n\nSee the [[French Republican Calendar]] and [[anti-clerical]] measures.

Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in Germany, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in England.<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263</ref> It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800\u20131830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of groups such as the [[Mormons]], the [[Restoration Movement]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].\n\n===Restorationism===\n{{Main article|Restoration Movement}}\n{{See also|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}\nRestorationism refers to the belief that a purer form of Christianity should be restored using the [[Early Christianity|early church]] as a model.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement: Models of Restoration\">Douglas Allen Foster and Anthony L.

Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. \"Restorationism\" is often used to describe the [[Restoration Movement|Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement]].\n\n====Jehovah's Witnesses====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]]\n\n====Latter Day Saint movement====\nThe term \"Restorationist\" is also used to describe the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Community of Christ]] and numerous other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints sects]].

Nevertheless, the [[Church reform of Peter I]] in the early 18th century had placed the Orthodox authorities under the control of the [[Tsar]]. An official (titled [[Ober-Procurator]]) appointed by the Tsar himself ran the committee which governed the Church between 1721 and 1918: the [[Most Holy Synod]].\n\nThe Church became involved in the various campaigns of [[russification]],<ref>Natalia Shlikhta (2004) \"'Greek Catholic'\u2013'Orthodox'\u2013'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?\" in ''Religion, State & Society'', Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge)\n</ref> and was accused of involvement in [[anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]].<ref>Shlomo Lambroza, John D.

Although the authors of the article label the active role of the Church in inciting the government to conduct anti-Jewish acts (for example in the case of Ivan the Terrible's policy in the defeated territories) as \"obvious\", no facts are given in their article to support this. http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=787\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Bolsheviks]] and other Russian revolutionaries saw the Church, like the Tsarist state, as an [[enemy of the people]].\n\n====Russian Orthodox Church in the Soviet Union====\n{{Further information|Religion in the Soviet Union}}\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the [[White Army]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] (see [[White movement]]) after the October Revolution. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church.\n\nAfter the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (25 October Old Calendar) there was a movement within the Soviet Union to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see [[Communist International]]). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States. Since some of these Slavic states tied their ethnic heritage to their ethnic churches, both the peoples and their church where targeted by the Soviet.<ref>President of Lithuania: Prisoner of the Gulag a Biography of [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]] by Afonsas Eidintas Genocide and Research Centre of Lithuania {{ISBN|9789986757412}} p. 23 \"As early as August 1920 [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] wrote to [[E.

Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated [[anti-religious]] atheistic propaganda in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organised religions were never outlawed.\nSome actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with [[execution]] included torture being sent to [[gulags|prison camps]], [[sharashka|labour camps]] or [[Psikhushka|mental hospitals]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Father Arseny 1893\u20131973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.

In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.<ref>[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard]]. \"Cross meets Kremlin\" TIME Magazine, 24 June 2001. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html</ref> This included people like the [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] who was at this point a monastic. Along with her murder was [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich]] Romanov; the Princes [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia|Ioann Konstantinovich]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Konstantin Konstantinovich]], [[Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Igor Konstantinovich]] and [[Vladimir Paley|Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]]; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and [[Varvara Yakovleva]], a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Church of Maria Magdalene]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Christ the Saviour Cathedral Moscow]] after reconstruction]]\nThe main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to fewer than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Father [[Pavel Florensky]] was one of the [[New-martyr]]s of this particular period.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref>Ostling, Richard. \"Cross meets Kremlin\" ''Time Magazine'', 24 June 2001. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html</ref>\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many [[New-martyr]]s added as Saints from the yoke.\n\n====Diaspora emigration to the West====\nOne of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically \"eastern\" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice.\n\n===Modern trends in Christian theology===\n\n====Modernism and liberal Christianity====\n{{Main article|Liberal Christianity}}\n[[Liberal Christianity]], sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically informed religious movements and moods within late 18th, 19th and 20th-century Christianity. The word \"liberal\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\n====Fundamentalism====\n{{Main article|Christian fundamentalism}}\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and American [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th century and early 20th century in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian.\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"[[The Fundamentals|fundamentals]]\": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent [[Second Coming of Christ|return of Jesus Christ]].\n\n====Under/During Nazism====\n[[File:Papst Pius XI. 1JS.jpg|thumb|150px|Pope Pius XI]]\nThe position of Christians affected by Nazism is highly complex.\n\nRegarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, \"There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.</ref> [[Pope Pius XI]] declared \u2013 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' \u2013 that Fascist governments had hidden \"pagan intentions\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and [[Totalitarian]] Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God, fundamental [[human rights]] and dignity. His declaration that \"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCatholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in [[Dachau]], and 2,000 of them were executed. A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37.</ref> Many Catholic laymen and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876\u20131958). The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2008), p. 332.</ref> A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the [[German Lutheran Church]], was complex. Though many<ref>http://www.catholicarrogance.org/Catholic/Hitlersfaith-1.html</ref> Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\n\n===Second Vatican Council===\n{{Main article|Second Vatican Council}}\nOn 11 October 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was \"pastoral\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin.\n\n===Ecumenism===\n{{Main article|Ecumenism}}\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"''Ecumenism''\" is derived from Greek {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness.\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\n\n====Catholic ecumenism====\n{{Main article|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}\nOver the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]]. Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.\n\nOn 30 November 1894, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the Apostolic Letter ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm Orientalium Dignitas]'' (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\n\nSome of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. ''Filioque'', [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.\n\nWith respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.\n\n=== Pentecostal movement ===\n{{Main article|Pentecostalism}}\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=300\n|image1=Countries by percentage of Protestants 1938.svg\n|image2=Countries by percentage of Protestants (2010).svg\n|caption2=Countries by percentage of Protestants in 1938 and 2010. Pentecostal and [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations fueled much of the growth in Africa and Latin America.}}\nThe [[Third Great Awakening]] (1904 onwards) had its roots in the Holiness movement which had developed in the late 19th century. The Pentecostal revival movement began, out of a passion for more power and a greater outpouring of the Spirit. In 1902, the American evangelists Reuben Archer Torrey and Charles M. Alexander conducted meetings in Melbourne, Australia, resulting in more than 8,000 converts. News of this revival travelled fast, igniting a passion for prayer and an expectation that God would work in similar ways elsewhere.\n\nTorrey and Alexander were involved in the beginnings of the great Welsh revival (1904) which led Jessie Penn-Lewis to witness the working of Satan during times of revival, and write her book \"War on the Saints\".  In 1906, the modern Pentecostal Movement was born on [[Azusa Street]] in Los Angeles.  Pentecostalism in turn inspired the [[Charismatic]] movement within already established denominations.\n\nIn reaction to these developments, [[Christian fundamentalism]] was a movement to reject the radical influences of philosophical humanism, as this was affecting the Christian religion. Especially targeting critical approaches to the interpretation of the Bible, and trying to blockade the inroads made into their churches by atheistic scientific assumptions, the fundamentalists began to appear in various denominations as numerous independent movements of resistance to the drift away from historic Christianity. Over time, the Fundamentalist Evangelical movement has divided into two main wings, with the label Fundamentalist following one branch, while [[Evangelical]] has become the preferred banner of the more moderate movement. Although both movements primarily originated in the English-speaking world, the majority of Evangelicals now live elsewhere in the world.\n\n====Ecumenism within Protestantism====\n[[Ecumenical]] movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church.\" This [[ecclesiology]] is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church.\" The \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the [[Trinity]], belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], and that He died and rose again bodily.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History|Bible|Saints|Religion}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Christianity: A History}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Christianity and Paganism]]\n* [[Christ myth theory]]\n* [[History of Christian theology]]\n* [[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[History of Protestantism]]\n* [[History of Oriental Orthodoxy]]\n* [[Christianization]]\n* [[Timeline of Christianity]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n* [[Protestantism]]\n* [[Rise of Christianity during the Fall of Rome]]\n* [[Role of the Christian Church in civilization]]\n* [[Timeline of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n* [[Restoration Movement]]\n* [[Timeline of Christian missions]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Christianity by century}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[John Bowden (theologian)|Bowden, John]].

The term ''cycles per second'' was largely replaced by ''hertz'' by the 1970s.

[[Light]] is electromagnetic radiation that is even higher in frequency, and has frequencies in the range of tens ([[infrared]]) to thousands ([[ultraviolet]]) of terahertz. Electromagnetic radiation with frequencies in the low terahertz range (intermediate between those of the highest normally usable radio frequencies and long-wave infrared light) is often called [[terahertz radiation]]. Even higher frequencies exist, such as that of [[gamma ray]]s, which can be measured in exahertz (EHz). (For historical reasons, the frequencies of light and higher frequency electromagnetic radiation are more commonly specified in terms of their [[wavelength]]s or [[photon]] [[Energy|energies]]: for a more detailed treatment of this and the above frequency ranges, see [[electromagnetic spectrum]].)\n\n===Computers===\n{{details|topic=why the frequency, including for gigahertz (GHz) etc., is a flawed speed indicator for computers|Megahertz myth}}\nIn computers, most [[central processing unit]]s (CPU) are labeled in terms of their [[clock rate]] expressed in megahertz (10<sup>6</sup> Hz) or gigahertz (10<sup>9</sup> Hz). This specification refers to the frequency of the CPU's master [[clock signal]]. This signal is a [[square wave]], which is an electrical voltage that switches between low and high logic values at regular intervals. As the hertz has become the primary unit of measurement accepted by the general populace to determine the performance of a CPU, many experts have criticized this approach, which they claim is an [[Megahertz myth|easily manipulable benchmark]]. Some processors use multiple clock periods to perform a single operation, while others can perform multiple operations in a single cycle.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amit |last=Asaravala |url=https://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,62851,00.html |title=Good Riddance, Gigahertz |website=Wired.com |date=2004-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-28}}</ref> For personal computers, CPU clock speeds have ranged from approximately 1&nbsp;MHz in the late 1970s ([[Atari]], [[Commodore International|Commodore]], [[Apple computers]]) to up to 6&nbsp;GHz in [[IBM POWER microprocessors]].\n\nVarious [[Bus (computing)|computer buses]], such as the [[front-side bus]] connecting the CPU and [[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]], also operate at various frequencies in the megahertz range.\n\n== {{Visible anchor|SI multiples}} == <!-- Other articles link here. -->\n{{SI multiples\n| symbol=Hz\n| unit=hertz\n| note=Common prefixed units are in bold face.\n| k=10<sup>3</sup> s|M=10<sup>6</sup> s|G=10<sup>9</sup> s|T=10<sup>12</sup> s|\n| anchor=SI_prefixed_forms_of_hertz\n| right=\n}}\n\nHigher frequencies than the [[International System of Units]] provides prefixes for are believed to occur naturally in the frequencies of the quantum-mechanical vibrations of high-energy, or, equivalently, massive particles, although these are not directly observable and must be inferred from their interactions with other phenomena.

Use of the heroic couplet was pioneered by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] in the ''[[Legend of Good Women]]'' and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',<ref name=Hobsbaum>Hobsbaum, Philip. ''Metre, Rhythm and Verse Form''.  Routledge (1996) p.23</ref> and generally considered to have been perfected by [[John Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope]] in the Restoration Age and early 18th century respectively. \n\n==Example==\nA frequently-cited example illustrating the use of heroic couplets is this passage from ''Cooper's Hill'' by [[John Denham (poet)|John Denham]], part of his description of the [[River Thames|Thames]]:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nO could I flow like thee, and make thy stream\nMy great example, as it is my theme!\nThough deep yet clear, though gentle yet not dull;\nStrong without rage, without o'erflowing full.\n</poem>}}\n\n==History==\nThe term \"heroic couplet\" is sometimes reserved for couplets that are largely ''closed'' and self-contained, as opposed to the [[enjambment|enjambed]] couplets of poets like [[John Donne]]. The heroic couplet is often identified with the [[English Baroque]] works of [[John Dryden]] and [[Alexander Pope]], who used the form for their translations of the epics of [[Virgil]] and [[Homer]], respectively. Major poems in the closed couplet, apart from the works of Dryden and Pope, are  [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[The Vanity of Human Wishes]]'', [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[The Deserted Village]]'', and [[John Keats]]'s ''[[Lamia and Other Poems|Lamia]]''. The form was immensely popular in the 18th century. The looser type of couplet, with occasional enjambment, was one of the standard verse forms in medieval narrative poetry, largely because of the influence of the [[Canterbury Tales]].\n\n==Variations==\nEnglish heroic couplets, especially in Dryden and his followers, are sometimes varied by the use of the occasional [[alexandrine]], or [[hexameter]] line, and [[tercet|triplet]]. Often these two variations are used together to heighten a climax. The breaking of the regular pattern of rhyming pentameter pairs brings about a sense of [[poetic closure]].  Here are two examples from Book IV of Dryden's translation of the ''[[Aeneid]]''.\n===''Alexandrine''===\n{{quote|<poem>\nHer lofty [[Courser (horse)|courser]], in the court below,\nWho his majestic rider seems to know,  \nProud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,  \nAnd champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.\n</poem>|(ll. 190\u2013193)}}\n\n===''Alexandrine and Triplet''===\n{{quote|<poem>\nMy Tyrians, at their injur\u2019d queen\u2019s command,  \nHad toss\u2019d their fires amid the Trojan band;  \nAt once extinguish\u2019d all the faithless name;  \nAnd I myself, in vengeance of my shame,\nHad fall\u2019n upon the pile, to mend the fun\u2019ral flame.\n</poem>|(ll. 867\u2013871)}}\n\n==Modern use==\nTwentieth-century authors have occasionally made use of the heroic couplet, often as an allusion to the works of poets of previous centuries. An example of this is [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the second section of which is a 999-line, 4-canto poem largely written in loose heroic couplets with frequent [[enjambment]].<ref name=Ferrando>{{cite book |last=Ferrando |first=Ignasi Navarro |title=In-roads of Language: Essay in English Studies |publisher=Universitat Jaume I |date=1996 |page=125}}</ref> Here is an example from the first canto:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAnd then black night.

[[Loki]], the mischief-maker, upon finding out about Baldr's one weakness, made a spear from mistletoe, and helped H\u00f6\u00f0r shoot it at Baldr.<ref name=\"D'AulaireD'Aulaire2005\">{{cite book|author1=Ingri D'Aulaire|author2=Edgar Parin D'Aulaire|title=D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TzMqpL66DDYC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&focus=viewport&vq=hod&dq=Hod|year=2005|publisher=New York Review of Books|isbn=978-1-59017-125-7|page=131}}</ref><ref name=\"Conway1990\">{{cite book|author=D.

On the other hand, the names of many gods occur in kennings and the poets might not have been particular in using any god name as a part of a kenning{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.\n\n==''Gesta Danorum''==\n[[Image:Hotherus and wood maidens by Froelich.jpg|left|thumb|300px|In [[Saxo Grammaticus|Saxo]]'s version of the story H\u00f8therus meets wood maidens who warn him that Balderus is a demi-god who can't be killed by normal means.]]\n\nIn ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' '''Hotherus''' is a human hero of the Danish and Swedish royal lines. He is gifted in swimming, archery, fighting and music and Nanna, daughter of King [[Gevarus]] falls in love with him. But at the same time Balderus, son of Othinus, has caught sight of Nanna bathing and fallen violently in love with her. He resolves to slay Hotherus, his rival.\n\nOut hunting, Hotherus is led astray by a mist and meets wood-maidens who control the fortunes of war. They warn him that Balderus has designs on Nanna but also tell him that he shouldn't attack him in battle since he is a demigod. Hotherus goes to consult with King Gevarus and asks him for his daughter. The king replies that he would gladly favour him but that Balderus has already made a like request and he does not want to incur his wrath.\n\nGevarus tells Hotherus that Balderus is invincible but that he knows of one weapon which can defeat him, a sword kept by [[Mimingus]], the satyr of the woods. Mimingus also has another magical artifact, a bracelet that increases the wealth of its owner. Riding through a region of extraordinary cold in a carriage drawn by reindeer, Hotherus captures the satyr with a clever ruse and forces him to yield his artifacts.\n\nHearing about Hotherus's artifacts, Gelderus, king of Saxony, equips a fleet to attack him. Gevarus warns Hotherus of this and tells him where to meet Gelderus in battle. When the battle is joined, Hotherus and his men save their missiles while defending themselves against those of the enemy with a [[testudo formation]]. With his missiles exhausted, Gelderus is forced to sue for peace. He is treated mercifully by Hotherus and becomes his ally. Hotherus then gains another ally with his eloquent oratory by helping King Helgo of [[H\u00e5logaland]] win a bride.\n\nMeanwhile, Balderus enters the country of king Gevarus armed and sues for Nanna. Gevarus tells him to learn Nanna's own mind. Balderus addresses her with cajoling words but is refused. Nanna tells him that because of the great difference in their nature and stature, since he is a demigod, they are not suitable for marriage.\n\nAs news of Balderus's efforts reaches Hotherus, he and his allies resolve to attack Balderus. A great naval battle ensues where the gods fight on the side of Balderus. [[Thor]]o in particular shatters all opposition with his mighty club. When the battle seems lost, Hotherus manages to hew Thoro's club off at the haft and the gods are forced to retreat. Gelderus perishes in the battle and Hotherus arranges a funeral pyre of vessels for him. After this battle Hotherus finally marries Nanna.\n\nBalderus is not completely defeated and shortly afterwards returns to defeat Hotherus in the field. But Balderus's victory is without fruit for he is still without Nanna. Lovesick, he is harassed by phantoms in Nanna's likeness and his health deteriorates so that he cannot walk but has himself drawn around in a cart.\n\nAfter a while Hotherus and Balderus have their third battle and again Hotherus is forced to retreat. Weary of life because of his misfortunes, he plans to retire and wanders into the wilderness. In a cave he comes upon the same maidens he had met at the start of his career. Now they tell him that he can defeat Balderus if he gets a taste of some extraordinary food which had been devised to increase the strength of Balderus.\n\nEncouraged by this, Hotherus returns from exile and once again meets Balderus in the field. After a day of inconclusive fighting, he goes out during the night to spy on the enemy. He finds where Balderus's magical food is prepared and plays the lyre for the maidens preparing it. While they don't want to give him the food, they bestow on him a belt and a girdle which secure victory.\n\nHeading back to his camp, Hotherus meets Balderus and plunges his sword into his side. After three days, Balderus dies from his wound. Many years later, Bous, the son of Othinus and Rinda, avenges his brother by killing Hotherus in a duel.\n\n==''Chronicon Lethrense'' and ''Annales Lundenses''==\nThere are also two lesser-known Danish{{Ndash}}Latin chronicles, the ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and the ''Annales Lundenses'', of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second [[euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of H\u00f6\u00f0r's slaying of Balder.\n\nIt relates that Hother was the king of the [[Saxons]], son of [[Hothbrodd|Hothbrod]], the daughter of [[Hadding]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/lejre.html|title=lejre|date=2007-03-10|access-date=2017-11-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310135852/http://www.oe.eclipse.co.uk/nom/lejre.html|archivedate=2007-03-10|df=}}</ref> Hother first slew Othen's (i.e., Odin's) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor.

Reaves translation, iUniverse, 2004</ref> the story of Baldr's death was taken from [[H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa]], a poem composed by [[Ulfr Uggason]] around 990 AD at a feast thrown by the Icelandic Chief [[\u00d3l\u00e1fr H\u00f6skuldsson]] to celebrate the finished construction of his new home, Hjar\u00f0arholt, the walls of which were filled with symbolic representations of the Baldr myth among others. Rydberg suggested that H\u00f6\u00f0r was depicted with eyes closed and Loki guiding his aim to indicate that Loki was the true cause of Baldr's death and H\u00f6\u00f0r was only his \"blind tool.\" Rydberg theorized that the author of the ''Gylfaginning'' then mistook the description of the symbolic artwork in the H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa as the actual tale of Baldr's death.\n\n==Notes==\n{{commons category|H\u00f6\u00f0r}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Henry Adams Bellows (businessman)|Bellows, Henry Adams]] (trans.)

During the period of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (ca. 550-330 BC), the surrounding district was known as ''Haraiva'' (in [[Old Persian]]), and in classical sources the region was correspondingly known as [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (Areia). In the [[Zoroastrian]] [[Avesta]], the district is mentioned as ''Haroiva''. The name of the district and its main town is derived from that of the chief river of the region, the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Herey River]] (Old Dari ''Hereyrud'', \"Silken Water\"), which traverses the district and passes some {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} south of modern Her\u0101t. Herey is mentioned in Sanskrit as yellow or golden color equivalent to Persian \"Zard\" meaning Gold (yellow).

At the time of Alexander the Great in 330 BC, Aria was obviously an important district. It was administered by a [[satrap]] called [[Satibarzanes]], who was one of the three main Persian officials in the East of the Empire, together with the satrap [[Bessus]] of [[Bactria]] and Barsaentes of Arachosia. In late 330 BC, Alexander captured the Arian capital that was called [[Artacoana]]. The town was rebuilt and the citadel was constructed. Afghanistan became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] after Alexander died, which formed an alliance with the Indian [[Maurya Empire]]. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Historian [[Strabo]] writes that the Seleucids later gave the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the Mauryas after a treaty was made.{{Quote|Alexander took these away from the Aryans and established settlements of his own, but [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]] gave them to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Sandrocottus]] ([[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]), upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange 500 elephants.<ref>An Historical Guide to Kabul \u2013 The Story of Kabul by [[Nancy Hatch Dupree]] / A\u1e25mad \u02bbAl\u012b Kuhz\u0101d.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, most sources suggest that Herat was predominantly [[Zoroastrian]]. It became part of the [[Parthian Empire]] in 167 BC. In the [[Sasanian]] period (226-652), ''Har\u0113v'' is listed in an inscription on the [[Ka'ba-i Zartosht]] at [[Naqsh-e Rustam]]; and ''Hariy'' is mentioned in the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] catalogue of the provincial capitals of the empire.

It must be underlined, however, that Herat remained one of the three Sasanian mint centers in the east, the other two being [[Balkh Province|Balkh]] and [[Merv|Marv]]. The Hephthalites from Herat and some unidentified [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] opposed the Arab forces in a battle of Qohest\u0101n in 651-52 AD, trying to block their advance on [[Nishapur|Nish\u0101pur]], but they were defeated\n\nWhen the Arab armies appeared in [[Greater Khorasan|Khor\u0101s\u0101n]] in the 650s AD, Her\u0101t was counted among the twelve capital towns of the Sasanian Empire. The Arab army under the general command of [[Ahnaf ibn Qais]] in its conquest of Khor\u0101s\u0101n in 652 seems to have avoided Her\u0101t, but it can be assumed that the city eventually submitted to the Arabs, since shortly afterwards an Arab governor is mentioned there. A treaty was drawn in which the regions of B\u0101dghis and Bushanj were included. As did many other places in Khor\u0101s\u0101n, Her\u0101t rebelled and had to be re-conquered several times.<ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Abu Ja\u2019far Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Jarir \u1e6cabari]], Ta\u02berikh al-rosul wa\u2019l-moluk, pp. 2904-6</ref>\n\nAnother power that was active in the area in the 650s was [[Tang dynasty]] China which had embarked on a campaign that culminated in the [[Conquest of the Western Turks]]. By 659-661, the Tang claimed a tenuous suzerainty over Herat, the westernmost point of Chinese power in its long history.

The city was noted for its textiles during the Abbasid Caliphate, according to many references by geographers. Her\u0101t also had many learned sons such as [[Khwajah Abdullah Ansari|Ans\u0101r\u012b]]. The city is described by [[Estakhri]] and [[Ibn Hawqal]] in the 10th century as a prosperous town surrounded by strong walls with plenty of water sources, extensive suburbs, an inner citadel, a congregational mosque, and four gates, each gate opening to a thriving market place. The government building was outside the city at a distance of about a mile in a place called Khor\u0101s\u0101n\u0101b\u0101d.

The Saffarids succeeded in expelling the Taherids from Khorasan in 873.\n\nThe [[Samanids|S\u0101m\u0101nid dynasty]] was established in [[Transoxiana]] by three brothers, [[Nuh I|Nuh]], [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahy\u0101]], and [[Ahmad Samani|Ahmad]]. Ahmad S\u0101m\u0101ni opened the way for the Samanid dynasty to the conquest of Khor\u0101s\u0101n, including Her\u0101t, which they were to rule for one century. The centralized Samanid administration served as a model for later dynasties. The Samanid power was destroyed in 999 by the [[Qarakhanids]], who were advancing on Transoxiana from the northeast, and by the [[Ghaznavids]], former Samanid retainers, attacking from the southeast.\n\nSultan Ma\u1e25mud of Ghazni officially took control of Khor\u0101s\u0101n in 998.

According to the account of Mustawfi, Herat flourished especially under the [[Ghurid dynasty]] in the 12th century. Mustawfi reported that there were \"359 colleges in Herat, 12,000 shops all fully occupied, 6,000 bath-houses; besides caravanserais and mills, also a [[darwish]] [[convent]] and a fire temple\".

The city was destroyed a second time and remained in ruins from 1222 to about 1236. In 1244 a local prince Shams al-Din Kart was named ruler of Her\u0101t by the Mongol governor of Khor\u0101s\u0101n and in 1255 he was confirmed in his rule by the founder of the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khan dynasty]] [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]]. Shams al-Din founded a new dynasty and his successors, especially Fakhr-al-Din and Ghiyath al-Din, built many mosques and other buildings. The members of this dynasty were great patrons of literature and the arts.

The city reached its greatest glory under the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid princes]], especially [[Husayn Bayqarah|Sultan Husayn Bayqara]] who ruled Herat from 1469 until May 4, 1506. His chief minister, the poet and author in Persian and Turkish, [[Ali-Shir Nava'i|Mir Ali-Shir Nava'i]] was a great builder and patron of the arts. Under the Timurids, Herat assumed the role of the main capital of an empire that extended in the West as far as central Persia. As the capital of the Timurid empire, it boasted many fine religious buildings and was famous for its sumptuous court life and musical performance and its tradition of miniature paintings. On the whole, the period was one of relative stability, prosperity, and development of economy and cultural activities. It began with the nomination of [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shahrokh]], the youngest son of Timur, as governor of Herat in 1397. The reign of Shahrokh in Herat was marked by intense royal patronage, building activities, and promotion of manufacturing and trade, especially through the restoration and enlargement of the Herat's b\u0101z\u0101r. The present Musallah Complex, and many buildings such as the madrasa of [[Goharshad]], Ali Shir mah\u0101l, many gardens, and others, date from this time. The village of [[Gazar Gah]], over two km northeast of Herat, contained a shrine which was enlarged and embellished under the Timurids. The tomb of the poet and mystic [[Khwajah Abdullah Ansari|Khw\u0101jah Abdull\u0101h Ans\u0101r\u012b]] (d. 1088), was first rebuilt by Shahrokh about 1425, and other famous men were buried in the shrine area.

The eastern reaches of the Hari River, including the rapids, are frozen hard in the winter, and people travel on it as on a road.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Her\u0101t\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 24.4\n|Feb record high C = 27.6\n|Mar record high C = 31.0\n|Apr record high C = 37.8\n|May record high C = 39.7\n|Jun record high C = 44.6\n|Jul record high C = 50.0\n|Aug record high C = 42.7\n|Sep record high C = 39.3\n|Oct record high C = 37.0\n|Nov record high C = 30.0\n|Dec record high C = 26.5\n|Jan high C = 9.1\n|Feb high C = 11.9\n|Mar high C = 17.9\n|Apr high C = 24.0\n|May high C = 29.6\n|Jun high C = 35.0\n|Jul high C = 36.7\n|Aug high C = 35.1\n|Sep high C = 31.4\n|Oct high C = 25.0\n|Nov high C = 17.8\n|Dec high C = 12.0\n|Jan mean C = 2.9\n|Feb mean C = 5.5\n|Mar mean C = 10.2\n|Apr mean C = 16.3\n|May mean C = 22.1\n|Jun mean C = 27.2\n|Jul mean C = 29.8\n|Aug mean C = 28.0\n|Sep mean C = 22.9\n|Oct mean C = 16.1\n|Nov mean C = 8.8\n|Dec mean C = 4.7\n|Jan low C = -2.9\n|Feb low C = -0.6\n|Mar low C = 3.8\n|Apr low C = 9.1\n|May low C = 13.3\n|Jun low C = 18.2\n|Jul low C = 21.2\n|Aug low C = 19.2\n|Sep low C = 13.2\n|Oct low C = 7.4\n|Nov low C = 1.0\n|Dec low C = -1.4\n|Jan record low C = \u221226.7\n|Feb record low C = -20.5\n|Mar record low C = \u221213.3\n|Apr record low C = -2.3\n|May record low C = 0.8\n|Jun record low C = 9.7\n|Jul record low C = 14.7\n|Aug record low C = 8.4\n|Sep record low C = 1.3\n|Oct record low C = -5.6\n|Nov record low C = \u221212.8\n|Dec record low C = \u221222.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 51.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 55.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 29.2\n|May precipitation mm = 9.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 1.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 10.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 35.8\n|Jan sun = 149.3\n|Feb sun = 153.5\n|Mar sun = 202.5\n|Apr sun = 235.7\n|May sun = 329.6\n|Jun sun = 362.6\n|Jul sun = 378.6\n|Aug sun = 344.8\n|Sep sun = 323.2\n|Oct sun = 274.0\n|Nov sun = 235.0\n|Dec sun = 143.1\n|Jan rain days = 6\n|Feb rain days = 8\n|Mar rain days = 8\n|Apr rain days = 7\n|May rain days = 2\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 0\n|Oct rain days = 1\n|Nov rain days = 3\n|Dec rain days = 5\n|Jan snow days = 2\n|Feb snow days = 2\n|Mar snow days = 1\n|Apr snow days = 0\n|May snow days = 0\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0\n|Nov snow days = 0\n|Dec snow days = 1\n|Jan humidity = 72\n|Feb humidity = 69\n|Mar humidity = 62\n|Apr humidity = 56\n|May humidity = 45\n|Jun humidity = 34\n|Jul humidity = 30\n|Aug humidity = 30\n|Sep humidity = 34\n|Oct humidity = 42\n|Nov humidity = 55\n|Dec humidity = 67\n|source 1 = NOAA (1959\u20131983)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n  |url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-II/AH/40938.TXT\n  |title = Herat Climate Normals 1959-1983\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = December 25, 2012}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Places of interest===\n[[File:Area of Herat in 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|An area of Herat]]\n\n*'''Foreign consulates'''\nIndia, Iran and Pakistan operate their consulate here for trade, military and political links.\n\n{{Location map many | Afghanistan\n                <!-- see details: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Location_map_many -->\n| width = 260   <!-- width of the map in pixels, default is 240.

[[Old Norse]] ''Hei\u00f0ab\u00fdr'', [[German language|German]] ''Haithabu'') was an important [[Viking Age]] (8th to the 11th centuries) trading settlement near the southern end of the [[Jutland Peninsula]], now in the [[Schleswig-Flensburg]] district of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]]. It is  the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein. \n\nThe settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the [[Schlei]], which connects to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15&nbsp;km to the [[Treene River]], which flows into the [[Eider River|Eider]] with its [[North Sea]] estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a [[corduroy road]] overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later L\u00fcbeck.\nHedeby was the second largest Nordic town during the Viking Age, after [[Upp\u00e5kra]] in present-day southern Sweden,<ref>Sveriges riksdag, [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/Fornlamningen-Uppakra_GX02Kr327/?text=true Motion 2009/10:Kr327 Fornl\u00e4mningen Upp\u00e5kra] 2009-10-05</ref>\nThe city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] was later founded on the other side of the Schlei.

In 808 the Danish king [[Gudfred|Godfred]] (Lat. Godofredus) destroyed a competing [[Early Slavs|Slav]] trade centre named [[Reric]], and it is recorded in the Frankish chronicles that he moved the merchants from there to Hedeby. This may have provided the initial impetus for the town to develop. The same sources record that Godfred strengthened the [[Danevirke]], an earthen wall that stretched across the south of the Jutland peninsula. The [[Danevirke]] joined the defensive walls of Hedeby to form an east-west barrier across the peninsula, from the marshes in the west to the Schlei inlet leading into the Baltic in the east.\n\nThe town itself was surrounded on its three landward sides (north, west, and south) by earthworks. At the end of the 9th century the northern and southern parts of the town were abandoned for the central section. Later a 9-metre (29-ft) high semi-circular wall was erected to guard the western approaches to the town. On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre.\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |work= |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women. Further: Never did I hear singing fouler than that of these people, it is a rumbling emanating from their throats, similar to that of a dog but even more bestial.\"''<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |work= |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Destruction===\nThe town was sacked in 1050 by King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway during a conflict with King [[Sweyn II of Denmark]]. He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110&lpg=PT110&dq=hedeby+slavs+1066&source=bl&ots=XXYAU9uYbz&sig=nOwUX1OdJyTGCw758s53v22zjkw&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi70b3K3KvLAhVFkJAKHcmXBB8Q6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=hedeby%20slavs%201066&f=false|accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

However, the division between the Afghan government and the Hazara people was already made too deep under Abdur Rahman. Hazara continued to face severe social, economic and political [[discrimination]] through most of the 20th century. In 1933 [[List of monarchs of Afghanistan|King]] [[Mohammed Nadir Khan]] was assassinated by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq Hazara]]. The Afghan government captured and executed him later, along with several of his innocent family members.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nMistrust of the central government by the Hazaras and local uprisings continued. In particular, in the 1940s, during [[Zahir Shah]]'s rule, a revolt took place against new taxes that were exclusively imposed on the Hazara. The Kuchi nomads meanwhile not only were exempted from taxes, but also received allowances from the Afghan government.<ref name=\"Monsutti\" /> The angry rebels began capturing and killing government officials. In response, the central government sent a force to subdue the region and later removed the taxes.\n[[File:Abdul Ali Mazari with his followers in Bamyan.jpg|left|thumb|[[Abdul Ali Mazari]] with his followers in [[Bamiyan]], leader of the [[Hizbe-Wahdat]] party during and following the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]].

However, rival Hazara political factions fought. The division was between the ''Tanz\u00e1im-i nasl-i naw-i Hazara'', a party based in Quetta, of Hazara nationalists and secular intellectuals, and the pro-[[Khomeini]] [[Islamist]] parties backed by the new ''Islamic Republic of Iran''.<ref name=\"Monsutti\" /> By 1979, the Iran-backed Islamist groups liberated Hazarajat from the central [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Soviet-backed Afghan government]] and later took entire control of Hazarajat away from the secularists. By 1984, after severe fighting, the secularist groups lost all their power to the Islamists.\n[[File:Bamyan Valley in 2012.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Bamiyan Valley]], the site of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]].]]\nAs the Soviets withdrew in 1989, the Islamist groups felt the need to broaden their political appeal and turned their focus to Hazara [[ethnic nationalism]].<ref name=\"Monsutti\" /> This led to establishment of the [[Hizb-i-Wahdat]], an alliance of all the Hazara resistance groups (except the ''Harakat-i Islami''). In 1992 with the fall of [[Kabul]], the ''Harakat-i Islami'' took sides with [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]]'s government while the Hizb-i-Wahdat took sides with the opposition. The Hizb-i-Wahdat was eventually forced out of Kabul in 1995 when the [[Taliban]] movement captured and killed their leader [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. With the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996, all the Hazara groups united with the new [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] against the common new enemy. However, it was too late and despite the fierce resistance Hazarajat fell to the Taliban by 1998. The Taliban had Hazarajat totally isolated from the rest of the world going as far as not allowing the [[United Nations]] to deliver food to the provinces of [[Bamiyan Province|Bamiyan]], [[Ghor Province|Ghor]], [[Wardak Province|Wardak]], and [[Daykundi Province|Daykundi]].<ref name=Rashid>{{cite book |last= Rashid|first= Ahmed|authorlink= Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia |edition= Paperback|date=  March 1, 2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0-300-08902-8}}</ref>\n\nThough Hazara played a role in the anti-Soviet movement, other Hazara participated in the new communist government, which actively courted Afghan minorities.

For example, there have been more than 5000 kilometers of road pavement completed across Afghanistan, of which little was done in central Afghanistan Hazarajat. On the other hand, the [[Band-e Amir]] in the [[Bamyan Province]] became the first [[national park]] of Afghanistan. The road from Kabul to [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] was also built, along with new police stations, government institutions, hospitals, and schools in the [[Bamyan Province]], [[Daykundi Province]], and the others.

In 2007 some Kuchi nomads entered into parts of Hazarajat to graze their livestock, and when the local Hazara resisted, a clash took place and several people on both sides died using assault rifles. Such events continue to occur, even after the central government was forced to intervene, including President [[Hamid Karzai]]. In late July 2012, a Hazara police commander in Uruzgan province reportedly rounded up and killed 9 Pashtun civilians in revenge for the death of two local Hazara. The matter is being investigated by the Afghan government.<ref name=\"yahoo\" />\n\nThe drive by President Hamid Karzai after the [[Afghan Peace Jirga 2010|Peace Jirga]] to strike a deal with Taliban leaders caused deep unease in Afghanistan's minority communities, who fought the Taliban the longest and suffered the most during their rule.

The earliest record of Hazara in the areas of Pakistan is found in Broadfoot's Sappers company from 1835 in Quetta. This company had also participated in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]]. Some Hazara also worked in the agriculture farms in [[Sindh]] and construction of Sukkur barrage. Haider Ali Karmal Jaghori was a prominent political thinker of the Hazara people in Pakistan, writing about the political history of Hazara people. His work ''Hazaraha wa Hazarajat Bastan Dar Aiyna-i-Tarikh'' was published in Quetta in 1992, and another work by Aziz Tughyan Hazara ''Tarikh Milli Hazara'' was published in 1984 in Quetta.\n\nMost Pakistani Hazaras today live in the city of Quetta, in [[Balochistan, Pakistan]]. Localities in the city of Quetta with prominent Hazara populations include [[Hazara Town]] and [[Mehr Abad]] and Hazara tribes such as the ''Sardar'' are exclusively Pakistani. Literacy level among the Hazara community in Pakistan is relatively high compare to the Hazaras of Afghanistan, and they have integrated well into the social dynamics of the local society. [[Saira Batool]], a Hazara woman, was one of the first female pilots in [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Other notable Hazara include Qazi Mohammad Esa, General [[Musa Khan Hazara]], who served as [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Commander in Chief of the Pakistani Army]] from 1958 to 1968, Air Marshal [[Sharbat Ali Changezi]], [[Hussain Ali Yousafi]], the slain chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/story/2009/01/090127_hazara_funeral_strike_zs.shtml \"Hussain Ali Yousafi, chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party'\"] ''BBC News'', 26 January 2009</ref> Syed Nasir Ali Shah, MNA from Quetta and his father [[Haji Sayed Hussain Hazara]] who was a senator and member of majlis shora during the [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] era.\n\nDespite all of this, Hazaras are often targeted by militant groups such as the [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and others. \"Activists say at least 800-1,000 Hazaras have been killed since 1999 and the pace is quickening.

While hawaladars are spread throughout the world, they are primarily located in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]], operating outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial channels, and [[remittance]] systems.

It is believed to have arisen in the financing of long-distance trade around the emerging capital trade centers in the early medieval period. In [[South Asia]], it appears to have developed into a fully-fledged money market instrument, which was only gradually replaced by the instruments of the formal [[bank|banking system]] in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n\"Hawala\" itself influenced the development of the [[Agency (law)|agency]] in [[common law]] and in [[civil law (private law)|civil laws]], such as the ''aval'' in [[Law of France|French law]] and the ''avallo'' in Italian law.

In Roman law, the \"contractor himself was considered the party to the contract and it took a second contract between the person who acted on behalf of a principal and the latter in order to transfer the rights and the obligations deriving from the contract to him\". On the other hand, Islamic law and the later common law \"had no difficulty in accepting agency as one of its institutions in the field of contracts and of obligations in general\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first= Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=26|issue=2 [Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24\u201325, 1977]|date=Spring 1978|pages=187\u201398 [196\u20138]|doi=10.2307/839667 |publisher=American Society of Comparative Law|jstor=839667}}</ref>\n\nToday, hawala is probably used mostly for migrant workers' [[remittance]]s to their countries of origin.\n\n==How hawala works==\nIn the most basic variant of the hawala system, money is transferred via a network of hawala brokers, or ''hawaladars''. It is the transfer of money without actually moving it. In fact, a successful definition of the hawala system that is used is \"money transfer without money movement\".  According to author Sam Vaknin, while there are large hawaladar operators with networks of middlemen in cities across many countries, most hawaladars are small businesses who work at hawala as a sideline or moonlighting operation.<ref name=\"Vaknin\" />\n\n[[Image:Hawala.png|thumb|Hawala example transaction; see text for an explanation]]\nThe figure shows how hawala works: (1)&nbsp;a&nbsp;customer (''A'', left-hand side) approaches a hawala broker (''X'') in one city and gives a sum of money (red arrow) that is to be transferred to a recipient (''B'', right-hand side) in another, usually foreign, city. Along with the money, he usually specifies something like a password that will lead to the money being paid out (blue arrows). (2b)&nbsp;The hawa calls another hawala broker ''M'' in the recipient's city, and informs ''M'' about the agreed password, or gives other disposition of the funds. Then, the intended recipient (''B''), who also has been informed by ''A'' about the password&nbsp;(2a), now approaches ''M'' and tells him the agreed password&nbsp;(3a). If the password is correct, then ''M'' releases the transferred sum to ''B'' (3b), usually minus a small commission. ''X'' now basically owes ''M'' the money that ''M'' had paid out to ''B''; thus ''M'' has to trust ''X''{{'}}s promise to settle the debt at a later date.\n\nThe unique feature of the system is that no [[Promissory note|promissory instruments]] are exchanged between the hawala brokers; the transaction takes place entirely on the [[honour system]]. As the system does not depend on the legal enforceability of claims, it can operate even in the absence of a legal and juridical environment. Trust and extensive use of connections are the components that distinguish it from other remittance systems. Hawaladars networks are often based on membership in the same family, village, clan, or ethnic group, and cheating is punished by effective ex-communication and \"loss of honour\"\u2014leading to severe economic hardship.<ref name=\"Vaknin\" />\n\nInformal records are produced of individual transactions, and a running tally of the amount owed by one broker to another is kept. Settlements of debts between hawala brokers can take a variety of forms (such as goods, services, properties, transfers of employees, etc.), and need not take the form of direct cash transactions.\n\nIn addition to commissions, hawala brokers often earn their profits through bypassing official [[exchange rate]]s. Generally, the funds enter the system in the source country's currency and leave the system in the recipient country's currency. As settlements often take place without any foreign exchange transactions, they can be made at other than official exchange rates.\n\nHawala is attractive to customers because it provides a fast and convenient transfer of funds, usually with a far lower commission than that charged by banks. Its advantages are most pronounced when the receiving country applies unprofitable exchange rate regulations or when the banking system in the receiving country is less complex (e.g., due to differences in legal environment in places such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia). Moreover, in some parts of the world it is the only option for legitimate fund transfers, and has even been used by aid organizations in areas where it is the best-functioning institution.<ref name=\"Passas, Nikos 2006 pp. 46\u201362\">{{cite journal |last=Passas |first=Nikos |year=2006|title=Demystifying Hawala: A Look into its Social Organization and Mechanics|journal=Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention |volume=7 |issue=suppl 1 |pages=46\u201362 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14043850601029083 |doi=10.1080/14043850601029083}}</ref>\n\n==Regional variants==\nDubai has been prominent for decades as a welcoming hub for hawala transactions worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/terrorist-illicit-finance/Documents/FinCEN-Hawala-rpt.pdf|title=Hawala|last=|first=|date=|website=www.treasury.gov|publisher=Financial Crimes Enforcement Network with Interpol/FOPAC|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===South Asia===\n\n====Hundis====\n{{main article|hundi}}\n[[File:1951 Bombay Province Rs 2500 Hundi.jpg|thumbnail|right|A 1951 hundi of Bombay Province for Rs 2500 with a pre-printed [[revenue stamp]].]]\nThe ''hundi'' is a financial instrument that developed on the Indian sub-continent for use in trade and credit transactions.

Water culture became a popular research technique after that. In 1699, [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] published his water culture experiments with [[spearmint]]. He found that plants in less-pure water sources grew better than plants in distilled water. By 1842, a list of nine elements believed to be essential for plant growth had been compiled, and the discoveries of German botanists [[Julius von Sachs]] and [[Wilhelm Knop]], in the years 1859\u20131875, resulted in a development of the technique of soilless cultivation.<ref name=\"Douglas1975\">Douglas, James S., ''Hydroponics,'' 5th ed.

It quickly became a standard research and teaching technique and is still widely used. Solution culture is, now considered, a type of hydroponics where there is no inert medium.\n\nIn 1929, William Frederick Gericke of the University of California at Berkeley began publicly promoting that solution culture be used for agricultural crop production.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=VigDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29 |last=Dunn |first=H.

Gericke had been denied use of the University's greenhouses for his experiments due to the administration's skepticism, and when the University tried to compel him to release his preliminary nutrient recipes developed at home he requested greenhouse space and time to improve them using appropriate research facilities. While he was eventually provided greenhouse space, the University assigned Hoagland and Arnon to re-develop Gericke's formula and show it held no benefit over soil grown plant yields, a view held by Hoagland. In 1940, Gericke published the book, ''Complete Guide to Soil less Gardening,'' after leaving his academic position in a climate that was politically unfavorable.<ref name=Gericke />\n\nTwo other plant nutritionists, [[Dennis R. Hoagland]] and [[Daniel I. Arnon]], at the University of California were asked to research Gericke's claims. The two wrote a classic 1938 agricultural bulletin, ''The Water Culture Method for Growing Plants Without Soil,''<ref>[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t51g1sb8j;view=1up;seq=1''The Water Culture Method for Growing Plants Without Soil]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}</ref> which made the claim that hydroponic crop yields were no better than crop yields with good-quality soils. Crop yields were ultimately limited by factors other than mineral nutrients, especially light. This research, however, overlooked the fact that hydroponics has other advantages including the fact that the roots of the plant have constant access to oxygen and that the plants have access to as much or as little water as they need.{{cn|date=August 2018}} This is important as one of the most common errors when growing is over- and under- watering; and hydroponics prevents this from occurring as large amounts of water can be made available to the plant and any water not used, drained away, recirculated, or actively aerated, eliminating anoxic conditions, which drown root systems in soil. In soil, a grower needs to be very experienced to know exactly how much water to feed the plant. Too much and the plant will be unable to access oxygen; too little and the plant will lose the ability to transport nutrients, which are typically moved into the roots while in solution. These two researchers developed several formulas for mineral nutrient solutions, known as [[Hoagland solution]]. Modified Hoagland solutions are still in use.\n\nOne of the earliest successes of hydroponics occurred on [[Wake Island]], a rocky atoll in the Pacific Ocean used as a refueling stop for [[Pan American Airlines]]. Hydroponics was used there in the 1930s to grow vegetables for the passengers. Hydroponics was a necessity on Wake Island because there was no soil, and it was prohibitively expensive to airlift in fresh vegetables.<ref>''Nice Clean Gardening'', Frank J.

For all techniques, most hydroponic reservoirs are now built of plastic, but other materials have been used including concrete, glass, metal, vegetable solids, and wood. The containers should exclude light to prevent algae and fungal growth in the nutrient solution.\n\n===Static solution culture===\n[[File:CDC South Aquaponics Raft Tank 1 2010-07-17.jpg|thumb|The deep water raft tank at the CDC South Aquaponics greenhouse in Brooks, Alberta.]]\nIn static solution culture, plants are grown in containers of nutrient solution, such as glass [[Mason jar]]s (typically, in-home applications), plastic buckets, tubs, or tanks. The solution is usually gently aerated but may be un-aerated. If un-aerated, the solution level is kept low enough that enough roots are above the solution so they get adequate oxygen. A hole is cut in the lid of the reservoir for each plant. A single reservoir can be dedicated to a single plant, or to various plants. Reservoir size can be increased as plant size increases. A home made system can be constructed from plastic food containers or glass canning jars with [[aeration]] provided by an aquarium pump, aquarium airline tubing and aquarium valves. Clear containers are covered with aluminium foil, butcher paper, black plastic, or other material to exclude light, thus helping to eliminate the formation of algae. The nutrient solution is changed either on a schedule, such as once per week, or when the concentration drops below a certain level as determined with an [[EC meter|electrical conductivity meter]]. Whenever the solution is depleted below a certain level, either water or fresh nutrient solution is added. A [[Mariotte's bottle]], or a float valve, can be used to automatically maintain the solution level. In raft solution culture, plants are placed in a sheet of buoyant plastic that is floated on the surface of the nutrient solution. That way, the solution level never drops below the roots.\n\n===Continuous-flow solution culture===\n[[File:Leafy Greens Hydroponics.jpg|thumb|The nutrient film technique being used to grow various salad greens]]\nIn continuous-flow solution culture, the nutrient solution constantly flows past the roots. It is much easier to automate than the static solution culture because sampling and adjustments to the temperature and nutrient concentrations can be made in a large storage tank that has potential to serve thousands of plants. A popular variation is the [[nutrient film technique]] or NFT, whereby a very shallow stream of water containing all the dissolved nutrients required for plant growth is recirculated past the bare roots of plants in a watertight thick root mat, which develops in the bottom of the channel and has an upper surface that, although moist, is in the air. Subsequent to this, an abundant supply of oxygen is provided to the roots of the plants. A properly designed NFT system is based on using the right channel slope, the right flow rate, and the right channel length. The main advantage of the NFT system over other forms of hydroponics is that the plant roots are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen, and nutrients. In all other forms of production, there is a conflict between the supply of these requirements, since excessive or deficient amounts of one results in an imbalance of one or both of the others. NFT, because of its design, provides a system where all three requirements for healthy plant growth can be met at the same time, provided that the simple concept of NFT is always remembered and practised. The result of these advantages is that higher yields of high-quality produce are obtained over an extended period of cropping. A downside of NFT is that it has very little buffering against interruptions in the flow (e.g., power outages). But, overall, it is probably one of the more productive techniques.{{citation needed|reason=To make this claim, the statement should use a reference which compares NFT productivity with other methods.|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe same design characteristics apply to all conventional NFT systems. While slopes along channels of 1:100 have been recommended, in practice it is difficult to build a base for channels that is sufficiently true to enable nutrient films to flow without ponding in locally depressed areas. As a consequence, it is recommended that slopes of 1:30 to 1:40 are used.{{citation needed|reason=Practical advice is appreciated, but it should still be supported with a reference.|date=April 2016}} This allows for minor irregularities in the surface, but, even with these slopes, ponding and [[waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] may occur. The slope may be provided by the floor, benches or racks may hold the channels and provide the required slope. Both methods are used and depend on local requirements, often determined by the site and crop requirements.\n\nAs a general guide, flow rates for each gully should be one liter per minute.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hydroponics.com.au/what-are-the-fundamentals-of-setting-up-an-nft-system/|title=What are the fundamentals of setting up an NFT system? {{!}} Hydroponics|date=2014-10-01|work=Hydroponics|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en-US}}</ref> At planting, rates may be half this and the upper limit of 2 L/min appears about the maximum. Flow rates beyond these extremes are often associated with nutritional problems. Depressed growth rates of many crops have been observed when channels exceed 12 meters in length. On rapidly growing crops, tests have indicated that, while oxygen levels remain adequate, nitrogen may be depleted over the length of the gully. As a consequence, channel length should not exceed 10\u201315 meters. In situations where this is not possible, the reductions in growth can be eliminated by placing another nutrient feed halfway along the gully and halving the flow rates through each outlet.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Aeroponics===\n{{Main article|Aeroponics}}\n[[Aeroponics]] is a system wherein roots are continuously or discontinuously kept in an environment saturated with fine drops (a [[mist]] or [[aerosol]]) of nutrient solution. The method requires no substrate and entails growing plants with their roots suspended in a deep air or growth chamber with the roots periodically wetted with a fine mist of [[Atomizer nozzle|atomized nutrients]]. Excellent aeration is the main advantage of aeroponics.\n[[File:Systeme AEROPONIC 573px.jpg|thumb|uprigh=1.5|A diagram of the aeroponic technique]]\nAeroponic techniques have proven to be commercially successful for propagation, seed germination, seed potato production, tomato production, leaf crops, and micro-greens.<ref>[http://www.sivb.org/InVitroReport/42-2/research.htm Research News. \"Commercial Aeroponics: The Grow Anywhere Story,\"] In Vitro Report (Society for In Vitro Biology), Issue 42.2 (April \u2013 June 2008).</ref> Since inventor [[Richard Stoner]] commercialized aeroponic technology in 1983, aeroponics has been implemented as an alternative to water intensive hydroponic systems worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title= Stoner, R., \"Aeroponics Versus Bed and Hydroponic Propagation\", Florist Review, Vol 173 no.4477, September 22, 1983 |url=http://www.biocontrols.com/aero28.html}}</ref> The limitation of hydroponics is the fact that {{convert|1|kg}} of water can only hold {{convert|8|mg}} of air, no matter whether aerators are utilized or not.\n\nAnother distinct advantage of aeroponics over hydroponics is that any species of plants can be grown in a true aeroponic system because the microenvironment of an aeroponic can be finely controlled. The limitation of hydroponics is that certain species of plants can only survive for so long in water before they become [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]]. The advantage of aeroponics is that suspended aeroponic plants receive 100% of the available oxygen and carbon dioxide to the roots zone, stems, and leaves,<ref>Stoner, R.J. (1983). ''Rooting in Air.'' Greenhouse Grower Vol I No. 11</ref> thus accelerating biomass growth and reducing rooting times. NASA research has shown that aeroponically grown plants have an 80% increase in dry weight biomass (essential minerals) compared to hydroponically grown plants. Aeroponics used 65% less water than hydroponics. NASA also concluded that aeroponically grown plants require \u00bc the nutrient input compared to hydroponics.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for NASA research|date=August 2018}} Unlike hydroponically grown plants, aeroponically grown plants will not suffer transplant shock when transplanted to soil, and offers growers the ability to reduce the spread of disease and pathogens.\nAeroponics is also widely used in laboratory studies of plant physiology and plant pathology. Aeroponic techniques have been given special attention from [[NASA]] since a mist is easier to handle than a liquid in a zero-gravity environment.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed. Mist is just multiple smaller liquids.|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Fogponics===\n{{Main article|Fogponics}}\nFogponics is a derivation of aeroponics wherein the nutrient solution is aerosolized by a [[ultrasonic humidifier|diaphragm vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies]]. Solution droplets produced by this method tend to be 5\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m in diameter, smaller than those produced by forcing a nutrient solution through pressurized nozzles, as in aeroponics. The smaller size of the droplets allows them to diffuse through the air more easily, and deliver nutrients to the roots without limiting their access to oxygen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.maximumyield.com/figuring-out-fogponics/2/1361|title=Figuring Out Fogponics|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gardenculturemagazine.com/diy-fogponics/|title=DIY Fogponics - Garden Culture Magazine|date=2016-01-18|work=Garden Culture Magazine|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-US}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Passive sub-irrigation===\n{{Main article|Passive hydroponics}}\nPassive sub-irrigation, also known as passive hydroponics, semi-hydroponics, or ''hydroculture'',<ref>[https://www.hydroculture.co.uk/Blog/What-is-Hydroculture%3F/ What is Hydroculture information page]</ref> is a method wherein plants are grown in an [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[porous]] medium that transports water and fertilizer to the roots by [[capillary action]] from a separate reservoir as necessary, reducing labor and providing a constant supply of water to the roots. In the simplest method, the pot sits in a shallow solution of fertilizer and water or on a capillary mat saturated with nutrient solution. The various hydroponic media available, such as [[ex-clay|expanded clay]] and coconut husk, contain more air space than more traditional potting mixes, delivering increased oxygen to the roots, which is important in [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] plants such as [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]], whose roots are exposed to the air in nature. Additional advantages of passive hydroponics are the reduction of root rot and the additional ambient humidity provided through evaporations.\n\nHydroculture compared to traditional farming in terms of crops yield per area in a controlled environment was roughly 10 times more efficient than traditional farming, uses 13 times less water in one crop cycle then traditional farming, but on average uses 100 times more kilojoules per kilogram of energy than traditional farming.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa|first1=Guilherme|title=Comparison of Land, Water, and Energy Requirements of Lettuce Grown Using Hydroponic vs. Conventional Agricultural Methods|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|date=16 June 2015|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/12/6/6879/htm|accessdate=5 December 2017|doi=10.3390/ijerph120606879}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nWater-cultivate a crocus.jpg|Water plant cultivated crocus\nHydroton.jpg|Expanded clay pellets\n</gallery>\n\n===Ebb and flow or flood and drain sub-irrigation===\n[[File:Systeme FLOOD&DRAIN 573px.jpg|thumb|150px|A Ebb and flow or flood and drain hydroponics system.]]\n{{Main article|Ebb and flow}}\nIn its simplest form, there is a tray above a reservoir of nutrient solution. Either the tray is filled with growing medium (clay granules being the most common) and then plant directly or place the pot over medium, stand in the tray.

This keeps the medium regularly flushed with nutrients and air. Once the upper tray fills past the drain stop, it begins recirculating the water until the timer turns the pump off, and the water in the upper tray drains back into the reservoirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.makehydroponics.com/whatsystem/flood-and-drain.htm |title= Flood and Drain or Ebb and Flow |publisher=www.makehydroponics.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-17}}</ref>\n\n===Run to waste===\nIn a run-to-waste system, nutrient and water solution is periodically applied to the medium surface. The method was invented in [[Bengal]] in 1946; for this reason it is sometimes referred to as \"The Bengal System\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New Dehli|isbn=9780195605662|page=10|edition=5th|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hydroponics.html?id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bengal System.png|thumb|A run-to-waste hydroponics system referred to as \"The Bengal System\" after the region in eastern India where it was invented (circa 1946\u20131948)]]\n\nThis method can be set up in various configurations. In its simplest form, a nutrient-and-water solution is manually applied one or more times per day to a container of inert growing media, such as rockwool, perlite, vermiculite, coco fibre, or sand. In a slightly more complex system, it is automated with a delivery pump, a timer and irrigation tubing to deliver nutrient solution with a delivery frequency that is governed by the key parameters of plant size, plant growing stage, climate, substrate, and substrate conductivity, pH, and water content.\n\nIn a commercial setting, watering frequency is multi-factorial and governed by computers or [[Programmable logic controller|PLCs]].\n\nCommercial hydroponics production of large plants like tomatoes, cucumber, and peppers uses one form or another of run-to-waste hydroponics.\n\nIn environmentally responsible uses, the nutrient-rich waste is collected and processed through an on-site filtration system to be used many times, making the system very productive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newagehydro.com/shop/faq.php |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Newagehydro.com |date= |access-date=2011-09-20}}</ref>\n\nSome [[bonsai]] are also grown in soil-free substrates (typically consisting of [[akadama]], grit, [[diatomaceous earth]] and other inorganic components) and have their water and nutrients provided in a run-to-waste form.\n\n===Deep water culture===\n[[File:Hungarian wax peppers roots being revealed IMG 5673.JPG|thumb|upright|The Deep water culture technique being used to grow Hungarian wax peppers.]]\n{{Main article|Deep water culture}}\nThe hydroponic method of plant production by means of suspending the plant roots in a solution of nutrient-rich, oxygenated water. Traditional methods favor the use of plastic buckets and large containers with the plant contained in a net pot suspended from the centre of the lid and the roots suspended in the nutrient solution.\nThe solution is oxygen saturated by an air pump combined with [[airstone|porous stones]]. With this method, the plants grow much faster because of the high amount of oxygen that the roots receive.<ref name=\"Growell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.growell.co.uk/pr/60/Deep-Water-Culture-It-s-all-about-the-bubbles-.html |title=Deep Water Culture |publisher=[[Growell]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413041448/http://www.growell.co.uk/pr/60/Deep-Water-Culture-It-s-all-about-the-bubbles-.html |archivedate=2010-04-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Top-fed deep water culture===\n''Top-fed'' deep water culture is a technique involving delivering highly oxygenated nutrient solution direct to the root zone of plants. While deep water culture involves the plant roots hanging down into a reservoir of nutrient solution, in top-fed deep water culture the solution is pumped from the reservoir up to the roots (top feeding). The water is released over the plant's roots and then runs back into the reservoir below in a constantly recirculating system. As with deep water culture, there is an [[airstone]] in the reservoir that pumps air into the water via a hose from outside the reservoir. The airstone helps add oxygen to the water. Both the airstone and the water pump run 24 hours a day.\n\nThe biggest advantage of top-fed deep water culture over standard deep water culture is increased growth during the first few weeks.{{citation needed|reason=An important claim likes this needs a good reference.|date=April 2016}} With deep water culture, there is a time when the roots have not reached the water yet. With top-fed deep water culture, the roots get easy access to water from the beginning and will grow to the reservoir below much more quickly than with a deep water culture system. Once the roots have reached the reservoir below, there is not a huge advantage with top-fed deep water culture over standard deep water culture. However, due to the quicker growth in the beginning, grow time can be reduced by a few weeks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Rotary===\n[[File:Expo 2015 - Coltura idroponica al padiglione del Belgio.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rotary hydroponic cultivation demonstration at the Belgian Pavilion Expo in 2015.]]\n{{Primary sources|section|date=July 2018}}\nA rotary hydroponic garden is a style of commercial hydroponics created within a circular frame which rotates continuously during the entire growth cycle of whatever plant is being grown.\n\nWhile system specifics vary, systems typically rotate once per hour, giving a plant 24 full turns within the circle each 24-hour period. Within the center of each rotary hydroponic garden can be a high intensity grow light, designed to simulate sunlight, often with the assistance of a mechanized timer.\n\nEach day, as the plants rotate, they are periodically watered with a hydroponic growth solution to provide all nutrients necessary for robust growth. Due to the plants continuous fight against gravity, plants typically mature much more quickly than when grown in soil or other traditional hydroponic growing systems.{{citation needed|reason=An important claim likes this needs a good reference.|date=April 2016}} Due to the small foot print a rotary hydroponic system has, it allows for more plant material to be grown per square foot of floor space than other traditional hydroponic systems.<ref>[https://www.mvonederland.nl/sites/default/files/media/MVO_factsheet_Skygreens.pdf A-Go-Gro system; a rotary hydroponics system]</ref>\n\n==Substrates==\nOne of the most obvious decisions hydroponic farmers have to make is which medium they should use. Different media are appropriate for different growing techniques.\n\n===Expanded clay aggregate===\n{{Main article|Expanded clay aggregate}}\n\n[[File:Hydroton.jpg|upright=0.6|thumb|Expanded clay pebbles.]]\nBaked clay pellets are suitable for hydroponic systems in which all nutrients are carefully controlled in water solution. The clay pellets are inert, [[pH]] neutral and do not contain any nutrient value.\n\nThe clay is formed into round pellets and fired in rotary [[kiln]]s at {{convert|1200|\u00b0C}}. This causes the clay to expand, like popcorn, and become porous. It is light in weight, and does not compact over time. The shape of an individual pellet can be irregular or uniform depending on brand and manufacturing process. The manufacturers consider expanded clay to be an ecologically sustainable and re-usable growing medium because of its ability to be cleaned and sterilized, typically by washing in solutions of white vinegar, [[chlorine]] [[bleach]], or [[hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}), and rinsing completely.\n\nAnother view is that clay pebbles are best not re-used even when they are cleaned, due to root growth that may enter the medium. Breaking open a clay pebble after a crop has been shown to reveal this growth.\n\n===Growstones===\n[[Growstones]], made from glass waste, have both more air and water retention space than perlite and peat. This aggregate holds more water than parboiled rice hulls.<ref name=\"growstones rice\">(2011). \"Growstones ideal alternative to perlite, parboiled rice hulls\".

The remainder is soda-lime glass.<ref name=\"growstones msds\"/>\n\n===Coir peat===\n[[Coco peat]], also known as [[coir]] or coco, is the leftover material after the fibres have been removed from the outermost shell (bolster) of the [[coconut]]. Coir is a 100% natural grow and flowering medium. Coconut coir is colonized with [[trichoderma]] fungi, which protects roots and stimulates root growth. It is extremely difficult to over-water coir due to its perfect air-to-water ratio; plant roots thrive in this environment. Coir has a high [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]] exchange, meaning it can store unused minerals to be released to the plant as and when it requires it. Coir is available in many forms; most common is coco peat, which has the appearance and texture of soil but contains no mineral content.\n\n===Rice husks===\n[[File:Rice husk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Rice husks, a hydroponic growing substrate option.]]\n[[Rice husks#Fertilizer and substrate|Parboiled rice husks]] (PBH) are an agricultural byproduct that would otherwise have little use.

It is used loose or in plastic sleeves immersed in the water. It is also used in potting soil mixes to decrease soil density. Perlite has similar properties and uses to [[vermiculite]] but, in general, holds more air and less water and is buoyant.\n\n===Vermiculite===\n[[File:Vermiculite1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|Vermiculite close-up.]]\nLike perlite, [[vermiculite]] is a mineral that has been superheated until it has expanded into light pebbles. Vermiculite holds more water than perlite and has a natural \"wicking\" property that can draw water and nutrients in a passive hydroponic system. If too much water and not enough air surrounds the plants roots, it is possible to gradually lower the medium's water-retention capability by mixing in increasing quantities of perlite.\n\n===Pumice===\n[[File:Pumice.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|A pumice stone.]]\nLike perlite, [[pumice]] is a lightweight, mined volcanic rock that finds application in hydroponics.\n\n===Sand===\nSand is cheap and easily available. However, it is heavy, does not hold water very well, and it must be sterilized between uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Gravel===\nThe same type that is used in aquariums, though any small gravel can be used, provided it is washed first. Indeed, plants growing in a typical traditional gravel filter bed, with water circulated using electric powerhead pumps, are in effect being grown using gravel hydroponics. Gravel is inexpensive, easy to keep clean, drains well and will not become waterlogged. However, it is also heavy, and, if the system does not provide continuous water, the plant roots may dry out.\n\n===Wood fibre===\n[[File:Palha de madeira2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Excelsior, or wood wool]]\n[[Wood fibre]], produced from steam friction of wood, is a very efficient organic substrate for hydroponics. It has the advantage that it keeps its structure for a very long time. [[Wood wool]] (i.e. wood slivers) have been used since the earliest days of the hydroponics research.<ref name=Gericke /> However, more recent research suggests that wood fibre may have detrimental effects on \"plant growth regulators\".<ref name=\"woodfibre pgr\">{{cite web | url=http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/research/2010/101025LopezHulls.html | title=Rice hulls a sustainable drainage option for greenhouse growers | publisher=Purdue University | date=October 25, 2010 | accessdate=August 30, 2012 | author=Wallheimer, Brian}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|reason=This citation is vague in its description of its findings and is in contradiction of more established science suggesting that wood fiber is an adequate media choice.

Rock wool is an inert substrate suitable for both run-to-waste and recirculating systems. Rock wool is made from molten rock, basalt or 'slag' that is spun into bundles of single filament fibres, and bonded into a medium capable of capillary action, and is, in effect, protected from most common microbiological degradation. Rock wool is typically used only for the seedling stage, or with newly cut clones, but can remain with the plant base for its lifetime. Rock wool has many advantages and some disadvantages. The latter being the possible skin irritancy (mechanical) whilst handling (1:1000).{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Flushing with cold water usually brings relief. Advantages include its proven efficiency and effectiveness as a commercial hydroponic substrate. Most of the rock wool sold to date is a non-hazardous, non-carcinogenic material, falling under Note Q of the European Union Classification Packaging and Labeling Regulation (CLP).{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source|date=October 2012}}\n\nMineral wool products can be engineered to hold large quantities of water and air that aid root growth and nutrient uptake in [[hydroponics]]; their fibrous nature also provides a good mechanical structure to hold the plant stable. The naturally high [[pH]] of mineral wool makes them initially unsuitable to plant growth and requires \"conditioning\" to produce a wool with an appropriate, stable pH.<ref name=\"Alexander 1994\">{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cHT3bMm3njsC&dq=rockwool&hl=id&source=gbs_navlinks_s |title = The Best of Growing Edge |author = Tom Alexander |author2=Don Parker |date = 1994 |publisher = New Moon Publishing, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-944557-01-3}}</ref>\n\n===Brick shards===\nBrick shards have similar properties to gravel.

However, they can be too lightweight for some uses. They are used mainly in closed-tube systems. Note that non-biodegradable [[polystyrene]] peanuts must be used; biodegradable packing peanuts will decompose into a sludge. Plants may absorb [[styrene]] and pass it to their consumers; this is a possible health risk.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Nutrient solutions==\n===Inorganic hydroponic solutions===\nThe [[formulation]] of hydroponic solutions is an application of [[plant nutrition]], with nutrient deficiency symptoms mirroring those found in traditional [[Agricultural soil science|soil based agriculture]]. However, the underlying chemistry of hydroponic solutions can differ from [[Soil#Nutrients|soil chemistry]] in many significant ways. Important differences include:\n* Unlike soil, hydroponic nutrient solutions do not have [[cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) from clay particles or organic matter. The absence of CEC means the [[pH]] and nutrient concentrations can change much more rapidly in hydroponic setups than is possible in soil.\n* Selective absorption of nutrients by plants often imbalances the amount of [[counterion]]s in solution.<ref name=Gericke /><ref name=Adv /><ref name=Jones /> This imbalance can rapidly affect solution pH and the ability of plants to absorb nutrients of similar ionic charge (see article [[membrane potential]]).

Common tools used to manage hydroponic solutions include:\n* [[Electrical conductivity meter]]s, a tool which estimates nutrient ppm by measuring how well a solution transmits an [[electric current]].\n* [[pH meter]], a tool that uses an electric current to determine the concentration of [[hydrogen ion]]s in solution.\n* [[Litmus paper]], disposable [[pH indicator]] strips that determine hydrogen ion concentrations by color changing [[chemical reaction]].\n* [[Graduated cylinder]]s or [[measuring spoon]]s to measure out premixed, commercial hydroponic solutions.\n\n====Equipment====\nChemical equipment can also be used to perform accurate [[chemical analysis|chemical analyses]] of nutrient solutions.

The free and open source tools HydroBuddy<ref>[http://scienceinhydroponics.com HydroBuddy] : A crowd-sourced community platform which gives alerts about chemistry and new grow protocols [http://www.flxiot.com Eddy]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} An Open Source Multi-Platform Hydroponic Nutrient Calculator</ref> and HydroCal<ref>[http://hydrocal.sourceforge.net/ HydroCal] : A JavaScript Hydroponic Nutrient Calculator</ref> have been created by professional chemists to help any hydroponics grower prepare their own nutrient solutions. The first program is available for Windows, Mac and Linux while the second one can be used through a simple JavaScript interface. Both programs allow for basic nutrient solution preparation although HydroBuddy provides added functionality to use and save custom substances, save formulations and predict electrical conductivity values.\n\n===Mixing solutions===\nOften mixing hydroponic solutions using individual salts is impractical for hobbyists and/or small-scale commercial growers because commercial products are available at reasonable prices. However, even when buying commercial products, multi-component fertilizers are popular. Often these products are bought as three part formulas which emphasize certain nutritional roles. For example, solutions for vegetative growth (i.e. high in nitrogen), flowering (i.e. high in potassium and phosphorus), and micronutrient solutions (i.e. with trace minerals) are popular. The timing and application of these multi-part fertilizers should coincide with a plant's growth stage. For example, at the end of an [[annual plant]]'s [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], a plant should be restricted from high nitrogen fertilizers. In most plants, nitrogen restriction inhibits vegetative growth and helps [[Flower#Flowering transition|induce flowering]].<ref name=Jones />\n\n==Advancements==\n{{Off topic|date=April 2016|Growroom}}\nWith pest problems reduced and nutrients constantly fed to the roots, productivity in hydroponics is high; however, growers can further increase yield by manipulating a plant's environment by constructing sophisticated [[growroom]]s.\n\n===CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment===\n{{Main article|Carbon dioxide#Agricultural and biological applications}}\nTo increase yield further, some sealed greenhouses inject [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] into their environment to help improve growth and plant fertility.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aeroponics]]\n* [[Anthroponics]]\n* [[Aquaponics]]\n* [[Fogponics]]\n* [[Folkewall]]\n* [[Grow box]]\n* [[Growroom]]\n* [[Organoponics]]\n* [[Passive hydroponics]]\n* [[Plant factory]]\n* [[Plant nutrition]]\n* [[Plant pathology]]\n* [[Root rot]]\n* [[Vertical farming]]\n* [[Xeriscaping]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{wikibooks|Hydroculture}}\n{{Commons category|Hydroponics}}\n{{Hydroculture |state=expanded}}\n{{Agriculture footer}}\n\n[[Category:Hydroponics| ]]\n[[Category:Hydroculture]]\n[[Category:Aeroponics]]\n\n[[de:Hydrokultur]]", "sha1": "aqd7w37hqo9pvyxbapejprvyeokgxn0"}}, {"title": "Humanist (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "14134", "revision": {"id": "774589465", "parentid": "765984804", "timestamp": "2017-04-09T13:35:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dispenser", "id": "2551723"}, "comment": "Cleanup per [[WP:MOSDAB]] using [[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dabfix.py|Dabfix]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|humanist|humanistic}}\n'''Humanist''' may refer to:\n\n* A proponent or practitioner of [[humanism]], which has several distinct senses, which are listed at [[Humanism (disambiguation)]]\n* A [[Renaissance Humanist]] or scholar in the Renaissance\n* [[Humanist (typeface classification)]], a class of sans-serif typeface styles\n* [[Humanist (electronic seminar)]], an email discussion list on humanities computing, described as \u201can international online seminar on humanities computing and the digital humanities\u201d\n* [[The Humanist (journal)|''The Humanist'' (journal)]], a magazine published by the [[American Humanist Association]]\n* [[Humanist (journal)|''Humanist'' (journal)]], a magazine published by the [[Norwegian Humanist Association]]\n* A scholar or academic in the [[Humanities]]\n*[[Humanism (philosophy of education)]]\n* [[Humanistic (album)|''Humanistic'' (album)]], the 2001 debut album by Abandoned Pools\n\n==See also==\n*[[Centre d\u00e9mocrate humaniste]], also known as The Humanist Democratic Centre\t\n*[[Humanist International]]\n*[[Humanistic Judaism]]\n*[[Humanist Manifesto]]\n*[[Humanist Party (Chile)]]\n*[[Humanist Party of India]]\n*[[Humanistic psychology]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "ofcxtml93vzulw0zx8n2rnvulm91f1u"}}, {"title": "Henry Purcell", "ns": "0", "id": "14135", "revision": {"id": "866474249", "parentid": "866474185", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T15:19:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/80.80.162.43|80.80.162.43]] ([[User talk:80.80.162.43|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the 17th-century composer|the New York judge|Henry Purcell (judge)|the 19th-century composer|Robert Lucas de Pearsall|other uses of Purcell|Purcell (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Henry Purcell by John Closterman.jpg|thumb|Purcell by [[John Closterman]], probably 1695]]\n\n'''Henry Purcell''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u025cr|s|\u0259l}} or {{IPAc-en|p|\u025cr|'|s|\u025b|l}};<ref>Wells, J.C., ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary''.

He attended [[Westminster School]] and in 1676 was appointed copyist at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref name=EB1911/> Henry Purcell's earliest [[anthem]] ''Lord, who can tell'' was composed in 1678. It is a [[Psalms|psalm]] that is prescribed for Christmas Day and also to be read at morning prayer on the fourth day of the month.<ref>Zimmerman, Franklin. ''Henry Purcell 1659\u20131695 His Life and Times''. (New York City: St. Martin's Press Inc., 1967), 65.</ref>\n\nIn 1679, he wrote songs for [[John Playford]]'s ''Choice Ayres, Songs and Dialogues'' and an anthem, the name of which is unknown, for the Chapel Royal. From an extant letter written by Thomas Purcell we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the Rev. [[John Gostling]], then at [[Canterbury]], but afterwards a gentleman of His Majesty's Chapel. Purcell wrote several anthems at different times for Gostling's extraordinary [[basso profondo]] voice, which is known to have had a [[Vocal range|range]] of at least two full [[octave]]s, from D below the [[Clef|bass staff]] to the D above it. The dates of very few of these sacred compositions are known; perhaps the most notable example is the anthem ''They that go down to the sea in ships.'' In gratitude for the providential escape of King Charles II from shipwreck, Gostling, who had been of the royal party, put together some verses from the [[Psalms]] in the form of an anthem and requested Purcell to set them to music. The challenging work opens with a passage which traverses the full extent of Gostling's range, beginning on the upper D and descending two octaves to the lower.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1679, Blow, who had been appointed organist of [[Westminster Abbey]] 10 years before, resigned his office in favour of Purcell.<ref name=Runciman>Runciman, John F.

London: [[George Bell & Sons]]. {{OCLC|5690003}}.</ref> Purcell now devoted himself almost entirely to the composition of sacred music, and for six years severed his connection with the theatre. However, during the early part of the year, probably before taking up his new office, he had produced two important works for the stage, the music for [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s ''Theodosius'', and [[Thomas d'Urfey]]'s ''Virtuous Wife''.<ref name=Runciman /> Between 1680 and 1688 Purcell wrote music for seven plays.<ref name=\"Harris, Ellen T 1987\">Harris, Ellen T.

Each work runs to less than one hour. At the time, ''Dido and Aeneas'' never found its way to the theatre, though it appears to have been very popular in private circles. It is believed to have been extensively copied, but only one song was printed by Purcell's widow in ''[[Orpheus Britannicus]]'', and the complete work remained in manuscript until 1840, when it was printed by the [[Musical Antiquarian Society]] under the editorship of Sir [[George Alexander Macfarren|George Macfarren]].<ref name=EB1911/> The composition of ''Dido and Aeneas'' gave Purcell his first chance to write a sustained musical setting of a dramatic text.

As the pipette injects more liquid, the droplet will increase in volume, the contact angle will increase, but its three-phase boundary will remain stationary until it suddenly advances outward. The contact angle the droplet had immediately before advancing outward is termed the advancing contact angle. The receding contact angle is now measured by pumping the liquid back out of the droplet. The droplet will decrease in volume, the contact angle will decrease, but its three-phase boundary will remain stationary until it suddenly recedes inward. The contact angle the droplet had immediately before receding inward is termed the receding contact angle. The difference between advancing and receding contact angles is termed contact angle hysteresis and can be used to characterize surface heterogeneity, roughness, and mobility.{{how|date=January 2015}} Surfaces that are not homogeneous will have domains that impede motion of the contact line. The slide angle is another dynamic measure of hydrophobicity and is measured by depositing a droplet on a surface and tilting the surface until the droplet begins to slide.

Once again hydrophobicity is induced by interlaminar air pockets (separated by 2.1 [[nanometer|nm]] distances). The UV effect is also explained. UV light creates [[electron-hole pair]]s, with the holes reacting with lattice oxygen, creating surface oxygen vacancies, while the electrons reduce V<sup>5+</sup> to V<sup>3+</sup>. The oxygen vacancies are met by water, and it is this water absorbency by the vanadium surface that makes it hydrophilic.

They quickly wrote off their first motor-bicycle as a valuable learning experiment.<ref>Herbert Wagner, 2003.

This first \"real\" Harley-Davidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of 24.74 cubic inches (405&nbsp;cc) with {{convert|9.75|in|cm|0}} flywheels weighing {{convert|28|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. The machine's advanced loop-frame pattern was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle (designed by Joseph Merkel, later of [[Flying Merkel]] fame). The bigger engine and loop-frame design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs. The boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer [[Ole Evinrude]], who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on Milwaukee's Lake Street.\n\n[[File:Harley-Davidson Monocylinder.jpg|thumb|Prototype]]\nThe prototype of the new loop-frame Harley-Davidson was assembled in a {{convert|10|x|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} shed in the Davidson family backyard.<ref name=\"Wagner, 2003. pp.45\u201362\">Wagner, 2003. pp.45\u201362.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/2711470|title=King celebrating 95 impressive years|publisher=[[Kokomo Tribune]] {{subscription required|via=Newspapers.com}}|date=June 3, 1998|page=19|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> Most of the major parts, however, were made elsewhere, including some probably fabricated at the West Milwaukee railshops where oldest brother William A.

By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue),<ref name=H-Dtimeline1900s>{{cite web |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1900s.jsp |title=Harley-Davidson History Timeline |publisher=Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Company |accessdate=September 29, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714065520/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1900s.jsp |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters.

That year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow (\"cream\") brick. With the new facilities production increased to 150 motorcycles in 1907. The company was officially incorporated that September. They also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time, a market that has been important to them ever since.<ref>Wagner, 2003. pp.68\u201381, 118.</ref>\n\nIn 1907 [[William A. Davidson]], brother to Arthur and Walter Davidson, quit his job as tool foreman for the Milwaukee Road railroad and joined the Motor Company.\n\nProduction in 1905 and 1906 were all single-cylinder models with 26.84 cubic inch (440&nbsp;cm\u00b3) engines. In February 1907 a prototype model with a 45-degree [[V-Twin]] engine was displayed at the [[Chicago]] Automobile Show. Although shown and advertised, very few V-Twin models were built between 1907 and 1910. These first V-Twins displaced 53.68 cubic inches (880&nbsp;cm\u00b3) and produced about {{convert|7|hp|kW}}. This gave about double the power of the first singles. Top speed was about {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}}.

The new engine had mechanically operated intake valves, as opposed to the \"automatic\" intake valves used on earlier V-Twins that opened by engine vacuum. With a displacement of 49.48 cubic inches (811&nbsp;cm\u00b3), the 1911 V-Twin was smaller than earlier twins, but gave better performance. After 1913 the majority of bikes produced by Harley-Davidson would be V-Twin models.\n\nIn 1912, Harley-Davidson introduced their patented \"Ful-Floteing Seat\", which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Gingerelli|first= Dain|title= Harley-Davidson Museum Masterpieces|page= 21|chapter= 1912 Model X\u20138\u2013A|publisher= Motorbooks|location= Minneapolis, MN US|year= 2010|url= {{Google books|1c-d1dqD8DYC|Harley-Davidson Museum Masterpieces|plainurl=yes}}|chapterurl= {{Google books|1c-d1dqD8DYC|Harley-Davidson Museum Masterpieces|page=20|plainurl=yes}}|isbn= 978-0-7603-3894-0|lccn= 2010014130|ref= harv}}</ref> The spring tension could be adjusted to suit the rider's weight.

Begun in 1910, the factory with its many additions would take up two blocks along Juneau Avenue and around the corner on 38th Street. Despite the competition, Harley-Davidson was already pulling ahead of [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] and would dominate motorcycle racing after 1914.

At the same time, its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models. Harley-Davidson, like the auto manufacturers, records a sale not when a consumer buys their product, but rather when it is delivered to a dealer. Therefore, it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called [[channel stuffing]]. When demand softened following the unique 2003 model year, this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price. In April 2004 alone, the price of HOG shares dropped from more than $60 to less than $40.

The announcement came in the wake of a massive company-wide restructuring, which began in early 2009 and involved the closing of two factories, one distribution center, and the planned elimination of nearly 25 percent of its total workforce (around 3,500 employees). The company announced on September 14, 2010 that it would remain in Wisconsin.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/harley-davidsons-to-remain-wisconsin-made/?src=mv&ref=automobiles | work=The New York Times | first=Jerry | last=Garrett | title=Harley-Davidsons to Remain Wisconsin-Made | date=September 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Motorcycle engines==\n[[File:Harley Davidson.jpg|thumb|upright|1,450&nbsp;cc V-twin]]\n{{Main article|Harley-Davidson engine timeline}}\n\nThe classic Harley-Davidson engines are [[V-twin engine]]s, with a 45\u00b0 angle between the cylinders. The [[crankshaft]] has a single pin, and both [[piston]]s are connected to this pin through their [[connecting rod]]s.<ref name = \"wfwvmg\"/>\n\nThis 45\u00b0 angle is covered under several [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States patents]] and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large, high-torque engine in a relatively small space. It causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy \"potato-potato\" sound so strongly linked to the Harley-Davidson brand.\n\nTo simplify the engine and reduce costs, the V-twin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor. This is known as a dual fire ignition system, causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke, with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder's exhaust stroke, effectively \"[[wasted spark|wasting a spark]]\". The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping.\nThe 45\u00b0 design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such: The first cylinder fires, the second (rear) cylinder fires 315\u00b0 later, then there is a 405\u00b0 gap until the first cylinder fires again, giving the engine its unique sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/harley3.htm|title=Howstuffworks \"The Harley Sound and Mystique\"|work=auto.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nHarley-Davidson has used various ignition systems throughout its history \u2013 be it the early points and condenser system, (Big Twin up to 1978 and Sportsters up to 1978), magneto ignition system used on some 1958 to 1969 Sportsters, early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights, (all models 1978 and a half to 1979), or the late electronic with transistorized ignition control module, more familiarly known as the black box or the brain, (all models 1980 to present).\n\nStarting in 1995, the company introduced Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) as an option for the 30th anniversary edition [[Electra Glide]].<ref name=H-Dtimeline1990s>{{cite web|url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1990s.jsp?locale=en_US|title=Harley-Davidson \u2013 Timeline 1990's|work=www.harley-davidson.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008|archivedate=October 3, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003125510/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1990s.jsp?locale=en_US|deadurl=yes}}</ref> EFI became standard on all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, including Sportsters, upon the introduction of the 2007 product line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nightrider.com/biketech/motorcycle_efi_basics.htm|title=Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Fuel Injection Explained|work=www.nightrider.com|accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Harley-Davidson began to participate in the Sound Quality Working Group, founded by Orfield Labs, Bruel and Kjaer, [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]], [[Yamaha]], [[Sennheiser]], SMS and Cortex. This was the nation's first group to share research on psychological acoustics. Later that year, Harley-Davidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at Orfield Labs, based on recordings taken at the [[Talladega Superspeedway]], with the objective to lower the sound level for EU standards while analytically capturing the \"Harley Sound\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} This research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with EU standards for 1998.\n\nOn February 1, 1994, the company filed a [[sound trademark]] application for the distinctive sound of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine: \"The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use\". Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed comments opposing the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use a single-crankpin V-twin engine which produce a similar sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/st_org/iptf/articles/content/1998101101.html|title=The Trademark Registrability of the Harley-Davidson Roar: A Multimedia Analysis|work=www.bc.edu|accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref>  These objections were followed by litigation.

These model families are distinguished by the frame, engine, suspension, and other characteristics.\n\n===Touring===\n{{See also|Harley-Davidson FL}}\n[[File:PolizeiHarley.JPG|thumb|Hamburg Police [[Harley-Davidson FL#Electra Glide|Electra Glide]]]]\nTouring models use Big-Twin engines and large-diameter telescopic forks. All Touring designations begin with the letters FL, ''e.g.'', FLHR (Road King) and FLTR (Road Glide).\n\nThe touring family, also known as \"dressers\" or \"baggers\", includes Road King, Road Glide, Street Glide and Electra Glide models offered in various trims. The Road Kings have a \"retro cruiser\" appearance and are equipped with a large clear windshield. Road Kings are reminiscent of big-twin models from the 1940s and 1950s. Electra Glides can be identified by their full front fairings. Most Electra Glides sport a fork-mounted fairing referred to as the \"Batwing\" due to its unmistakable shape. The Road Glide and Road Glide Ultra Classic have a frame-mounted fairing, referred to as the \"Sharknose\". The Sharknose includes a unique, dual front headlight.\n\nTouring models are distinguishable by their large saddlebags, rear coil-over air suspension and are the only models to offer full fairings with radios and [[Citizens Band radio|CBs]]. All touring models use the same frame, first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in 1980, and carried forward with only modest upgrades until 2009, when it was extensively redesigned. The frame is distinguished by the location of the steering head in front of the forks and was the first H-D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V-twin.\n[[File:harley.electraglide.750pix.jpg|thumb|Electra Glide \"Ultra Classic\"]]\nThe frame was modified for the 1994 model year when the oil tank went under the transmission and the battery was moved inboard from under the right saddlebag to under the seat. In 1997, the frame was again modified to allow for a larger battery under the seat and to lower seat height. In 2007, Harley-Davidson introduced the {{convert|96|cuin|cc|abbr=off}}<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/2013/harley_davidson/dyna/specifications/05/engine.html|title= Buyer's Guide: Harley-Davidson Dyna 2013|work= Motorcyclist Online]|publisher=[[Source Interlink]]|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> Twin Cam 96 engine, as well the six-speed transmission to give the rider better speeds on the highway.\n\nIn 2006, Harley introduced the FLHX Street Glide, a bike designed by Willie G.

With the rear-wheel suspension hidden under the transmission, they are visually similar to the \"hardtail\" [[Chopper (motorcycle)|choppers]] popular in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as from their own earlier history. In keeping with that tradition, Harley offers Softail models with \"Heritage\" styling that incorporate design cues from throughout their history and used to offer \"Springer\" front ends on these Softail models from the factory.\n\n;Designation\nSoftail models utilize the big-twin engine (F) and the Softail chassis (ST).\n* Softail models that use 21 inch (530&nbsp;mm) Front Wheels have designations that begin with FX, ''e.g.'', FXSTB (Night Train), FXSTD (Deuce), and FXSTS (Springer).\n*Softail models that use 16 inch (410&nbsp;mm) Front Wheels have designations beginning with FL, ''e.g.'', FLSTF (Fat Boy), FLSTC (Heritage Softail Classic), FLSTN (Softail Deluxe) and FLS (Softail Slim).\n* Softail models that use Springer forks with a {{convert|21|in|mm|sing=on}} wheel have designations that begin with FXSTS, ''e.g.'', FXSTS (Springer Softail) and FXSTSB (Bad Boy).\n*Softail models that use Springer forks with a {{convert|16|in|mm|sing=on}} wheel have designations that begin with FLSTS, ''e.g.'', FLSTSC (Springer Classic) and FLSTSB (Cross Bones).\n\n===Dyna===\n{{Main article|Harley-Davidson Super Glide}}\n[[File:Harley-Davidson 18.jpg|thumb|2005 Dyna [[Harley-Davidson Super Glide|Super Glide]] Custom.]]\nDyna-frame motorcycles were developed in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's oil reservoir.\n\nPrior to 2006, Dyna models typically featured a narrow, XL-style 39mm front fork and front wheel, as well as footpegs which the manufacturer included the letter \"X\" in the model designation to indicate. This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide (FXD), Super Glide Custom (FXDC), Street Bob (FXDB), and Low Rider (FXDL). One exception was the Wide Glide (FXDWG), which featured thicker 41mm forks and a narrow front wheel, but positioned the forks on wider triple-trees that give a beefier appearance. In 2008, the Dyna Fat Bob (FXDF) was introduced to the Dyna lineup, featuring aggressive styling like a new 2\u20131\u20132 exhaust, twin headlamps, a 180&nbsp;mm rear tire, and, for the first time in the Dyna lineup, a 130&nbsp;mm front tire. For the 2012 model year, the Dyna Switchback (FLD) became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards, detachable painted hard saddlebags, touring windshield, headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender.  The new front end resembled the big-twin FL models from 1968-1971.\n\nThe Dyna family used the 88-cubic-inch (1,440&nbsp;cm\u00b3) twin cam from 1999 to 2006. In 2007, the displacement was increased to 96 cubic inches (1,570&nbsp;cm\u00b3) as the factory increased the stroke to {{convert|4.375|in|mm|1}}. For the 2012 model year, the manufacturer began to offer Dyna models with the 103-cubic-inch (1,690&nbsp;cm\u00b3) upgrade.  All Dyna models use a rubber-mounted engine to isolate engine vibration. Harley discontinued the Dyna platform in 2017 for the 2018 model year, having been replaced by a completely-redesigned [[Softail]] chassis; some of the existing models previously released by the company under the Dyna nameplate have since been carried over to the new Softail line.<ref name=firstlooks>{{cite web |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2018-harley-davidson-softail-lineup//|title=2018 Harley-Davidson Softail Cruiser Lineup | publisher=[[Cycle World]]|accessdate=August 24, 2017|date=2017 }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n;Designation\nDyna models utilize the big-twin engine (F), footpegs noted as (X) with the exception of the 2012 FLD Switchback, a Dyna model which used floorboards as featured on the Touring (L) models, and the Dyna chassis (D). Therefore, except for the FLD from 2012 to 2016, all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD, ''e.g.'', FXDWG (Dyna Wide Glide) and FXDL (Dyna Low Rider).\n\n===Sportster===\n{{Main article|Harley-Davidson Sportster}}\n[[File:200501DIRTYDEBBIE 003a.jpg|thumb|2002 [[Harley-Davidson Sportster|Sportster]] 883 Custom]]\n[[File:2003 HD XL1200C Anniversary Edition.jpg|thumb|2003 Harley-Davidson XL1200 Custom Anniversary Edition\n]]\nIntroduced in 1957, the Sportster family were conceived as racing motorcycles, and were popular on dirt and flat-track race courses through the 1960s and 1970s. Smaller and lighter than the other Harley models, contemporary Sportsters make use of 883&nbsp;cc or 1,200&nbsp;cc Evolution engines and, though often modified, remain similar in appearance to their racing ancestors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/harley-davidson-sportster-1000.aspx|title=1972\u20131985 Harley-Davidson Sportster 1000|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=May 21, 2010|date=March\u2013April 2010|author=Richard Backus }}</ref>\n\nUp until the 2003 model year, the engine on the Sportster was rigidly mounted to the frame. The 2004 Sportster received a new frame accommodating a rubber-mounted engine. This made the bike heavier and reduced the available lean angle, while it reduced the amount of vibration transmitted to the frame and the rider, providing a smoother ride for rider and passenger.<ref>[http://www.motorcyclecruiser.com/roadtests/2004_harley_davidson_sportster/ ''Motorcycle Cruiser'' First Ride: 2004 Harley-Davidson Sportster Motorcycles].

Each motorcycle was individually numbered and came in one of two colors, Mirage Pearl Orange or Vivid Black. Also in 2007, electronic fuel injection was introduced to the Sportster family, and the Nightster model was introduced in mid-year. In 2009, Harley-Davidson added the Iron 883 to the Sportster line, as part of the Dark Custom series.\nIn the 2008 model year, Harley-Davidson released the XR1200 Sportster in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The XR1200 had an Evolution engine tuned to produce {{convert|91|bhp|abbr=on}}, four-piston dual front disc brakes, and an aluminum swing arm.  ''[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]]'' featured the XR1200 on the cover of its July 2008 issue and was generally positive about it in their \"First Ride\" story, in which Harley-Davidson was repeatedly asked to sell it in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Cathcart|first= Alan|date=July 2008|title= First Ride: 2008 Harley-Davidson XR1200 \u2013 Get Sporty!|journal=Motorcyclist|series= |pages= 49\u201353|publisher=Source Interlink Magazines|pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |oclc= |url= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}</ref>\nOne possible reason for the delayed availability in the United States was the fact that Harley-Davidson had to obtain the \"XR1200\" naming rights from Storz Performance, a Harley customizing shop in Ventura, Calif.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2009-harley-davidson-xr1200.aspx|title=2009 Harley-Davidson XR1200|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=August 20, 2009|date=September\u2013October 2009|author=Richard Backus}}</ref> The XR1200 was released in the United States in 2009 in a special color scheme including Mirage Orange highlighting its dirt-tracker heritage.

For the Sportster Evolution engines used since the mid-1980s, there have been two engine sizes. Motorcycles with the smaller engine are designated XL883, while those with the larger engine were initially designated XL1100. When the size of the larger engine was increased from 1,100&nbsp;cc to 1,200&nbsp;cc, the designation was changed accordingly from XL1100 to XL1200. Subsequent letters in the designation refer to model variations within the Sportster range, e.g. the XL883C refers to an 883&nbsp;cc Sportster Custom, while the XL1200S designates the now-discontinued 1200 Sportster Sport.\n\n===VRSC===\n{{Main article|Harley-Davidson VRSC}}\n[[File:Harley 5-06.jpg|thumb|2003 VRSCA V-Rod]]\nIntroduced in 2001 and produced until 2017,<ref name=last>{{Citation |title=SMART MONEY MUSCLE BIKES  |last= Smith |first= Jerry |magazine=[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]] |pages= 106\u2013107 |date=May\u2013June 2017 }}</ref>the VRSC muscle bike family bears little resemblance to Harley's more traditional lineup. Competing against Japanese and American muscle bikes in the upcoming [[power cruiser|muscle bike/power cruiser]] segment, the \"V-Rod\" makes use of an engine developed jointly with [[Porsche]] that, for the first time in Harley history, incorporates [[overhead cam]]s and liquid cooling. The V-Rod is visually distinctive, easily identified by the 60-degree V-Twin engine, the radiator and the [[Hydroforming|hydroformed]] frame members that support the round-topped air cleaner cover. The VRSC [[Automobile platform|platform]] was also used for factory drag-racing motorcycles.\n\nIn 2008, Harley added the anti-lock braking system as a factory installed option on all VRSC models.<ref name=\"ABS\" /> Harley also increased the displacement of the stock engine from {{convert|1130|to|1250|cc|cuin|abbr=on}}, which had only previously been available from Screamin' Eagle, and added a slipper clutch as standard equipment.\n\nVRSC models include: \n\n* VRSCA: V-Rod (2002\u20132006), VRSCAW: V-Rod (2007\u20132010), VRSCB: V-Rod (2004\u20132005), VRSCD: Night Rod (2006\u20132008), VRSCDX: Night Rod Special (2007\u20132014), VRSCSE: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2005), VRSCSE2: Screamin' Eagle CVO V-Rod (2006), VRSCR: Street Rod (2006\u20132007), VRSCX: Screamin' Eagle Tribute V-Rod (2007), VRSCF: V-Rod Muscle (2009\u20132014).\n\n;Designation\nVRSC models utilize the Revolution engine (VR), and the street versions are designated Street Custom (SC). After the VRSC prefix common to all street Revolution bikes, the next letter denotes the model, either A (base V-Rod: discontinued), AW (base V-Rod + W for Wide with a 240&nbsp;mm rear tire), B (discontinued), D (Night Rod: discontinued), R (Street Rod: discontinued), SE and SEII(CVO Special Edition), or X (Special edition).

Modern-day Dublin English largely lies on a [[phonology|phonological]] continuum,{{citation needed|reason=This appears obvious to my experience, though a source that digs deeper into this would be great|date=May 2017}} ranging from a more traditional, lower-prestige, local urban accent on the one end to a more recently developing, higher-prestige, non-local (regional and even supraregional) accent on the other end, whose most advanced characteristics only first emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s.<ref name=\"Dartspeak\">{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|2007b|p=180}}</ref> The accent that most strongly uses the traditional working-class features has been labelled by linguistis as '''local Dublin English'''. Most speakers from Dublin and its suburbs, however, have accent features falling variously along the entire middle as well as newer end of the spectrum, which together form what is called '''non-local Dublin English''', spoken by middle- and upper-class natives of Dublin and the greater eastern Irish region surrounding the city. A subset of this variety, whose middle-class speakers mostly range in the middle section of the continuum, is called '''mainstream Dublin English'''. Mainstream Dublin English has become the basis of an accent that has otherwise become supraregional (see more below) everywhere except in the north of the country. The majority of Dubliners born since the 1980s (led particularly by females) has shifted towards the most innovative non-local accent, here called '''new Dublin English''', which has gained ground over mainstream Dublin English and which is the most extreme variety in rejecting the local accent's traditional features.<ref>Hickey, Raymond (2015).

However, a few Irish English consonants have distinctive, varying qualities. The following consonant features are defining characteristics of Hiberno-English: \n*''H''-fulness: Unlike most English varieties of England and Wales, which [[h-dropping|drop the word-initial /h/ sound]] in words like ''house'' or ''happy'', Hiberno-English always retains word-initial {{IPAc-en|h}}.\n*The phonemes {{IPAc-en|\u00f0}} (as in ''the'') and {{IPAc-en|\u03b8}} (as in ''thin'') are pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English. {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} is pronounced as {{IPA-all|d|}} or {{IPA-all|d\u032a|}}, depending on specific dialect; and {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is pronounced as {{IPA-all|t|}} or {{IPA-all|t\u032a|}}.\n*The phoneme {{IPAc-en|t}}, when appearing at the end of word or between vowel sounds, is pronounced uniquely in most Hiberno-English; the most common pronunciation is as a \"[[slit fricative]]\".\n*The phoneme {{IPAc-en|l}} is almost always of a \"light\" or \"clear\" quality (i.e. not [[velarization|velarised]]), unlike Received Pronunciation, which uses both a clear and a dark \"L\" sound, or General American, which pronounces all \"L\" sounds as dark.\n*[[Rhoticity in English|Rhoticity]]: The pronunciation of historical /r/ is nearly universal in Irish accents of English. Like with General American (but not Received Pronunciation), this means that the letter \"r\", if appearing after a vowel sound, is always pronounced (in words such as ''here'', ''cart'', or ''surf'').\n\n'''Unique consonants in various Hiberno-English dialects:'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n| '''English diaphoneme'''\n| '''Ulster'''{{ref|NI|1}}\n| '''West & <br/>South-West Ireland'''\n| '''Local <br/>Dublin'''{{ref|Dub|2}}\n| '''New<br/>Dublin'''\n| '''Supraregional <br/>Ireland'''\n| '''Example words'''\n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} \n|[\u00f0]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[d]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[d\u032a]\n| '''th'''is, wri'''th'''e, wi'''th'''er \n|-\n| syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}}\n|[l] or [\u026b]\n|[l]\n|colspan=\"3\"|[l] or [\u026b]\n| ba'''ll''', so'''l'''dier, mi'''l'''k\n|-\n| {{IPA|/r/}}{{ref|r|3}}\n|[\u027b]\n|[\u0279\u02e0]\n|prevocalic/intervocalic: [\u0279\u02e0] or [\u027e] <br/>postvocalic: [\u2205] or [\u0279\u02e0]\n|[\u027b]\n|[\u0279\u02e0] or [\u027b] \n|'''r'''ot, shi'''r'''t, ta'''r''' \n|-\n| {{IPA|/t/ between vowels}}\n|[\u027e], [\u0294], or [\u2205]\n|[\u027e] or [\u03b8\u0320]{{ref|th|4}}\n|[\u0294h]\n|[\u027e\u03b8\u0320]{{ref|th|4}}\n|[\u027e] or [\u03b8\u0320]{{ref|th|4}}\n| ba'''tt'''le, I'''t'''aly, wa'''t'''er \n|-\n| {{IPA|/t/ in word-final position}} \n|[t] or [\u0294]\n|[\u03b8\u0320]\n|[h] or [\u2205]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[\u03b8\u0320]\n| ca'''t''', ge'''t''', righ'''t''' \n|-\n| {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} \n|[\u03b8]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[t]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[t\u032a]\n| le'''th'''al, '''th'''ick, wra'''th''' \n|-\n| {{IPA|/hw/}}{{ref|hw|5}} \n|[w]\n|colspan=\"2\"|[\u028d]\n|[w]\n|[\u028d] or [w]\n| a'''wh'''ile, '''wh'''ale, '''wh'''en\n|}\n'''Footnotes:'''\n\n{{note|NI|1}}In traditional, conservative [[Ulster English]], /k/ and /g/ are [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] before a low front vowel.<ref>{{harvnb|de Gruyter|2004|pp=88}}</ref>\n\n{{note|Dub|2}}Local Dublin also undergoes cluster simplification, so that [[stop consonant]] sounds occurring after [[fricative]]s or [[sonorant]]s may be left unpronounced, resulting, for example, in \"poun(d)\" and \"las(t)\".<ref name=\"South-West\"/>\n\n{{note|r|3}}Rhoticity: Every major accent of Irish English is strongly [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (pronounces \"r\" after a vowel sound), though to a weaker degree with the local Dublin accent.<ref name=\"Harvcoltxt|Hickey|1984|p=234\">{{Harvcoltxt|Hickey|1984|p=234}}</ref> The accents of local Dublin and some smaller eastern towns like [[Drogheda]] were historically non-rhotic and now only very lightly rhotic or variably rhotic, with the rhotic consonant being an alveolar approximant, [\u0279].

Dublin's retroflex approximant has no precedent outside of northern Ireland and is a genuine innovation of the past two decades.

Various aspects of Irish syntax have influenced Hiberno-English, though many of these idiosyncrasies are disappearing in suburban areas and among the younger population.\n\nThe other major influence on Hiberno-English that sets it apart from modern English in general is the retention of words and phrases from Old- and Middle-English.\n\n===From Irish===\n\n====Reduplication====\n[[Reduplication]] is an alleged trait of Hiberno-English strongly associated with [[Stage Irish]] and Hollywood films.\n\n* the Irish ''ar bith'' corresponds to English \"at all\", so the stronger ''ar chor ar bith'' gives rise to the form \"at all at all\".\n**\"I've no time at all at all.\"\n* ''ar eagla go \u2026'' (lit. \"on fear that \u2026\") means \"in case \u2026\". The variant ''ar eagla na heagla'', (lit. \"on fear of fear\") implies the circumstances are more unlikely. The corresponding Hiberno-English phrases are \"to be sure\" and \"to be sure to be sure\". In this context, these are not, as might be thought, disjuncts meaning \"certainly\"; they could better be translated \"in case\" and \"just in case\". Nowadays normally spoken with conscious levity.\n** \"I brought some cash in case I saw a bargain, and my credit card to be sure to be sure.\"\n\n====Yes and no====\nIrish lacks words that directly translate as [[yes and no|\"yes\" or \"no\"]], and instead [[echo response|repeats the verb used in the question]], negated if necessary, to answer. Hiberno-English uses \"yes\" and \"no\" less frequently than other English dialects as speakers can repeat the verb, positively or negatively, instead of (or in redundant addition to) using \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\n* \"Are you coming home soon?\" \u2013 \"I am.\"\n* \"Is your mobile charged?\" \u2013 \"It isn't.\"\n\nThis is not limited only to the verb ''to be'': it is also used with ''to have'' when used as an auxiliary; and, with other verbs, the verb ''to do'' is used. This is most commonly used for intensification, especially in Ulster English.\n* \"This is strong stuff, so it is.\"\n* \"We won the game, so we did.\"\n\n====Recent past construction====\nIrish indicates recency of an action by adding \"after\" to the present continuous (a verb ending in \"-ing\"), a construction known as the \"hot news perfect\" or \"after perfect\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1jpNgJhjJF4C&pg=PA129&lpg=PA129&dq=%22hot+news+perfect |title=A semantic and pragmatic examination ... \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-3-87808-372-6|year=1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aPPexF5hyIkC&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=%22after+perfect%22+irish |title=Dialects across borders: selected ... \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=26 November 2010|isbn=978-90-272-4787-2|year=2005}}</ref> The idiom for \"I had done X when I did Y\" is \"I was after doing X when I did Y\", modelled on the Irish usage of the compound [[preposition]]s ''i ndiaidh'', ''tar \u00e9is'', and ''in \u00e9is'': ''bh\u00ed m\u00e9 tar \u00e9is/i ndiaidh/in \u00e9is X a dh\u00e9anamh, nuair a rinne m\u00e9 Y''.\n* \"Why did you hit him?\" \u2013 \"He was after giving me cheek.\" (he had been cheeky to me).\nA similar construction is seen where exclamation is used in describing a recent event:\n* \"I'm after hitting him with the car!\" ''T\u00e1im tar \u00e9is \u00e9 a bhualadh leis an gcarr!''\n* \"She's after losing five stone in five weeks!\"\n\nWhen describing less astonishing or significant events, a structure resembling the German perfect can be seen:\n* \"I have the car fixed.\" ''T\u00e1 an carr deisithe agam.''\n* \"I have my breakfast eaten.\" ''T\u00e1 mo bhricfeasta ithe agam.''\n\nThis correlates with an analysis of \"H1 Irish\" proposed by Adger & Mitrovic,<ref>Adger (2004)</ref> in a deliberate parallel to the status of German as a [[V2 word order|V2 language]].\n\n====Reflection for emphasis====\nThe reflexive version of pronouns is often used for emphasis or to refer indirectly to a particular person, etc., according to context.  ''Herself'', for example, might refer to the speaker's boss or to the woman of the house. Use of ''herself'' or ''himself'' in this way often indicates that the speaker attributes some degree of arrogance or selfishness to the person in question. Note also the indirectness of this construction relative to, for example, ''She's coming now''\n* \"'Tis herself that's coming now.\" ''Is \u00ed f\u00e9in at\u00e1 ag teacht anois.''\n* \"Was it all of ye or just yourself?\" ''An sibhse ar fad n\u00f3 tusa f\u00e9in a bh\u00ed i gceist?''\n\n====Prepositional pronouns====\nThere are some language forms that stem from the fact that there is no verb ''to have'' in Irish. Instead, possession is indicated in Irish by using the preposition ''at'', (in Irish, ''ag.''). To be more precise, Irish uses a prepositional pronoun that combines ''ag'' \"at\" and ''m\u00e9'' \"me\" to create ''agam''.\nIn English, the verb \"to have\" is used, along with a \"with me\" or \"on me\" that derives from ''T\u00e1 \u2026 agam.''  This gives rise to the frequent\n* \"Do you have the book?\" \u2013 \"I have it with me.\"\n* \"Have you change for the bus on you?\"\n* \"He will not shut up if he has drink taken.\"\nSomebody who can speak a language \"has\" a language, in which Hiberno-English has borrowed the grammatical form used in Irish.\n* \"She does not have Irish.\" ''N\u00edl Gaeilge aici.'' literally \"There is no Irish at her\".\n\nWhen describing something, many Hiberno-English speakers use the term \"in it\" where \"there\" would usually be used. This is due to the Irish word ''ann'' (pronounced \"oun\" or \"on\") fulfilling both meanings.\n* \"Is it yourself that is in it?\" ''An t\u00fa f\u00e9in at\u00e1 ann?''\n* \"Is there any milk in it?\" ''An bhfuil bainne ann?''\n\nAnother idiom is this thing or that thing described as \"this man here\" or \"that man there\", which also features in [[Newfoundland English]] in Canada.\n* \"This man here.\" ''An fear seo.'' (cf. the related ''anseo'' = here)\n* \"That man there.\" ''An fear sin.'' (cf. the related ''ansin'' = there)\n\nConditionals have a greater presence in Hiberno-English due to the tendency to replace the simple present tense with the conditional (would) and the simple past tense with the conditional perfect (would have).\n* \"John asked me would I buy a loaf of bread.\" (John asked me to buy a loaf of bread.)\n* \"How do you know him? We would have been in school together.\" (We went to school together.)\n\n'''Bring''' and '''take''': Irish use of these words differs from that of British English because it follows the Irish grammar for ''beir'' and ''t\u00f3g''. English usage is determined by direction; person determines Irish usage. So, in English, one '''takes''' \"''from'' here ''to'' there\", and '''brings''' it \"''to'' here ''from'' there\". In Irish, a person '''takes''' only when accepting a transfer of possession of the object from someone else{{spaced ndash}}and a person '''brings''' at all other times, irrespective of direction (to or from).\n* Don't forget to bring your umbrella with you when you leave.\n* (To a child) Hold my hand: I don't want someone to take you.\n\n====To be====\n\nThe Irish equivalent of the verb \"to be\" has two present tenses, one (the present tense proper or \"aimsir l\u00e1ithreach\") for cases which are generally true or are true at the time of speaking and the other (the habitual present or \"aimsir ghn\u00e1thl\u00e1ithreach\") for repeated actions. Thus, \"you are [now, or generally]\" is ''t\u00e1 t\u00fa'', but \"you are [repeatedly]\" is ''b\u00edonn t\u00fa''. Both forms are used with the verbal noun (equivalent to the English [[present participle]]) to create compound tenses. This is similar to the distinction between ''[[wikt:ser|ser]]'' and ''[[wikt:estar|estar]]'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\nThe corresponding usage in English is frequently found in rural areas, especially [[County Mayo|Mayo]]/[[County Sligo|Sligo]] in the west of Ireland and [[County Wexford|Wexford]] in the south-east, Inner-City Dublin along with border areas of the North and Republic. In this form, the verb \"to be\" in English is similar to its use in Irish, with a \"does be/do be\" (or \"bees\", although less frequently) construction to indicate the continuous, or habitual, present:\n* \"He does be working every day.\" ''B\u00edonn s\u00e9 ag obair gach l\u00e1.''\n* \"They do be talking on their mobiles a lot.\" ''B\u00edonn siad ag caint go minic ar a bhf\u00f3in p\u00f3ca.''\n* \"He does be doing a lot of work at school.\" ''B\u00edonn s\u00e9 ag d\u00e9anamh go leor oibre ar scoil.''\n* \"It's him I do be thinking of.\" ''Is air a bh\u00edonn m\u00e9 ag smaoineamh.''\n\nThis construction also surfaces in [[African American Vernacular English]], as the famous [[habitual be]].\n\n===From Old and Middle English===\n\nIn old-fashioned usage, \"it is\" can be freely abbreviated ''\u2019tis'', even as a standalone sentence. This also allows the double contraction ''\u2019tisn\u2019t'', for \"it is not\".\n\nIrish has separate forms for the second person singular (''t\u00fa'') and the second person plural (''sibh'').\nMirroring Irish, and almost every other [[Indo-European Languages|Indo European language]], the plural ''you'' is also distinguished from the singular in Hiberno-English, normally by use of the otherwise archaic English word ''ye'' {{IPA|[ji\u02d0]}}; the word ''yous'' (sometimes written as ''youse'') also occurs, but primarily only in Dublin and across [[Ulster]]. In addition, in some areas in [[Leinster]], north [[Connacht]] and parts of Ulster, the hybrid word ''ye-s'', pronounced \"yiz\", may be used. The pronunciation differs with that of the northwestern being {{IPA|[ji\u02d0z]}} and the Leinster pronunciation being {{IPA|[j\u026az]}}.\n\n* \"Did ye all go to see it?\" ''Ar imigh sibh go l\u00e9ir chun \u00e9 a fheicint?''\n* \"None of youse have a clue!\" ''N\u00edl ciall/leid ar bith agaibh!''\n* \"Are ye not finished yet?\" ''Nach bhfuil sibh cr\u00edochnaithe f\u00f3s?''\n* \"Yis are after destroying it!\" ''T\u00e1 sibh tar \u00e9is \u00e9 a scriosadh!''\n\nThe word ''ye'', ''yis'' or ''yous'', otherwise archaic, is still used in place of \"you\" for the second-person plural. ''Ye'r'', ''Yisser'' or ''Yousser'' are the possessive forms, e.g. \"Where are yous going?\"\n\nThe verb ''mitch'' is very common in Ireland, indicating being truant from school. This word appears in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] (though he wrote in [[Early Modern English]] rather than [[Middle English]]), but is seldom heard these days in [[British English]], although pockets of usage persist in some areas (notably [[South Wales]], Devon, and [[Cornwall]]). In parts of Connacht and Ulster the ''mitch'' is often replaced by the verb ''scheme'', while in Dublin it is often replaced by \"on the hop/bounce\".\n\nAnother usage familiar from Shakespeare is the inclusion of the second person pronoun after the imperative form of a verb, as in \"Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed\" ([[Romeo and Juliet]], Act III, Scene IV). This is still common in [[Ulster]]: \"Get youse your homework done or you're no goin' out!\" In [[Munster]], you will still hear children being told, \"Up to bed, let ye\" {{IPA|[l\u025b\u02c8t\u0283i]}}.\n\nFor influence from [[Scotland]], see [[Ulster Scots language|Ulster Scots]] and [[Ulster English]].\n\n===Other grammatical influences===\n\n'''Now''' is often used at the end of sentences or phrases as a semantically empty word, completing an utterance without contributing any apparent meaning. Examples include \"Bye now\" (= \"Goodbye\"), \"There you go now\" (when giving someone something), \"Ah now!\" (expressing dismay), \"Hold on now\" (= \"wait a minute\"), \"Now then\" as a mild attention-getter, etc. This usage is universal among English dialects, but occurs more frequently in Hiberno-English.  It is also used in the manner of the Italian 'prego' or German 'bitte', for example a barman might say \"Now, Sir.\" when delivering drinks.\n\n'''So''' is often used for emphasis (\"I can speak Irish, so I can\"), or it may be tacked onto the end of a sentence to indicate agreement, where \"then\" would often be used in Standard English (\"Bye so\", \"Let's go so\", \"That's fine so\", \"We'll do that so\"). The word is also used to contradict a negative statement (\"You're not pushing hard enough\" \u2013 \"I am so!\"). (This contradiction of a negative is also seen in American English, though not as often as \"I am too\", or \"Yes, I am\".) The practice of indicating emphasis with ''so'' and including reduplicating the sentence's subject pronoun and auxiliary verb (is, are, have, has, can, etc.) such as in the initial example, is particularly prevalent in more northern dialects such as those of Sligo, Mayo and the counties of Ulster.\n\n'''Sure''' is often used as a tag word, emphasising the obviousness of the statement, roughly translating as but/and/well. Can be used as \"to be sure\", the famous Irish stereotype phrase. (But note that the other stereotype of \"Sure and \u2026\" is not actually used in Ireland.) Or \"Sure, I can just go on Wednesday\", \"I will not, to be sure.\" The word is also used at the end of sentences (primarily in [[Munster]]), for instance \"I was only here five minutes ago, sure!\" and can express emphasis or indignation.\n\n'''To''' is often omitted from sentences where it would exist in British English. For example, \"I'm not let go out tonight\", instead of \"I'm not allowed ''to'' go out tonight\".\n\n'''Will''' is often used where British English would use \"shall\" or American English \"should\" (as in \"Will I make us a cup of tea?\"). The distinction between \"shall\" (for first-person simple future, and second- and third-person emphatic future) and \"will\" (second- and third-person simple future, first-person emphatic future), maintained by many in England, does not exist in Hiberno-English, with \"will\" generally used in all cases.\n\n'''Once''' is sometimes used in a different way from how it is used in other dialects; in this usage, it indicates a combination of logical and causal conditionality: \"I have no problem laughing at myself once the joke is funny.\"  Other dialects of English would probably use \"if\" in this situation.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ireland|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Anglo-Manx]]\n* [[Dialect]]\n*[[English language in Europe]]\n*[[Highland English]]\n*[[Languages of Ireland]]\n*[[List of English words of Irish origin]]\n*[[Newfoundland English]]\n*[[Regional accents of English]]\n*[[Ulster English]]\n*[[Welsh English]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group = lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |32em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book\n|author=[[David Adger|Adger, David]]\n|last=\n|first=\n|year=2003\n|title=Core Syntax: A Minimalist Approach\n|location=Oxford\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=0-19-924370-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n|last=Hickey\n|first=Raymond\n|year=1984\n|title=Coronal Segments in Irish English\n|journal=Journal of Linguistics\n|volume=20\n|issue=2\n|pages=233\u2013250\n|doi=10.1017/S0022226700013876\n|ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Hickey\n|first=Raymond\n|author-mask=3\n|year=2007\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3vDuPNG7nUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|title=Irish English: History and Present-Day Forms\n|location=Cambridge, UK\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn=0-521-85299-4\n|ref=harv\n}}\n* \u2014\u2014\u2014 (2007b). \"[https://www.uni-due.de/IERC/DartSpeak_EstuaryEnglish_(Hickey).pdf Dartspeak and Estuary English: Advanced metropolitan speech in Ireland and England]\".

The lower section shows how the \u03bb/4 harmonic interacts in visible light (green and red), as photographed in an [[optical flat]].]]\n\n'''Harmonic analysis''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] concerned with the representation of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] or signals as the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of basic [[wave]]s, and the study of and generalization of the notions of [[Fourier series]] and [[Fourier transform]]s (i.e. an extended form of [[Fourier analysis]]). In the past two centuries, it has become a vast subject with applications in areas as diverse as [[number theory]], [[representation theory]], [[signal processing]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[Theory_of_tides#Harmonic_analysis|tidal analysis]] and [[neuroscience]].\n\nThe term \"[[harmonic]]s\" originated as the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''harmonikos'', meaning \"skilled in music\".<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=harmonic \"harmonic\"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.</ref> In physical [[eigenvalue]] problems, it began to mean waves whose frequencies are [[Multiple (mathematics)|integer multiples]] of one another, as are the frequencies of the [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonics of music notes]], but the term has been generalized beyond its original meaning.\n\nThe classical Fourier transform on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is still an area of ongoing research, particularly concerning Fourier transformation on more general objects such as [[distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]]. For instance, if we impose some requirements on a distribution ''f'', we can attempt to translate these requirements in terms of the Fourier transform of ''f''. The [[Paley\u2013Wiener theorem]] is an example of this. The Paley\u2013Wiener theorem immediately implies that if ''f'' is a nonzero [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of [[compact support]] (these include functions of compact support), then its Fourier transform is never compactly supported. This is a very elementary form of an [[uncertainty principle]] in a harmonic-analysis setting. See also: [[Convergence of Fourier series]].\n\nFourier series can be conveniently studied in the context of [[Hilbert space]]s, which provides a connection between harmonic analysis and [[functional analysis]].\n\n==Applied harmonic analysis==\n\n[[File:Bass Guitar Time Signal of open string A note (55 Hz).png|thumb|400 px| Bass-guitar time signal of open-string A note (55&nbsp;Hz)]]\n[[File:Fourier Transform of bass guitar time signal.png|thumb|400 px| Fourier transform of bass-guitar time signal of open-string A note (55&nbsp;Hz)<ref>Computed with https://sourceforge.net/projects/amoreaccuratefouriertransform/.</ref>]]\n\nMany applications of harmonic analysis in science and engineering begin with the idea or hypothesis that a phenomenon or signal is composed of a sum of individual oscillatory components.  Ocean [[tide]]s and vibrating [[String (music)|strings]] are common and simple examples.  The theoretical approach is often to try to describe the system by a [[differential equation]] or [[system of equations]] to predict the essential features, including the amplitude, frequency, and phases of the oscillatory components.  The specific equations depend on the field, but theories generally try to select equations that represent major principles that are applicable.\n\nThe experimental approach is usually to [[Data collection|acquire data]] that accurately quantifies the phenomenon.  For example, in a study of tides, the experimentalist would acquire samples of water depth as a function of time at closely enough spaced intervals to see each oscillation and over a long enough duration that multiple oscillatory periods are likely included.  In a study on vibrating strings, it is common for the experimentalist to acquire a sound waveform sampled at a rate at least twice that of the highest frequency expected and for a duration many times the period of the lowest frequency expected.\n\nFor example, the top signal at the right is a sound waveform of a bass guitar playing an open string corresponding to an A note with a fundamental frequency of 55&nbsp;Hz.  The waveform appears oscillatory, but it is more complex than a simple sine wave, indicating the presence of additional waves.  The different wave components contributing to the sound can be revealed by applying a mathematical analysis technique known as the [[Fourier transform]], the result of which is shown in the lower figure.  Note that there is a prominent peak at 55&nbsp;Hz, but that there are other peaks at 110&nbsp;Hz, 165&nbsp;Hz, and at other frequencies corresponding to integer multiples of 55&nbsp;Hz.  In this case, 55&nbsp;Hz is identified as the fundamental frequency of the string vibration, and the integer multiples are known as [[harmonic]]s.\n\n==Abstract harmonic analysis==\n[[File:Lord Kelvin's harmonic analyser 1876, Hunterian Museum, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Lord Kelvin]]'s harmonic analyser 1876, Hunterian Museum, Glasgow]]\nOne of the most modern branches of harmonic analysis, having its roots in the mid-20th century, is [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] on [[topological group]]s. The core motivating ideas are the various [[Fourier transform]]s, which can be generalized to a transform of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s defined on Hausdorff [[locally compact group|locally compact topological groups]].\n\nThe theory for [[abelian group|abelian]] [[locally compact group]]s is called [[Pontryagin duality]].\n\nHarmonic analysis studies the properties of that duality and Fourier transform and attempts to extend those features to different settings, for instance, to the case of non-abelian [[Lie group]]s.\n\nFor general non-abelian locally compact groups, harmonic analysis is closely related to the theory of unitary group representations. For compact groups, the [[Peter\u2013Weyl theorem]] explains how one may get harmonics by choosing one irreducible representation out of each equivalence class of representations. This choice of harmonics enjoys some of the useful properties of the classical Fourier transform in terms of carrying convolutions to pointwise products, or otherwise showing a certain understanding of the underlying [[Group (mathematics)|group]] structure. See also: [[Non-commutative harmonic analysis]].\n\nIf the group is neither abelian nor compact, no general satisfactory theory is currently known (\"satisfactory\" means at least as strong as the [[Plancherel theorem]]). However, many specific cases have been analyzed, for example [[Special linear group|SL<sub>''n''</sub>]]. In this case, [[Group representation|representations]] in infinite [[Dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimensions]] play a crucial role.\n\n==Other branches==\n*Study of the [[eigenvalue]]s and [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Laplacian]] on [[domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]]s, [[manifold]]s, and (to a lesser extent) [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s is also considered a branch of harmonic analysis. See e.g., [[hearing the shape of a drum]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Terras |first1=Audrey |title=Harmonic Analysis on Symmetric Spaces-Euclidean Space, the Sphere, and the Poincar\u00e9 Upper Half-Plane |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-1461479710 |page=37 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcHBAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=harmonic+analysis+hear+shape+of+a+drum&source=bl&ots=VxY1ZdYBM_&sig=lOpL3zS5uDcw07QE3Ps-2gzRr-A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi2wsbTioXYAhVKQt8KHaqCC_kQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&q=harmonic%20analysis%20hear%20shape%20of%20a%20drum&f=false |accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\n* Harmonic analysis on Euclidean spaces deals with properties of the [[Fourier transform]] on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> that have no analog on general groups.

There is also the \"[[Inside-the-park home run|inside-the-park]]\" home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.\n\nWhen a home run is scored, the batter is also credited with a [[hit (baseball)|hit]] and a run scored, and an [[RBI]] for each runner that scores, including himself. Likewise, the pitcher is recorded as having given up a hit, and a run for each runner that scores including the batter.\n\nHome runs are among the most popular aspects of baseball and, as a result, prolific home run hitters are usually the most popular among fans and consequently the highest paid by teams\u2014hence the old saying, variously attributed to slugger [[Ralph Kiner]], or to a teammate talking about Kiner, \"Home run hitters drive [[Cadillac]]s, and singles hitters drive [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]s.\"<ref name=\"Corbett\">{{sabrbio1|b65aaec9|Ralph Kiner|Warren Corbett|July 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Types of home runs==\n===Out of the park===\n[[Image:Mets Foul Pole.png|thumb|right|upright|If a batted ball hits the foul pole (orange pole on the right), the ball is fair and a home run is awarded to the batter]]In modern times a home run is most often scored when the ball is hit over the outfield wall between the foul poles (in [[fair ball|fair territory]]) before it touches the ground ([[in flight]]), and without being caught or deflected back onto the field by a fielder. A batted ball is also a home run if it touches either foul pole or its attached screen before touching the ground, as the foul poles are by definition in fair territory. Additionally, many major-league ballparks have [[ground rules (baseball)|ground rules]] stating that a batted ball in flight that strikes a specified location or fixed object is a home run; this usually applies to objects that are beyond the outfield wall but are located such that it may be difficult for an umpire to judge.\n\nIn professional baseball, a batted ball that goes over the outfield wall ''after'' touching the ground (i.e. a ball that bounces over the outfield wall) becomes an automatic [[double (baseball)|double]]. This is colloquially referred to as a \"[[ground rule double]]\" because the rule is not strictly written into the rules of baseball, but is rather a [[ground rules|rule]] of the field (or \"grounds\") being used. \n\nA fielder is allowed to reach over the wall to attempt to catch the ball as long as his feet are on or over the field during the attempt, and if the fielder successfully catches the ball while it is in flight the batter is out, even if the ball had already passed the vertical plane of the wall. However, since the fielder is not part of the field, a ball that bounces off a fielder (including his glove) and over the wall without touching the ground is still a home run. A fielder may not deliberately throw his [[baseball glove|glove]], [[baseball cap|cap]], or any other equipment or apparel to stop or deflect a fair ball, and an [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] may award a home run to the batter if a fielder does so on a ball that, in the umpire's judgment, would have otherwise been a home run (this is rare in modern professional baseball).<ref name=\"rulebook\">{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf|title=Major League Baseball Rulebook|publisher=[[Major League Baseball]]|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100319044131/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/07_the_runner.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2010 |accessdate=July 16, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nA home run accomplished in any of the above manners is an automatic home run. The ball is dead, even if it rebounds back onto the field (e.g., from striking a foul pole), and the batter and any preceding runners cannot be put out at any time while running the bases. However, if one or more runners fail to touch a base or one runner passes another before reaching home plate, that runner or runners can be called out on [[appeal play|appeal]], though in the case of not touching a base a runner can go back and touch it if doing so won't cause them to be passed by another preceding runner and they have not yet touched the next base (or home plate in the case of missing third base). This stipulation is in Approved Ruling (2) of Rule 7.10(b).<ref name=\"rulebook\" />\n\n===Inside-the-park home run===<!-- This section is linked from [[Roberto Clemente]] -->\n{{Main|Inside-the-park home run}}\nAn [[inside-the-park home run]] occurs when a batter hits the ball into play and is able to circle the bases before the fielders can put him out. Unlike with an outside-the-park home run, the batter-runner and all preceding runners are liable to be put out by the defensive team at any time while running the bases. This can only happen if the ball does not leave the ballfield.\n\nIn the early days of baseball, outfields were relatively much more spacious, reducing the likelihood of an over-the-fence home run, while increasing the likelihood of an inside-the-park home run, as a ball getting past an outfielder had more distance that it could roll before a fielder could track it down.\n\nModern outfields are much less spacious and more uniformly designed than in the game's early days, therefore inside-the-park home runs are now a rarity. They usually occur when a fast runner hits the ball deep into the outfield and the ball bounces in an unexpected direction away from the nearest outfielder (e.g., off a divot in the grass or off the outfield wall), or an outfielder misjudges the flight of the ball in a way that he cannot quickly recover from the mistake (e.g., by diving and missing). The speed of the runner is crucial as even [[Triple (baseball)|triples]] are relatively rare in most modern ballparks.\n\nIf any defensive play on an inside-the-park home run is labeled an [[error (baseball)|error]] by the official scorer, a home run is not scored; instead, it is scored as a [[single (baseball)|single]], [[double (baseball)|double]], or [[triple (baseball)|triple]], and the [[batter-runner]] and any applicable preceding runners are said to have taken all additional bases on error. All runs scored on such a play, however, still count.\n\nAn example of an unexpected bounce occurred during the [[2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] at [[AT&T Park]] in San Francisco on July 10, 2007. [[Ichiro Suzuki]] of the [[American League]] team hit a fly ball that caromed off the right-center field wall in the opposite direction from where [[National League]] right fielder [[Ken Griffey Jr.|Ken Griffey, Jr.]] was expecting it to go. By the time the ball was relayed, Ichiro had already crossed the plate standing up. This was the first inside-the-park home run in [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] history, and led to Suzuki being named the game's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]].\n\n==Number of runs batted in==\nHome runs are often characterized by the number of runners on base at the time. A home run hit with the bases empty is seldom called a \"one-run homer\", but rather a '''solo home run''', '''solo homer''', or \"solo shot\". With one runner on base, two runs are scored (the baserunner and the batter) and thus the home run is often called a '''two-run homer''' or '''two-run shot'''. Similarly, a home runs with two runners on base is a '''three-run homer''' or '''three-run shot'''.\n\nThe term \"four-run homer\" is seldom used; instead, it is nearly always called a \"grand slam\". Hitting a grand slam is the best possible result for the batter's turn at bat and the worst possible result for the pitcher and his team.\n\n===Grand slam===\n{{Main|Grand slam (baseball)}}\nA grand slam occurs when the bases are \"loaded\" (that is, there are base runners standing at first, second, and third base) and the batter hits a home run. According to ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'', the term originated in the card game of [[contract bridge]]. An '''inside-the-park grand slam''' is a grand slam that is also an [[inside-the-park home run]], a home run without the ball leaving the field, and it is very rare, due to the relative rarity of loading the bases along with the significant rarity (nowadays) of inside-the-park home runs.\n\nOn July 25, 1956, [[Roberto Clemente]] became the only MLB player to have ever scored a '''walk-off inside-the-park grand slam''' in a 9\u20138 [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] win over the [[Chicago Cubs]], at [[Forbes Field]].\n\nOn April 23, 1999, [[Fernando Tat\u00eds]] made history by hitting two grand slams in one inning, both against [[Chan Ho Park]] of the Los Angeles Dodgers. With this feat, Tat\u00eds also set a Major League record with 8 RBI in one inning.\n\nOn July 29, 2003 against the Texas Rangers, [[Bill Mueller]] of the [[Boston Red Sox]] became the only player in major league history to hit two grand slams in one game from opposite sides of the plate. In fact, he hit three home runs in that game, and his two grand slams were in consecutive at-bats.\n\nOn August 25, 2011 the New York Yankees became the first team to hit three grand slams in one game vs the Oakland A's. The Yankees eventually went on to win the game 22\u20139, after trailing 7\u20131.\n\n==Specific situation home runs==\nThese types of home runs are characterized by the specific game situation in which they occur, and can theoretically occur on either an outside-the-park or inside-the-park home run.\n\n===Walk-off home run===\n{{Main|Walk-off home run}}\nA walk-off home run is a home run hit by the [[home team]] in the bottom of the ninth inning, any [[extra inning]], or other scheduled final inning, which gives the home team the lead and thereby ends the game. The term is attributed to [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] [[relief pitcher]] [[Dennis Eckersley]],<ref name=\"eck_walk_off\">{{cite news|first=Lowell|last=Cohn|title=What the Eck?|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=April 21, 1988|page=D1}}</ref> so named because after the run is scored, the losing team has to \"walk off\" the field.\n\nTwo [[World Series]] have ended via the \"walk-off\" home run. The first was the [[1960 World Series]] when [[Bill Mazeroski]] of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] hit a 9th inning solo home run in the 7th game of the series off [[New York Yankees]] pitcher [[Ralph Terry]] to give the Pirates the World Championship. The second time was the [[1993 World Series]] when [[Joe Carter]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] hit a 9th inning 3-run home run off [[Philadelphia Phillies]] pitcher [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]] in Game 6 of the series, to help the Toronto Blue Jays capture their second World Series Championship in a row.\n\nSuch a home run can also be called a \"[[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]\" or \"sudden victory\" home run. That usage has lessened as \"walk-off home run\" has gained favor. Along with Mazeroski's 1960 shot, the most famous walk-off or sudden-death homer would probably be the \"[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round the World]]\" hit by [[Bobby Thomson]] to win the 1951 National League pennant for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], along with many other game-ending home runs that famously ended some of the most important and suspenseful baseball games.\n\nA walk-off home run over the fence is an exception to baseball's one-run rule. Normally if the home team is tied or behind in the ninth or extra innings the game ends as soon as the home team scores enough runs to achieve a lead. If the home team has two outs in the inning, and the game is tied, the game will officially end either the moment the batter successfully reaches 1st base or the moment the runner touches home plate\u2014whichever happens last. However, this is superseded by the \"ground rule\", which provides automatic doubles (when a ball-in-play hits the ground first then leaves the playing field) and home runs (when a ball-in-play leaves the playing field without ever touching the ground). In the latter case, all base runners including the batter are allowed to cross the plate.\n\n===Lead-off home run===\nA lead-off home run is a home run hit by the first batter of a team, the [[leadoff hitter]] of the first inning of the game. In [[MLB]], [[Rickey Henderson]] holds the record with 81 lead-off home runs.<ref>https://www.mlb.com/cut4/george-springer-is-the-best-homer-hitting-leadoff-hitter/c-274349016</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/215333472/oakland-as-to-play-on-rickey-henderson-field/|title=Oakland A's to play on Rickey Henderson Field|website=Major League Baseball|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref> [[Craig Biggio]] holds the [[National League]] record with 53, third overall to Henderson, and [[Alfonso Soriano|Soriano]] with 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130109&content_id=40900688&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb |title=With 68 percent, Craig Biggio just shy on first try at Hall of Fame &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, [[Brady Anderson]] set a Major League record by hitting a lead-off home run in four consecutive games.\n\n===Back-to-back===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}\n{{Example farm|section|date=August 2015}}\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2015}}\n}}\nWhen two consecutive batters each hit a home run, this is described as back-to-back home runs. It is still considered back-to-back even if both batters hit their home runs off different pitchers. A third batter hitting a home run is commonly referred to as back-to-back-to-back.\n\nFour home runs in a row by consecutive batters has only occurred eight times in the history of Major League Baseball. Following convention, this is called back-to-back-to-back-to-back. The most recent occurrence was on July 27, 2017, when the [[Washington Nationals]] hit four in a row against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in [[Nationals Park]] as [[Brian Goodwin (baseball)|Brian Goodwin]], [[Wilmer Difo]], [[Bryce Harper]] and [[Ryan Zimmerman]] homered off pitcher [[Michael Blazek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Castillo|first=Jorge|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/nationals-journal/wp/2017/07/27/back-to-back-to-back-to-back-nats-club-four-home-runs-in-a-row-vs-brewers/?utm_term=.994749d5b788|title=Back-to-back-to-back-to-back: Nats club four homers in a row and eight in four innings|publisher=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=August 19, 2018}}</ref> Blazek became the fourth pitcher to surrender back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs, following [[Paul Foytack]] on July 31, 1963, [[Chase Wright]] on April 22, 2007, and [[Dave Bush]].\n\nOn August 14, 2008, the Chicago White Sox defeated the Kansas City Royals 9-2. In this game, Jim Thome, Paul Konerko, Alexei Ram\u00edrez, and Juan Uribe hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs in that order. Thome, Konerko, and Ramirez blasted their homers off of Joel Peralta, while Uribe did it off of Rob Tejeda. The next batter, veteran backstop Toby Hall, tried aimlessly to hit the ball as far as possible, but his effort resulted in a strike out.\n\nOn April 22, 2007 the [[Boston Red Sox]] were trailing the [[New York Yankees]] 3\u20130 when [[Manny Ramirez]], [[J. D. Drew]], [[Mike Lowell]] and [[Jason Varitek]] hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to put them up 4\u20133. They eventually went on to win the game 7\u20136 after a three-run home run by Mike Lowell in the bottom of the 7th inning. On September 18, 2006 trailing 9\u20135 to the San Diego Padres in the 9th inning, [[Jeff Kent]], [[J. D. Drew]], [[Russell Martin]], and [[Marlon Anderson]] of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs to tie the game. After giving up a run in the top of the 10th, the Dodgers won the game in the bottom of the 10th, on a walk-off two run home run by [[Nomar Garciaparra]]. J. D. Drew has been part of two different sets of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs. In both occurrences, his homer was the second of the four.\n\nOn September 30, 1997, in the sixth inning of Game One of the [[American League Division Series]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Tim Raines]], [[Derek Jeter]] and [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] hit back-to-back-to-back home runs for the Yankees. Raines' home run tied the game. New York went on to win 8\u20136. This was the first occurrence of three home runs in a row ever in postseason play. The [[Boston Red Sox]] repeated the feat in Game Four of the [[2007 American League Championship Series]], also against the Indians. The Indians returned the favor in Game One of the [[2016 American League Division Series]].\n\nTwice in MLB history have two brothers hit back-to-back home runs. On April 23, 2013, brothers [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] (formerly B.J. Upton) and [[Justin Upton]] hit back-to-back home runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130423&content_id=45613032&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb |title=B.J. and Justin Upton hit back-to-back home runs, a rare feat for brothers &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2013-04-24 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref> The first time was on September 15, 1938, when [[Lloyd Waner]] and [[Paul Waner]] performed the feat.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-09-15/sports/0209150023_1_major-league-homer-candlestick-park |title=Sept. 15 1938: Brothers Lloyd and Paul Waner hit...|work=Chicago Tribune|date=2002-09-15 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref>\n\nSimple back-to-back home runs are a relatively frequent occurrence. If a pitcher gives up a homer, he might have his concentration broken and might alter his normal approach in an attempt to \"make up for it\" by striking out the next batter with some fastballs. Sometimes the next batter will be expecting that and will capitalize on it. A notable back-to-back home run of that type in [[World Series]] play involved \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot]]\" in 1932, which was accompanied by various Ruthian theatrics, yet the pitcher, [[Charlie Root]], was allowed to stay in the game.

The first home run ever hit in the [[National League]] was by Ross Barnes of the Chicago White Stockings (now known as the [[Chicago Cubs]]), in 1876. The home \"run\" was literally descriptive. Home runs over the fence were rare, and only in ballparks where a fence was fairly close. Hitters were discouraged from trying to hit home runs, with the conventional wisdom being that if they tried to do so they would simply fly out. This was a serious concern in the 19th century, because in baseball's early days a ball caught after one bounce was still an out. The emphasis was on place-hitting and what is now called \"manufacturing runs\" or \"small ball\".\n\nThe home run's place in baseball changed dramatically when the [[live-ball era]] began after World War I. First, the materials and manufacturing processes improved significantly, making the now-mass-produced, cork-centered ball somewhat more lively. Batters such as [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Rogers Hornsby]] took full advantage of rules changes that were instituted during the 1920s, particularly prohibition of the [[spitball]], and the requirement that balls be replaced when worn or dirty. These changes resulted in the baseball being easier to see and hit, and easier to hit out of the park. Meanwhile, as the game's popularity boomed, more outfield seating was built, shrinking the size of the outfield and increasing the chances of a long fly ball resulting in a home run. The teams with the sluggers, typified by the [[New York Yankees]], became the championship teams, and other teams had to change their focus from the \"inside game\" to the \"power game\" in order to keep up.\n\nBefore 1931, a ball that bounced over an outfield fence during a major league game was considered a home run. The rule was changed to require the ball to clear the fence on the fly, and balls that reached the seats on a bounce became [[ground rule double]]s in most parks. A carryover of the old rule is that if a player deflects a ball over the outfield fence without it touching the ground, it is a home run.\n\n[[File:Polo Grounds 1917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Polo Grounds]] left field foul line with guide rope, as seen from upper deck, 1917]]\n\nAlso, until approximately that time, the ball had to not only go over the fence in fair territory, but to land in the [[bleacher]]s in fair territory or to still be visibly fair when disappearing behind a wall. The rule stipulated \"fair when last seen\" by the [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]]. Photos from that era in ballparks, such as the [[Polo Grounds]] and [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], show ropes strung from the foul poles to the back of the bleachers, or a second \"foul pole\" at the back of the bleachers, in a straight line with the foul line, as a visual aid for the umpire. Ballparks still use a visual aid much like the ropes; a net or screen attached to the foul poles on the fair side has replaced ropes. As with American football, where a touchdown once required a literal \"touch down\" of the ball in the end zone but now only requires the \"breaking of the [vertical] plane\" of the goal line, in baseball the ball need only \"break the plane\" of the fence in fair territory (unless the ball is caught by a player who is in play, in which case the batter is called out).\n\n[[Babe Ruth]]'s 60th home run in 1927 was somewhat controversial, because it landed barely in fair territory in the stands down the [[right field]] line. Ruth lost a number of home runs in his career due to the when-last-seen rule. Bill Jenkinson, in ''The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs'', estimates that Ruth lost at least 50 and as many as 78 in his career due to this rule.\n\nFurther, the rules once stipulated that an over-the-fence home run in a sudden-victory situation would only count for as many bases as was necessary to \"force\" the winning run home. For example, if a team trailed by two runs with the bases loaded, and the batter hit a fair ball over the fence, it only counted as a triple, because the runner immediately ahead of him had technically already scored the game-winning run. That rule was changed in the 1920s as home runs became increasingly frequent and popular. Babe Ruth's career total of 714 would have been one higher had that rule not been in effect in the early part of his career.\n\n==Records==\nMajor League Baseball keeps running totals of all-time home runs by team, including teams no longer active (prior to 1900) as well as by individual players. [[Gary Sheffield]] hit the 250,000th home run in MLB history with a grand slam on September 8, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-09-09-tigers-athletics_N.htm|work=USA Today|title=Sheffield hits MLB's 250,000th HR as Tigers beat A's|date=September 9, 2008}}</ref> Sheffield had hit MLB's 249,999th home run against [[Gio Gonz\u00e1lez]] in his previous at-bat.\n\nThe all-time, verified professional baseball record for career home runs for one player, excluding the U.

Oh spent his entire career playing for the [[Yomiuri Giants]] in Japan's [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], later managing the Giants, the [[Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks]] and the 2006 World Baseball Classic Japanese team. Oh holds the all-time home run world record, having hit 868 home runs in his career.\n\nIn [[Major League Baseball]], the career record is 762, held by [[Barry Bonds]], who broke Hank Aaron's record on August 7, 2007, when he hit his 756th home run at [[AT&T Park]] off pitcher [[Mike Bacsik (left-handed pitcher)|Mike Bacsik]].<ref name=\"PEDs\">Although Major League Baseball recognizes these records as official, some baseball historians decline to accept records accumulated by players like Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and others with the alleged assistance of [[steroids]] or other [[performance-enhancing drugs]]</ref> Only eight other major league players have hit as many as 600: [[Hank Aaron]] (755), [[Babe Ruth]] (714),<ref name=\"PEDs\"/> [[Alex Rodriguez]] (696), [[Willie Mays]] (660), <ref name=\"PEDs\"/> [[Albert Pujols]] (633), <ref name=\"PEDs\" /> [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] (630), [[Jim Thome]] (612), and [[Sammy Sosa]] (609).\n\nThe single season record is 73, set by Barry Bonds in 2001.<ref name=\"PEDs\" />  Other notable single season records were achieved by Babe Ruth who hit 60 in 1927, [[Roger Maris]], with 61 home runs in 1961, and [[Mark McGwire]], who hit 70 in 1998.<ref name=\"PEDs\" />\n\n[[Negro league baseball|Negro League]] slugger [[Josh Gibson]]'s Baseball Hall of Fame plaque says he hit \"almost 800\" home runs in his career. The ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' lists Gibson's lifetime home run total at 800. Ken Burns' award-winning series, ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', states that his actual total may have been as high as 950. Gibson's true total is not known, in part due to inconsistent record keeping in the Negro Leagues. The 1993 edition of the MacMillan ''Baseball Encyclopedia'' attempted to compile a set of Negro League records, and subsequent work has expanded on that effort. Those records demonstrate that Gibson and Ruth were of comparable power. The 1993 book had Gibson hitting 146 home runs in the 501 \"official\" Negro League games they were able to account for in his 17-year career, about 1 homer every 3.4 games. Babe Ruth, in 22 seasons (several of them in the [[dead-ball era]]), hit 714 in 2503 games, or 1 homer every 3.5 games. The large gap in the numbers for Gibson reflect the fact that Negro League clubs played relatively far fewer league games and many more \"barnstorming\" or exhibition games during the course of a season, than did the major league clubs of that era.\n\nOther legendary home run hitters include [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Mel Ott]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Mickey Mantle]] (who on September 10, 1960, mythically hit \"the longest home run ever\" at an estimated distance of {{convert|643|ft|m|0}}, although this was measured after the ball stopped rolling<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/art_hr.shtml |title=Longest Home Run Ever Hit by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-16}}</ref>), [[Reggie Jackson]], [[Harmon Killebrew]], [[Ernie Banks]], [[Mike Schmidt]], [[Dave Kingman]], [[Sammy Sosa]]<ref name=\"PEDs\" /> (who hit 60 or more home runs in a season 3 times), [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] and [[Eddie Mathews]].

It was first utilized on September 3, 2008 in a game between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] at [[Tropicana Field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20080903&content_id=3412731&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy|title=Instant message: Yanks not done Replay used on A-Rod's homer in Bombers' must-win vs. Rays|last=Hoch|first=Bryan|date=September 4, 2008|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> [[Alex Rodriguez]] of the Yankees hit what appeared to be a home run, but the ball hit a catwalk behind the foul pole. It was at first called a home run, until Tampa Bay manager [[Joe Maddon]] argued the call, and the umpires decided to review the play. After 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the umpires came back and ruled it a home run.\n\nAbout two weeks later, on September 19, also at Tropicana Field, a boundary call was overturned for the first time. In this case, [[Carlos Pe\u00f1a]] of the Rays was given a ground rule double in a game against the [[Minnesota Twins]] after an umpire believed a fan reached into the field of play to catch a fly ball in right field. The umpires reviewed the play, determined the fan did not reach over the fence, and reversed the call, awarding Pe\u00f1a a home run.\n\nAside from the two aforementioned reviews at Tampa Bay, replay was used four more times in the 2008 MLB regular season: twice at Houston, once at Seattle, and once at San Francisco. The San Francisco incident is perhaps the most unusual. [[Bengie Molina]], the Giants' catcher, hit what was first called a single. Molina then was replaced in the game by Emmanuel Burriss, a pinch-runner, before the umpires re-evaluated the call and ruled it a home run. In this instance though, Molina was not allowed to return to the game to complete the run, as he had already been replaced. Molina was credited with the home run, and two RBIs, but not for the run scored which went to Burriss instead.\n\nOn October 31, 2009, in the fourth inning of Game 3 of the World Series, Alex Rodriguez hit a long fly ball that appeared to hit a camera protruding over the wall and into the field of play in deep left field.  The ball ricocheted off the camera and re-entered the field, initially ruled a double.  However, after the umpires consulted with each other after watching the instant replay, the hit was ruled a home run, marking the first time an instant replay home run was hit in a playoff game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091031&content_id=7586236&vkey=news_mlb|title=A-Rod awarded homer on replay, First postseason use of review gives Yank two-run shot|date=November 1, 2009|last=DiComo|first=Anthony|work=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders]] (by year)\n* [[Major League Baseball single-season home run record]]\n* [[Home Run Derby]]\n* [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]]\n* [[Josh Gibson Legacy Award]]\n* [[Mel Ott Award]]\n* [[Joe Bauman Home Run Award]]\n\n'''Career achievements'''\n* [[List of lifetime home run leaders through history]]\n* [[500 home run club]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders]]\n* [[20\u201320\u201320 club|List of Major League Baseball players with 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in the same season]]\n* [[20\u201320\u201320 club#20\u201320\u201320\u201320 club|List of Major League Baseball players with 20 doubles, 20 triples, 20 home runs, and 20 stolen bases in the same season]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball single-game home run leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their first major league at bat]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their final major league at bat]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618145621/http://www.hrpace.com/ MLB's Home Run Leaders] \u2013 batting statistics for over 16,000 players\n\n{{Baseball}}{{Baseball statistics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Home Run}}\n[[Category:Baseball rules]]\n[[Category:Batting statistics]]\n[[Category:Baseball terminology]]", "sha1": "qa4gakj8wyb4zzl0p0yehove3b65b3l"}}, {"title": "Harappa", "ns": "0", "id": "14149", "revision": {"id": "866425831", "parentid": "862172168", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T07:27:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Smithy876", "id": "32094199"}, "comment": "Removed unnecessary word, fixed grammar", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the historical Harappan Civilization|Indus Valley Civilization}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2015}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=December 2015}}\n{{Infobox ancient site\n  |name = Harappa\n  |native_name = {{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0691\u067e\u0651\u06c1}} {{ur icon}}\n  |alternate_name =\n  |image = File:View of Granary and Great Hall on Mound F.JPG\n  |alt =\n  |caption = A view of Harappa's Granary and Great Hall\n  |map_type = Pakistan#Punjab Pakistan\n  |map_alt =\n  |map_size =\n  |coordinates = {{Coord|30|37|44|N|72|51|50|E|type:landmark_region:PK|display=inline,title}}\n  |location = [[Sahiwal District]], [[Punjab, Pakistan]]\n  |region =\n  |type = Settlement\n  |part_of =\n  |length =\n  |width =\n  |area = {{convert|150|ha|abbr=on}}\n  |height =\n  |builder =\n  |material =\n  |built =\n  |abandoned =\n  |epochs = [[Periodization of the Indus Valley Civilization|Harappa 1]] to [[Periodization of the Indus Valley Civilization|Harappa 5]]\n  |cultures = [[Indus Valley Civilization]]\n  |dependency_of =\n  |occupants =\n  |event =\n  |excavations =\n  |archaeologists =\n  |condition = Ruined\n  |ownership = {{PAK}}\n  |management =\n  |public_access = Yes\n  |website = {{URL|https://www.harappa.com}}\n  |notes =\n}}\n'''Harappa''' ({{IPA-pa|\u0266\u0259\u027d\u0259ppa\u02d0|prron}}; [[Urdu]]/{{lang-pnb|{{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0691\u067e\u0651\u06c1}}}}) is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]], about {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Sahiwal]].

The two greatest cities, [[Mohenjo-daro]] and Harappa, emerged circa 2600&nbsp;BC along the [[Indus River]] valley in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | title = World History: Patterns of Interaction | publisher = McDougal Littell | year = 1999 | location = Evanston, IL | isbn = 0-395-87274-X }}</ref> The civilization, with a possible [[writing system]], urban centers, and diversified [[Social structure|social]] and [[economic system]], was rediscovered in the 1920s also after excavations at [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Sindh near [[Larkana]], and Harappa, in west [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] south of [[Lahore]].

As early as 1826 Harappa, located in west Punjab, attracted the attention of a British officer in India, who gets credit for preliminary excavations in Harappa.\n\n==Culture and economy==\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization was mainly an urban culture sustained by surplus agricultural production and commerce, the latter including trade with [[Sumer]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]]. Both [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and Harappa are generally characterized as having \"differentiated living quarters, flat-roofed brick houses, and fortified administrative or religious centers.\"<ref name=loc>Library of Congress: Country Studies. 1995.

Retrieved 13 January 2006.</ref> Although such similarities have given rise to arguments for the existence of a standardized system of urban layout and planning, the similarities are largely due to the presence of a semi-orthogonal type of civic layout, and a comparison of the layouts of [[Mohenjo-Daro]] and Harappa shows that they are in fact, arranged in a quite dissimilar fashion.\n\nThe weights and measures of the Indus Valley Civilization, on the other hand, were highly standardized, and conform to a set scale of gradations. Distinctive seals were used, among other applications, perhaps for identification of property and shipment of goods. Although copper and [[bronze]] were in use, [[Iron (material)|iron]] was not yet employed. \"Cotton was woven and dyed for clothing; wheat, rice, and a variety of vegetables and fruits were [[Agriculture|cultivated]]; and a number of animals, including the [[Brahman (cattle)|humped bull]], were [[Domestication|domesticated]],\"<ref name=\"loc\" /> as well as \"[[fighting cock|fowl for fighting]]\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8xHK6ibUMYC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=Harappa+cock+fight&source=bl&ots=0iVMnkD9m5&sig=RBt1SvGwwTAgeu-PqZzEhvY-bAk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JiEfUL35CYSQ9gTL3oDwAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Harappa%20cock%20fight&f=false] Poultry: Identification, Fabrication, Utilization by Thomas Schneller \u2013 Cengage Learning, 28 September 2009 \u2013 page 16</ref>  Wheel-made pottery\u2014some of it adorned with animal and geometric motifs\u2014has been found in profusion at all the major Indus sites.

Some of the most valuable things traded were [[carnelian]] and [[lapis lazuli]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together, Worlds Apart|last = Pollard|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Norton|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-393-92207-3|location = New York|page = 67}}</ref>\n\nWhat is clear is that Harappan society was not entirely peaceful, with the human skeletal remains demonstrating some of the highest rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981712000599# | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2012.09.012 | volume=2 | issue=2\u20133 | title=A peaceful realm?

A large number of seals have been found at such sites as Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. Many bear pictographic inscriptions generally thought to be a form of writing or script.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Despite the efforts of philologists from all parts of the world, and despite the use of modern [[cryptography|cryptographic analysis]], the signs remain undeciphered. It is also unknown if they reflect proto-[[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] or other non-[[Vedic period|Vedic]] language(s). The ascription of Indus Valley Civilization [[iconography]] and [[epigraphy]] to historically known cultures is extremely problematic, in part due to the rather tenuous archaeological evidence of such claims, as well as the projection of modern South Asian political concerns onto the archaeological record of the area. This is especially evident in the radically varying interpretations of Harappan material culture as seen from both Pakistan- and India-based scholars.\nIn February 2006 a school teacher in the village of Sembian-Kandiyur in [[Tamil Nadu]] discovered a stone [[celt (tool)]] with an inscription estimated to be up to 3,500 years old.<ref name=\"The Hindu_century\">{{cite news | last=Subramaniam | first=T.

There are three different versions.\nThe pattern of the '''Phalaecian''' (Latin: ''hendecasyllabus phalaecius'') is as follows (using \"-\" for a long syllable, \"u\" for a short and \"x\" for an \"[[anceps]]\" or variable syllable):\n x x  - u u -  u -  u - x \n<!--The verses should not be regrouped into \"feet,\" as this is false to the principles of Aeolic verse.  Also, the last syllable should not be marked x because brevis in longo is a distinct phenomenon from syllaba anceps-->\n (where x x is either - u or - -  or u -)\n\nAnother form of hendecasyllabic verse is the \"'''Alcaic'''\" (Latin: ''hendecasyllabus alcaicus''; used in the [[Alcaic stanza]]), which has the pattern:\n x - u -  x  - u u -  u -\n\nThe third form of hendecasyllabic verse is the \"'''Sapphic'''\" (Latin: ''hendecasyllabus sapphicus''; so named for its use in the [[Sapphic stanza]]), with the pattern:\n - x -  x  - u u -  u - -\n\nForty-three of Catullus's poems are hendecasyllabic; for an example, see [[Catullus 1]].\n\nThe metre has been imitated in English, notably by [[Alfred Tennyson]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], and [[Robert Frost]], cf. \"For Once Then Something.\" Contemporary American poets [[Annie Finch]] (\"Lucid Waking\") and [[Patricia Smith (poet)|Patricia Smith]] (\"The Reemergence of the Noose\") have published recent examples.  Poets wanting to capture the hendecasyllabic rhythm in English have simply transposed the pattern into its accentual-syllabic equivalent: /u|/u|/uu/u|/u|, or [[trochee]]/trochee/[[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]]/trochee/trochee, so that the long/short pattern becomes a stress/unstress pattern. Tennyson, however, maintained the quantitative features of the metre:\n\n:O you chorus of indolent reviewers,\n:Irresponsible, indolent reviewers,\n:Look, I come to the test, a tiny poem\n:All composed in a metre of Catullus...\n:(\"Hendecasyllabics\")\n\n==In Italian poetry==\nThe hendecasyllable ({{lang-it|endecasillabo}}) is the principal metre in [[Italian poetry]]. Its defining feature is a constant stress on the tenth syllable, so that the number of syllables in the verse may vary, equaling eleven in the usual case where the final word is stressed on the penultimate syllable.  The verse also has a stress preceding the [[caesura]], on either the fourth or sixth syllable. The first case is called ''endecasillabo a minore'', or lesser hendecasyllable, and has the first [[hemistich]] equivalent to a ''[[quinario]]''; the second is called ''endecasillabo a maiore'', or greater hendecasyllable, and has a ''[[settenario]]'' as the first hemistich.<ref name=trecc>Claudio Ciociola (2010) [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/endecasillabo_(Enciclopedia-dell'Italiano)/ \"Endecasillabo\"], ''Enciclopedia dell'Italiano'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.</ref>\n\n\u2212 \t\nThe most usual stress schemes for the Italian hendecasyllable are stresses on sixth and tenth syllables (for example, \"''Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita'',\" [[Dante Alighieri]], first line of ''[[The Divine Comedy]]),'' and on the fourth, seventh and tenth syllables (\"''Un incalzar di cavalli accorrenti'',\" [[Ugo Foscolo]], ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'').\n\nMost classical Italian poems are composed in hendecasyllables, including the major works of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], [[Francesco Petrarca]], [[Ludovico Ariosto]], and [[Torquato Tasso]]. The rhyme system varies from [[terza rima]] to [[ottava rima|ottava]], from [[sonnet]] to [[canzone]]. From the early 16th century, hendecasyllables are often used without a strict system, with few or no rhymes, both in poetry and in drama. An early example is ''Le Api'' (\"the bees\") by [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]], written around 1517 and published in 1525, which begins:<ref name=api>Giovanni Rucellai (1539) ''Le Api di M. Giovanni Rucellai gentilhuomo Fiorentino le quali compose in Roma de l'anno MDXXIIII essendo quivi castellano di Castel Sant' Angelo.''

Later examples can be found in the ''Canti'' of [[Giacomo Leopardi]], where hendecasyllables are alternated with ''settenari''. The effect of ''endecasillabi sciolti'' (\"untied\" hendecasyllables) may be considered similar to that of English [[blank verse]].\n\nIt has a role in Italian poetry, and a formal structure, comparable to the [[alexandrine]] in [[French language|French]].\n\n==In Polish poetry==\nThe 11-syllable metre was very popular in Polish poetry, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, owing to strong Italian literary influence. It was used by [[Jan Kochanowski]],<ref>Compare: Summary [in:] Lucylla Pszczo\u0142owska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc\u0142aw 1997, p. 398.</ref> [[Piotr Kochanowski]] (who translated ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' by [[Torquato Tasso]]), [[Sebastian Grabowiecki]], [[Wespazjan Kochowski]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Herakliusz Lubomirski]]. The greatest Polish Romantic poet, [[Adam Mickiewicz]], set his poem [[Gra\u017cyna]] in this measure. The Polish hendecasyllable is widely used when translating English \n[[blank verse]].\n\nAlmost always, the 11-syllable line is divided by a caesura into 5 + 6 syllables. Only rarely it is fully iambic. \n\nA popular form of Polish literature that employs the hendacasyllable is the [[Sapphic stanza]]: 11/11/11/5. \n\nThe Polish hendecasyllable is often combined with an 8-syllable line: 11a/8b/11a/8b. Such a stanza was used by Mickiewicz in his ballads, as in the following example.\n\n: ''Ktokolwiek b\u0119dziesz w nowogr\u00f3dzkiej stronie,''\n: ''Do P\u0142u\u017cyn ciemnego boru''\n: ''Wjechawszy, pomnij zatrzyma\u0107 twe konie,''\n: ''By\u015b si\u0119 przypatrzy\u0142 jezioru.''\n: ''(\u015awite\u017a)''\n\nIn Polish, the word for hendecasyllable is \"jedenastozg\u0142oskowiec\".\n\n==In Portuguese poetry==\nThe hendecasyllable ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''hendecass\u00edlabo'') is a common meter in Portuguese poetry. The best-known Portuguese poem composed in hendecasyllables is [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]]' epic ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas]]'', which begins as follows:\n\n:::As armas e os bar\u00f5es assinalados,\n:::Que da ocidental praia Lusitana,\n:::Por mares nunca de antes navegados,\n:::Passaram ainda al\u00e9m da Taprobana,\n:::Em perigos e guerras esfor\u00e7ados,\n:::Mais do que prometia a for\u00e7a humana,\n:::E entre gente remota edificaram\n:::Novo Reino, que tanto sublimaram\n\nIn Portuguese, hendecasyllables are often referred to as decasyllables (''decass\u00edlabo''), even when the work in question consists exclusively of eleven-syllable lines (as does ''Os Lus\u00edadas'').\n\n==In English poetry==\nThe term \"hendecasyllable\" is sometimes used in English poetry to describe  a line of iambic pentameter with an extra short syllable at the end, as in the first line of John [[Keats]]'s ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]:'' \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.\"\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[decasyllable]]\n* [[iambic pentameter]]\n\n=== The Italian hendecasyllable ===\n\n*Raffaele Spongano, ''Nozioni ed esempi di metrica italiana'', Bologna, R.

The following are the ten largest in the Hebrides and their outliers.\n\nThe [[St Kilda, Scotland#Origin of names|etymology of St Kilda]], a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides, and its main island [[Hirta]], is very complex. No [[saint]] is known by the name of Kilda, and various theories have been proposed for the word's origin, which dates from the late 16th century.<ref>Buchanan (1983) Pages 2\u20136.</ref> Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name \"St Kilda\" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it may have been derived from Norse ''{{lang|non|sunt kelda}}'' (\"sweet wellwater\") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring ''{{lang|gd|Tobar Childa}}'' was dedicated to a saint. (''{{lang|gd|Tobar Childa}}'' is a [[list of tautological place names|tautological placename]], consisting of the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and [[Old Norse|Norse]] words for ''well'', i.e. \"well well\").<ref>Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 314\u201325.</ref> The origin of the Gaelic for \"Hirta\"\u2014''{{lang|gd|Hiort}}'', ''{{lang|gd|Hirt}}'', or ''{{lang|gd|Irt}}''<ref>Newton, Michael Steven. The Naughty Little Book of Gaelic: All the Scottish Gaelic You Need to Curse, Swear, Drink, Smoke and Fool around. Sydney, Nova Scotia: Cape Breton UP, 2014.</ref>\u2014which long pre-dates the use of \"St Kilda\", is similarly open to interpretation. Watson (1926) offers the Old Irish ''{{lang|sga|hirt}}'', a word meaning \"death\", possibly relating to the dangerous seas.<ref>Watson (1994) p. 97</ref> Maclean (1977), drawing on an [[Icelanders' sagas|Icelandic saga]] describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of ''{{lang|non|Hirtir}}'', speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a [[stag]], ''{{lang|non|hirtir}}'' being \"stags\" in Norse.<ref>Maclean (1977) page 33.</ref>\n\nThe etymology of small islands may be no less complex. In relation to {{lang|gd|[[Dubh Artach]]}}, [[Robert Louis Stevenson|R. L.

He was born and died in [[Nuremberg]].  [[Matheolus Perusinus]] served as his [[tutor]]. \n\nSchedel is best known for his writing the text for the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', known as ''Schedelsche Weltchronik'' (English: ''Schedel's World Chronicle''), published in 1493 in Nuremberg.  It was commissioned by Sebald Schreyer (1446 \u2013 1520) and Sebastian Kammermeister (1446 \u2013 1503).<ref>Hartmann Schedule, Weltchronik, Kolorierte Gesamtausgabe von 1493, Einleitung und cementer Stephen F\u00fcssel, Weltbild Verlag</ref>  Maps in the ''Chronicle'' were the first ever illustrations of many cities and countries.\n\nWith the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1447, it became feasible to print books and maps for a larger customer basis. Because they had to be handwritten, books were previously rare and very expensive.\n\nSchedel was also a notable collector of books, art and [[old master print]]s. An album he had bound in 1504, which once contained five [[engraving]]s by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]], provides important evidence for dating de' Barbari's work.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Nuernberg schedel.JPG|Nuremberg\nFile:Nuremberg chronicles - CRACOVIA.png|[[Krak\u00f3w]]\nFile:Nuremberg chronicles - BRESSLA.png|[[Breslau]]\nFile:Praha1493.jpg|[[Prague]]\nFile:Hans Boehm Pfeifer von Niklashausen Schedelsche Weltchronik.JPG|Hans B\u00f6hm, the \"Pauker von Niklashausen\"\nFile:Schedel judenfeindlichkeit.jpg|[[Blood libel]]: the supposed killing of a Christian boy at the hands of Jews in Trient in 1475\nFile:Schedel judenfeindlichkeit2.jpg|Burning of Jews for the supposed desecration of sacramental wafers in Deggendorf, Bavaria in 1492\nFile:Schedel konstantinopel.jpg|[[Constantinople]] in 1493\nFile:Hartmann-schedel-hierosolima-1493 2-BW-1147x965.jpg|Jerusalem\nFile:Hartmann-schedel DESTRVCCIO-IHEROSOLIME 1493 1-1460x750.jpg|The destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans\nFile:Nuremberg chronicles f 105r 1.png|[[Seneca the Younger|Death of Seneca]]\nFile:Aesopnurembergchronicle.jpg| [[Aesop]]\nFile:Nuremberg Chronicle World Map 1493 Cornell CUL PJM 1002 02.jpg|Uncolored [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] World Map (1493).\nFile:Colored woodcut town view of Florence.jpg|View of Florence by Hartmann Schedel, Printed in Nuremberg by Anton Koberger in 1493.\n</gallery>\n\n== Editions ==\n* Hartmann Schedel: ''Registrum huius operis libri cronicarum cu [cum] figuris et imagibus [imaginibus] ab inicio mudi [mundi]''.

It was the standard epic metre in classical Greek and Latin literature, such as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Aeneid]]''. Its use in other genres of composition include [[Horace]]'s satires, [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]],'' and the Hymns of Orpheus. According to [[Greek mythology]], hexameter was invented by [[Phemonoe]], daughter of [[Apollo]] and the first [[Pythia]] of Delphi.<ref>Pausanias, 10.5.7</ref><ref>Pliny the Elder, 7.57</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n== Classical Hexameter ==\nIn classical hexameter, the six feet follow these rules:\n* A foot can be made up of two long syllables (\u2013 \u2013), a [[spondee]]; or a long and two short syllables, a [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]] (\u2013 \u03c5 \u03c5). \n* The first four feet can contain either one of them.  \n* The fifth is almost always a dactyl, and last must be a spondee.\n\nA short syllable (\u03c5) is a syllable with a short vowel and no consonant at the end. A long syllable (\u2013) is a syllable that either has a long vowel, one or more consonants at the end (or a [[Gemination|long consonant]]), or both. Spaces between words are not counted in syllabification, so for instance \"cat\" is a long syllable in isolation, but \"cat attack\" would be syllabified as short-short-long: \"ca\", \"ta\", \"tack\" (\u03c5 \u03c5 \u2013).\n\nVariations of the sequence from line to line, as well as the use of [[caesura]] (logical full stops within the line) are essential in avoiding what may otherwise be a monotonous sing-song effect.\n\n== Application==\nAlthough the rules seem simple, it is hard to use classical hexameter in English, because English is a [[Isochrony#Stress timing|stress-timed]] language that condenses vowels and consonants between stressed syllables, while hexameter relies on the regular timing of the phonetic sounds. Languages having the latter properties (i.e., languages that are not stress-timed) include Ancient Greek, Latin, Lithuanian and Hungarian.\n\nWhile the above classical hexameter has never enjoyed much popularity in English, where the standard metre is [[iambic pentameter]], English poems have frequently been written in [[iambic hexameter]]. There are numerous examples from the 16th century and a few from the 17th; the most prominent of these is [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612) in couplets of iambic hexameter. An example from Drayton (marking the feet):\n:Nor a | ny o | ther wold | like Cot | swold e | ver sped,\n:So rich | and fair | a vale | in for | tuning | to wed.\n\nIn the 17th century the iambic hexameter, also called [[alexandrine]], was used as a substitution in the [[heroic couplet]], and as one of the types of permissible lines in lyrical stanzas and the [[Pindaric]] odes of [[Abraham Cowley|Cowley]] and [[John Dryden|Dryden]].\n\nSeveral attempts were made in the 19th century to naturalise the [[dactylic hexameter]] to English, by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]] and others, none of them particularly successful. [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] wrote many of his poems in six-foot iambic and [[sprung rhythm]] lines. In the 20th century a loose ballad-like six-foot line with a strong medial pause was used by [[William Butler Yeats]]. The iambic six-foot line has also been used occasionally, and an accentual six-foot line has been used by translators from the Latin and many poets.\n\nIn the late 18th century the hexameter was adapted to the [[Lithuanian language]] by [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]. His poem ''[[The Seasons (poem)|\"Metai\" (The Seasons)]]'' is considered the most successful hexameter text in Lithuanian as yet.\n\n[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is extremely suitable to hexameter (and other forms of poetry based on [[metre (poetry)|quantitative metre]]), insomuch that if a student comes to a halt when reciting a poem s/he was supposed to learn, s/he can say \"I'm stuck here, unfortunately the rest won't come into my mind,\" and it will be an impeccable hexameter in Hungarian: ''Itt elakadtam, sajnos nem jut eszembe a t\u00f6bbi.''\n\n:Itt ela | kadtam, | sajnos | nem jut e | szembe a | t\u00f6bbi.\n\nDue to this feature, hexameter has been widely used both in translated (Greek and Roman) and in original poetry up to the twentieth century (e.g. by [[Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti]]).<ref>[http://www.magyarulbabelben.net/works/hu-en/Radn\u00f3ti_Mikl\u00f3s-1909 Radn\u00f3ti's poems with English translations], see the Fifth, Seventh or Eighth Eclogue, the seventh being the most famous, while the eighth is rendered into English in hexameter.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dactylic hexameter]]\n*[[Prosody (Latin)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n==References==\n* Stephen Greenblatt et al.

Other Heracleidae included [[Macaria]], Lamos, [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]], [[Bianor (disambiguation)#Greeks and Greek mythology|Bianor]], [[Tlepolemus]], and [[Telephus]]. These Heraclids were a group of [[Dorians|Dorian]] kings who conquered the [[Peloponnesus|Peloponnesian]] kingdoms of [[Mycenae]], [[Sparta]] and [[Argos]]; according to the literary tradition in [[Greek mythology]], they claimed a right to rule through their ancestor.  Since [[Karl Otfried M\u00fcller]]'s ''Die Dorier'' (1830, English translation 1839), I. ch. 3, their rise to dominance has been associated with a \"[[Dorian invasion]]\".\n\nThough details of genealogy differ from one ancient author to another, the cultural significance of the mythic theme, that the descendants of Heracles, exiled after his death, returned some generations later to reclaim land that their ancestors had held in [[Mycenaean Greece]], was to assert the primal legitimacy of a traditional ruling clan that traced its origin, thus its legitimacy, to Heracles.\n\n==Origin==\nHeracles, whom [[Zeus]] had originally intended to be ruler of [[Argos]], [[Lacedaemon]] and Messenian [[Pylos]], had been supplanted by the cunning of [[Hera]], and his intended possessions had fallen into the hands of [[Eurystheus]], king of [[Mycenae]]. After the death of [[Heracles]], his children, after many wanderings, found refuge from Eurystheus at [[Athens, Greece|Athens]]. Eurystheus, on his demand for their surrender being refused, attacked Athens, but was defeated and slain. Hyllus and his brothers then invaded Peloponnesus, but after a year's stay were forced by a pestilence to quit. They withdrew to [[Thessaly]], where [[Aegimius]], the mythical ancestor of the [[Dorians]], whom Heracles had assisted in war against the [[Lapiths|Lapithae]], adopted Hyllus and made over to him a third part of his territory.\n\nAfter the death of [[Aegimius]], his two sons, [[Pamphylus (mythology)|Pamphylus]] and [[Dymas]], voluntarily submitted to Hyllus (who was, according to the Dorian tradition in [[Herodotus]] V. 72, really an [[Achaea]]n), who thus became ruler of the Dorians, the three branches of that race being named after these three heroes. Desiring to reconquer his paternal inheritance, Hyllus consulted the [[Delphi|Delphic oracle]], which told him to wait for \"the third fruit\", (or \"the third crop\") and then enter Peloponnesus by \"a narrow passage by sea\". Accordingly, after three years, [[Hyllus]] marched across the [[isthmus]] of [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]] to attack [[Atreus]], the successor of [[Eurystheus]], but was slain in single combat by [[Echemus]], king of [[Tegea]]. This second attempt was followed by a third under [[Cleodaeus]] and a fourth under [[Aristomachus (Heracleidae)|Aristomachus]], both unsuccessful.\n\n==Dorian invasion==\n{{Main|Dorian invasion}}\nAt last, [[Temenus]], [[Cresphontes]] and [[Aristodemus]], the sons of Aristomachus, complained to the oracle that its instructions had proved fatal to those who had followed them. They received the answer that by the \"third fruit\" the \"third generation\" was meant, and that the \"narrow passage\" was not the isthmus of Corinth, but the straits of [[Rhium]]. They accordingly built a fleet at [[Naupactus]], but before they set sail, [[Aristodemus]] was struck by lightning (or shot by [[Apollo]]) and the fleet destroyed, because one of the Heracleidae had slain an [[Acarnanian]] soothsayer.\n\nThe oracle, being again consulted by [[Temenus]], bade him offer an expiatory sacrifice and banish the murderer for ten years, and look out for a man with three eyes to act as guide. On his way back to [[Naupactus]], [[Temenus]] fell in with [[Oxylus]], an Aetolian, who had lost one eye, riding on a horse (thus making up the three eyes) and immediately pressed him into his service. According to another account, a mule on which Oxylus rode had lost an eye. The Heracleidae repaired their ships, sailed from [[Naupactus]] to [[Antirrhium]], and thence to [[Rhium]] in [[Peloponnesus]]. A decisive battle was fought with [[Tisamenus]], son of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]], the chief ruler in the peninsula, who was defeated and slain.  This conquest was traditionally dated eighty years after the [[Trojan War]].<ref>''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Thuc.+1.12 Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War 1.12]''</ref>\n\nThe Heracleidae, who thus became practically masters of Peloponnesus, proceeded to distribute its territory among themselves by lot. [[Argos]] fell to [[Temenus]], [[Lacedaemon]] to [[Procles]] and [[Eurysthenes]], the twin sons of [[Aristodemus]]; and [[Messenia (ancient region)|Messenia]] to [[Cresphontes]] (tradition maintains that Cresphontes cheated in order to obtain Messenia, which had the best land of all.<ref>''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D4 Apollodorus, Library  2.8.4]''</ref>) The fertile district of [[Elis]] had been reserved by agreement for [[Oxylus]]. The Heracleidae ruled in [[Lacedaemon]] until 221 BCE, but disappeared much earlier in the other countries.\n\nThis conquest of [[Peloponnesus]] by the Dorians, commonly called the \"Dorian invasion\" or the \"Return of the Heraclidae\", is represented as the recovery by the descendants of Heracles of the rightful inheritance of their hero ancestor and his sons. The Dorians followed the custom of other Greek tribes in claiming as ancestor for their ruling families one of the legendary heroes, but the traditions must not on that account be regarded as entirely mythical. They represent a joint invasion of Peloponnesus by Aetolians and Dorians, the latter having been driven southward from their original northern home under pressure from the Thessalians. It is noticeable that there is no mention of these Heraclidae or their invasion in [[Homer]] or [[Hesiod]]. [[Herodotus]] (vi. 52) speaks of poets who had celebrated their deeds, but these were limited to events immediately succeeding the death of Heracles.\n\n==List of Heraclid kings==\n\n===At Sparta===\n{{main|List of kings of Sparta}}\nAt [[Sparta]], the Heraclids formed two dynasties ruling jointly: the [[Agiads]] and the [[Eurypontids]].\n\n===At Corinth===\nAt Corinth the Heraclids ruled as the [[Bacchiadae]] dynasty<ref>Diodorus Siculus, 7.9</ref> before the aristocratic revolution, which brought a Bacchiad aristocracy into power. The kings were as follows:\n* Aletes 1073 - 1035 BCE\n* Ixion 1035 - 997 BCE\n* Agelas I 997 - 960 BCE\n* Prymnis 960 - 925 BCE\n* Bacchis 925 - 890 BCE\n* Agelas II 890 - 860 BCE\n* Eudemus 860 - 835 BCE\n* Aristomedes 835 - 800 BCE\n* Agemon 800 - 784 BCE\n* Alexander 784 - 759 BCE\n* Telestes 759 - 747 BCE\n\n==In Euripides' tragedy==\n{{Main|Heracleidae (play)}}\nThe story was first amplified by the Greek tragedians, who probably drew their inspiration from local legends, which glorified the services rendered by Athens to the rulers of Peloponnesus.\n\nThe Heracleidae are the main subject of [[Euripides]]' play, ''Heracleidae''.<ref>It is the first of two surviving plays by Euripides where the family of Heracles are suppliants (the second being ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles Mad]]'').</ref> J. A. Spranger found the political subtext of ''Heracleidae'', never far to seek, so particularly apt in Athens towards the end of the peace of Nicias, in 419 BCE, that he suggested the date as its first performance.<ref>J. A. Spranger, \"The Political Element in the Heracleidae of Euripides\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''19'''.3/4 (July 1925), pp. 117-128.</ref>\n\nIn the tragedy, [[Iolaus]], Heracles' old comrade, and his children, Macaria and her brothers and sisters have hidden from [[Eurystheus]] in [[Athens]], which was ruled by King [[Demophon of Athens|Demophon]]; as the first scene makes clear, their expectation is that the blood relationship of the kings with Heracles and their father's past indebtedness to [[Theseus]], will finally provide them sanctuary. As Eurysttheus prepared to attack, an [[oracle]] told Demophon that he would win if and only if a noble woman was sacrificed to [[Persephone]]. Macaria volunteered for the sacrifice and a spring was named the Macarian spring in her honor.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 8\n* [[Diodorus Siculus]] iv. 57, 58\n* [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] i. 32, 41, ii. 13, 18, iii.

Henry was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. Henry purchased the [[Cotentin|County of Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. Henry gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. Henry was present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. Henry married [[Matilda of Scotland]] but continued to have a large number of mistresses by whom he had many illegitimate children.\n\nRobert, who invaded in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII of Flanders]] and [[Fulk V of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Br\u00e9mule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.\n\nConsidered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[judge|justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were \"new men\" of obscure backgrounds rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.\n\nHenry's only legitimate son and heir, [[William Adelin]], drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, Henry declared his daughter, [[Empress Matilda]], his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, [[Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life, 1068\u20131099==\n===Childhood and appearance, 1068\u201386===\nHenry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30\u201331}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the various travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born.

Japanese artwork and comics serve as the first example of hentai material, coming to represent the iconic style after the publication of [[Azuma Hideo]]'s ''Cybele'' in 1979. Japanese animation (anime) had its first hentai, in both definitions, with the 1984 release of Wonderkid's ''[[Lolita Anime]]'', overlooking the erotic and sexual depictions in 1969's ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' and the bare-breasted Cleopatra in 1970's ''[[Cleopatra (1970 film)|Cleopatra]]'' film. Erotic games, another area of contention, has its first case of the art style depicting sexual acts in 1985's ''[[Tenshitachi no Gogo]]''. The history of each medium itself, complicated based on the broad definition and usage.\n\n=== Origin of erotic manga ===\n[[File:Akibachan5a.jpg|thumbnail|Gratuitous illustrations of panties are a typical form of [[fanservice]]]]\n[[File:Tako to ama retouched.jpg|thumbnail|''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' (1814), a well-known example of Japanese erotic art (''[[shunga]]'')]]\nDepictions of sex and abnormal sex can be traced back through the ages, predating the term \"hentai\". {{nihongo|[[Shunga]]|\u6625\u753b}}, a Japanese term for erotic art, is thought to have and existed in some form since [[Heian period]]. From the 16th to the 19th century, shunga works were suppressed by ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s''.<ref name=\"Bowman\">{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/library/99910501/columbia-chronologies-of-asian-history-and-culture | title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2000 | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=Bowman, John}}</ref> A well-known example is ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' which depicts a woman being stimulated by two [[octopus]]es. Shunga production fell with the rise of pornographic photographs in the late 19th century.\n\nTo define erotic [[manga]], a definition for [[manga]] is needed. While the ''[[Hokusai Manga]]'' uses the term \"manga\" in its title, it does not depict the story-telling aspect common to modern manga, as the images are unrelated.

Hentai is typically defined as consisting of excessive nudity, and graphic sexual intercourse whether or not it is perverse. The term \"[[ecchi]]\" is typically related to [[fanservice]], with no sexual intercourse being depicted.\n\nTwo early works escape being defined as hentai, but contain erotic themes. This is likely due to the obscurity and unfamiliarity of the works, arriving in America and fading from public focus a full twenty years before importation and surging interests coined the Americanized term of hentai. The first is the 1969 film ''[[One Thousand and One Arabian Nights (film)|One Thousand and One Arabian Nights]]'' which faithfully includes erotic elements of the original story.<ref name=AE />{{rp|27}} In 1970, ''[[Cleopatra: Queen of Sex]]'', was the first animated film to carry an X rating, but it was mislabeled as erotica in America.<ref name=\"AE\">{{cite book |last1=Clements |first1=Jonathan | authorlink1=Clements, Jonathan |last2=McCarthy |first2=Helen |authorlink2=Helen McCarthy | title=[[The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917]] |edition=Revised and Expanded | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | year=2006}}</ref>{{rp|104}}\n\nThe term typically identifies the ''[[Lolita Anime]]'' series as the first erotic [[anime]] and [[original video animation]] (OVA); it was released in 1984 by Wonder Kids.

The origins of eroge began in the early 1980s, while the computer industry in Japan was struggling to define a computer standard with makers like [[NEC]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and [[Fujitsu]] competing against one another.<ref name=\"eroge1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shii.org/geekstories/eroge.html |title=A History of Eroge |accessdate=28 April 2013 |author=Todome, Satoshi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121205102947/http://www.shii.org/geekstories/eroge.html |archivedate=5 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[NEC PC-9801|PC98]] series, despite lacking in processing power, [[CD drive]]s and limited graphics, came to dominate the market, with the popularity of eroge games contributing to their success.<ref name=eroge1 /><ref name=hcg />\n\nDue to the vague definitions of any erotic game, depending on its classification, citing the first erotic game is a subjective one. If the definition applies to adult themes, the first game was ''[[Softporn Adventure]]''. Released in America in 1981 for the [[Apple II]], this was a text-based comedic game from [[On-Line Systems]]. If eroge is defined as the first graphical depictions and/or Japanese adult themes, it would be [[Koei]]'s 1982 release of ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]''.<ref name=\"hcg\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers3.htm | title=Hardcore gaming 101: Japanese computers | publisher=Hardcoregaming101 | accessdate=28 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Matthew T.|date=December 2005|title=The Impact of Telepresence on Cultural Transmission through Bishoujo Games|journal=PsychNology Journal|volume=3|issue=3|pages=292\u2013311|url=http://www.psychnology.org/File/PNJ3(3)/PSYCHNOLOGY_JOURNAL_3_3_JONES.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1720-7525}}</ref> Sexual intercourse is depicted through simple graphic outlines. Notably, ''Night Life'' was not intended to be erotic so much as an instructional guide \"to support married life\". A series of \"undressing\" games appeared as early as 1983, such as \"Strip Mahjong\". The first [[anime]]-styled erotic game was [[Tenshitachi no Gogo]], released in 1985 by [[JAST]]. In 1988, [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]] released the first erotic [[role-playing game]], ''Chaos Angel''.<ref name=eroge1 /> In 1989, [[AliceSoft]] released the turn-based RPG ''[[Rance (series)|Rance]]'' and [[ELF Corporation|ELF]] released ''[[Dragon Knight (series)|Dragon Knight]]''.<ref name=eroge1 />\n\nIn the late 1980s, eroge began to stagnate under high prices and the majority of games containing uninteresting plots and mindless sex.<ref name=eroge1 /> ELF's 1992 release of ''[[Dokyusei]]'' came as customer frustration with eroge was mounting and spawned a new genre of games called [[dating sim]]s.<ref name=eroge1 />  ''Dokyusei'' was unique because it had no defined plot and required the player to build a relationship with different girls in order to advance the story.<ref name=eroge1 /> Each girl had her own story, but the prospect of consummating a relationship required the girl growing to love the player; there was no easy sex.<ref name=eroge1 />\n\nThe term \"[[visual novel]]\" is vague, with Japanese and English definitions classifying the genre as a type of interactive fiction game driven by narration and limited player interaction. While the term is often retroactively applied to many games, it was [[Leaf (Japanese company)|Leaf]] that coined the term with their \"Leaf Visual Novel Series\" (LVNS) with the 1996 release of ''[[Shizuku]]'' and ''[[Kizuato]]''.<ref name=eroge1 /> The success of these two dark eroge games would be followed by the third and final installment of the LVNS, the 1997 romantic eroge ''[[To Heart]]''.<ref name=eroge1 /> Eroge visual novels took a new emotional turn with [[Tactics (brand)|Tactics]]' 1998 release ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]''.<ref name=eroge1 /> [[Key (company)|Key]]'s 1999 release of ''[[Kanon (visual novel)|Kanon]]'' proved to be a major success and would go on to have numerous console ports, two manga series and two anime series.\n\n== Censorship ==\n{{see also|Censorship in Japan}}\n[[File:Akihabara August 2014 07.JPG|thumb|Wide variety of hentai merchandise is commonly sold in specialized stores in Japan]]\nJapanese laws have impacted depictions of works since the [[Meiji Restoration]], but these predate the common definition of hentai material. Since becoming law in 1907, Article 175 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]] forbids the publication of obscene materials. Specifically, depictions of male-female sexual intercourse and [[pubic hair]] are considered obscene, but bare genitalia is not. As censorship is required for published works, the most common representations are the blurring dots on pornographic videos and \"bars\" or \"lights\" on still images. In 1986, Toshio Maeda sought to get past censorship on depictions of sexual intercourse, by creating tentacle sex.<ref name=\"Maeda\">{{cite web | url=http://www.urotsukidoji.jp/en/profile.html | title=Hentai Comics | publisher=Maeda, Toshio | accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> This led to the large number of works containing sexual intercourse with monsters, demons, robots, and aliens, whose genitals look different from men's. While western views attribute hentai to any explicit work, it was the products of this censorship which became not only the first titles legally imported to America and Europe, but the first successful ones. While uncut for American release, the United Kingdom's release of ''[[Urotsukidoji]]'' removed many scenes of the violence and tentacle rape scenes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=389419 | title=Urotsukidoji III \u2013 The Return of the Overfiend | publisher=Move Censorship.com | accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was also because of this law that the artists began to depict the characters with a minimum of anatomical details and without pubic hair, by law, prior to 1991. Part of the ban was lifted when [[Nagisa Oshima]] prevailed over the obscenity charges at his trial for his film ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://faculty.upj.pitt.edu/jalexander/Research%20archive/Japanese%20obscenity%20law/Oshima%20article.pdf | title=Obscenity, Pornography, and the Law in Japan: Reconsidering Oshima\u2019s In the Realm of the Senses | accessdate=26 April 2013 | author=Alexander, James}}</ref> Though not enforced, the lifting of this ban did not apply to anime and manga as they were not deemed artistic exceptions.<ref name=Galbraith />\n\nHowever, alterations of material or censorship and even banning of works are common.

He was the first monarch of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nHenry attained the throne when his forces defeated King [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], the culmination of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. He was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. He cemented his claim by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], daughter of [[Edward IV]] and niece of Richard III. Henry was successful in restoring the power and stability of the English monarchy after the civil war.\n\nHis [[#Trade agreements|supportive stance]] of the [[British Isles]]' wool industry and his standoff with the [[Low Countries]] had long lasting benefits to all of the British economy. However, the capriciousness and lack of due process that indebted many would tarnish his legacy and were soon ended upon Henry VII's death, after a commission revealed widespread abuses.<ref>Thomas Penn.

He paid very close attention to detail, and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising new revenues and after a reign of nearly 24 years, he was peacefully succeeded by his son, [[Henry VIII]]. The new taxes were unpopular and two days after his coronation, Henry VIII arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]. They were charged with [[high treason]] and were executed in 1510.\n\n==Ancestry and early life==\nHenry VII was born at [[Pembroke Castle]] on 28 January 1457 to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond]]. His father, [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], died three months before his birth.<ref>Caroline Rogers and Roger Turvey, ''Henry VII'', London: Hodder Murray, 2005</ref>\n\nHenry's paternal grandfather, [[Owen Tudor]], originally from the [[Tudors of Penmynydd]], Isle of [[Anglesey]] in Wales, had been a page in the court of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. He rose to become one of the \"Squires to the Body to the King\" after military service at the [[Battle of Agincourt]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=13 }}</ref> Owen is said to have secretly married the widow of Henry V, [[Catherine of Valois]]. One of their sons was Edmund Tudor, father of Henry VII. Edmund was created [[Earl of Richmond]] in 1452, and \"formally declared legitimate by Parliament\".<ref name=\"Williams17\">{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=17}}</ref>\n\nHenry's main claim to the English throne derived from his mother through the [[House of Beaufort]]. Henry's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was a great-granddaughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of Lancaster, fourth son of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and his third wife [[Katherine Swynford]]. Katherine was Gaunt's mistress for about 25 years; when they married in 1396, they already had four children, including Henry's great-grandfather [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]]. Thus Henry's claim was somewhat tenuous: it was from a woman, and by illegitimate descent. In theory, the Portuguese and Castilian royal families had a better claim (as far as \"legitimacy\" is concerned) as descendants of [[Catherine of Lancaster]], the daughter of John of Gaunt and his second wife [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]].\n\nGaunt's nephew [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] legitimised Gaunt's children by Katherine Swynford by [[Letters Patent]] in 1397. In 1407, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], who was Gaunt's son by his first wife, issued new Letters Patent confirming the legitimacy of his half-siblings, but also declaring them ineligible for the throne.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=156 }}</ref> Henry IV's action was of doubtful legality, as the Beauforts were previously legitimised by an [[Act of Parliament]], but it further weakened Henry's claim.\n\nNonetheless, by 1483 Henry was the senior male [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] claimant remaining, after the deaths in battle or by murder or execution of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], his son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], and the other Beaufort line of descent through Lady Margaret's uncle, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|2nd Duke of Somerset]].\n\nHenry also made some political capital out of his Welsh ancestry, for example in attracting military support and safeguarding his army's passage through Wales on its way to the Battle of Bosworth.<ref name=\"Chrimes, S.B. 3\">{{cite book |author=Chrimes, S.B. |title=Henry VII |page=3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Davies, Norman |title=The Isles \u2013 A History |pages=337\u2013379 }}</ref> He came from an old, established Anglesey family that claimed descent from [[Cadwaladr]] (in legend, the last ancient British king),<ref name=\"Mackie, J.D. 47\">{{cite book |author=Mackie, J.D. |title=The Earlier Tudors 1485\u20131558 |page=47 }}</ref> and on occasion Henry displayed the red dragon of Cadwaladr.<ref name=\"Chrimes, S.B. 3\"/> He took it, as well as the standard of [[St George's Cross|St George]], on his procession through London after the victory at Bosworth.<ref name=\"Mackie, J.D. 54\">{{cite book |author=Mackie, J.D. |title=The Earlier Tudors 1485\u20131558 |page=54 }}</ref> A contemporary writer and Henry's biographer, [[Bernard Andr\u00e9]], also made much of Henry's Welsh descent.<ref name=\"Mackie, J.D. 47\"/>\n\nIn reality, however, his hereditary connections to Welsh aristocracy were not strong.

In November 1476, Henry's protector fell ill and his principal advisers were more amenable to negotiating with the English king. Henry was handed over and escorted to the Breton port of Saint-Malo. While there, he feigned stomach cramps and in the confusion fled into a monastery. As at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] after [[Battle of Tewkesbury|1471 battle]], Edward IV prepared to order his extraction and probable execution. The townspeople took exception to his behaviour, however, and Francis recovered from his illness. Thus a small band of scouts rescued Henry.\n\n==Rise to the throne==\n[[File:Younghenry7.jpg|thumb|left|Young Henry VII, by a French artist ([[Mus\u00e9e Calvet]], [[Avignon]])]]\n\nBy 1483, Henry's mother was actively promoting him as an alternative to [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], despite her being married to a Yorkist, [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]. At [[Rennes Cathedral]] on Christmas Day 1483, Henry pledged to marry the eldest daughter of Edward IV, [[Elizabeth of York]], who was also Edward's heir since the presumed death of her brothers, the [[Princes in the Tower]] (King [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] and his brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]]).<ref>S.

With money and supplies borrowed from his host, [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]], Henry tried to land in England, but his conspiracy unravelled, resulting in the execution of his primary co-conspirator, the [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].<ref name=\"Williams25\">{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=25}}</ref> Now supported by Francis II's prime-minister, [[Pierre Landais]], Richard III attempted to extradite Henry from Brittany, but Henry escaped to France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=297}}</ref> He was welcomed by the French, who readily supplied him with troops and equipment for a second invasion.\n\nHenry gained the support of the Woodvilles, in-laws of the late Edward IV, and sailed with a small French and Scottish force, landing in Mill Bay, [[Pembrokeshire]], close to his birthplace.<ref>https://historypoints.org/index.php?page=henry-tudor-s-landing-site</ref> He marched towards England accompanied by his uncle Jasper and the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Wales was traditionally a Lancastrian stronghold, and Henry owed the support he gathered to his Welsh birth and ancestry, being directly descended, through his father, from [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]].<ref>Henry's return to Wales was regarded by some as the fulfilment of a Messianic prophecy. {{cite book |author=Rees, David |title=The Son of Prophecy: Henry Tudor's Road to Bosworth |publisher=Black Raven Press |location=London |year=1985  |isbn=0-85159-005-5}}</ref> He amassed an army of around 5,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=361}}</ref><ref>Estimates of the size of Henry's army at Bosworth vary. {{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=31}}, gives a figure of 'perhaps' 6,000.</ref>\n\nHenry was aware that his best chance to seize the throne was to engage Richard quickly and defeat him immediately, as Richard had reinforcements in [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]]. Richard only needed to avoid being killed to keep his throne. Though outnumbered, Henry's Lancastrian forces decisively defeated Richard's Yorkist army at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485. Several of Richard's key allies, such as the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] and [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas]] Stanley, crucially switched sides or left the battlefield. Richard III's death at Bosworth Field effectively ended the Wars of the Roses, although it was not the last battle Henry had to fight.\n\n==Reign==\nAs king, Henry was styled as [[His Grace]]. His full style as king was: ''Henry, by the Grace of God, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland''.\n[[File:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|The [[Tudor Rose]]<br />Combination of the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]] and the [[White Rose of York]]]]\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|King Henry VII's Coat of Arms]]\n[[File:Henryviiiarmour.jpg|thumb|Perfected and fluted armour of Henry VII]]\nUpon his succession as king, Henry became entitled to bear the [[Royal Arms of England|arms of his kingdom]]. After his marriage, he used the red-and-white rose as his emblem \u2013 this continued to be his dynasty's emblem, known as the [[Tudor rose]].\n\nHenry's first concern was to secure his hold on the throne. He declared himself king \"by right of conquest\" retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before Bosworth Field.<ref>S.. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 50.</ref> Thus anyone who had fought for Richard against him would be guilty of [[Treason Act 1495|treason]], and Henry could legally confiscate his lands and property of Richard III while restoring his own. However, he spared Richard's nephew and designated heir, the [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln|Earl of Lincoln]], and he made [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Margaret Plantagenet]], a Yorkist heiress, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Countess of Salisbury]] sui juris. He took great care not to address the baronage, or summon Parliament, until after his coronation, which took place in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 30 October 1485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations/henry-vii-and-elizabeth-of-york|title=Westminster Abbey website: Coronations, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> Almost immediately afterwards, he issued an edict that any gentleman who swore fealty to him would, notwithstanding any previous attainder, be secure in his property and person.\n\nHenry then honoured his pledge of December 1483 to marry Elizabeth of York.<ref name=\"Williams25\"/><ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 53.</ref> They were third cousins, as both were great-great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt.<ref>Genealogical tables in {{cite book |author=Morgan, Kenneth O. |title=The Oxford History of Britain |page=709 }}</ref> The marriage took place on 18 January 1486 at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]]. The marriage unified the warring houses and gave his children a strong claim to the throne. The unification of the houses of York and Lancaster by this marriage is symbolised by the heraldic emblem of the [[Tudor rose]], a combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster. It also ended future discussion as to whether the descendants of the fourth son of Edward III, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund, Duke of York]], through marriage to Philippa, heiress of the second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], had a superior or inferior claim to those of the third son [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], who had held the throne for three generations.\nIn addition, Henry had [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] repeal ''[[Titulus Regius]]'', the statute that declared Edward IV's marriage invalid and his children illegitimate, thus legitimising his wife. Amateur historians [[Bertram Fields]] and [[Sir Clements Markham]] have claimed that he may have been involved in the murder of the Princes in the Tower, as the repeal of ''Titulus Regius'' gave the Princes a stronger claim to the throne than his own. [[Alison Weir]], however, points out that the Rennes ceremony, two years earlier, was possible only if Henry and his supporters were certain that the Princes were already dead.<ref>Weir, Alison. ''The Princes in the Tower'', p. 190</ref>\n\nHenry secured his crown principally by dividing and undermining the power of the nobility, especially through the aggressive use of bonds and recognisances to secure loyalty. He also enacted laws against [[Bastard feudalism|livery and maintenance]], the great lords' practice of having large numbers of \"retainers\" who wore their lord's badge or uniform and formed a potential private army.\n\nWhile he was still in Leicester, after the battle of Bosworth Field, Henry was already taking precautions to prevent any rebellions against his reign.  Before leaving Leicester to go to London, Henry dispatched [[Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke|Robert Willoughby]] to Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire, to have the ten-year-old [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]], arrested and taken to the Tower of London.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 51.</ref> Edward was the son of George, Duke of Clarence, and as such he presented a threat as a potential rival to the new King Henry VII for the throne of England.  However, Henry was threatened by several active rebellions over the next few years. The first was the rebellion of the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion|Stafford brothers]] and [[Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell|Viscount Lovell]] of 1486, which collapsed without fighting.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn 1487, Yorkists led by Lincoln rebelled in support of [[Lambert Simnel]], a boy who was claimed to be the [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]],<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 72.</ref> son of Edward IV's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Clarence]] (who had last been seen as a prisoner in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]). The rebellion began in  [[Ireland]], where the traditionally Yorkist nobility, headed by the powerful [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]], proclaimed Simnel King and provided troops for his invasion of England. The rebellion was defeated and Lincoln killed at the [[Battle of Stoke]]. Henry showed remarkable clemency to the surviving rebels: he pardoned Kildare and the other Irish nobles, and he  made the boy, Simnel, a servant in the royal kitchen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=62}}</ref>\n\nIn 1490, a young [[Flemish people|Fleming]], [[Perkin Warbeck]], appeared and claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard]], the younger of the \"Princes in the Tower\". Warbeck won the support of Edward IV's sister [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]]. He led attempted invasions of Ireland in 1491 and England in 1495, and persuaded [[James IV of Scotland]] to invade England in 1496. In 1497 Warbeck landed in [[Cornwall]] with a few thousand troops, but was soon captured and executed.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', pp. 69\u201370.</ref>\n\nIn 1499, Henry had the Earl of Warwick executed. However, he spared Warwick's elder sister [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury|Margaret]]. She survived until 1541, when she was executed by Henry VIII.\n\nHenry married Elizabeth of York with the hope of uniting the Yorkist and Lancastrian sides of the Plantagenet dynastic disputes, and he was largely successful. However, such a level of paranoia persisted that anyone (John de la Pole, Earl of Richmond,<ref>S. B. Chrimes, p. 72.</ref> for example) with blood ties to the Plantagenets was suspected of coveting the throne.<ref>Penn 2011, pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\n===Economics===\n[[File:Henry VII groat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Groat (coin)|Groat]] of Henry VII]]\n\nFor most of Henry VII's reign [[Edward Story]] was [[Bishop of Chichester]]. Story's register still exists and, according to the 19th-century historian W.R.W. Stephens, \"affords some illustrations of the avaricious and parsimonious character of the king\". It seems that the king was skillful at extracting money from his subjects on many pretexts, including that of war with France or war with Scotland. The money so extracted added to the king's personal fortune rather than the stated purpose.<ref name=stephens176>Stephens. Memorials of the South Saxon See and Cathedral Church of Chichester. pp. 176\u2013177</ref>\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Henry VII came to the throne without personal experience in estate management or financial administration.<ref>S. B. Chimes, ''Henry VII'' (Yale University Press, 1977) p. 119.</ref> Yet during his reign he became a fiscally prudent monarch who restored the fortunes of an effectively bankrupt [[exchequer]]. Henry VII introduced stability to the financial administration of England by keeping the same financial advisors throughout his reign. For instance, other than the first few months of the reign, [[John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham|Lord Dynham]] and [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey]] were the only two office holders in the position of [[Lord High Treasurer]] of England throughout his reign.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 121</ref>\n\nHenry VII improved tax collection within the realm by introducing ruthlessly efficient mechanisms of taxation. He was supported in this effort by his chancellor, Archbishop [[John Morton (archbishop)|John Morton]], whose \"[[Morton's Fork]]\" was a [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]] method of ensuring that nobles paid increased taxes. Morton's Fork may actually have been invented by another of Henry's supporters, [[Richard Foxe]].<ref name=\"B. Chrimes, p. 203\">S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 203.</ref> However, whether it is called \"Morton's Fork\" or \"Fox's Fork\", the result was the same: Those nobles who spent little must have saved much and, thus, they could afford the increased taxes; on the other hand, those nobles who spent much obviously had the means to pay the increased taxes.<ref name=\"B. Chrimes, p. 203\"/> Royal government was also reformed with the introduction of the [[King's Council]] that kept the nobility in check.  Henry VIII executed [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]], his two most hated tax collectors, on trumped-up charges of treason.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kathy Elgin|title=Henry VIII: The Charismatic King who Reforged a Nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA8EAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT55|year=2013|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|page=55}}</ref>\n\nHe established the [[pound (mass)|pound]] [[avoirdupois]] as a standard of weight; it became part of the [[Imperial units|Imperial]]<ref name=sizes>{{cite web \n<!-- There are other sources which might be cited, but this one sums up the history and confusion over what a pound means very well indeed, so prefer linking it to available government documents or books.

Up to a point, he succeeded. He was not a military man and had no interest in trying to regain French territories lost during the reigns of his predecessors; he was therefore ready to conclude a treaty with France at Etaples that brought money into the coffers of England, and ensured the French would not support pretenders to the English throne, such as Perkin Warbeck. However, this treaty came at a slight price, as Henry mounted a minor invasion of Brittany in November 1492. Henry decided to keep Brittany out of French hands, signed an alliance with Spain to that end, and sent 6,000 troops to France.{{sfn|Mackie|1952|p=97}} The confused, fractious nature of Breton politics undermined his efforts, which finally failed after three sizeable expeditions, at a cost of \u00a324,000. However, as France was becoming more concerned with the Italian Wars, the French were happy to agree to the [[Treaty of Etaples]].<ref>John M. Currin, \"'The King's Army into the Partes of Bretaigne': Henry VII and the Breton Wars, 1489\u20131491,\" ''War in History,'' Nov 2000, Vol. 7 Issue 4, p379-412</ref> Henry had pressured the French by [[Siege of Boulogne (1492)|laying siege to Boulogne]] in October 1492. \n[[File:EmpsonHenryDudley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry VII (centre), with his advisors [[Richard Empson|Sir Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley|Sir Edmund Dudley]]]]\n\nHenry had been under the financial and physical protection of the French throne or its vassals for most of his life, prior to his ascending the throne of England. To strengthen his position, however, he subsidised shipbuilding, so strengthening the [[The Tudors and the Royal Navy|navy]] (he commissioned Europe's first ever \u2013 and the world's oldest surviving \u2013 [[dry dock]] at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] in 1495) and improving trading opportunities.\n\nHenry VII was one of the first European monarchs to recognise the importance of the newly united Spanish kingdom and concluded the [[Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489)|Treaty of Medina del Campo]], by which his son, [[Arthur Tudor]], was married to [[Catherine of Aragon]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=103}} He also concluded the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] with Scotland (the first treaty between England and Scotland for almost two centuries), which betrothed his daughter Margaret to King James IV of Scotland. By means of this marriage, Henry VII hoped to break the [[Auld Alliance]] between Scotland and France. Though this was not achieved during his reign, the marriage eventually led to the union of the English and Scottish crowns under Margaret's great-grandson, [[James I of England|James VI and I]] following the death of Henry's granddaughter [[Elizabeth I]].\n\nHe also formed an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] (1493\u20131519) and persuaded [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to issue a [[papal bull]] of [[excommunication]] against all pretenders to Henry's throne.\n\n===Trade agreements===\n\nHenry VII was much enriched by trading [[alum]], which was used in the wool and cloth trades for use as a [[chemical]] [[dye fixative]] when [[dye]]ing [[fabric]]s.<ref>Penn 2011, p. 201</ref> Since alum was mined in only one area in Europe (Tolfa, Italy), it was a scarce commodity and therefore especially valuable to its land holder, the pope. With the English economy heavily invested in wool production, Henry VII became involved in the alum trade in 1486. With the assistance of the Italian merchant-banker, Lodovico della Fava and the Italian banker, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Henry VII became deeply involved in the trade by licensing ships, obtaining alum from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and selling it to the Low Countries and in England.<ref>Penn 2011, pp. 203\u2013204.</ref> This trade made an expensive commodity cheaper, which raised opposition from [[Pope Julius II]] since the Tolfa mine was a part of papal territory and had given the Pope monopoly control over alum.\n \nHenry's most successful diplomatic achievement as regards the economy was the ''[[Magnus Intercursus]]'' (\"great agreement\") of 1496. In 1494, Henry embargoed trade (mainly in wool) with the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]] as retaliation for Margaret of Burgundy's support of Perkin Warbeck. The [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Merchant Adventurers]], the company which enjoyed the monopoly of the Flemish wool trade, relocated from [[Antwerp]] to [[Calais]]. At the same time, Flemish merchants were ejected from England. The stand-off eventually paid off for Henry. Both parties realised they were mutually disadvantaged by the reduction in commerce. Its restoration by the ''Magnus Intercursus'' was very much to England's benefit in removing taxation for English merchants and significantly increasing England's wealth. In turn, Antwerp became an extremely important trade [[entrep\u00f4t]] (transshipment port), through which, for example, goods from the Baltic, spices from the east and Italian silks were exchanged for English cloth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |pages=167\u2013168}}</ref>\n\nIn 1506, Henry extorted the Treaty of Windsor from [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome of Burgundy]]. Philip had been shipwrecked on the English coast, and while Henry's guest, was bullied into an agreement so favourable to England at the expense of the Netherlands that it was dubbed the ''Malus Intercursus'' (\"evil agreement\"). France, [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundy]], the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and the [[Hanseatic League]] all rejected the treaty, which was never in force. Philip died shortly after the negotiations.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |pages=198\u2013201 }}</ref>\n\n===Law enforcement and Justices of Peace===\nHenry's principal problem was to restore royal authority in a realm recovering from the Wars of the Roses. There were too many powerful noblemen and, as a consequence of the system of so-called [[bastard feudalism]], each had what amounted to private armies of indentured retainers ([[mercenary|mercenaries]] masquerading as servants).\n[[File:King Henry VII from NPG.jpg|thumb|left|Late 16th-century copy of a portrait of Henry VII]]\n\nHe was content to allow the nobles their regional influence if they were loyal to him. For instance, the Stanley family had control of Lancashire and Cheshire, upholding the peace on the condition that they stayed within the law. In other cases, he brought his over-powerful subjects to heel by decree. He passed laws against \"livery\" (the upper classes' flaunting of their adherents by giving them badges and emblems) and \"maintenance\" (the keeping of too many male \"servants\"). These laws were used shrewdly in levying fines upon those that he perceived as threats.\n\nHowever, his principal weapon was the [[Court of Star Chamber]]. This revived an earlier practice of using a small (and trusted) group of the [[Privy Council]] as a personal or Prerogative Court, able to cut through the cumbersome legal system and act swiftly. Serious disputes involving the use of personal power, or threats to royal authority, were thus dealt with.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=178 }}</ref>\n\nHenry VII used [[Justices of the Peace]] on a large, nationwide scale. They were appointed for every shire and served for a year at a time. Their chief task was to see that the laws of the country were obeyed in their area. Their powers and numbers steadily increased during the time of the Tudors, never more so than under Henry's reign.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = MacCulloch | first = Diarmaid | year = 1996 |title = The Consolidation of England 1485\u20131603 | journal = The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain | pages=39\u201342}}</ref> Despite this, Henry was keen to constrain their power and influence, applying the same principles to the Justices of the Peace as he did to the nobility: a similar system of bonds and recognisances to that which applied to both the gentry and the nobles who tried to exert their elevated influence over these local officials.\n\nAll Acts of Parliament were overseen by the Justices of the Peace. For example, Justices of the Peace could replace suspect jurors in accordance with the 1495 act preventing the corruption of juries. They were also in charge of various administrative duties, such as the checking of weights and measures.\n\nBy 1509, Justices of the Peace were key enforcers of law and order for Henry VII. They were unpaid, which, in comparison with modern standards, meant a lesser tax bill to pay for a police force. Local gentry saw the office as one of local influence and prestige and were therefore willing to serve. Overall, this was a successful area of policy for Henry, both in terms of efficiency and as a method of reducing the corruption endemic within the nobility of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Later years and death===\n[[File:HenryVIIdeathbed.jpg|thumb|Scene at deathbed of Henry VII at Richmond Palace (1509) drawn contemporaneously from witness accounts by the courtier Sir Thomas Wriothesley (d.1534) who wrote an account of the proceedings BL Add.MS 45131, f.54]]\n\n[[File:WLA vanda Henry VII bust.jpg|thumb|Posthumous portrait bust by [[Pietro Torrigiano]] made using Henry's [[death mask]]]]\nIn 1502, Henry VII's first son and heir apparent, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], died suddenly at [[Ludlow Castle]], very likely from a viral respiratory illness known at the time as the \"[[English sweating sickness]]\".<ref>Penn 2011, p. 70.</ref> This made Henry, Duke of York ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) heir apparent to the throne. The King, normally a reserved man who rarely showed much emotion in public unless angry, surprised his courtiers by his intense grief and sobbing at his son's death, while his concern for the Queen is evidence that the marriage was a happy one, as is his reaction to the Queen's death the following year, when he shut himself away for several days, refusing to speak to anyone.<ref>Chrimes  ''Henry VII''  pp. 302\u20134</ref>\n\nHenry VII wanted to maintain the Spanish alliance. He therefore arranged a [[papal dispensation]] from [[Pope Julius II]] for Prince Henry to marry his brother's widow Catherine, a relationship that would have otherwise precluded marriage in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1503, Queen Elizabeth died in childbirth, so King Henry had the dispensation also permit him to marry Catherine himself. After obtaining the dispensation, Henry had second thoughts about the marriage of his son and Catherine. Catherine's mother [[Isabella I of Castile]] had died and Catherine's sister [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] had succeeded her; Catherine was therefore daughter of only one reigning monarch and so less desirable as a spouse for Henry VII's heir-apparent. The marriage did not take place during his lifetime. Otherwise, at the time of his father's arranging of the marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the future Henry VIII was too young to contract the marriage according to Canon Law, and would be ineligible until age fourteen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Penn|first1=Thomas|title=Winter King: Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England|date=March 12, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439191576|pages=204|edition=Reprint}}</ref>\n\nHenry made half-hearted plans to remarry and beget more heirs, but these never came to anything. In 1505 he was sufficiently interested in a potential marriage to [[Joan of Naples (1478-1518)|Joan]], the recently widowed Queen of Naples, that he sent ambassadors to Naples to report on the 27-year-old's physical suitability.<ref>Schwarz, Arthur L., [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1605830178 ''VIVAT REX! An Exhibition Commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the Accession of Henry VIII''] (The Grolier Club, 2009), p. 58 \"''Henry's Father Searches for a New Wife''\".</ref> The wedding never took place, and the physical description Henry sent with his ambassadors of what he desired in a new wife matched the description of [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]]. After 1503, records show the [[Tower of London]] was never again used as a royal residence by Henry Tudor, and all royal births under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took place in palaces. Henry VII was shattered by the loss of Elizabeth, and her death broke his heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://authorherstorianparent.blogspot.com/2011/11/henry-viis-half-hearted-attempts-to-woo.html|title=his story, her story|author=Amy Licence|work=authorherstorianparent.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBEPoST7-ooC&pg=PT52&lpg=PT52&dq=henry+vii+shattered+by+death&source=bl&ots=JuUI5CBqo-&sig=D9RmFZUPf3O4d5i96kD_Ehn3Izo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OEciVNrSLJSwyATWnIDgDQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=henry%20vii%20shattered%20by%20death&f=false|title=A Short History of Early Modern England|work=google.com}}</ref> During his lifetime the nobility often jeered him for re-centralizing power in London, and later the 16th-century historian [[Francis Bacon]] was ruthlessly critical of the methods by which he enforced tax law, but it is equally true that Henry Tudor was hellbent on keeping detailed records of his personal finances, down to the last halfpenny;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20hvii%20policy.htm|title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII|publisher=}}</ref> these and one account book detailing the expenses of his queen survive in the British National Archives. Until the death of his wife, the evidence is clear from these accounting books that Henry Tudor was a more doting father and husband than was widely known. Many of the entries show a man who loosened his purse strings generously for his wife and children, and not just on necessities: in spring 1491 he spent a great amount of gold on his daughter Mary for a lute; the following year he spent money on a lion for Elizabeth's menagerie.\n\nWith Elizabeth's death, the possibility for such family indulgences greatly diminished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queentohistory.com/book-reviews/documentaries/henry-vii-winter-king/|title=Henry VII Winter King|work=Queen to History}}</ref> Immediately afterward, Henry became very sick and nearly died himself, allowing only [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], his mother, near him: \"privily departed to a solitary place, and would that no man should resort unto him.\"<ref>Chrimes  ''Henry VII'' p. 304</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Penn|first1=Thomas|title=Winter King: Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England|date=March 12, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439191576|pages=110\u2013113|edition=Reprint}}</ref>\n \nHenry VII died at [[Richmond Palace]] on 21 April 1509 of [[tuberculosis]] and was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], next to his wife, Elizabeth, in the chapel he commissioned.<ref>S.B.

His mother survived him, dying two months later on 29 June 1509.\n\n==Appearance and character==\nHenry is the first English king of whose appearance good contemporary visual records in realistic portraits exist that are relatively free of idealization. At 27, he was tall, slender, with small blue eyes, which were said to have a noticeable animation of expression, and noticeably bad teeth in a long, sallow face beneath very fair hair. Amiable and high-spirited, Henry was friendly if dignified in manner, and it was clear to everyone that he was extremely intelligent. His biographer, Professor Chrimes, credits him \u2013 even before he had become king \u2013 with \"a high degree of personal magnetism, ability to inspire confidence, and a growing reputation for shrewd decisiveness\". On the debit side, he may have looked a little delicate as he suffered from poor health.<ref>Chrimes, ''Henry VII'' p. 53</ref><ref>Desmond Seward, ''The Wars of the Roses'' pg 318</ref>\n\n==Legacy and memory==\n[[File:Henry VII and Elizabeth of York Common Royal Descent.png|thumb|Common royal descent of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York uniting the houses of Lancaster and York]]\nHistorians have always compared Henry VII with his continental contemporaries, especially Louis XI of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon. By 1600 historians emphasised Henry's wisdom in drawing lessons in statecraft from other monarchs. In 1622 [[Francis Bacon]] published his ''[[History of the Reign of King Henry VII]]''. By 1900 the [[New Monarchs|\"New Monarchy\"]] interpretation stressed the common factors that in each country led to the revival of monarchical power. This approach raised puzzling questions about similarities and differences in the development of national states. In the late 20th century a model of European state formation was prominent in which Henry less resembles Louis and Ferdinand.<ref>Steven Gunn, \"Politic history, New Monarchy and state formation: Henry VII in European perspective,\" ''Historical Research,'' Aug 2009, Vol. 82 Issue 217, pp 380\u2013392</ref>\n\n==Henry's and Elizabeth's children==\n<div class=\"center\" ><gallery>\nFile:Arthur Prince of Wales c 1500.jpg|[[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur Tudor]], [[Prince of Wales]], first husband of [[Catherine of Aragon]]\nFile:Margaret Tudor.jpg|[[Margaret Tudor]], wife of [[James IV of Scotland]] and great-grandmother of [[James VI and I|James I of England]]\nFile:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|[[Henry VIII of England]], Henry VII's successor\nFile:1496 Mary Tudor.jpg|[[Mary Tudor, Queen of France]] and subsequently wife of [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Charles Brandon]]\n</gallery></div>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Arthur, Prince of Wales|Arthur]]||style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"|19 September 1486||2 April 1502|||[[Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] from birth to death\n|-\n|[[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]]||28 November 1489||18 October 1541|||[[Queen consort of Scotland]] as the wife of [[James IV]] and regent for her son [[James V of Scotland|James V]], grandmother of both [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]\n|-\n|[[Henry VIII]]||28 June 1491||28 January 1547||Henry VII's successor as King of England and the first King of Ireland\n|-\n|[[Elizabeth Tudor (1492\u20131495)|Elizabeth]]||2 July 1492||style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"|14 September 1495||Died young\n|-\n|[[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]||18 March 1496||25 June 1533||[[Queen of France]], wife of [[Louis XII]], grandmother of [[Lady Jane Grey]]\n|-\n|style=\"white=space: nowrap;\"|Edward||1498?||1499||Possibly confused with Edmund.<ref>\"Historical Memorials of Westminster Abbey\" by Arthur Penryn Stanley (page 281-282): ''\"His infant daughter Elizabeth, aged three years and two months, was buried, with great pomp, in a small tomb at the feet of Henry III.

Henry was the second [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor monarch]], succeeding his father, [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].\n\nHenry is best known for [[Wives of Henry VIII|his six marriages]], in particular his efforts to have his first marriage, to [[Catherine of Aragon]], annulled. His disagreement with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the [[English Reformation]], separating the [[Church of England]] from papal authority. He appointed himself the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and [[dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved convents and monasteries]], for which he was excommunicated. Henry is also known as \"the father of the [[Royal Navy]]\"; he invested heavily in the Navy, increasing its size greatly from a few to more than 50 ships.\n\nDomestically, Henry is known for his radical changes to the [[History of the Constitution of the United Kingdom|English Constitution]], ushering into England the theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. Besides asserting the sovereign's supremacy over the Church of England, he greatly expanded royal power during his reign. Charges of treason and heresy were commonly used to quell dissent, and those accused were often executed without a formal trial, by means of [[Bill of attainder|bills of attainder]]. He achieved many of his political aims through the work of his chief ministers, some of whom were banished or executed when they fell out of his favour. [[Thomas Wolsey]], [[Thomas More]], [[Thomas Cromwell]], [[Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich|Richard Rich]], and [[Thomas Cranmer]] all figured prominently in Henry's administration. He was an extravagant spender and used the proceeds from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and acts of the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] to convert into royal revenue the money that was formerly paid to Rome. Despite the influx of money from these sources, Henry was continually on the verge of financial ruin due to his personal extravagance as well as his numerous costly and largely unsuccessful continental wars, particularly with [[Francis I of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], as he sought to enforce his [[English claims to the French throne|claim]] to the Kingdom of [[France]]. At home, he oversaw the legal union of [[England and Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]] and following the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]] he was the first English monarch to rule as [[King of Ireland]].\n\nHis contemporaries considered Henry in his prime to be an attractive, educated and accomplished king. He has been described as \"one of the most charismatic rulers to sit on the English throne\".<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|2000|p=41}}.</ref> He was an author and composer. As he aged, Henry became severely obese and his health suffered, contributing to his death in 1547. He is frequently characterised in his later life as a lustful, egotistical, harsh, and insecure king.<ref>{{harvnb|Ives|2006|pp=28\u201336}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Edward VI]].\n\n== Early years ==\n[[File:Vaux Passional (f.9).

He was subsequently appointed [[Earl Marshal]] of England and [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] at age three, and was inducted into the [[Order of the Bath]] soon after. The day after the ceremony he was created [[Duke of York]] and a month or so later made [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Warden of the Scottish Marches]]. In May 1495, he was appointed to the [[Order of the Garter]]. The reason for all the appointments to a small child was so his father could keep personal control of lucrative positions and not share them with established families.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> Henry was given a first-rate education from leading tutors, becoming fluent in Latin and French, and learning at least some Italian.<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1966|p=24}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=14\u201315}}</ref> Not much is known about his early life \u2013 save for his appointments \u2013 because he was not expected to become king.<ref name=\"scarisbrick3\" /> In November 1501, Henry also played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], the youngest surviving child of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=4}}</ref> As Duke of York, Henry used the arms of his father as king, differenced by a ''label of three points ermine''. He was further honoured, on 9 February 1506, by [[Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]] who made him a [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Knight of the Golden Fleece]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Complete Peerage, Volume III|year=1912|last=Gibbs (editor)|first=Vicary|page=443|publisher=St Catherine's Press}}Under Duke of Cornwall, which was his title when he succeeded his brother as Prince of Wales.</ref>\n\nIn 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, possibly of [[sweating sickness]],<ref>{{harvnb|Maloney|2015|page=96}}</ref> just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\">{{harvnb|Crofton|2006|p=126}}</ref> Arthur's death thrust all his duties upon his younger brother, the 10-year-old Henry. After a little debate, Henry became the new [[Duke of Cornwall]] in October 1502, and the new [[Prince of Wales]] and Earl of Chester in February 1503.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Henry VII gave the boy few tasks. Young Henry was strictly supervised and did not appear in public. As a result, he ascended the throne \"untrained in the exacting art of kingship\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=6}}</ref>\n\nHenry VII renewed his efforts to seal a marital alliance between England and Spain, by offering his second son in marriage to Arthur's widow Catherine.<ref name=\"crofton126\" /> Both Isabella and Henry VII were keen on the idea, which had arisen very shortly after Arthur's death.<ref name=\"loades22\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=22}}</ref> On 23 June 1503, a treaty was signed for their marriage, and they were betrothed two days later.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=8}}</ref> A papal dispensation was only needed for the \"impediment of public honesty\" if the marriage had not been [[consummated]] as Catherine and her [[duenna]] claimed, but Henry VII and the Spanish ambassador set out instead to obtain a dispensation for \"affinity\", which took account of the possibility of consummation.<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /> Cohabitation was not possible because Henry was too young.<ref name=\"loades22\" /> Isabella's death in 1504, and the ensuing problems of succession in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], complicated matters. Her father preferred her to stay in England, but Henry VII's relations with Ferdinand had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=22\u201323}}.</ref> Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry's rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. Ferdinand's solution was to make his daughter ambassador, allowing her to stay in England indefinitely. Devout, she began to believe that it was God's will that she marry the prince despite his opposition.<ref name=\"Loades2009\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=23}}</ref>\n\n== Early reign ==\n[[File:HenryVIII 1509.jpg|thumb|upright|Eighteen-year-old Henry VIII after his [[coronation]] in 1509]]\nHenry VII died on 21 April 1509, and the 17-year-old Henry succeeded him as king. Soon after his father's burial on 10 May, Henry suddenly declared that he would indeed marry Catherine, leaving unresolved several issues concerning the papal dispensation and a missing part of the [[marriage portion]].<ref name=\"scarisbrick8\" /><ref name=\"loades24\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=24}}</ref> The new king maintained that it had been his father's dying wish that he marry Catherine.<ref name=\"Loades2009\" /> Whether or not this was true, it was certainly convenient. Emperor Maximilian I had been attempting to marry his granddaughter (and Catherine's niece) [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to Henry; she had now been jilted.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=12}}</ref> Henry's wedding to Catherine was kept low-key and was held at the friar's church in Greenwich on 11 June 1509.<ref name=\"loades24\" /> On 23 June 1509, Henry led the now 23-year-old Catherine from the [[Tower of London]] to [[Westminster Abbey]] for their coronation, which took place the following day.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> It was a grand affair: the king's passage was lined with tapestries and laid with fine cloth.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1819\" /> Following the ceremony, there was a grand banquet in [[Westminster Hall]].<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=19}}</ref> As Catherine wrote to her father, \"our time is spent in continuous festival\".<ref name=\"loades24\" />\n\nTwo days after his coronation, Henry arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]. They were charged with [[high treason]] and were executed in 1510. Politically-motivated executions would remain one of Henry's primary tactics for dealing with those who stood in his way.<ref name=\"Crofton2006\" /> Henry also returned to the public some of the money supposedly extorted by the two ministers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1904|p=17}}</ref> By contrast, Henry's view of the [[House of York]] \u2013 potential rival claimants for the throne \u2013 was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the [[Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset|Marquess of Dorset]], were pardoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=304&nbdash;306}}</ref> Others (most notably [[Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk|Edmund de la Pole]]) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother [[Richard de la Pole|Richard]] siding against the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, Catherine conceived, but the child, a girl, was [[stillborn]] on 31 January 1510. About four months later, Catherine again became pregnant.<ref name=\"loades26\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=26}}</ref> On New Year's Day 1511, the child \u2013 [[Henry, Duke of Cornwall|Henry]] \u2013 was born. After the grief of losing their first child, the couple were pleased to have a boy and festivities were held,<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=18}}</ref> including a two-day [[joust]] known as the [[The 1511 Westminster Tournament Roll|Westminster Tournament]]. However, the child died seven weeks later.<ref name=\"loades26\" /> Catherine had two stillborn sons in 1514 and 1515, but gave birth in February 1516 to a girl, [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. Relations between Henry and Catherine had been strained, but they eased slightly after Mary's birth.<ref name=\"loades4849\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=48\u201349}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Henry's marriage to Catherine has since been described as \"unusually good\",<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=103}}</ref> it is known that Henry took mistresses. It was revealed in 1510 that Henry had been conducting an affair with one of the sisters of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], either Elizabeth or [[Anne Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hart|2009|p=27}}</ref> The most significant mistress for about three years, starting in 1516, was [[Elizabeth Blount]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount is one of only two completely undisputed mistresses, few for a virile young king.<ref name=\"Fraser1994\">{{harvnb|Fraser|1994|p=220}}</ref><ref name=\"loades4748\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=47\u201348}}</ref> Exactly how many Henry had is disputed: [[David Loades]] believes Henry had mistresses \"only to a very limited extent\",<ref name=\"loades4748\" /> whilst [[Alison Weir]] believes there were numerous other affairs.<ref name=\"Weir\">{{harvnb|Weir|1991|pp=122\u20133}}</ref> Catherine did not protest, and in 1518 fell pregnant again with another girl, who was also stillborn.<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> Blount gave birth in June 1519 to Henry's illegitimate son, [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Henry FitzRoy]].<ref name=\"loades4849\" /> The young boy was made Duke of Richmond in June 1525 in what some thought was one step on the path to his eventual legitimisation.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=98,&nbsp;104}}</ref> In 1533, FitzRoy married [[Mary FitzRoy, Duchess of Richmond and Somerset|Mary Howard]], but died childless three years later.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=255}}</ref> At the time of Richmond's death in June 1536, Parliament was enacting the [[Second Succession Act]], which could have allowed him to become king.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=255,&nbsp;271}}</ref>\n\n== France and the Habsburgs ==\n[[File:British - Field of the Cloth of Gold - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|The meeting of Francis I and Henry VIII at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] in 1520]]\n\nIn 1510, [[Kingdom of France|France]], with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the [[League of Cambrai]], was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with [[Louis XII of France]], an issue that divided his council. Certainly war with the combined might of the two powers would have been exceedingly difficult.<ref name=\"Loades27\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=27}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, however, Henry also signed a pact with Ferdinand. After [[Pope Julius II]] created the anti-French [[League of Cambrai#Holy League|Holy League]] in October 1511,<ref name=\"Loades27\" /> Henry followed Ferdinand's lead and brought England into the new League. An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover [[Aquitaine]] for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=27\u201328}}</ref> The attack, however, following a formal declaration of war in April 1512, was not led by Henry personally<ref name=\"Scarisbrick2831\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=28\u201331}}</ref> and was a considerable failure; Ferdinand used it simply to further his own ends, and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick2831\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=30\u201332}}</ref> Henry then pulled off a diplomatic coup by convincing the Emperor to join the Holy League.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=62}}</ref> Remarkably, Henry had also secured the promised title of \"[[Most Christian King]] of France\" from Julius and possibly coronation by the Pope himself in Paris, if only Louis could be defeated.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=33\u201334}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry VIII with Charles Quint and Pope Leon X circa 1520.jpg|thumb|left|Henry with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (right) and [[Pope Leo X]] (centre), c. 1520]]\n\nOn 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and his troops defeated a French army at the [[Battle of the Spurs]] \u2013 a relatively minor result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took [[Th\u00e9rouanne]] and handed it over to Maximillian; [[Tournai]], a more significant settlement, followed.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=62\u201363}}</ref> Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=35\u201336}}</ref> His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, [[James IV of Scotland]], to invade England at the behest of Louis.<ref>{{harvnb|Guicciardini|1968|p=280}}</ref> Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the [[Battle of Flodden]] on 9 September 1513.<ref name=\"loades63\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=63}}</ref> Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war.<ref name=\"loades63\" /> These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=65\u201366}}</ref> With the replacement of Julius by [[Pope Leo X]], who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ascended the thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire following the deaths of his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=67\u201368}}</ref> leaving three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate. The careful diplomacy of [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Thomas Wolsey]] had resulted in the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]] in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe in the wake of a new Ottoman threat, and it seemed that peace might be secured.<ref name=\"loades6869\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]] near [[Calais]] for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable.<ref name=\"loades6869\" /> Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles.

Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to [[Leviticus]] 20:21,<ref group=\"nb\">Although Henry would have read the verse in its Latin (vulgate) form, the translation used in the 1604 King James Bible is instructive: \"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless\".</ref> an [[Affinity (canon law)|impediment]] Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with.

He had such a reputation for integrity that his endorsement would have engendered huge support for the annulment among Parliament and the people, who loved Catherine. More's silence so angered Henry that he tried to force his hand by having him imprisoned and tried. The perfidy of the king's secretary, Thomas Cromwell, however, and the perjury of a petty bureaucrat, Richard Rich, brought about More's conviction and execution for treason in 1535.

The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the submissive role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a [[false pregnancy]] or [[miscarriage]] in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1971|p=138}}</ref> Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with [[Margaret and Mary Shelton|Margaret (\"Madge\") Shelton]] in 1535, although historian [[Antonia Fraser]] argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister [[Mary Shelton]].<ref name=\"Fraser1994\" />\n\nOpposition to Henry's religious policies was quickly suppressed in England.

Fisher openly rejected Henry as the Supreme Head of the Church, but More was careful to avoid openly breaking the Treason Act, which (unlike later acts) did not forbid mere silence. Both men were subsequently convicted of high treason, however \u2013 More on the evidence of a single conversation with [[Richard Rich]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]].

Henry called for public displays of joy regarding Catherine's death. The queen was pregnant again, and she was aware of the consequences if she failed to give birth to a son.  Later that month, the King was unhorsed in a tournament and was badly injured and it seemed for a time that his life was in danger. When news of this accident reached the queen, she was sent into shock and miscarried a male child that was about 15 weeks old, on the day of Catherine's funeral, 29 January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=348}}</ref> For most observers, this personal loss was the beginning of the end of the royal marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1971|p=141}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Boleyn family still held important positions on the Privy Council, Anne had many enemies, including the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]].

As a consequence, the king was excommunicated by Pope Paul III on 17 December of the same year.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick361\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|p=361}}</ref> In 1540, Henry sanctioned the complete destruction of shrines to saints. In 1542, England's remaining monasteries were all dissolved, and their property transferred to the Crown. [[Abbot]]s and [[prior]]s lost their seats in the [[House of Lords]]; only archbishops and bishops remained. Consequently, the [[Lords Spiritual]]\u2014as members of the clergy with seats in the House of Lords were known\u2014were for the first time outnumbered by the [[Lords Temporal]].\n\n== Second invasion of France and the \"Rough Wooing\" of Scotland ==\n{{Main|Rough Wooing}}\nThe 1539 alliance between Francis and Charles had soured, eventually degenerating into renewed war. With Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn dead, relations between Charles and Henry improved considerably, and Henry concluded a secret alliance with the Emperor and decided to enter the [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|Italian War]] in favour of his new ally. An invasion of France was planned for 1543.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=75}}</ref> In preparation for it, Henry moved to eliminate the potential threat of Scotland under the youthful [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. The Scots were defeated at [[Battle of Solway Moss]] on 24 November 1542,<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=75\u201376}}</ref> and James died on 15 December. Henry now hoped to unite the crowns of England and Scotland by marrying his son Edward to James' successor, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]]. The Scottish Regent [[James Hamilton, Duke of Ch\u00e2tellerault|Lord Arran]] agreed to the marriage in the [[Treaty of Greenwich]] on 1 July 1543, but it was rejected by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] on 11 December. The result was eight years of war between England and Scotland, a campaign later dubbed \"the [[Rough Wooing]]\". Despite several peace treaties, unrest continued in Scotland until Henry's death.<ref name=\"Elton1977b\" /><ref name=\"Loades79\" /><ref>Neil Murphy,  \"Violence, Colonization and Henry VIII\u2019s Conquest of France, 1544\u20131546.\" ''Past and Present'' 233#1 (2016): 13-51.</ref>\n\nDespite the early success with Scotland, Henry hesitated to invade France, annoying Charles. Henry finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil]]. The other, under Suffolk, [[Sieges of Boulogne (1544\u20131546)#First siege|laid siege to Boulogne]].

Out of money, France and England signed the [[Treaty of Ardres|Treaty of Camp]] on 7 June 1546. Henry secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (\u00a3750,000).

He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from [[gout]]. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced to the jousting accident in 1536 in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The chronic wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's [[mood swing]]s, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality and temperament.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-jousting-accident-that-turned-henry-viii-into-a-tyrant-1670421.html |title=The jousting accident that turned Henry VIII into a tyrant |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"discovery\">{{cite news | url = http://news.discovery.com/history/henry-viii-blood-disorder-110311.html | title = King Henry VIII's Madness Explained | last = Sohn | first = Emily |date = 11 March 2011 | publisher=discovery.com | accessdate =25 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe theory that Henry suffered from [[syphilis]] has been dismissed by most historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Hays|2010|p=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Gareth|title=Young and Damned and Fair|year=2016}} p. 130</ref> Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to [[scurvy]], which is caused by a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-30/news/mn-1456_1_henry-viii |title=Names in the News: Henry VIII Termed Victim of Scurvy |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=30 August 1989}}</ref> Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been [[Kell antigen system|Kell positive]] and suffered from [[McLeod syndrome]].<ref name=\"discovery\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Whitley|Kramer|2010|p=passim}}</ref> According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of [[traumatic brain injury]] after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity.

Since Edward was then only nine years old, he could not rule directly. Instead, Henry's will designated 16 [[executor]]s to serve on a council of regency until Edward reached the age of 18. The executors chose [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]], Jane Seymour's elder brother, to be [[Lord Protector]] of the Realm. If Edward died childless, the throne was to pass to Mary, Henry VIII's daughter by Catherine of Aragon, and her heirs. If Mary's issue failed, the crown was to go to Elizabeth, Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn, and her heirs. Finally, if Elizabeth's line became extinct, the crown was to be inherited by the descendants of Henry VIII's deceased younger sister, Mary, the Greys. The descendants of Henry's sister Margaret&nbsp;\u2013 the Stuarts, rulers of Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 were thereby excluded from the succession.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=332\u2013333}}</ref> This final provision failed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became King of England in 1603.\n\n== Public image ==\n[[File:Pastime.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sheet music|Musical score]] of \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\", c. 1513, composed by Henry.]]\nHenry cultivated the image of a [[Renaissance man]], and his court was a centre of scholarly and artistic innovation and glamorous excess, epitomised by the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. He scouted the country for choirboys, taking some directly from Wolsey's choir, and introduced Renaissance music into court. Musicians included [[Benedict de Opitiis]], [[Richard Sampson]], [[Ambrose Lupo]], and Venetian organist [[Dionisio Memo]].<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" />\n\nHenry himself kept a considerable collection of instruments; he was skilled on the [[lute]], could play the organ, and was a talented player of the [[virginals]].<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\">{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1997|pp=15\u201316}}</ref> He could also [[sight read]] music and sing well.<ref name=\"scarisbrick1516\" /> He was an accomplished musician, author, and poet; his best known piece of music is \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\" (\"The Kynges Ballade\").

He was known for his strong defence of conventional Christian piety.<ref name=\"Crofton2006a\" /> The King was involved in the original construction and improvement of several significant buildings, including [[Nonsuch Palace]], [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]] and Westminster Abbey in London. Many of the existing buildings Henry improved were properties confiscated from Wolsey, such as [[Christ Church, Oxford]]; [[Hampton Court Palace]]; the [[Palace of Whitehall]]; and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nHenry was an intellectual. The first English king with a modern humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was thoroughly at home in his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the public support for the reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's ''Oratio'' (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Chibi|1997|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref> At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith.<ref>{{harvnb|Betteridge|2005|pp=91\u2013109}}</ref> Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.<ref name=\"hibbert\" />\n\nA large well-built athlete (over {{convert|6|ft|m|disp=sqbr}} tall and strong and broad in proportion), Henry excelled at jousting and hunting. More than pastimes, they were political devices that served multiple goals, from enhancing his athletic royal image to impressing foreign emissaries and rulers, to conveying Henry's ability to suppress any rebellion. Thus he arranged a jousting tournament at Greenwich in 1517, where he wore gilded armour, gilded horse trappings, and outfits of velvet, satin and cloth of gold dripping with pearls and jewels. It suitably impressed foreign ambassadors, one of whom wrote home that, \"The wealth and civilisation of the world are here, and those who call the English barbarians appear to me to render themselves such\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hutchinson|2012|p=202}}</ref> Henry finally retired from jousting in 1536 after a heavy fall from his horse left him unconscious for two hours, but he continued to sponsor two lavish tournaments a year. He then started adding weight and lost the trim, athletic figure that had made him so handsome; Henry's courtiers began dressing in heavily padded clothes to emulate \u2013 and flatter \u2013 their increasingly stout monarch. Towards the end of his reign his health rapidly declined.<ref>{{harvnb|Gunn|1991|pp=543\u2013560}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Williams|2005|pp=41\u201359}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lipscomb|2009|p = }}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]]]]\nThe power of Tudor monarchs, including Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, [[Divine right of kings|by the grace of God]] alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Guy|1997|p=78}}</ref> The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the [[royal prerogative]].

This fortune was estimated to \u00a31,250,000 (\u00a3375&nbsp;million by today's standards).<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=13}}</ref> By comparison, however, the reign of Henry was a near-disaster in financial terms.

Henry hung 2,000 tapestries in his palaces; by comparison, James V of Scotland [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|hung just 200]].<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|2005|pp=79\u201380}} citing {{harvnb|Thurley|1993|pp=222\u2013224}}</ref> Henry took pride in showing off his collection of weapons, which included exotic archery equipment, 2,250 pieces of land ordnance and 6,500 [[Handgun#Single-shot pistols|handguns]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2005|pp=11\u201329}}</ref> Tudor monarchs had to fund all the expenses of government out of their own income. This income came from the Crown lands that Henry owned as well as from customs duties like [[tonnage and poundage]], granted by parliament to the king for life. During Henry's reign the revenues of the Crown remained constant (around \u00a3100,000),<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=64}}</ref> but were eroded by inflation and rising prices brought about by war. Indeed, war and Henry's dynastic ambitions in Europe exhausted the surplus he had inherited from his father by the mid-1520s.\n\nWhereas Henry VII had not involved Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII had to turn to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, and as a result the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth \u00a3120,000 (\u00a336&nbsp;million) a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Weir|2002|p=393}}</ref> The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country.

Pollard]] has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.<ref>{{harvnb|Pollard|1905|pp=230\u2013238}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, between 1532 and 1537, Henry instituted a number of statutes that dealt with the relationship between king and pope and hence the structure of the nascent [[Church of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=missing}}</ref> These included the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] (passed 1533), which extended the charge of ''[[praemunire]]'' against all who introduced papal bulls into England, potentially exposing them to the death penalty if found guilty.<ref name=\"bernard71\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=71}}</ref> Other acts included the [[Supplication against the Ordinaries]] and the [[Submission of the Clergy]], which recognised Royal Supremacy over the church. The [[Ecclesiastical Appointments Act 1534]] required the clergy to elect bishops nominated by the Sovereign. The [[Act of Supremacy]] in 1534 declared that the King was \"the only Supreme Head on Earth of the Church of England\" and the [[Treasons Act 1534]] made it high treason, punishable by death, to refuse the [[Oath of Supremacy]] acknowledging the King as such. Similarly, following the passage of the Act of Succession 1533, all adults in the Kingdom were required to acknowledge the Act's provisions (declaring Henry's marriage to Anne legitimate and his marriage to Catherine illegitimate) by oath;<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=185}}</ref> those who refused were subject to imprisonment for life, and any publisher or printer of any literature alleging that the marriage to Anne was invalid subject to the death penalty.<ref name=\"bernard2005\">{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Finally, the [[Act Concerning Peter's Pence and Dispensations|Peter's Pence Act]] was passed, and it reiterated that England had \"no superior under God, but only your [[His Grace|Grace]]\" and that Henry's \"imperial crown\" had been diminished by \"the unreasonable and uncharitable usurpations and exactions\" of the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Lehmberg|1970|p=missing}}</ref> The King had much support from the Church under Cranmer.<ref>{{harvnb|Bernard|2005|p=195}}</ref>\n\nHenry, to Thomas Cromwell's annoyance, insisted on parliamentary time to discuss questions of faith, which he achieved through the Duke of Norfolk. This led to the passing of the [[Act of Six Articles]], whereby six major questions were all answered by asserting the religious orthodoxy, thus restraining the reform movement in England.<ref name=\"elton289\" /> It was followed by the beginnings of a reformed [[liturgy]] and of the [[Book of Common Prayer]], which would take until 1549 to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=291}}</ref> The victory won by religious conservatives did not convert into much change in personnel, however, and Cranmer remained in his position.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=297}}</ref> Overall, the rest of Henry's reign saw a subtle movement away from religious orthodoxy, helped in part by the deaths of prominent figures from before the break with Rome, especially the executions of Thomas More and John Fisher in 1535 for refusing to renounce papal authority. Henry established a new political theology of obedience to the crown that was continued for the next decade. It reflected [[Martin Luther]]'s new interpretation of the [[Ten commandments#Catholic and Lutheran Christianity|fourth commandment]] (\"Honour thy father and mother\"), brought to England by [[William Tyndale]]. The founding of royal authority on the [[Ten Commandments]] was another important shift: reformers within the Church used the Commandments' emphasis on faith and the word of God, while conservatives emphasised the need for dedication to God and doing good. The reformers' efforts lay behind the publication of the ''[[Great Bible]]'' in 1539 in English.<ref>{{harvnb|Rex|1996|pp=863\u2013894}}</ref> Protestant Reformers still faced persecution, particularly over objections to Henry's annulment. Many fled abroad, including the influential Tyndale,<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=3177}}</ref> who was eventually executed and his body burned at Henry's behest.\n\nWhen taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown, Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535. The result was an extensive compendium, the ''[[Valor Ecclesiasticus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=232\u2013233}}</ref> In September of the same year, Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions, to be undertaken by four appointee visitors. The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country's religious houses, with largely negative conclusions.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=233}}</ref> In addition to reporting back to Cromwell, the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards. The result was to encourage self-dissolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=233\u2013234}}</ref> In any case, the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state-enforced [[dissolution of the monasteries]] with all religious houses worth less than \u00a3200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=234\u2013235}}</ref> After a short pause, surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners, and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539. By January 1540 no such houses remained: some 800 had been dissolved. The process had been efficient, with minimal resistance, and brought the crown some \u00a390,000 a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=235\u2013236}}</ref> The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=236\u2013237}}</ref> Cromwell's actions transferred a fifth of England's landed wealth to new hands. The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown, which would use the lands much more efficiently.<ref>{{harvnb|St\u00f6ber|2007|p=190}}</ref> Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England's religious houses, they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|p=238}}</ref>\n\nResponse to the reforms was mixed. The religious houses had been the only support of the impoverished,<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=254\u2013256}}</ref> and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536\u20131537, known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{harvnb|Meyer|2010|pp=269\u2013272}}</ref> Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553\u20131558).\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Basire Embarkation of Henry VIII.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Depiction of Henry embarking at [[Dover]], c. 1520]]\n\nApart from permanent garrisons at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], Calais, and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], England's standing army numbered only a few hundred men. This was increased only slightly by Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=32}}</ref> Henry's invasion force of 1513, some 30,000 men, was composed of [[billmen]] and [[longbowmen]], at a time when the other European nations were moving to [[Arquebus|hand guns]] and [[pikemen]]. The difference in capability was at this stage not significant, however, and Henry's forces had new armour and weaponry. They were also supported by battlefield artillery and the [[war wagon]],<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|2001|p=82}}</ref> relatively new innovations, and several large and expensive siege guns.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> The invasion force of 1544 was similarly well-equipped and organised, although command on the battlefield was laid with the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk, which in the case of the latter produced disastrous results at Montreuil.<ref name=\"Elton1977b\" />\n\nHenry's break with Rome incurred the threat of a large-scale French or Spanish invasion.<ref name=\"elton282\">{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=282}}</ref> To guard against this, in 1538, he began to build a chain of expensive, state-of-the-art defences, along Britain's southern and eastern coasts from [[Kent]] to [[Cornwall]], largely built of material gained from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|demolition of the monasteries]].<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=183, 281\u2013283}}</ref> These were known as Henry VIII's [[Device Forts]]. He also strengthened existing coastal defence fortresses such as Dover Castle and, at Dover, Moat Bulwark and Archcliffe Fort, which he personally visited for a few months to supervise.<ref name=\"elton282\" /> Wolsey had many years before conducted the censuses required for an overhaul of the system of [[militia]], but no reform resulted.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pages=87\u201388}}</ref> In 1538\u201339, Cromwell overhauled the [[Muster (military)|shire musters]], but his work mainly served to demonstrate how inadequate they were in organisation.<ref name=\"elton282\" /> The building works, including that at Berwick, along with the reform of the militias and musters, were eventually finished under Queen Mary.<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|page=391}}</ref>\n\nHenry is traditionally cited as one of the founders of the [[Royal Navy]].<ref name=\"loades83\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=82}}</ref> Technologically, Henry invested in large cannon for his warships, an idea that had taken hold in other countries, to replace the smaller [[serpentine (gun)|serpentines]] in use.<ref name=\"loades83\" /> He also flirted with designing ships personally&nbsp;\u2013 although his contribution to larger vessels, if any, is not known, it is believed that he influenced the design of [[rowbarges]] and similar galleys.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=82\u201383}}</ref> Henry was also responsible for the creation of a permanent navy, with the supporting anchorages and dockyards.<ref name=\"loades83\" /> Tactically, Henry's reign saw the Navy move away from boarding tactics to employ gunnery instead.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> The [[Tudor navy]] was enlarged up to fifty ships (the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' was one of them), and Henry was responsible for the establishment of the \"council for marine causes\" to specifically oversee all the maintenance and operation of the Navy, becoming the basis for the later [[Admiralty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\n[[File:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|right|The division of Ireland in 1450]]\nAt the beginning of Henry's reign, Ireland was effectively divided into three zones: [[the Pale]], where English rule was unchallenged; [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]], the so-called \"obedient land\" of Anglo-Irish peers; and the Gaelic [[Connacht|Connaught]] and [[Ulster]], with merely nominal English rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=180}}</ref> Until 1513,  Henry continued the policy of his father, to allow Irish lords to rule in the king's name and accept steep divisions between the communities.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> However, upon the death of the [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare|8th Earl of Kildare]], governor of Ireland, fractious Irish politics combined with a more ambitious Henry to cause trouble. When [[Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond]] died, Henry recognised one successor for Ormond's English, Welsh and Scottish lands, whilst in Ireland another took control. Kildare's successor, the 9th Earl, was replaced as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland by [[Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey]] in 1520.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=183\u2013184}}</ref> Surrey's ambitious aims were costly, but ineffective; English rule became trapped between winning the Irish lords over with diplomacy, as favoured by Henry and Wolsey, and a sweeping military occupation as proposed by Surrey.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=181\u2013185}}</ref> Surrey was recalled in 1521, with [[Piers Butler]] \u2013 one of claimants to the Earldom of Ormond \u2013 appointed in his place. Butler proved unable to control opposition, including that of Kildare. Kildare was appointed chief governor in 1524, resuming his dispute with Butler, which had before been in a lull. Meanwhile, the [[James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond|Earl of Desmond]], an Anglo-Irish peer, had turned his support to Richard de la Pole as pretender to the English throne; when in 1528 Kildare failed to take suitable actions against him, Kildare was once again removed from his post.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=185\u2013186}}</ref>\n\nThe Desmond situation was resolved on his death in 1529, which was followed by a period of uncertainty. This was effectively ended with the appointment of Henry FitzRoy, Duke of Richmond and the king's son, as lord lieutenant. Richmond had never before visited Ireland, his appointment a break with past policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=186\u2013187}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> For a time it looked as if peace might be restored with the return of Kildare to Ireland to manage the tribes, but the effect was limited and the Irish parliament soon rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"loades187\">{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=187}}</ref> Ireland began to receive the attention of Cromwell, who had supporters of Ormond and Desmond promoted. Kildare, on the other hand, was summoned to London; after some hesitation, he departed for London in 1534, where he would face charges of treason.<ref name=\"loades187\" /> His son, [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Thomas, Lord Offaly]] was more forthright, denouncing the king and leading a \"Catholic crusade\" against the king, who was by this time mired in marital problems. Offaly had the Archbishop of Dublin murdered, and besieged Dublin. Offaly led a mixture of Pale gentry and Irish tribes, although he failed to secure the support of [[Lord Darcy]], a sympathiser, or Charles V. What was effectively a civil war was ended with the intervention of 2,000 English troops \u2013 a large army by Irish standards \u2013 and the execution of Offaly (his father was already dead) and his uncles.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=187\u2013189}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=207\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Offaly revolt was followed by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir [[Anthony St Leger (Lord Deputy of Ireland)|Antony St Leger]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], who would remain into the post past Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|p=191}}</ref> Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere [[fiefdom]] to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] free from the Papal [[Lord|overlordship]]. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref> The Irish law of the tribes did not suit such an arrangement, because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.<ref>{{harvnb|Loades|2009|pp=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe complexities and sheer scale of Henry's legacy ensured that, in the words of Betteridge and Freeman, \"throughout the centuries, Henry has been praised and reviled, but he has never been ignored\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" />  Historian J.D. Mackie sums up Henry's personality and its impact on his achievements and popularity:\n\n{{quote|The respect, nay even the popularity, which he had from his people was not unmerited....He kept the development of England in line with some of the most vigorous, though not the noblest forces of the day.  His high courage \u2013 highest when things went ill \u2013 his commanding intellect, his appreciation of fact, and his instinct for rule carried his country through a perilous time of change, and his very arrogance saved his people from the wars which afflicted other lands. Dimly remembering the wars of the Roses, vaguely informed as to the slaughters and sufferings in Europe, the people of England knew that in Henry they had a great king.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.D. Mackie|title=The Earlier Tudors, 1485\u20131558|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPPjvveNsTQC&pg=PA443|year=1952|pages=44\u201343}}</ref>}}\n\nA particular focus of modern historiography has been the extent to which the events of Henry's life (including his marriages, foreign policy and religious changes) were the result of his own initiative and, if they were, whether they were the result of opportunism or of a principled undertaking by Henry.<ref name=\"bandf1\">{{harvnb|Betteridge|Freeman|2012|pp=1\u201319}}</ref> The traditional interpretation of those events was provided by historian [[Albert Pollard|A.F. Pollard]], who in 1902 presented his own, largely positive, view of the king,  lauding him, \"as the king and statesman who, whatever his personal failings, led England down the road to parliamentary democracy and empire\".<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Pollard's interpretation remained the dominant interpretation of Henry's life until the publication of the doctoral thesis of G. R. Elton in 1953.\n\nElton's book on ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'', maintained Pollard's positive interpretation of the Henrician period as a whole, but reinterpreted Henry himself as a follower rather than a leader. For Elton, it was Cromwell and not Henry who undertook the changes in government \u2013 Henry was shrewd, but lacked the vision to follow a complex plan through.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Henry was little more, in other words, than an \"ego-centric monstrosity\" whose reign \"owed its successes and virtues to better and greater men about him; most of its horrors and failures sprang more directly from [the king]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elton|1977|pp=23,332}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the central tenets of Elton's thesis have since been questioned, it has consistently provided the starting point for much later work, including that of [[Jack Scarisbrick|J. J. Scarisbrick]], his student. Scarisbrick largely kept Elton's regard for Cromwell's abilities, but returned agency to Henry, who Scarisbrick considered to have ultimately directed and shaped policy.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> For Scarisbrick, Henry was a formidable, captivating man who \"wore regality with a splendid conviction\".<ref>{{harvnb|Scarisbrick|1968|p=17}}</ref> The effect of endowing Henry with this ability, however, was largely negative in Scarisbrick's eyes: to Scarisbrick the Henrician period was one of upheaval and destruction and those in charge worthy of blame more than praise.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> Even among more recent biographers, including [[David Loades]], [[David Starkey]] and [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]], there has ultimately been little consensus on the extent to which Henry was responsible for the changes he oversaw or the correct assessment of those he did bring about.<ref name=\"bandf1\" />\n\nThis lack of clarity about Henry's control over events has contributed to the variation in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist.<ref name=\"bandf1\" /> One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a \"hulking tyrant\" who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change.<ref name=\"morris19\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Starkey|2008|pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; [[Lacey Baldwin Smith]], for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but deeply held piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1971|p=passim}}</ref>\n\n== Style and arms ==\n{{double image|right|Coat of Arms of Henry VIII of England (1509-1547).svg|180|Coat of Arms of England (1509-1554).svg|180|Henry's armorial during his early reign (left) and later reign (right)}}\nMany changes were made to the royal style during his reign. Henry originally used the style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, [[List of monarchs of England|King of England]], [[English Kings of France|France]] and [[Lord of Ireland]]\". In 1521, pursuant to a grant from Pope Leo X rewarding Henry for his ''Defence of the Seven Sacraments'', the royal style became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, [[Fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]] and Lord of Ireland\". Following Henry's excommunication, [[Pope Paul III]] rescinded the grant of the title \"Defender of the Faith\", but an [[Act of Parliament]] ([[35 Hen 8]] c 3) declared that it remained valid; and it continues in royal usage to the present day. Henry's motto was \"Coeur Loyal\" (\"true heart\"), and he had this embroidered on his clothes in the form of a heart symbol and with the word \"loyal\". His emblem was the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Beaufort portcullis]]. As king, Henry's [[heraldry|arms]] were the same as those used by his predecessors since [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]: ''Quarterly, Azure three [[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lys]] Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England)''.\n\nIn 1535, Henry added the \"supremacy phrase\" to the royal style, which became \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England and France, Defender of the Faith, Lord of Ireland and of the Church of England in Earth Supreme Head\". In 1536, the phrase \"of the Church of England\" changed to \"of the Church of England and also of [[Church of Ireland|Ireland]]\". In 1541, Henry had the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] change the title \"Lord of Ireland\" to \"King of Ireland\" with the [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542]], after being advised that many Irish people regarded the Pope as the true head of their country, with the Lord acting as a mere representative. The reason the Irish regarded the Pope as their overlord was that Ireland had originally been given to King [[Henry II of England]] by [[Pope Adrian IV]] in the 12th century as a feudal territory under papal overlordship. The meeting of Irish Parliament that proclaimed Henry VIII as King of Ireland was the first meeting attended by the Gaelic Irish chieftains as well as the [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrats. The style \"Henry the Eighth, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth Supreme Head\" remained in use until the end of Henry's reign.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| ref=<ref>{{cite book |last=Weir |first=Alison |authorlink=Alison Weir |title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy |publisher=Vintage Books |place=London |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-09-953973-5 |chapter=The Tudors}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| 1 = 1.

When he reached the town of Sarsuti, the residents, who were mostly non-Muslims, fled and were chased by a detachment of Timur's troops, with thousands of them being killed and looted by the troops. From there he travelled to Fatehabad, whose residents fled and a large number of those remaining in the town were massacred. The [[Ahirs]] resisted him at Ahruni but were defeated, with thousands being killed and many being taken prisoners while the town was burnt to ashes. From there he travelled to [[Tohana]], whose [[Jat]] inhabitants were stated to be robbers according to [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]]. They tried to resist but were defeated and fled. Timur's army pursued and killed 200 [[Jats]], while taking many more as prisoners. He then sent a detachment to chase the fleeing [[Jats]] and killed 2,000 of them while their wives and children were enslaved and their property plundered. Harveer Singh Gulia (1376 - 1398) was a [[Jat]]  of the Gulia Clan from the village Badli; district Rohtak in Haryana, India. He was 22 years old when fought war with Timur. He was a strong and brave warrior.  Timur proceeded to Kaithal whose residents were massacred and plundered, destroying all villages along the way. On the next day, he came to [[Assandh]] whose residents were \"[[Zoroastrians|fire-worshippers]]\" according to Yazdi, and had fled to Delhi. Next he travelled to and subdued Tughlaqpur fort and [[Salwan]] before reaching [[Panipat]] whose residents had already fled.

One arrow pierced Timur's hand. Timur was in the army of horsemen. Harveer Singh Gulia charged ahead like a lion, and hit Timur on his chest with a spear, and he was about to fall under his horse, when his commander Khijra, saved him and separated him from the horse.(Timur eventually died from this wound when he reached Samarkhand). The spearmen and swordsmen of the enemy leapt on the Harveer Singh Gulia, and he fainted from the wounds he received and fell. At that very time, the Supreme Commander Jograj  Gujar, with 22,000 Mulls (warriors) attacked the enemy and killed 5000 horsemen. Jograj Gujjar himself with his own hands lifted the unconscious Harveer Singh Gulia and brought him to the camp.

These inter-caste songs are fluid in nature, and never personalized for any specific caste, and they are sung collectively by women from different strata, castes, dialects. These songs do transform fluidly in dialect, style, words, etc. This adoptive style can be seen from the adoption of tunes of Bollywood movie songs into Haryanvi songs.

medicine}}\n[[File:HippocraticOath.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Hippocratic Corpus]]''<br />A collection of early medical works may be associated with [[Hippocrates]]]]\n{{Alternative medicine sidebar|general}}\nThe '''history of medicine''' shows how societies have changed in their approach to illness and disease from ancient times to the present. Early medical traditions include those of [[Babylonian medicine|Babylon]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|China]], [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|Egypt]] and [[Ayurveda|India]]. [[Sushruta|The Indians]] introduced the concepts of [[medical diagnosis]], [[prognosis]], and advanced [[medical ethics]]. The [[Hippocratic Oath]] was written in [[ancient Greece]] in the 5th century BCE, and is a direct inspiration for oaths of office that physicians swear upon entry into the profession today. In the [[Middle Ages]], surgical practices inherited from the ancient masters were improved and then systematized in [[Rogerius (physician)|Rogerius's]] ''The Practice of Surgery''. Universities began systematic training of physicians around 1220 C.E. in Italy.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, understanding of anatomy improved, and the microscope was invented. Prior to the 19th century, [[humorism]] (also known as humoralism) was thought to explain the cause of disease but it was gradually replaced by the [[germ theory of disease]], leading to effective treatments and even cures for many infectious diseases. Military doctors advanced the methods of trauma treatment and surgery.  Public health measures were developed especially in the 19th century as the rapid growth of cities required systematic sanitary measures. Advanced research centers opened in the early 20th century, often connected with major hospitals.  The mid-20th century was characterized by new biological treatments, such as antibiotics. These advancements, along with developments in chemistry, genetics, and [[radiography]] led to [[modern medicine]]. Medicine was heavily professionalized in the 20th century, and new careers opened to women as nurses (from the 1870s) and as physicians (especially after 1970).\n\n== Prehistoric medicine ==\n{{Main|Prehistoric medicine}}\nAlthough there is no record to establish when plants were first used for medicinal purposes ([[herbalist|herbalism]]), the use of plants as healing agents, as well as clays and soils is ancient.  Over time through emulation of the behavior of fauna a medicinal knowledge base developed and passed between generations. As tribal culture specialized specific castes, [[shaman]]s and [[apothecary|apothecaries]] fulfilled the role of healer.<ref>[http://www.apiindia.org/pdf/progress_in_medicine_2017/mu_86.pdf http://www.apiindia.org/pdf/progress_in_medicine_2017/mu_86.pdf]</ref>\nThe first known [[dentistry]] dates to c 7000 BC in [[Baluchistan]] where Neolithic dentists used flint-tipped drills and bowstrings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4882968.stm|title=Stone age man used dentist drill|date=6 April 2006|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The first known [[trepanning]] operation was carried out c 5000 BC in [[Ensisheim]], France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9709/newsbriefs/trepanation.html|title=Neolithic Surgery - Archaeology Magazine Archive|website=archive.archaeology.org}}</ref> A possible [[amputation]] was carried out c 4,900 BC in Buthiers-Bulancourt, France.<ref>[http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/buquet322/ http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/buquet322/]</ref>\n\nEven earlier, Neanderthals may have engaged in medical practices.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spitkins |first1=Penny |last2=el al |title=Calculated or caring?

When removing or renaming this section, please adjust wikilink in that article accordingly.-->\nThe [[Atharvaveda]], a sacred text of [[Hinduism]] dating from the [[Iron Age India|Early Iron Age]], is one of the first Indian text dealing with medicine. The Atharvaveda also contain prescriptions of herbs for various ailments. The use of herbs to treat ailments would later form a large part of [[Ayurveda]].\n\nAyurveda, meaning the \"complete knowledge for long life\" is another medical system of India. Its two most famous texts belong to the schools of [[Charaka]] and [[Sushruta]]. The earliest foundations of Ayurveda were built on a synthesis of traditional herbal practices together with a massive addition of theoretical conceptualizations, new [[nosology|nosologies]] and new therapies dating from about 600 BCE onwards, and coming out of the communities of thinkers who included the [[Buddha]] and others.<ref>Kenneth G. Zysk, ''Asceticism and Healing in Ancient India: Medicine in the Buddhist Monastery,'' Oxford University Press, rev. ed. (1998) {{ISBN|0-19-505956-5}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the compendium of [[Charaka]], the [[Charaka Samhita|Charakasamhit\u0101]], health and disease are not predetermined and life may be prolonged by human effort. The compendium of [[Sushruta|Su\u015bruta]], the [[Sushruta Samhita|Su\u015brutasamhit\u0101]] defines the purpose of medicine to cure the diseases of the sick, protect the healthy, and to prolong life. Both these ancient compendia include details of the examination, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of numerous ailments.  The [[Sushruta Samhita|Su\u015brutasamhit\u0101]] is notable for describing procedures on various forms of [[surgery]], including [[rhinoplasty]], the repair of torn ear lobes, perineal [[lithotomy]], cataract surgery, and several other excisions and other surgical procedures. Most remarkable is Sushruta's penchant for scientific classification:\nHis medical treatise consists of 184 chapters, 1,120 conditions are listed, including injuries and illnesses relating to aging and mental illness.\n\nThe Ayurvedic classics mention eight branches of medicine: k\u0101y\u0101cikits\u0101 ([[internal medicine]]), \u015balyacikits\u0101 (surgery including anatomy), \u015b\u0101l\u0101kyacikits\u0101 (eye, ear, nose, and throat diseases), kaum\u0101rabh\u1e5btya (pediatrics with obstetrics and gynaecology), bh\u016btavidy\u0101 (spirit and psychiatric medicine), agada tantra ([[toxicology]] with treatments of stings and bites), ras\u0101yana (science of rejuvenation), and v\u0101j\u012bkara\u1e47a ([[aphrodisiac]] and fertility). Apart from learning these, the student of \u0100yurveda was expected to know ten arts that were indispensable in the preparation and application of his medicines: distillation, operative skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacture, pharmacy, analysis and separation of minerals, compounding of metals, and preparation of [[alkalis]].  The teaching of various subjects was done during the instruction of relevant clinical subjects.  For example, teaching of anatomy was a part of the teaching of surgery, embryology was a part of training in pediatrics and obstetrics, and the knowledge of physiology and pathology was interwoven in the teaching of all the clinical disciplines.\nThe normal length of the student's training appears to have been seven years.  But the physician was to continue to learn.<ref>Dominik Wujastyk, ed., ''The Roots of Ayurveda,'' Penguin (2003) {{ISBN|0-14-044824-1}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternative form of medicine in India, [[Unani medicine]] got deep roots and royal patronage during medieval times. It progressed during Indian sultanate and [[Mughal Empire|mughal]] periods. Unani medicine is very close to Ayurveda. Both are based on theory of the presence of the elements (in Unani, they are considered to be fire, water, earth and air) in the human body. According to followers of Unani medicine, these elements are present in different fluids and their balance leads to health and their imbalance leads to illness.<ref>Arab Medicine during the Ages by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, Studies in History of Medicine and Science, IHMMR, New Delhi, Vol. XIV, No. 1-2, 1996, p.&nbsp;1\u201339</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century CE, Sanskrit medical wisdom still dominated. Muslim rulers built large hospitals in 1595 in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], and in [[History of Delhi|Delhi]] in 1719, and numerous commentaries on ancient texts were written.<ref name=\"Deepak Kumar 2003 pp 680-3\">Deepak Kumar, \"India\" in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp.&nbsp;680\u201383</ref>\n\n=== China ===\n{{Main|Traditional Chinese medicine}}\n[[File:Traditional Chinese medicine in Xi'an market.jpg|thumb|Assorted dried plant and animal parts used in traditional Chinese medicines, clockwise from top left corner: dried [[Lingzhi mushroom|Lingzhi]] (lit. \"spirit mushrooms\"), [[ginseng]], [[Siraitia grosvenorii|Luo Han Guo]], turtle shell underbelly ([[plastron]]), and dried curled snakes]]\n\nChina also developed a large body of traditional medicine. Much of the philosophy of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] derived from empirical observations of disease and illness by [[Taoist]] physicians and reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. These causative principles, whether material, essential, or mystical, correlate as the expression of the natural order of the universe.\n\nThe foundational text of Chinese medicine is the [[Huangdi Neijing|Huangdi neijing]], (or ''Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon''), written 5th century to 3rd century BCE.<ref>Unschuld (2003), 1.</ref>  Near the end of the 2nd century CE, during the Han dynasty, [[Zhang Zhongjing]], wrote a ''[[Shang Han Lun|Treatise on Cold Damage]]'', which contains the earliest known reference to the ''[[Neijing Suwen]]''. The [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] practitioner and advocate of [[acupuncture]] and [[moxibustion]], [[Huangfu Mi]] (215\u2013282), also quotes the [[Yellow Emperor]] in his ''Jiayi jing'', c. 265.  During the [[Tang Dynasty]], the ''Suwen'' was expanded and revised, and is now the best extant representation of the foundational roots of traditional Chinese medicine.  [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] that is based on the use of herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage and other forms of therapy has been practiced in China for thousands of years.\n\nIn the 18th century, during the Qing dynasty, there was a proliferation of popular books as well as more advanced encyclopedias on traditional medicine.  Jesuit missionaries introduced Western science and medicine to the royal court, the Chinese physicians ignored them.<ref>Frank Dikotter, \"China\" in Roy Porter, ed, ''The Cambridge History of Science: Volume 4: 18th-century Science'' (2003) pp.&nbsp;695\u201397</ref>\n\nFinally in the 19th century, Western medicine was introduced at the local level by Christian medical missionaries from the [[London Missionary Society]] (Britain), the [[Methodism|Methodist]] Church (Britain) and the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States|Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  [[Benjamin Hobson]] (1816\u20131873) in 1839, set up a highly successful Wai Ai Clinic in Guangzhou, China.<ref>{{cite book|author1=TJ Hinrichs|author2=Linda L Barnes|title=Chinese Medicine and Healing: An Illustrated History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtsYe0ZFORcC&pg=PA197|year=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=197|display-authors=etal|isbn=9780674047372}}</ref> The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was founded in 1887 by the [[London Missionary Society]], with its first graduate (in 1892) being [[Sun Yat-sen]], who later led the [[Chinese Revolution (1911)]]. The [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] was the forerunner of the School of Medicine of the [[University of Hong Kong]], which started in 1911.\n\nBecause of the social custom that men and women should not be near to one another, the women of China were reluctant to be treated by male doctors. The missionaries sent women doctors such as Dr. [[Mary Hannah Fulton]] (1854\u20131927). Supported by the Foreign Missions Board of the Presbyterian Church (USA) she in 1902 founded the first medical college for women in China, the Hackett Medical College for Women, in Guangzhou.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Edward T.

In preserving medical practices from antiquity, Byzantine medicine influenced [[Islamic medicine]] as well as fostering the Western rebirth of medicine during the Renaissance.\n\nByzantine physicians often compiled and standardized medical knowledge into textbooks. Their records tended to include both diagnostic explanations and technical drawings. The [[Medical Compendium in Seven Books]], written by the leading physician [[Paul of Aegina]], survived as a particularly thorough source of medical knowledge. This compendium, written in the late seventh century, remained in use as a standard textbook for the following 800 years.\n\nLate antiquity ushered in a revolution in medical science, and historical records often mention civilian hospitals (although battlefield medicine and wartime triage were recorded well before Imperial Rome).

The theory stated that within every individual there were four humours, or principal fluids \u2013 black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood, these were produced by various organs in the body, and they had to be in balance for a person to remain healthy.  Too much phlegm in the body, for example, caused lung problems; and the body tried to cough up the phlegm to restore a balance. The balance of humours in humans could be achieved by diet, medicines, and by [[blood-letting]], using leeches. The four humours were also associated with the four seasons, black bile-autumn, yellow bile-summer, phlegm-winter and blood-spring.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nicola Barber|title=Medieval Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIHm2TegTwYC&pg=PA13|year=2012|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|page=13|isbn=9781410946614}}</ref>\n\nHealing included both physical and spiritual therapeutics, such as the right herbs, a suitable diet, clean bedding, and the sense that care was always at hand.

They were trained in traditional methods of physical care that involved little knowledge of medicine. The breakthrough to professionalization based on knowledge of advanced medicine was led by [[Florence Nightingale]] in England.

Today its Colonel In Chief is [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex]], the daughter-in-law of [[Queen Elizabeth II]].  In the United States, upper middle class women who already supported hospitals promoted nursing. The new profession proved highly attractive to women of all backgrounds, and schools of nursing opened in the late 19th century. They soon a function of large hospitals, where they provided a steady stream of low-paid idealistic workers.

After 1820 the Second Viennese School of Medicine emerged with the contributions of physicians such as [[Carl Freiherr von Rokitansky]], [[Josef \u0160koda]], [[Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra]], and [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]]. Basic medical science expanded and specialization advanced. Furthermore, the first [[dermatology]], eye, as well as [[ear, nose, and throat]] clinics in the world were founded in Vienna.  The textbook of [[ophthalmologist]] [[Georg Joseph Beer]] (1763\u20131821) ''Lehre von den Augenkrankheiten'' combined practical research and philosophical speculations, and became the standard reference work for decades.<ref>Erna Lesky, ''The Vienna Medical School of the 19th Century'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976)</ref>\n\n===Berlin===\nAfter 1871 Berlin, the capital of the new German Empire, became a leading center for medical research. [[Robert Koch]] (1843\u20131910) was a representative leader.  He became famous for isolating ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' (1877), the ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis|Tuberculosis bacillus]]'' (1882) and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' (1883) and for his development of [[Koch's postulates]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1905 for his tuberculosis findings.

Weapon development -particularly the appearance of  [[rifles|Springfield Model 1861]], mass-produced and much more accurate than muskets led to generals underestimating the risks of long range rifle fire; risks exemplified in the death of [[John Sedgwick]] and the disastrous [[George Pickett#Gettysburg and Pickett's Charge|Pickett's Charge]].  The rifles could shatter bone forcing amputation and longer ranges meant casualties were sometimes not quickly found.

First came epidemics of the childhood diseases of chicken pox, mumps, whooping cough, and, especially, measles. Operations in the South meant a dangerous and new disease environment, bringing diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid fever, and malaria. There were no antibiotics, so the surgeons prescribed coffee, whiskey, and quinine. Harsh weather, bad water, inadequate shelter in winter quarters, poor policing of camps, and dirty camp hospitals took their toll.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Link | first1 = Kenneth | year = 1983 | title = Potomac Fever: The Hazards of Camp Life | url = | journal = Vermont History | volume = 51 | issue = 2| pages = 69\u201388 | pmid = 11633534 }}</ref>\n\nThis was a common scenario in wars from time immemorial, and conditions faced by the Confederate army were even worse. The Union responded by building army hospitals in every state. What was different in the Union was the emergence of skilled, well-funded medical organizers who took proactive action, especially in the much enlarged United States Army Medical Department,<ref>Mary C. Gillett, ''The Army Medical Department, 1818\u20131865'' (1987)</ref> and the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], a new private agency.<ref>William Quentin Maxwell, ''Lincoln's Fifth Wheel: The Political History of the U.S. Sanitary Commission'' (1956)</ref> Numerous other new agencies also targeted the medical and morale needs of soldiers, including the [[United States Christian Commission]] as well as smaller private agencies.<ref>Justin Martin,  ''Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted'' (2011) pp.&nbsp;178\u2013230</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army learned many lessons and in August 1886, it established the Hospital Corps.\n\n===Statistical methods===\n[[File:Nightingale-mortality.jpg|thumb|\"''[[polar area diagram|Diagram]] of the causes of mortality in the army in the East''\" by Florence Nightingale.]]\n\nA major breakthrough in epidemiology came with the introduction of statistical maps and graphs. They allowed careful analysis of seasonality issues in disease incidents, and the maps allowed public health officials to identify critical loci for the dissemination of disease.  [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] in London developed the methods. In 1849, he observed that the symptoms of cholera, which had already claimed around 500 lives within a month, were vomiting and diarrhoea. He concluded that the source of contamination must be through ingestion, rather than inhalation as was previously thought. It was this insight that resulted in the removal of The Pump On Broad Street, after which deaths from cholera plummeted afterwards. English nurse [[Florence Nightingale]] pioneered analysis of large amounts of statistical data, using graphs and tables, regarding the condition of thousands of patients in the Crimean War to evaluate the efficacy of hospital services. Her methods proved convincing and led to reforms in military and civilian hospitals, usually with the full support of the government.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Magnello | first1 = M.

The pioneer was [[John Shaw Billings]] (1838\u20131913). A senior surgeon in the war, Billings built the [[Library of the Surgeon General's Office]] (now the [[National Library of Medicine]]), the centerpiece of modern medical information systems.<ref>He also built the [[New York Public Library]]</ref> Billings figured out how to mechanically analyze medical and demographic data by turning facts into numbers and punching the numbers onto cardboard cards that could be sorted and counted by machine.

Shell shock among frontline soldiers exposed to heavy artillery bombardment was first diagnosed by British Army doctors in 1915. By 1916, similar symptoms were also noted in soldiers not exposed to explosive shocks, leading to questions as to whether the disorder was physical or psychiatric.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = Caroline | year = 2010 | title = The Shock of War | url = | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 58\u201366 }}</ref> In the 1920s [[surrealism|surrealist]] opposition to psychiatry was expressed in a number of surrealist publications.  In the 1930s several controversial medical practices were introduced including inducing seizures (by [[electroshock]], [[insulin]] or other drugs) or cutting parts of the brain apart ([[leucotomy]] or [[lobotomy]]). Both came into widespread use by psychiatry, but there were grave concerns and much opposition on grounds of basic morality, harmful effects, or misuse.<ref>G. E. Berrios and Roy Porter ''The History of Clinical Psychiatry'' (1995)</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s new [[psychiatric drugs]], notably the antipsychotic [[chlorpromazine]], were designed in laboratories and slowly came into preferred use. Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control. There was also increasing opposition to the use of psychiatric hospitals, and attempts to move people back into the community on a collaborative [[World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry|user-led group]] approach (\"therapeutic communities\") not controlled by psychiatry. Campaigns against [[masturbation]] were done in the [[Victorian era]] and elsewhere. [[Lobotomy]] was used until the 1970s to treat [[schizophrenia]]. This was denounced by the [[anti-psychiatric]] movement in the 1960s and later.\n\n==20th century and beyond==\n\n=== Twentieth-century warfare and medicine ===\nThe [[ABO blood group system]] was discovered in 1901, and the [[Rhesus blood group system]] in 1937, facilitating [[blood transfusion]].\n\nDuring the 20th century, large-scale wars were attended with [[medic]]s and [[mobile hospital]] units which developed advanced techniques for healing massive injuries and controlling infections rampant in battlefield conditions. During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u20131920), General [[Pancho Villa]] organized hospital trains for wounded soldiers. Boxcars marked ''Servicio Sanitario'' (\"sanitary service\") were re-purposed as surgical operating theaters and areas for recuperation, and staffed by up to 40 Mexican and U.S. physicians. Severely wounded soldiers were shuttled back to base hospitals.<ref>[[Friedrich Katz]], ''The Life and Times of Pancho Villa''.

Those practices were combined to broaden [[cosmetic surgery]] and other forms of [[elective surgery]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Henry Drysdale Dakin|Henry Dakin]] developed the [[Carrel-Dakin method]] of treating wounds with an irrigation, Dakin's solution, a [[germicide]] which helped prevent [[gangrene]].<ref>Mark Harrison, ''The Medical War: British Military Medicine in the First World War'' (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/Medical-War-British-Military-Medicine/dp/0199575827/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\nThe Great War spurred the usage of [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|Roentgen]]'s [[X-ray]], and the [[electrocardiograph]], for the [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of internal bodily functions.  This was followed in the inter-war period by the development of the first anti-bacterial agents such as the [[sulpha]] antibiotics.\n\n===Public health===\n{{Main|Public health}}\n[[Public health]] measures became particular important during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], which killed at least 50 million people around the world.<ref>John M.

Male doctors were unable to cure the patients, and they felt like failures.

Bristow, ''American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic'' (Oxford University Press, 2012)</ref>\n\nFrom 1917 to 1923, the [[American Red Cross]] moved into Europe with a battery of long-term child health projects.  It built and operated hospitals and clinics, and organized antituberculosis and antityphus campaigns.  A high priority involved child health programs such as clinics, better baby shows, playgrounds, fresh air camps, and courses for women on infant hygiene. Hundreds of U.S. doctors, nurses, and welfare professionals administered these programs, which aimed to reform the health of European youth and to reshape European public health and welfare along American lines.<ref>Julia F.

Major wars showed the need for effective hygiene and medical treatment.]]\n\nThe advances in medicine made a dramatic difference for Allied troops, while the Germans and especially the Japanese and Chinese suffered from a severe lack of newer medicines, techniques and facilities.  Harrison finds that the chances of recovery for a badly wounded British infantryman were as much as 25 times better than in the First World War. The reason was that:\n:\"By 1944 most casualties were receiving treatment within hours of wounding, due to the increased mobility of field hospitals and the extensive use of aeroplanes as ambulances. The care of the sick and wounded had also been revolutionized by new medical technologies, such as active immunization against tetanus, sulphonamide drugs, and penicillin.\"<ref>Mark Harrison, ''Medicine and Victory: British Military Medicine in the Second World War'' (2004) p. 275</ref>\n\n====Nazi and Japanese medical research====\nUnethical [[human subject research]], and killing of patients with disabilities, peaked during the Nazi era, with [[Nazi human experimentation]] and [[Aktion T4]] during [[the Holocaust]] as the most significant examples. Many of the details of these and related events were the focus of the [[Doctors' Trial]]. Subsequently, principles of [[medical ethics]], such as the [[Nuremberg Code]], were introduced to prevent a recurrence of such atrocities.<ref>Horst H.

In Liberia, for example, the United States had large military operations during the war and the U.S. Public Health Service began the use of DDT for indoor residual spraying (IRS) and as a larvicide, with the goal of controlling malaria in Monrovia, the Liberian capital. In the early 1950s, the project was expanded to nearby villages. In 1953, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) launched an antimalaria program in parts of Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa. However these projects encountered a spate of difficulties that foreshadowed the general retreat from malaria eradication efforts across tropical Africa by the mid-1960s.<ref>James L. A.

However, in southern Africa, the [[HIV]] epidemic beginning around 1990 has eroded national health.]]\n[[File:Infant with cochlear implant.jpg|left|thumb|A [[cochlear implant]] is a common kind of [[neural prosthesis]], a device replacing part of the [[human nervous system]].]]\nThe [[World Health Organization]] was founded in 1948 as a [[United Nations]] agency to improve [[global health]]. In most of the world, [[life expectancy]] has improved since then, and was about 67 years {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, and well above 80 years in some countries. [[Eradication of infectious diseases]] is an international effort, and several new [[vaccine]]s have been developed during the post-war years, against infections such as [[measles]], [[mumps]], several strains of [[influenza]] and [[human papilloma virus]]. The long-known vaccine against [[Smallpox]] finally eradicated the disease in the 1970s, and [[Rinderpest]] was wiped out in 2011. [[Eradication of polio]] is underway. [[Tissue culture]] is important for development of vaccines. Though the early success of antiviral vaccines and antibacterial drugs, [[antiviral drugs]] were not introduced until the 1970s. Through the WHO, the international community has developed a response protocol against epidemics, displayed during the [[SARS]] epidemic in 2003, the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1]] from 2004, the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] and onwards.\n\nAs infectious diseases have become less lethal, and the most common [[cause of death|causes of death]] in developed countries are now [[tumor]]s and [[cardiovascular disease]]s, these conditions have received increased attention in medical research. [[Tobacco smoking]] as a cause of [[lung cancer]] was first researched in the 1920s, but was not widely supported by publications until the 1950s. [[Cancer treatment]] has been developed with [[radiotherapy]], [[chemotherapy]] and [[surgical oncology]].\n\n[[Oral rehydration therapy]] has been extensively used since the 1970s to treat [[cholera]] and other diarrhea-inducing infections.\n\nThe [[sexual revolution]] included taboo-breaking research in [[human sexuality]] such as the 1948 and 1953 [[Kinsey reports]], invention of [[hormonal contraception]], and the normalization of [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]] in many countries. [[Family planning]] has promoted a [[demographic transition]] in most of the world. With threatening [[sexually transmitted infections]], not least [[HIV]], use of [[barrier contraception]] has become imperative. The struggle against HIV has improved [[antiretroviral]] treatments.\n\n[[Medical radiography|X-ray imaging]] was the first kind of [[medical imaging]], and later [[ultrasonic imaging]], [[CT scanning]], [[MR scanning]] and other imaging methods became available.\n\n[[Genetics]] have advanced with the discovery of the [[DNA]] molecule, [[genetic mapping]] and [[gene therapy]]. [[Stem cell]] research took off in the 2000s (decade), with [[stem cell therapy]] as a promising method.\n\n[[Evidence-based medicine]] is a modern concept, not introduced to literature until the 1990s.\n\n[[Prosthetic]]s have improved. In 1958, [[Arne Larsson]] in Sweden became the first patient to depend on an [[artificial cardiac pacemaker]]. He died in 2001 at age 86, having outlived its inventor, the surgeon, and 26 pacemakers. Lightweight materials as well as [[neural prosthetic]]s emerged in the end of the 20th century.\n\n====Modern surgery====\n[[Cardiac surgery]] was revolutionized in 1948 as open-heart surgery was introduced for the first time since 1925.\n\nIn 1954 [[Joseph Murray]], [[J. Hartwell Harrison]] and others accomplished the first [[kidney transplantation]]. [[organ transplant|Transplantations]] of other organs, such as heart, liver and pancreas, were also introduced during the later 20th century. The first partial [[face transplant]] was performed in 2005, and the first full one in 2010. By the end of the 20th century, [[microtechnology]] had been used to create tiny robotic devices to assist [[microsurgery]] using micro-video and [[fiber optics|fiber-optic]] cameras to view internal tissues during surgery with minimally invasive practices.<ref>Murray, Joseph E., \"The First Successful Organ Transplants in Man\", Nobel Lect., 1990, Nobelprize.org., Web, July 7, 2010</ref>\n\n[[Laparoscopic surgery]] was broadly introduced in the 1990s. [[Natural orifice surgery]] has followed. [[Remote surgery]] is another recent development, with the [[Lindbergh operation]] in 2001 as a groundbreaking example.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Health care in the United States]]\n* [[History of herbalism]]\n* [[History of hospitals]]\n* [[History of medicine in Canada]]\n* [[History of medicine in the United States]]\n* [[History of nursing]]\n* [[History of pathology]]\n* [[History of pharmacy]]\n* [[History of surgery]]\n* [[Clifford Allbutt#History of medicine|Thomas Clifford Allbutt]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |first=Thomas Clifford |last=Allbutt |wstitle=Medicine#Modern Progress |display=Medicine: Modern Progress |volume=18 |pages=55\u201364}};</ref>\n* [[Timeline of nursing history]]\n* [[Timeline of medicine and medical technology]]\n* [[History of health care (disambiguation)]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n{{Notelist |notes =\n{{efn|name=\"asylum numbers\"|\nEngland and Wales had nine county and borough asylums in 1827 with an average capacity of a little over 100 patients, but by 1890 there were 66 such asylums containing on average 800 patients each;<ref>{{cite book |last = Scull |first = Andrew |title = Most Solitary of Afflictions: Madness And Society in Britain, 1700\u20131900 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xiaa2hMYRokC |year = 2005 |publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 978-0-300-10754-8 |page = 281}}</ref> the total number of patients so confined increased from 1,027 in 1827 to 74,004 in 1900.<ref>{{cite book |last = Jones |first = Kathleen |title = Asylums and after: a revised history of the mental health services: from the early 18th century to the 1990s |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ej8QAQAAMAAJ&q=1%2C046#search_anchor |year = 1993 |publisher = Athlone Press |isbn = 978-0-485-12091-2 |page = 116}}</ref> Similarly, in Germany, between 1852 and 1898 the asylum population increased seven-fold from 11,622 to 74,087 patients during a period when the total population had only grown by ten per cent.<ref name=\"otto marx\" /> In America the asylum population had risen to almost 250,000 on the eve of the First World War.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1 = Wright |first1 = D. |title = Getting Out of the Asylum: Understanding the Confinement of the Insane in the Nineteenth Century |doi = 10.1093/shm/10.1.137 |journal = Social History of Medicine |volume = 10 |issue = 1 |pages = 137\u201355 |year = 1997 |pmid = 11619188 |pmc = }}</ref>\n}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bowers, Barbara S. ed.

The city lies at the [[confluence]] of the [[River Leine]] (progression: {{PAller}}) and its [[tributary]] [[Ihme]], in the south of the [[North German Plain]], and is the largest city of the [[Hannover\u2013Braunschweig\u2013G\u00f6ttingen\u2013Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region]]. It is the fifth-largest city in the [[Low German]] dialect area after Hamburg, [[Dortmund]], [[Essen]], and Bremen.\n\nBefore it became the capital of Lower Saxony in 1946, Hanover was the capital of the [[Principality of Calenberg]] (1636-1692), the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (1692-1814), the  [[Kingdom of Hanover]] (1814-1866), the [[Province of Hanover]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1868-1918), the [[Province of Hanover]] of the [[Free State of Prussia]] (1918-1946), and of the [[State of Hanover]] (1946). From 1714 to 1837, Hanover was by [[personal union]] the family seat of the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian Kings of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], under their title of the dukes of [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (later described as the [[Electorate of Brunswick-Luneburg|Elector of Hanover]]).\n\nThe city is a major crossing point of railway lines and highways ([[Autobahn]]en), connecting European main lines in both the east-west ([[Berlin]]\u2013[[Ruhr|Ruhr area]]/[[D\u00fcsseldorf]]/[[Cologne]]) and north-south ([[Hamburg]]\u2013[[Frankfurt]]/[[Stuttgart]]/[[Munich]]) directions. [[Hannover Airport]] lies north of the city, in [[Langenhagen]], and is Germany's ninth-busiest airport. The city's most notable institutions of higher education are the [[Hannover Medical School]] with its [[university hospital]] (Klinikum der Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover), and the [[University of Hanover]].\n\nThe [[Hanover fairground]], due to numerous extensions, especially for the [[Expo 2000]], is the largest in the world. Hanover hosts annual commercial [[World's fair|trade fairs]] such as the [[Hanover Fair]] and the [[CeBIT]]. The IAA Commercial Vehicles show takes place every two years. It is the world's leading trade show for transport, logistics and mobility. Every year Hanover hosts the [[Sch\u00fctzenfest Hannover]], the world's largest marksmen's festival, and the [[Oktoberfest celebrations#Hannover|Oktoberfest Hannover]].\n\n\"Hanover\" is the traditional English spelling. The German spelling (with a double n) is becoming more popular in English; recent editions of encyclopedias prefer the German spelling,<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica] uses \"Hannover\". It says \"''English'' Hanover\" but uses \"Hannover\" in the prose.</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254472/Hannover Microsoft Encarta] gives the primary spelling as \"Hannover\".</ref> and the local government uses the German spelling on English websites.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hannover.de/english/ |title=Official Website of the City and Region of Hannover |publisher=Hannover.de |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}</ref> The English pronunciation, with [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] on the first syllable, is applied to both the [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] spellings, which is different from German pronunciation, with stress on the second syllable and a long second vowel. The traditional English spelling is still used in historical contexts, especially when referring to the British [[House of Hanover]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Merian Hannover Ostseite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|Illustration of Hanover by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]], 1654]]\n{{see also|Timeline of Hanover|History of Hanover (region)}}\nHanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River [[Leine]]. Its original name ''Honovere'' may mean \"high (river)bank\", though this is debated (cf. ''das Hohe Ufer''). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century, receiving [[town privileges]] in 1241, due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the [[Hanseatic League]] city of [[Bremen]] by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide [[North German Plain]] and north-west of the [[Harz]] mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the [[Rhine]], [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the [[Low Countries]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] or [[Thuringia]].\n\nIn the 14th century the main [[Church (building)|churches]] of Hanover were built, as well as a [[Defensive wall|city wall]] with three city gates. The beginning of industrialization in Germany led to trade in iron and silver from the northern [[Harz Mountains]], which increased the city's importance.\n\nIn 1636 [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], ruler of the [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] [[principality of Calenberg]], moved his residence to Hanover. The Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg was elevated by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] to the rank of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1692, and this elevation was confirmed by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] in 1708. Thus the principality was upgraded to the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], colloquially known as the [[Electorate of Hanover]] after Calenberg's capital (see also: [[House of Hanover]]). Its Electors later become monarchs of [[Great Britain]] (and from 1801, of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]). The first of these was [[George I of Great Britain|George I Louis]], who acceded to the British throne in 1714. The last British monarch who reigned in Hanover was [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]. [[Semi-Salic law]], which required succession by the male line if possible, forbade the accession of [[Queen Victoria]] in Hanover. As a male-line descendant of George I, Queen Victoria was herself a member of the House of Hanover. Her descendants, however, bore her husband's titular name of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]. Three kings of Great Britain, or the United Kingdom, were concurrently also [[prince-elector|Electoral Princes]] of Hanover.\n\nDuring the time of the personal union of the crowns of the United Kingdom and Hanover (1714\u20131837), the monarchs rarely visited the city. In fact, during the reigns of the final three joint rulers (1760\u20131837), there was only one short visit, by [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821. From 1816 to 1837 [[Viceroy]] [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|Adolphus]] represented the monarch in Hanover.\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] was fought near the city on 26 July 1757. The [[France|French]] army defeated the [[Hanoverian Army of Observation]], leading to the city's occupation as part of the [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|Invasion of Hanover]]. It was recaptured by Anglo-German forces led by [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick|Ferdinand of Brunswick]] the following year.\n\n===19th century===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Hannover Georgstra\u00dfe mit Theater (um 1895).jpg|thumb|Am [[Kr\u00f6pcke]], 1895]]\n[[File:Hannover Schloss zu Herrenhausen (um 1895).jpg|thumb|right|Schloss [[Herrenhausen Gardens|Herrenhausen]], 1895]]\nAfter [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] imposed the [[Convention of Artlenburg]] (Convention of the Elbe) on July 5, 1803, about 35,000 French soldiers occupied Hanover. The Convention also required disbanding the army of Hanover. However, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] did not recognize the Convention of the Elbe. This resulted in a great number of soldiers from Hanover eventually emigrating to [[Great Britain]], where the [[King's German Legion]] was formed. It was only troops from Hanover and [[Black Brunswickers|Brunswick]] that consistently opposed France throughout the entire Napoleonic wars. The Legion later played an important role in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 elevated the electorate to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]]. The capital town Hanover expanded to the western bank of the [[Leine]] and since then has grown considerably.\n\nIn 1837, the [[personal union]] of the United Kingdom and Hanover ended because [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV's]] heir in the United Kingdom was female ([[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]). Hanover could be inherited only by male heirs. Thus, Hanover passed to William IV's brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover|Ernest Augustus]], and remained a kingdom until 1866, when it was annexed by [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War|Austro-Prussian war]]. Despite Hanover being expected to defeat Prussia at the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]], Prussia employed [[Prussian Army#Moltke the Elder|Moltke the Elder's Kesselschlacht order of battle]] to instead destroy the Hanoverian army. The city of Hanover became the capital of the Prussian [[Province of Hanover]]. After the annexation, the people of Hanover generally opposed the Prussian government.\n\nTo Hanover's industry, however, the new connection with [[Prussia]] meant an improvement in business. The introduction of [[free trade]] promoted economic growth and led to the recovery of the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] (the founders' era). Between 1879 and 1902 Hanover's population grew from 87,600 to 313,940. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1842 the first [[Horsecar|horse railway]] was inaugurated, and from 1893 an electric [[tram]] was installed. In 1887 Hanover's [[Emile Berliner]] invented the record and the [[phonograph|gramophone]].\n\n[[File:Hannover Synagogenmahnmal.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Synagogue]]]]\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nAfter 1937 the Lord Mayor and the state commissioners of Hanover were members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] (Nazi party). A large [[German Jews|Jewish population]] then existed in Hanover. In October 1938, 484 Hanoverian Jews of Polish origin were expelled to [[Poland]], including the [[Herschel Grynszpan|Grynszpan family]]. However, Poland refused to accept them, leaving them stranded at the border with thousands of other Polish-Jewish deportees, fed only intermittently by the Polish [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and Jewish welfare organisations. The Grynszpans' son [[Herschel Grynszpan]] was in [[Paris]] at the time.

Near the entrance to the Berggarten is the historic ''Library Pavillon''. The ''Mausoleum'' of the Guelphs is also located in the Berggarten. Like the Great Garden, the Berggarten also consists of several parts, for example the ''Paradies'' and the ''Prairie Garden''. The ''[[Georgengarten]]'' is an English landscape garden. The ''Leibniz Temple'' and the ''Georgen Palace'' are two points of interest there.\n\nThe landmark of Hanover is the [[New City Hall (Hanover)|New Town Hall]] (''Neues Rathaus'').

In the centre are the large [[Marktkirche, Hanover|Marktkirche]] (Church St. Georgii et Jacobi, preaching venue of the bishop of the Lutheran [[Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover|Landeskirche Hannovers]]) and the ''Old Town Hall''. Nearby are the ''Leibniz House'', the ''Nolte House'', and the ''Beguine Tower''.  The ''Kreuz-Church-Quarter'' around the ''Kreuz Church'' contains many little lanes. Nearby is the old royal sports hall, now called the ''Ballhof'' theatre. On the edge of the Old Town are the ''Market Hall'', the ''Leine Palace'', and the ruin of the ''Aegidien Church'' which is now a monument to the victims of war and violence. Through the ''Marstall Gate'' the bank of the river ''Leine'' can be reached; the ''Nanas'' of [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] are located here. They are part of the ''Mile of Sculptures'', which starts from Trammplatz, leads along the river bank, crosses K\u00f6nigsworther Square, and ends at the entrance of the Georgengarten. Near the Old Town is the district of Calenberger Neustadt where the Catholic [[Basilica Minor]] of ''St. Clemens'', the ''Reformed Church'' and the Lutheran [[Neust\u00e4dter Kirche, Hannover|Neust\u00e4dter Hof- und Stadtkirche St. Johannis]] are located.\n\nSome other popular sights are the ''Waterloo Column'', the ''[[Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves|Laves]] House'', the ''Wangenheim Palace'', the ''Lower Saxony State Archives'', the ''Hanover Playhouse'', the ''Kr\u00f6pcke Clock'', the ''Anzeiger Tower Block'', the ''Administration Building of the NORD/LB'', the ''Cupola Hall'' of the Congress Centre, the ''Lower Saxony Stock'', the ''Ministry of Finance'', the ''Garten Church'', the ''Luther Church'', the ''Gehry Tower'' (designed by the American architect [[Frank Gehry|Frank O.

As backlit LCD game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power, they were not battery-friendly like the non-backlit original Game Boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life. By this point, [[rechargeable battery]] technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[Atari Lynx]] did not have nearly as much success as the Game Boy.\n\nEven though third-party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery-hungry alternatives to the Game Boy, these batteries employed a [[Nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium]] process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency; lead-acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limiters (cigarette lighter plug devices); but the batteries had mediocre portability. The later [[Nickel-metal hydride battery|NiMH]] batteries, which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency, were not released until the late 1990s, years after the Game Gear, Atari Lynx, and original Game Boy had been discontinued. During the time when technologically superior handhelds had strict technical limitations, batteries had a very low [[ampere-hour|mAh]] rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available.\n\nModern game systems such as the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[PlayStation Portable]] have rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|Lithium-Ion]] batteries with proprietary shapes. Other seventh-generation consoles such as the [[GP2X]] use standard [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]]. Because the mAh rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the 1990s, the power needed for handhelds like the GP2X may be supplied by relatively few batteries.\n\n==== Game Boy ====\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.jpg|right|thumb|130px|The original Game Boy]]\n[[Nintendo]] released the Game Boy on April 21, 1989 (September 1990 for the UK). The design team headed by [[Gunpei Yokoi]] had also been responsible for the [[Game & Watch]] system, as well as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Kid Icarus]]''. The Game Boy came under scrutiny by some industry critics, saying that the monochrome screen was too small, and the processing power was inadequate. The design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns, and when compared to the Microvision, the Game Boy was a huge leap forward.\n\nYokoi recognized that the Game Boy needed a [[Killer application|killer app]]\u2014at least one game that would define the console, and persuade customers to buy it. In June 1988, [[Minoru Arakawa]], then-CEO of Nintendo of America saw a demonstration of the game ''[[Tetris]]'' at a trade show. Nintendo purchased the rights for the game, and packaged it with the Game Boy system as a [[Glossary of video game terms#Launch Title|launch title]]. It was almost an immediate hit. By the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the US.<ref name=\"GBsales1989\">{{cite web |url=http://firstarkansasnews.net/2011/01/game-boy-nintendo-dominates-the-portable-market/ |title=Game Boy \u2014 Nintendo dominates the portable market |accessdate=April 28, 2011 |date=January 22, 2011 |publisher=First Arkansas News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123202930/http://firstarkansasnews.net/2011/01/game-boy-nintendo-dominates-the-portable-market/ |archivedate=January 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell over 118 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendoannualreport2005\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/report/NintendoAnnualReport2005.pdf |title=05 Annual Report |accessdate=March 22, 2008  |date=March 31, 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo Co., Ltd. |page=65}}</ref><ref name=\"GBsales\">{{cite web|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/source/7.htm |title=Game Boy |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |work=A Brief History of Game Console Warfare |publisher=[[BusinessWeek]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509094404/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/source/7.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2007 }}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==== Atari Lynx ====\n{{Main|Atari Lynx}}\n[[File:Atari-Lynx-I-Handheld.jpg|left|thumb|Atari Lynx]]\nIn 1987, [[Epyx]] created the Handy Game; a device that would turn into the Atari Lynx in 1989. It is the first color handheld console ever made, as well as the first with a [[backlight|backlit]] screen. It also features networking support with up to 17 other players, and advanced hardware that allows the zooming and scaling of sprites.  The Lynx can also be turned upside down to accommodate [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] players. However, all these features came at a very high price point, which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives. The Lynx is also very unwieldy, consumes batteries very quickly, and lacked the third-party support enjoyed by its competitors. Due to its high price, short battery life, production shortages, a dearth of compelling games, and Nintendo's aggressive marketing campaign, and despite a redesign in 1991, the Lynx became a [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failure]]. Despite this, companies like Telegames helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance, and when new owner Hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain, independent developers like Songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until 2004's ''Winter Games''.{{clear}}\n\n==== TurboExpress ====\n{{Main|TurboExpress}}\n[[File:NEC-TurboExpress-Upright-FL.jpg|thumb|150px|TurboExpress handheld]]\nThe TurboExpress is a portable version of the TurboGrafx, released in 1990 for $249.99 (the price was briefly raised to $299.99, soon dropped back to $249.99, and by 1992 it was $199.99). Its Japanese equivalent is the [[TurboExpress|PC Engine GT]].\n\nIt is the most advanced handheld of its time and can play all the [[TurboGrafx-16]]'s games (which are on a small, credit-card sized media called [[HuCard]]s). It has a 66&nbsp;mm (2.6 in.) screen, the same as the original Game Boy, but in a much higher resolution, and can display 64 [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] at once, 16 per scanline, in 512 colors. Although the hardware can only handle 481 simultaneous colors. It has 8&nbsp;kilobytes of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. The Turbo runs the HuC6820 [[Central processing unit|CPU]] at 1.79 or 7.16&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]].\n\nThe optional \"TurboVision\" TV tuner includes RCA audio/video input, allowing users to use TurboExpress as a video monitor. The \"TurboLink\" allowed two-player play. ''Falcon'', a flight simulator, included a \"head-to-head\" dogfight mode that can only be accessed via TurboLink. However, very few TG-16 games offered co-op play modes especially designed with the TurboExpress in mind.{{clear}}\n\n==== Bitcorp Gamate ====\n{{Main|Gamate}}\n[[File:Gamate.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Gamate and game cards]]\nThe Bitcorp Gamate is the one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the Nintendo Game Boy. It was released in Asia in 1990 and distributed worldwide by 1991.\n\nLike the Sega Game Gear, it was horizontal in orientation and like the Game Boy, required 4 AA batteries. Unlike many later Game Boy clones, its internal components were professionally assembled (no \"glop-top\" chips). Unfortunately the system's fatal flaw is its screen. Even by the standards of the day, its screen is rather difficult to use, suffering from similar motion blur problems that were common complaints with the first generation Game Boys. Likely because of this fact sales were quite poor, and Bitcorp closed by 1992. However, new games continued to be published for the Asian market, possibly as late as 1994. The total number of games released for the system remains unknown.\n\nGamate games were designed for stereo sound, but the console is only equipped with a mono speaker. {{clear}}\n\n==== Sega Game Gear ====\n{{Main|Game Gear}}\n[[File:Game-Gear-Handheld.jpg|thumb|Sega Game Gear]]\nThe Game Gear is the third color handheld console, after the Lynx and the TurboExpress; produced by Sega. Released in Japan in 1990 and in North America and Europe in 1991, it is based on the [[Master System]], which gave Sega the ability to quickly create Game Gear games from its large library of games for the Master System. While never reaching the level of success enjoyed by Nintendo, the Game Gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor, lasting longer than any other Game Boy rivals.\n\nWhile the Game Gear is most frequently seen in black or navy blue, it was also released in a variety of additional colors: red, light blue, yellow, clear, and violet. All of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the Asian market.\n\nFollowing Sega's success with the Game Gear, they began development on a successor during the early 1990s, which was intended to feature a [[touchscreen]] interface, many years before the [[Nintendo DS]]. However, such a technology was very expensive at the time, and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around $289 were it to be released. Sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the [[Genesis Nomad]], a handheld version of the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], as the successor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/974/974695p7.html|title=IGN Presents the History of SEGA|page=7|publisher=IGN|author=Travis Fahs|date=April 21, 2009|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==== Watara Supervision ====\n{{Main|Watara Supervision}}\n[[File:Watara-Supervision-Tilted.jpg|thumb|left|The Watara Supervision with tilting screen.]]\nThe Watara Supervision was released in 1992 in an attempt to compete with the Nintendo Game Boy. The first model was designed very much like a Game Boy, but it is grey in color and has a slightly larger screen. The second model was made with a hinge across the center and can be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user. While the system did enjoy a modest degree of success, it never impacted the sales of Nintendo or Sega. The Supervision was redesigned a final time as \"The Magnum\". Released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the [[Game Boy Pocket]]. It was available in three colors: yellow, green and grey. Watara designed many of the games themselves, but did receive some third party support, most notably from [[Thin Chen Enterprise|Sachen]].\n\nA TV adapter was available in both PAL and NTSC formats that could transfer the Supervision's black-and-white palette to 4 colors, similar in some regards to the Super Game Boy from Nintendo.{{clear}}\n\n==== Hartung Game Master ====\n{{Main|Game Master (console)}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hgm front-1-.jpg|right|thumb|Hartung Gamemaster]] -->\nThe Hartung Game Master is an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early 1990s. Its graphics were much lower than most of its contemporaries, similar in complexity to the Atari 2600. It was available in black, white, and purple, and was frequently rebranded by its distributors, such as Delplay, Videojet and Virella.\nThe exact number of games released is not known, but is likely around 20. The system most frequently turns up in Europe and Australia.{{clear}}\n\n=== Late 1990s ===\nBy this time, the lack of significant development in [[Nintendo]]'s product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] and the [[WonderSwan Color]] to be developed.{{clear}}\n\n==== Sega Nomad ====\n{{Main Article|Genesis Nomad}}\n[[File:Sega-Nomad-Front.jpg|thumb|Sega Nomad|right]]\nThe Nomad was released in October 1995 in North America only.<ref name=\"gamepro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/125748.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |author=Snow, Blake |publisher=[[GamePro]] |date=July 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012194600/http://gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/125748.shtml|archivedate=October 12, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"AllgameNomad\">{{cite web |author=Marriott, Scott Alan |title=Sega Genesis Nomad - Overview |url=http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=17671 |accessdate=October 18, 2013 |publisher=[[Allgame]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114094423/http://www.allgame.com/platform.php?id=17671 |archivedate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games.

The Game Boy Pocket takes two [[AAA batteries]] as opposed to four AA batteries for roughly ten hours of gameplay. The first model of the Game Boy Pocket did not have an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] to show battery levels, but the feature was added due to public demand. The Game Boy Pocket was not a new software platform and played the same software as the original Game Boy model.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Show Notes|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=95|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1996|page=16}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==== Game.com ====\n{{Main|Game.com}}\n[[File:Tiger-Game-Com-FL.jpg|thumb|Game.com]]\nThe Game.com (pronounced in TV commercials as \"game com\", not \"game dot com\", and not capitalized in marketing material) is a handheld game console released by [[Tiger Electronics]] in September 1997. It featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience, sporting PDA-style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus. However, Tiger hoped it would also challenge Nintendo's Game Boy and gain a following among younger gamers too. Unlike other handheld game consoles, the first game.com consoles included two slots for game cartridges, which would not happen again until the Tapwave Zodiac, the DS and DS Lite, and could be connected to a 14.4 kbit/s modem. Later models had only a single cartridge slot.{{clear}}\n\n==== Game Boy Color ====\n{{Main|Game Boy Color}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Game Boy Color was the first handheld by Nintendo featuring Colors]]\nThe Game Boy Color (also referred to as GBC or CGB) is Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy and was released on October 21, 1998, in Japan and in November of the same year in the United States. It features a color screen, and is slightly bigger than the [[Game Boy Pocket]]. The processor is twice as fast as a Game Boy's and has twice as much memory. It also had an [[infrared]] communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the Game Boy, such as the Game Boy Advance.\n\nThe Game Boy Color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system, as they felt that the Game Boy, even in its latest incarnation, the Game Boy Pocket, was insufficient. The resulting product was backward compatible, a first for a handheld console system, and leveraged the large library of games and great installed base of the predecessor system. This became a major feature of the Game Boy line, since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors. As of March 31, 2005, the Game Boy and [[Game Boy Color]] combined to sell 118.69 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendoannualreport2005\"/><ref name=\"GBsales\"/>\n\nThe console is capable of displaying up to 56 different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of 32,768, and can add basic four-color shading to games that had been developed for the original Game Boy.

The SP features a \"[[Bivalve shell|clamshell]]\" design (folding open and closed, like a laptop computer), as well as a [[Frontlight|frontlit]] color display and rechargeable battery. Despite the smaller form factor, the screen remained the same size as that of the original. In 2005, the [[Game Boy Micro]] was released. This revision sacrifices screen size and backwards compatibility with previous Game Boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter [[Backlight|backlit]] screen. A new SP model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time.\n\nAlong with the [[Nintendo GameCube]], the GBA also introduced the concept of \"connectivity\": using a handheld system as a console controller. A handful of games use this feature, most notably ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Pac-Man Vs.]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]''.\n\nAs of December 31, 2007, the GBA, GBA SP, and the Game Boy Micro combined have sold 80.72 million units worldwide.<ref name=\"080124e\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080124e.pdf#page=8 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 |format=PDF | page=8}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==== Game Park 32 ====\n{{Main|GP32}}\n[[File:Gp32-flu.jpg|left|thumb|GP32]]\nThe original GP32 was released in 2001 by the South Korean company [[Game Park]] a few months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance.

A front-lit screen was added and the new version was called GP32 FLU (Front Light Unit). In summer 2004, another redesign, the GP32 BLU, was made, and added a backlit screen. This version of the handheld was planned for release outside South Korea; in Europe, and it was released for example in Spain (VirginPlay was the distributor). While not a commercial success on a level with mainstream handhelds (only 30,000 units were sold), it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user-made applications and emulators of other systems, being popular with developers and more technically adept users.<ref name=\"clockerz\">[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6159783.html GP2X Q&A, With Craig Rothwell].

It was designed as a combination MP3 player, cellphone, PDA, radio, and gaming device. The system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout, including its vertically oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges. The most well known of these was \"[[N-Gage (device)|sidetalking]]\", or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides, causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a [[taco]].\n\nThe N-Gage QD was later released to address the design flaws of the original. However, certain features available in the original N-Gage, including MP3 playback, FM radio reception, and USB connectivity were removed.\n\n[[N-Gage (service)|Second generation of N-Gage]] launched on April 3, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015450/http://www.n-gage.com/ngi/ngage/web/g0/en/community/articles.Detail.general-anewdayforngage.1.html |archivedate=April 12, 2009 |title= A New Day for N-Gage |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=April 3, 2008}}</ref> in the form of a service for selected [[Nokia]] [[Smartphone]]s.{{clear}}\n\n==== Cybiko ====\n{{Main|Cybiko}}\n[[File:cybiko.jpg|right|thumb|Cybiko Classic with extended antenna on the main desktop.]]\n\nThe [[Cybiko]] is a Russian hand-held computer introduced in May 2000 by David Yang's company and designed for teenage audiences, featuring its own two-way radio text messaging system. It has over 430 \"official\" freeware games and applications. Because of the text messaging system, it features a QWERTY keyboard that was used with a stylus. An MP3 player add-on was made for the unit as well as a SmartMedia card reader. The company stopped manufacturing the units after two product versions and only a few years on the market. Cybikos can communicate with each other up to a maximum range of 300 metres (0.19 miles). Several Cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom.\n\nCybiko Classic:\n\nThere were two models of the Classic Cybiko. Visually, the only difference was that the original version had a power switch on the side, whilst the updated version used the \"escape\" key for power management. Internally, the differences between the two models were in the internal memory, and the location of the firmware.\n\nCybiko Xtreme:\n\nThe Cybiko Xtreme was the second-generation Cybiko handheld. It featured various improvements over the original Cybiko, such as a faster processor, more RAM, more ROM, a new operating system, a new keyboard layout and case design, greater wireless range, a microphone, improved audio output, and smaller size.\n\n==== Tapwave Zodiac ====\n{{Main|Tapwave Zodiac}}\nIn 2003, Tapwave released the Zodiac. It was designed to be a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-handheld game console hybrid. It supported photos, movies, music, [[Internet]], and documents. The Zodiac used a special version Palm OS 5, 5.2T, that supported the special gaming buttons and graphics chip. Two versions were available, Zodiac 1 and 2, differing in memory and looks. The Zodiac line ended in July 2005 when Tapwave declared bankruptcy.{{clear}}\n\n=== Mid 2000s ===\n\n==== Nintendo DS ====\n{{Main|Nintendo DS}}\n[[File:Nintendo-DS-Fat-Blue.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo DS has two screens (the lower of which is a touchscreen), a microphone and Wi-Fi connectivity.]]\nThe Nintendo DS was released in November 2004. Among its new features were the incorporation of two screens, a [[touchscreen]], wireless connectivity, and a microphone port. As with the Game Boy Advance SP, the DS features a clamshell design, with the two screens aligned vertically on either side of the hinge.\n\nThe DS's lower screen is touch sensitive, designed to be pressed with a stylus, a user's finger or a special \"thumb pad\" (a small plastic pad attached to the console's wrist strap, which can be affixed to the thumb to simulate an analog stick). More traditional controls include four face buttons, two shoulder buttons, a [[D-pad]], and \"Start\" and \"Select\" buttons. The console also features online capabilities via the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] and ad-hoc wireless networking for multiplayer games with up to sixteen players. It is backwards-compatible with all Game Boy Advance games, but not games designed for the Game Boy or Game Boy Color.\n\nIn January 2006, Nintendo revealed an updated version of the DS: the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] (released on March 2, 2006, in Japan) with an updated, smaller form factor (42% smaller and 21% lighter than the original Nintendo DS), a cleaner design, longer battery life, and brighter, higher-quality displays, with adjustable brightness. It is also able to connect wirelessly with Nintendo's Wii console.\n\nIn October 2008, Nintendo announced the [[Nintendo DSi]], with larger, 3.25-inch screens and two integrated cameras. It has an [[Secure Digital|SD card]] storage slot in place of the [[Game Boy Advance]] slot, plus internal flash memory for storing downloaded games. It was released on November 1, 2008, in Japan, and was released in North America April 5, 2009, and April 3, 2009, in Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2009, the Nintendo DS, Nintendo DS Lite and Nintendo DSi combined have sold 125.13 million units worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2009/090507e.pdf#page=22 |title=Consolidated Financial Highlights |accessdate=May 7, 2009 |date=May 7, 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=Nintendo |page=22}}</ref> In 2010 Nintendo released a larger version of the DSi, called the DSi XL.{{clear}}\n\n==== Game King ====\n{{Main|GameKing}}\n[[File:GameKing2.jpg|left|thumb|The GameKing 2.]]\nThe GameKing is a handheld game console released by the Chinese company TimeTop in 2004. The first model while original in design owes a large debt to Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. The second model, the GameKing 2, is believed to be inspired by Sony's PSP.<ref>[https://gizmodo.com/101781/gameking-2-portable-game-machine Gameking 2 Portable Game Machine]. Gizmodo.com (April 30, 2005). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.</ref> This model also was upgraded with a backlit screen, with a distracting background transparency (which can be removed by opening up the console). A color model, the GameKing 3 apparently exists, but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of Asia.  Whether intentionally or not, the GameKing has the most primitive graphics of any handheld released since the Game Boy of 1989. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAs many of the games have an \"old school\" simplicity, the device has developed a small cult following. The Gameking's speaker is quite loud and the cartridges' sophisticated looping soundtracks (sampled from other sources) are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics.\n\nTimeTop made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as \"GameKing\", but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics, is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi-carts (like the GB Station Light II). Outside of Asia (especially China) however the Gameking remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of Japanese handhelds such as those manufactured by Nintendo and Sony.{{clear}}\n\n==== PlayStation Portable ====\n{{Main|PlayStation Portable}}\n[[File:PSP-2000.jpg|right|thumb|PlayStation Portable]]\nThe PlayStation Portable (officially abbreviated PSP)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PSP/Features|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213151309/http://www.us.playstation.com/psp/about/|archivedate=February 13, 2008| title=PSP - About| publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> is a handheld game console manufactured and marketed by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]].<ref name=\"SCEAspecs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.us.playstation.com/psp/about/specs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213151309/http://www.us.playstation.com/psp/about/specs|archivedate=February 13, 2008| title=PSP Technical Specifications| publisher=\"Sony Computer Entertainment| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> Development of the console was first announced during E3 2003,<ref name=\"IGNE32003\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/402/402220p1.html| title=E3 2003: Sony Goes Handheld!| date=May 13, 2003| publisher=IGN| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> and it was unveiled on May 11, 2004, at a Sony press conference before E3&nbsp;2004.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BTcqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VkUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2031,1889081&dq=sony+aims+to+take+on+rivals&hl=en| title=Sony aims to take on rivals| first=Stanley A.| last=Miller II| date=May 11, 2004| publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/news/psp-japanese-launch-impressions| title=PSP Japanese launch impressions| date=December 11, 2004| publisher=1UP| accessdate=March 12, 2008| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721193505/http://www.1up.com/news/psp-japanese-launch-impressions| archivedate=July 21, 2016| df=mdy-all}}</ref> in [[North America]] on March 24, 2005,<ref name=\"GSUSlaunch\">{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6121009/spot-on-the-us-psp-launch| title=The US PSP Launch| date=March 24, 2005| first=Tor| last=Thorsen| publisher=GameSpot| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref> and in the [[PAL region]] on September 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4200000/newsid_4202900/4202934.stm| title=Sony PSP launches across Europe| date=September 1, 2005| publisher=The BBC| accessdate=March 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation Portable is the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, [[Universal Media Disc]] (UMD), for distribution of its games.

It was released on October 1, 2009, in American and European territories, and on November 1 in Japan. It was revealed prior to E3 2009 through Sony's Qore VOD service. Although its design is significantly different from other PSPs, it is not intended to replace the PSP 3000, which Sony continued to manufacture, sell, and support. On April 20, 2011, the manufacturer announced that the PSP Go would be discontinued so that they may concentrate on the PlayStation Vita. Sony later said that only the European and Japanese versions were being cut, and that the console would still be available in the US.\nUnlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive, but instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory to store games, video, pictures, and other media. This can be extended by up to 32 GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro (M2) flash card. Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8\" 480 \u00d7 272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3\" 480 \u00d7 272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls.

Internally, the PS Vita features a 4 core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a 4 core SGX543MP4+ graphics processing unit, as well as [[LiveArea]] software as its main user interface, which succeeds the [[XrossMediaBar]].\n\nThe device is fully backwards-compatible with PlayStation Portable games digitally released on the PlayStation Network via the PlayStation Store. However, PSone Classics and PS2 titles were not compatible at the time of the primary public release in Japan. The Vita's dual analog sticks will be supported on selected PSP games. The graphics for PSP releases will be up-scaled, with a smoothing filter to reduce pixelation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==== Razer Switchblade ====\n{{Main|Razer Switchblade}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Switchbladeconcept.jpg|thumb|250px|Razer Switchblade]] -->\nThe '''Razer Switchblade''' was a prototype pocket-sized like a [[Nintendo DSi XL]] designed to run [[Windows 7]], featured a multi-touch LCD screen and an adaptive keyboard that changed keys depending on the game you play.

After finishing the college in Osnabr\u00fcck, he moved in 1827 to visit the University of Berlin to study theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He soon combined philosophical and philological studies and was interested in art and modern literature.\n\nIn 1831, Abeken acquired a [[licenciate]] of theology. At the end of the year he visited Rome, and was welcomed in the house of [[Christian Karl Josias, Freiherr von Bunsen]]. Abeken participated in Bunsen's works, namely an evangelic prayer and hymn-book. In 1834 became chaplain to the Prussian embassy in Rome.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abeken, Heinrich|volume=1|pages=38-39}} Endnote: See ''Heinrich Abeken, ein schlichtes Leben in bewegter Zeit'' (Berlin, 1898), by his widow. This is valuable by reason of the letters written from the Prussian headquarters.</ref> He married his first wife, who died soon thereafter.\nBunsen left Rome in 1838 and Abeken followed soon thereafter to Germany. In 1841, he was sent to England to help founding a German-English evangelic [[episcopacy]] in [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In the same year, he was sent by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]], where he joined an expedition led by professor [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]. In 1845 and 1846 he returned via Jerusalem and Rome to Germany. He became Legation Councillor in Berlin, later Council Referee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 1848 he received an appointment in the Prussian ministry for foreign affairs, and in 1853 was promoted to be privy councillor of legation (''Geheimer Legationsrath'').<ref name=EB1911/> Abeken remained in charge for more than twenty years of Prussian politics, assisting [[Otto Theodor Freiherr von Manteuffel]] and Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]. The latter was so much pleased with Abeken's work that officials started to call Abeken \"the quill [i.e., the scribe] of Bismarck.\" Abeken married in 1866 [[Hedwig von Olfers]], daughter of the general director of the royal museums, [[Ignaz von Olfers|Privy Council von Olfers]].\n\nHe was much employed by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] in the writing of official despatches, and stood high in the favour of King William, whom he often accompanied on his journeys as representative of the foreign office.  He was present with the king during the campaigns of 1866 and 1870-71.  In 1851 he published anonymously ''Babylon und Jerusalem,'' a slashing criticism of the views of the [[Ida, Countess von Hahn-Hahn|Countess von Hahn-Hahn]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nDuring the war against Austria in 1866 as well as in the wars against France in 1870 and 1871, Abeken stayed in the Prussian headquarters. A major part of the dispatches of the time have been written by him. Unfortunately his health was damaged by the endeavours of these travels, and he died after an illness of several months. Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] described Abeken in a condolence letter to his widow: ''One of my most reliable advisors, standing on my side in the most decisive moments; His loss is irreplaceable to me; In him his fatherland has lost one of the most noble and most loyal men and officials.''\n\nDespite his engagement in politics, Abeken never lost his interest in theology and continued to publish and speak in this sector during all of his life. He was interested in art and archeology, and was sponsor of the Archeological Institute of Rome and member of the Archeological Society of Rome. He founded a Circle of Friends of the Greek Literature in Berlin and was member of the prize commission for the royal Schiller-Prize.\n\nSee ''Heinrich Abeken, ein schlichtes Leben in bewegter Zeit'' (Berlin, 1898), by his widow.

John Bruce's original family name was Knight, but on coming of age in 1805 he assumed the name of Bruce: his mother, through whom he inherited the Duffryn estate, was the daughter of William Bruce, high sheriff of Glamorganshire.\n\nHenry was educated from the age of twelve at the [[Bishop Gore School]], [[Swansea]] ([[Bishop Gore School|Swansea Grammar School]]). In 1837 he was called to the [[barrister|bar]] from Lincoln's Inn.<ref name=WBO>{{cite web|last1=Rees|first1=James Frederick|title=Henry Austin Bruce|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BRUC-AUS-1815.html?query=henry+bruce&field=name|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|accessdate=27 January 2016}}</ref> Shortly after he had begun to practice, the discovery of coal beneath the Duffryn and other Aberdare Valley [[estate (house)|estates]] brought his family great wealth.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Aberdare, Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron|volume=1|page=44}}</ref> From 1847 to 1854 Bruce was stipendiary magistrate for [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and [[Aberdare]], resigning the position in the latter year, after entering parliament as Liberal member for [[Merthyr Tydfil (UK Parliament constituency)|Merthyr Tydfil]].\n\n== Industrialist and politician, 1852\u20131868 ==\n[[File:1stLordAberdare.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Aberdare, portrait after [[Henry Tanworth Wells]].]]\nBruce was returned unopposed as MP for Merthyr Tydfil in December 1852, following the death of Sir John Guest.<ref name=\"CMG 18-12-52 Merthyr el\">{{cite news|title=Election of Henry Austin Bruce Esq. at Merthyr|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3090420/3090423/30/|accessdate=27 January 2016|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|date=18 December 1852|page=3}}</ref> He did so with the enthusiastic support of the late member's political allies, notably the iron masters of Dowlais, and he was thereafter regarded by his political opponents, most notably  in the Aberdare Valley, as their nominee.{{sfn|Jones|1965|pp=253-4}} Even so, Bruce's parliamentary record demonstrated support for liberal policies, with the exception of the ballot.{{sfn|Jones|1965|p=254}} The electorate in the constituency at this time remained relatively small, excluding the vast majority of the working classes.\n\nSignificantly, however, Bruce's relationship with the miners of the Aberdare Valley, in particular, deteriorated as a result of the [[Aberdare Strike 1857-8|Aberdare Strike]] of 1857-8.{{sfn|Jones|1964|pp=166-9}} In a speech to a large audience of miners at the Aberdare Market Hall, Bruce sought to strike a conciliatory tone in persuading the miners to return to work. In a second speech, however, he delivered a broadside against the trade union movement generally, referring to the violence engendered elsewhere as a result of strikes and to alleged examples of intimidation and violence in the immediate locality.<ref name=\"CMG 18571212\">{{cite news|title=The Great Strike and the Colliers|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3294344/ART30|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian|page=6|date=12 December 1857}}</ref> The strike damaged his reputation and may well have contributed to his eventual election defeat ten years later.  In 1855, Bruce was appointed a trustee of the [[GKN plc|Dowlais Iron Company]] and played a role in the further development of the iron industry.<ref name=\"WBO\" />\n\nIn November 1862, after nearly ten years in Parliament, he became [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], and held that office until April 1864.<ref name=\"WBO\" /> He became a [[Privy Councillor]] and a Charity Commissioner for England and Wales in 1864, when he was moved to be Vice-President of the Council of Education.<ref>Burke's Peerage (2003), vol.I, pp.9-10</ref>\n\n== 1868 general election ==\nAt the 1868 General Election, Merthyr Tydfil became a two-member constituency with a much-increased electorate as a result of the Second Reform Act of 1867. Since the formation of the constituency, Merthyr Tydfil had dominated representation as the vast majority of the electorate lived in the town and its vicinity, whereas there was a much lower number of electors in the neighbouring Aberdare Valley.{{sfn|Jones|1965|p=251}} During the 1850s and 1860s, however, the population of Aberdare grew rapidly, and the franchise changes in 1867 gave the vote to large numbers of miners in that valley. Amongst these new electors, Bruce, as noted above, remained unpopular as a result of his actions during the 1857 -8 dispute. Initially, it appeared that the Aberdare iron master, [[Richard Fothergill (politician)|Richard Fothergill]], would be elected to the second seat alongside Bruce. However, the appearance of a third Liberal candidate, [[Henry Richard]], a nonconformist radical popular in both Merthyr and Aberdare, left Bruce on the defensive and he was ultimately defeated, finishing in third place behind  both Richard and  Fothergill.\n\n== Later political career ==\n[[File:HenryAustinBruce.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue overlooking the Main Building of Cardiff University]]\n\nAfter losing his seat, Bruce was elected for [[Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Renfrewshire]] on 25 January 1869, he was made Home Secretary by [[William Ewart Gladstone]].  His tenure of this office was conspicuous for a reform of the [[licensing laws]], and he was responsible for the [[Licensing Act 1872]], which made the [[magistrate]]s the licensing authority, increased the penalties for misconduct in public-houses and shortened the number of hours for the sale of drink. In 1873 Bruce relinquished the home secretaryship, at Gladstone's request, to become [[Lord President of the Council]], and was elevated to the peerage as [[Baron Aberdare]], of Duffryn in the County of Glamorgan, on 23 August that year.<ref>Burke's Peerage, 107th edn. (2003), p.9-10</ref> Being a Gladstonian Liberal, Aberdare had hoped for a much more radical proposal to keep existing licensee holders for a further ten years, and to prevent any new applicants.  Its unpopularity pricked his nonconformist's conscience, when like Gladstone himself he had a strong leaning towards Temperance.  He had already pursued 'moral improvement' on miners in the regulations attempting to further ban boys from the pits. The Trades Union Act 1871 was another more liberal regime giving further rights to unions, and protection from malicious prosecutions.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3732?docPos=2 | title = Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare | accessdate = 22 December 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of Henry Austin Bruce (4671282).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Caricature of Bruce by [[Carlo Pellegrini (caricaturist)|Carlo Pellegrini]] published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1869 with the caption ''\"He has gained credit by converting himself to the Ballot; he would gain greater credit by converting himself into an ex-secretary of State for the Home Department\"'']]\nThe defeat of the Liberal government in the following year terminated Lord Aberdare's official political life, and he subsequently devoted himself to social, educational and economic questions.  Education became one of Lord Aberdare's main interests in later life. His interest had been shown by the speech on Welsh education which he had made on 5 May 1862. In  1880, he was appointed to chair the Departmental Committee on Intermediate and Higher Education in Wales and Monmouthshire, whose report ultimately led to the Welsh Intermediate Education Act of 1889.<ref name=\"WBO\" /> The report also stimulated the campaign for the provision of university education in  Wales. In 1883, Lord Aberdare was elected the first president of the [[Cardiff University|University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire]].  In his inaugural address he declared that the framework of Welsh education would not be complete until there was a [[University of Wales]]. The University was eventually founded in 1893 and Aberdare became its first chancellor.<ref name=\"WBO\" />\n\nIn 1876 he was elected a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]]; from 1878 to 1891 he was president of the [[Royal Historical Society]].   and in 1881 he became president of both the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the [[Girls' Public Day School Company|Girls' Day School Trust]].<ref name=EB1911 /> In 1888 he headed the commission that established the [[Official Table of Drops]], listing how far a person of a particular weight should be dropped when hanged for a [[capital offence]] (the only method of '[[judicial execution]]' in the United Kingdom at that time), to ensure an instant and painless death, by cleanly breaking the neck between the 2nd and 3rd vertebrae, an 'exacting science', eventually brought to perfection by Chief Executioner [[Albert Pierrepoint]]. Prisoners health, clothing and discipline was a particular concern even at the end of his career.  In the Lords he spoke at some length to the Home Affairs Committee chaired by Arthur Balfour about the prison rules system.<ref>{{citation| url =http://parlipapers.proquest.com/parlipapers/result/pqpdocumentview?accountid=15133&groupid=94436&pgId=3b9ca55d-4995-45b4-bf64-7d64518a9344&rsId=1588C65E621 | title= Prison Rules Inquiry | date= 16 April 1889 | accessdate = 22 December 2016 }}</ref> Aberdare had always maintained a healthy skepticism about intemperate working-classes; in 1878 urging greater vigilance against the vice of excessive drinking, he took evidence on miners and railway colliers habitual imbibing.

The defeat of the Licensing Bill by the Tory 'beerage' and publicans was drafted to limit hours and protect the public, but it persuaded a convinced Anglican forever more of the iniquities.\n\nIn 1882 he began a connection with West Africa which lasted the rest of his life, by accepting the chairmanship of the [[National African Company]], formed by [[George Taubman Goldie|Sir George Goldie]], which in 1886 received a charter under the title of the [[Royal Niger Company]] and in 1899 was taken over by the British government, its territories being constituted the protectorate of [[Nigeria]]. West African affairs, however, by no means exhausted Lord Aberdare's energies, and it was principally through his efforts that a charter was in 1894 obtained for the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire,a constituent institution of the University of Wales.

They are a type of [[extremophile]] organisms.  The name comes from the Greek word for \"salt-loving\". While most halophiles are classified into the [[Archaea]] domain, there are also [[bacteria]]l halophiles and some [[eukaryota]], such as the [[alga]] ''[[Dunaliella salina]]'' or [[fungus]] ''[[Wallemia ichthyophaga]]''. Some well-known species give off a red color from carotenoid compounds, notably [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. Halophiles can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean, such as the [[Great Salt Lake]] in Utah, [[Owens Lake]] in California, the [[Dead Sea]], and in [[evaporation pond]]s.\n\n== Classification ==\nHalophiles are categorized as slight, moderate, or extreme, by the extent of their [[halotolerance]]. Slight halophiles prefer 0.3 to 0.8 M (1.7 to 4.8%\u2014seawater is 0.6 M or 3.5%), moderate halophiles 0.8 to 3.4 M (4.7 to 20%), and extreme halophiles 3.4 to 5.1 M (20 to 30%) salt content.<ref name=Ollivier>{{cite journal | last1 = Ollivier | first1 = B. | last2 = Caumette | first2 = P. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = J-L. | last4 = Mah | first4 = R. | year = 1994 | title = Anaerobic bacteria from hypersaline environments | url = | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 58 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201338 | pmc = 372951 | pmid=8177169}}</ref>  Halophiles require sodium chloride (salt) for growth, in contrast to halotolerant organisms, which do not require salt but can grow under saline conditions.\n\n== Lifestyle ==\nHigh salinity represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy. Most halophilic and all [[halotolerance|halotolerant]] organisms expend energy to exclude salt from their [[cytoplasm]] to avoid protein aggregation ('[[salting out]]'). To survive the high salinities, halophiles employ two differing strategies to prevent [[desiccation]] through [[osmosis|osmotic]] movement of water out of their cytoplasm. Both strategies work by increasing the internal [[osmolarity]] of the cell. In the first (which is employed by the majority of halophilic bacteria, some [[archaea]], [[yeast]]s, [[algae]] and [[fungi]]), [[organic compounds]] are accumulated in the cytoplasm\u2014[[osmoprotectant]]s which are known as compatible solutes. These can be either synthesised or accumulated from the environment.<ref name=Santos>{{cite journal | last1 = Santos | first1 = H. | last2 = da Costa | first2 = M.S. | year = 2002 | title = Compatible solutes of organisms that live in hot saline environments | url = | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 501\u2013509 | doi=10.1046/j.1462-2920.2002.00335.x}}</ref> The most common compatible solutes are [[pH|neutral]] or [[zwitterionic]], and include [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar]]s, [[polyol]]s, [[betaine]]s, and [[ectoine]]s, as well as derivatives of some of these compounds.\n\nThe second, more radical, adaptation involves the selective influx of [[potassium]] (K<sup>+</sup>) ions into the cytoplasm. This adaptation is restricted to the moderately halophilic bacterial order [[Halanaerobiales]], the extremely halophilic archaeal family [[Halobacteriaceae]], and the extremely halophilic bacterium ''[[Salinibacter ruber]]''. The presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests [[convergent evolution]] of this strategy, it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer.<ref name=Santos/> The primary reason for this is the entire intracellular machinery (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high salt levels, whereas in the compatible solute adaptation, little or no adjustment is required to intracellular macromolecules; in fact, the compatible solutes often act as more general stress protectants, as well as just osmoprotectants.<ref name=Santos/>\n\nOf particular note are the extreme halophiles or [[haloarchaea]] (often known as [[halobacteria]]), a group of archaea, which require at least a 2 M salt concentration and are usually found in saturated solutions (about 36% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)#Usage in biology|w/v]] salts). These are the primary inhabitants of salt lakes, inland seas, and evaporating ponds of seawater, such as the deep [[saltern]]s, where they tint the water column and sediments bright colors. These species  most likely perish if they are exposed to anything other than a very high-concentration, salt-conditioned environment. These prokaryotes require salt for growth. The high concentration of sodium chloride in their environment limits the availability of oxygen for respiration. Their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged [[amino acid]]s on their surfaces, allowing the retention of water molecules around these components. They are [[heterotroph]]s that normally respire by aerobic means. Most halophiles are unable to survive outside their high-salt native environments. Indeed, many cells are so fragile that when placed in distilled water, they immediately [[cytolysis|lyse]] from the change in osmotic conditions.\n\nHalophiles may use a variety of energy sources. They can be aerobic or anaerobic.

His father, Arthur Simon (1881\u20131948), was an electrical engineer who had come to the United States from [[Germany]] in 1903 after earning his engineering degree from the [[Technische Hochschule]] of [[Darmstadt]].<ref>Simon 1991, p.3, 23</ref> An inventor who was granted \"several dozen patents\", his father also was an independent patent attorney.<ref>Simon 1991 p. 20</ref> His mother, Edna Marguerite Merkel, was an accomplished pianist whose ancestors had come from [[Prague]] and [[Cologne]].<ref name=\"Simon 1991 p.3\">Simon 1991 p.3</ref> His European ancestors had been piano makers, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[vintner]]s. Simon's father was Jewish and his mother came from a family with Jewish, Lutheran, and Catholic backgrounds.<ref name=\"Simon 1991 p.3\"/> Simon called himself an atheist.<ref>{{cite book| title= Herbert A. Simon: The Bounds of Reason in Modern America|year=2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801880254|page=22|author=Hunter Crowther-Heyck|quote=His secular, scientific values came well before he was old enough to make such calculating career decisions. For example, while still in middle school, Simon wrote a letter to the editor of the ''Milwaukee Journal'' defending the civil liberties of atheists, and by high school he was \"certain\" that he was \"religiously an atheist\", a conviction that never wavered.}}</ref>\n\nSimon was educated in the Milwaukee public school system, where he developed an interest in science. He found schoolwork to be interesting and easy. Unlike many children, Simon was exposed to the idea that human behavior could be studied scientifically at a relatively young age due to the influence of his mother's younger brother, Harold Merkel, who had studied economics at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] under [[John R. Commons]]. Through his uncle's books on economics and psychology, Simon discovered the social sciences. Among his earliest influences, Simon has cited [[Richard T. Ely|Richard Ely]]'s economics textbook, [[Norman Angell]]'s ''[[The Great Illusion]]'', and [[Henry George]]'s ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''. At that time, Simon argued \"from conviction, rather than cussedness\" in favor of George's controversial \"[[Georgism|single tax]]\" on land rents.<ref name=\"Velupillai, Kumaraswamy 2000\">Velupillai, Kumaraswamy. ''Computable Economics: The Arne Ryde Memorial Lectures''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nIn 1933, Simon entered the [[University of Chicago]], and following those early influences, he studied the social sciences and mathematics. He was interested in biology, but chose not to study it because of his \"color-blindness and awkwardness in the laboratory\".<ref>Simon 1991 p. 39</ref> He chose instead to focus on [[political science]] and [[economics]]. His most important mentor was [[Henry Schultz]], an [[Econometrics|econometrician]] and [[mathematical economist]].<ref name=nobelAutoBiog/>  Simon received both his B.A. (1936) and his Ph.D. (1943) in political science, from the University of Chicago, where he studied under [[Harold Lasswell]], Nicholas Rashevsky, [[Rudolf Carnap]], Henry Schultz, and [[Charles Edward Merriam]].<ref>Augier & March 2001</ref>\n\nAfter enrolling in a course on \"Measuring Municipal Governments\", Simon was invited to be a research assistant for Clarence Ridley, with whom he coauthored ''Measuring Municipal Activities'' in 1938.<ref>Simon 1991 p. 64</ref> Eventually his studies led him to the field of [[Organizational behavior|organizational]] [[decision-making]], which would become the subject of his doctoral dissertation.\n\n==Academic career==\nAfter graduating with his undergraduate degree, Simon obtained a research assistantship in municipal administration which turned into a directorship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nFrom 1942 to 1949, Simon was a professor of political science and also served as department chairman at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in [[Chicago]]. There, he began participating in the seminars held by the staff of the [[Cowles Commission]] who at that time included [[Trygve Haavelmo]], [[Jacob Marschak]], and [[Tjalling Koopmans]]. He thus began an in-depth study of economics in the area of [[Institutional economics|institutionalism]]. Marschak brought Simon in to assist in the study he was currently undertaking with [[Sam Schurr]] of the \"prospective economic effects of [[atomic energy]]\".<ref name=\"nobel autobio\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/simon-bio.html|title=Herbert A.

In 1949, Simon became a professor of administration and chairman of the Department of Industrial Management at [[Carnegie Tech]] (later to become [[Carnegie Mellon University]]). Simon later also<ref>Simon 1991 p. 136</ref> taught [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] in the same university,<ref name=\"nobel autobio\" /> (occasionally visiting other universities.<ref>[http://philosophy.princeton.edu/about/faculty-1949 \"Princeton University, Department Of Philosophy, Faculty Since 1949\"], at philosophy.princeton.edu accessed 2014-Oct-13</ref>).\n\n==Personal life and interests==\nSimon married Dorothea Pye in 1938. Their marriage lasted 63 years until his death from a cancerous tumor. In January 2001, Simon underwent surgery at UPMC Presbyterian to remove a cancerous tumor in his abdomen. Although the surgery was successful, Simon later succumbed to the complications that followed. They had three children, Katherine, Peter, and Barbara. His wife died in 2002.<ref name=DorotheaSObit/>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1955, Simon studied mathematical economics and during this time, together with [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]], discovered and proved the [[Hawkins\u2013Simon theorem]] on the \"conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input-output matrices\". He also developed theorems on near-decomposability and aggregation. Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations, by 1954 Simon determined that the best way to study problem-solving was to simulate it with computer programs, which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition. Founded during the 1950s, he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimon had a keen interest in the arts, as he was a pianist.

In this book he based his concepts with an approach that recognized multiple factors that contribute to decision making. His organization and administration interest allowed him to not only serve three times as a university department chairman, but he also played a big part in the creation of the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] in 1948; administrative team that administered aid to the [[Marshall Plan]] for the U.S. government, serving on President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s Science Advisory Committee, and also the [[National Academy of Science]].<ref name=\"nobel autobio\"/> Simon has made a great number of contributions to both economic analysis and applications. Because of this, his work can be found in a number of economic literary works, making contributions to areas such as mathematical economics including theorem, human rationality, behavioral study of firms, theory of casual ordering, and the analysis of the [[parameter identification problem]] in econometrics.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[William Baumol|William J.

Barnard and H. A. Simon. (1947). ''Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-making Processes in Administrative Organization''. Macmillan, New York.</ref> first published in 1947, and updated across the years was based on Simon's doctoral dissertation.<ref name=\"Simon1976\">{{Harvnb|Simon|1976}}</ref> It served as the foundation for his life's work. The centerpiece of this book is the behavioral and cognitive processes of humans making rational choices, that is, decisions. By his definition, an operational administrative decision should be correct and efficient, and it must be practical to implement with a set of coordinated means.<ref name=\"Simon1976\"/>\n\t\nSimon recognised that a theory of administration is largely a theory of human decision making, and as such must be based on both economics and on psychology. He states:\n\n{{Quotation|[If] there were no limits to human rationality administrative theory would be barren. It would consist of the single precept: Always select that alternative, among those available, which will lead to the most complete achievement of your goals.<ref name=\"Simon1976\"/> (p xxviii)}}\n\nContrary to the \"[[homo economicus]]\" stereotype, Simon argued that alternatives and consequences may be partly known, and means and ends imperfectly differentiated, incompletely related, or poorly detailed.<ref name=\"Simon1976\"/>\n\nSimons defined the task of rational decision making is to select the alternative that results in the more preferred set of all the possible consequences. Correctness of administrative decisions was thus measured by:\n* Adequacy of achieving the desired objective\n* Efficiency with which the result was obtained\n\nThe task of choice was divided into three required steps:<ref>{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=67}}</ref>\n\n* Identifying and listing all the alternatives\n* Determining all consequences resulting from each of the alternatives;\n* Comparing the accuracy and efficiency of each of these sets of consequences\n\nAny given individual or organization attempting to implement this model in a real situation would be unable to comply with the three requirements. Simon argued that knowledge of all alternatives, or all consequences that follow from each alternative is impossible in many realistic cases.<ref name=\"BarnardSimon1947\"/>\n\nSimon attempted to determine the techniques and/or behavioral processes that a person or organization could bring to bear to achieve approximately the best result given limits on rational decision making.<ref name=Simon1976/> Simon writes:\n\n{{quote|The human being striving for rationality and restricted within the limits of his knowledge has developed some working procedures that partially overcome these difficulties. These procedures consist in assuming that he can isolate from the rest of the world a closed system containing a limited number of variables and a limited range of consequences.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=82}}</ref>}}\n\nSimon therefore, describes work in terms of an economic framework, conditioned on human cognitive limitations: Economic man and Administrative man.\n\n''Administrative Behavior'' addresses a wide range of human behaviors, cognitive abilities, management techniques, personnel policies, training goals and procedures, specialized roles, criteria for evaluation of accuracy and efficiency, and all of the ramifications of communication processes. Simon is particularly interested in how these factors influence the making of decisions, both directly and indirectly.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimons argued that the two outcomes of a choice require monitoring and that many members of the organization would be expected to focus on adequacy, but that administrative management must pay particular attention to the efficiency with which the desired result was obtained.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimon followed [[Chester Barnard]] who pointed out that \"the decisions that an individual makes as a member of an organization are quite distinct from his personal decisions\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Barnard|1938|p=77}} cited by {{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 202\u2013203}}</ref> Personal choices may be determined whether an individual joins a particular organization, and continue to be made in his or her extra\u2013organizational private life. As a member of an organization, however, that individual makes decisions not in relationship to personal needs and results, but in an impersonal sense as part of the organizational intent, purpose, and effect. Organizational inducements, rewards, and sanctions are all designed to form, strengthen, and maintain this identification.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimon<ref name=\"Simon1976\"/> saw two universal elements of human social behavior as key to creating the possibility of organizational behavior in human individuals: Authority (addressed in Chapter VII\u2014The Role of Authority) and in Loyalties and Identification (Addressed in Chapter X: Loyalties, and Organizational Identification).\n\nAuthority is a well-studied, primary mark of organizational behavior, straightforwardly defined in the organizational context as the ability and right of an individual of higher rank to guide the decisions of an individual of lower rank. The actions, attitudes, and relationships of the dominant and subordinate individuals constitute components of role behavior that may vary widely in form, style, and content, but do not vary in the expectation of obedience by the one of superior status, and willingness to obey from the subordinate.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nLoyalty was defined by Simon as the \"process whereby the individual substitutes organizational objectives (service objectives or conservation objectives) for his own aims as the value-indices which determine his organizational decisions\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 218}}</ref> This entailed evaluating alternative choices in terms of their consequences for the group rather than only for onself or ones family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp= 206}}</ref>\n\nDecisions can be complex admixtures of facts and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted in the exercise of authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following [[Lasswell]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Lasswell|1935|pp=29\u201351}} cited by {{Harvnb|Simon|1976|pp=205}}</ref> he states that \"a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of their consequences for the specified group\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Simon|1976|p=205}}</ref> A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimon has been critical of traditional economics' elementary understanding of decision-making, and argues it \"is too quick to build an idealistic, unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then prescribe on the basis of such unrealistic picture\".<ref>Simon, Herbert. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel-perspectives/en/herbert-simon.html{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> His contributions to research in the area of administrative decision-making have become increasingly mainstream in the business community.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\nSimon was a pioneer in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], creating with [[Allen Newell]] the [[Logic Theorist|Logic Theory Machine]] (1956) and the [[General Problem Solver]] (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the [[Information Processing Language]] (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, [[Cliff Shaw]], and Simon. [[Donald Knuth]] mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the [[linked list]] originally called \"NSS memory\" for its inventors.<ref>Volume 1 of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''</ref> In 1957, Simon predicted that [[computer chess]] would surpass human chess abilities within \"ten years\" when, in reality, that transition took about forty years.<ref>[http://www.ddj.com/hpc-high-performance-computing/184405171 Computer Chess: The Drosophila of AI] October 30, 2002</ref>\n\nIn the early 1960s psychologist [[Ulric Neisser]] asserted that while machines are capable of replicating \"cold cognition\" behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate \"[[hot cognition]]\" behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions. Simon responded to Neisser's views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition,<ref>Herbert A. Simon, [http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=346072 ''A Theory of Emotional Behavior'']. Carnegie Mellon University Complex Information Processing (CIP) Working Paper #55, June 1, 1963.</ref> which he updated in 1967 and published in ''Psychological Review''.<ref>Herbert A. Simon, [http://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=34512 \"Motivational and Emotional Controls of Cognition\"]. ''Psychological Review'', 1967, Vol. 74, No. 1, 29-39.</ref> Simon's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years, but subsequent work on emotions by [[Aaron Sloman|Sloman]] and [[Rosalind Picard|Picard]] helped refocus attention on Simon's paper and eventually, made it highly influential on the topic.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nSimon also collaborated with [[James G. March]] on several works in [[organization theory]].<ref name=edward2001/>\n\nWith [[Allen Newell]], Simon developed a [[theory]] for the [[simulation]] of human [[problem solving]] behavior using production rules.<ref>Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, ''Human Problem Solving'', 1972</ref> The study of human [[problem solving]] required new kinds of human measurements and, with [[Anders Ericsson]], Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis.<ref>K. A. Ericsson and H. A. Simon, ''Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data'', 1993</ref> Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 [[chunking (psychology)|chunks]] of information. A [[chess]] [[expert]] was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.<ref>Chase and Simon. \"Perception in Chess\". ''[[Cognitive Psychology]]'' Volume 4, 1973</ref>\n\nHe was awarded the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Turing Award]], along with [[Allen Newell]], in 1975. \"In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with [[Cliff Shaw|J. C. (Cliff) Shaw]] at the [[RAND Corporation]], and {{Sic|nolink=y|subsequent|ially|expected=subsequently}} with numerous faculty and student colleagues at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], they have made basic contributions to [[artificial intelligence]], the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/simon_1031467.cfm|title=Herbert A.

He is responsible for the concept of organizational decision-making as it is known today. He also was the first to discuss this concept in terms of uncertainty; i.e., it is impossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision. While this notion was not entirely new, Simon is best known for its origination. It was in this area that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Press Release: Studies of Decision-Making Lead to Prize in Economics |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1978/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=11 May 2014|date=16 October 1978}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Cowles Commission]], Simon's main goal was to link economic theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of [[general equilibrium]] and [[econometrics]]. He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate that began in the 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit maximization was not accomplished, in part, because of the lack of complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only \"[[bounded rationality]]\" and must make decisions by \"[[satisficing]]\", or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make them happy enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility theory]].\n\nFurther, Simon emphasized that psychologists invoke a \"procedural\" definition of rationality, whereas economists employ a \"substantive\" definition. Gustavos Barros argued that the procedural rationality concept does not have a significant presence in the economics field and has never had nearly as much weight as the concept of bounded rationality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barros|first1=Gustavo|title=Herbert A. Simon and the Concept of Rationality: Boundaries and Procedures|journal=Brazilian Journal of Political Economy|date=2010|volume=30|issue=3|pages=455\u2013472|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/rep/v30n3/a06v30n3.pdf}}</ref> However, in an earlier article, Bhargava (1997) noted the importance of Simon's arguments and emphasized that there are several applications of the \"procedural\" definition of rationality in econometric analyses of data on health. In particular, economists should employ \"auxiliary assumptions\" that reflect the knowledge in the relevant biomedical fields, and guide the specification of econometric models for health outcomes.\n\nSimon was also known for his research on [[industrial organization]]. He determined that the internal organization of firms and the external business decisions thereof, did not conform to the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical theories]] of \"rational\" decision-making. Simon wrote many articles on the topic over the course of his life, mainly focusing on the issue of decision-making within the behavior of what he termed \"[[bounded rationality]]\". \"Rational behavior, in economics, means that individuals maximize their utility function under the constraints they face (e.g., their budget constraint, limited choices, ...) in pursuit of their self-interest. This is reflected in the theory of [[subjective expected utility]]. The term, [[bounded rationality]], is used to designate rational choice that takes into account the cognitive limitations of both knowledge and cognitive capacity. Bounded rationality is a central theme in [[behavioral economics]]. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision-making process influences decisions. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory\".{{cite quote|date=September 2013}}\n\nSimon determined that the best way to study these areas was through [[computer simulation]]s. As such, he developed an interest in [[computer science]]. Simon's main interests in computer science were in artificial intelligence, [[human\u2013computer interaction]], principles of the organization of humans and machines as information processing systems, the use of computers to study (by modeling) philosophical problems of the nature of intelligence and of [[epistemology]], and the social implications of computer technology.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn his youth, Simon took an interest in [[land economics]] and [[Georgism]], an idea known at the time as \"single tax\".<ref name=\"Velupillai, Kumaraswamy 2000\"/> The system is meant to redistribute unearned [[economic rent]] to the public and improve land use. In 1979, Simon still maintained these ideas and argued that [[land value tax]] should replace taxes on wages.<ref>Simon, Herbert.

Simon Collected Papers, Carnegie Mellon University Library. Quote: \"It is clearly preferable to impose the additional cost on land by increasing the land tax, rather than to increase the wage tax\"</ref>\n\nSome of Simon's economic research was directed toward understanding technological change in general and the information processing revolution in particular.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Pedagogy==\nSimon's work has strongly influenced [[John Mighton]], developer of a program that has achieved significant success in improving mathematics performance among elementary and high school students.<ref name=\"tvo\">\"John Mighton: The Ubiquitous Bell Curve\", in ''[[Big Ideas (TV series)|Big Ideas]]'' on [[TVOntario]], broadcast 1:30 a.m., 6 November 2010.</ref> Mighton cites a 2000 paper by Simon and two coauthors that counters arguments by French mathematics educator, [[Guy Brousseau]], and others suggesting that excessive practice hampers children's understanding:<ref name=\"tvo\" />\n\n{{Quotation|[The] criticism of practice (called \"drill and kill,\" as if this phrase constituted empirical evaluation) is prominent in constructivist writings. Nothing flies more in the face of the last 20 years of research than the assertion that practice is bad. All evidence, from the laboratory and from extensive case studies of professionals, indicates that real competence only comes with extensive practice... In denying the critical role of practice one is denying children the very thing they need to achieve real competence. The instructional task is not to \"kill\" motivation by demanding drill, but to find tasks that provide practice while at the same time sustaining interest.|[[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John R.

Hematite crystallizes in the [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral lattice system]], and it has the same [[crystal]] structure as [[ilmenite]] and [[corundum]]. Hematite and ilmenite form a complete [[solid solution]] at temperatures above {{convert|950|C|F}}.\n\nHematite is colored black to steel or silver-gray, brown to reddish brown, or red. It is [[mining|mined]] as the [[Iron ore#Hematite ore|main ore of iron]]. Varieties include ''kidney ore'', ''martite'' ([[pseudomorph]]s after [[magnetite]]), ''iron rose'' and ''specularite'' (specular hematite). While the forms of hematite vary, they all have a rust-red streak. Hematite is harder than pure iron, but much more brittle. [[Maghemite]] is a hematite- and [[magnetite]]-related oxide mineral.\n\n[[File:Hematite - Titanomagnitite.jpg|thumb|upright|A microscopic picture of hematite ]]\nHuge deposits of hematite are found in [[banded iron formation]]s. Gray hematite is typically found in places that can have still standing water or mineral [[hot spring]]s, such as those in [[Yellowstone National Park]] in [[North America]]. The mineral can [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of water and collect in layers at the bottom of a lake, spring, or other standing water. Hematite can also occur without water, however, usually as the result of [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity.\n\n[[Clay]]-sized hematite crystals can also occur as a secondary mineral formed by [[weathering]] processes in [[soil]], and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as [[goethite]], is responsible for the red color of many [[tropical]], ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.\n[[Image:Hematite structure.jpg|thumb|Crystal structure of hematite]]\n\n==Etymology and history==\n{{Main article|Ochre}}\nThe name hematite is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for blood [[wikt:\u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1|\u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1]] ''haima,'' due to the red coloration found in some varieties of hematite<ref name=\":0\" />. The color of hematite lends itself to use as a [[pigment]].

Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]], but that the low symmetry of the [[Ion#Anions and cations|cation]] sites allows [[spin\u2013orbit coupling]] to cause [[spin canting|canting of the moments]] when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the [[anisotropy]] which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy.<ref>{{Cite journal| author = Dzyaloshinsky, I. | title= A thermodynamic theory of \"weak\" ferromagnetism of antiferromagnetics| journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids| volume=4| page = 241|year =1958|doi= 10.1016/0022-3697(58)90076-3| issue = 4|bibcode = 1958JPCS....4..241D }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| author = Moriya, T. |title= Anisotropic Superexchange Interaction and Weak Ferromagnetism|journal = Phys.

The origin of these high coercivity values has been interpreted as a consequence of the subparticle structure induced by the different particle and [[crystallite]] size growth rates at increasing annealing temperature. These differences in the growth rates are translated into a progressive development of a subparticle structure at the nanoscale.

Megafauna outside of the [[African continent]], which did not evolve alongside humans, proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation, and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the Earth (additionally, many [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|African species have also gone extinct in the Holocene]]). These extinctions, occurring near the [[Pleistocene]]\u2013[[Holocene]] boundary, are sometimes referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]].\n\nThe arrival of humans on different continents coincides with megafaunal extinction. The most popular theory is that human overhunting of species added to existing stress conditions. Although there is debate regarding how much human predation affected their decline, certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity, such as the extinction events of [[List of extinct animals of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[List of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands|Hawaii]]. Aside from humans, [[climate change]] may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions, especially at the end of the Pleistocene.\n\nEcologically, humanity has been noted as an unprecedented \"global superpredator\" that consistently preys on the adults of other [[apex predator]]s, and has [[human impact on the environment|worldwide effect]]s on [[food web]]s. There have been extinctions of species on every [[land mass]] and in every [[ocean]]: there are many famous examples [[List of African animals extinct in the Holocene|within Africa]], [[List of Asian animals extinct in the Holocene|Asia]], [[List of extinct animals of Europe|Europe]], [[List of extinct animals of Australia|Australia]], [[List of North American animals extinct in the Holocene|North]] and [[List of South American animals extinct in the Holocene|South America]], and on smaller islands. Overall, the Holocene extinction can be linked to the [[human impact on the environment]]. The Holocene extinction continues into the 21st century, with [[Meat#Environmental impact|meat consumption]], [[overfishing]], [[ocean acidification]] and the [[decline in amphibian populations]] being a few broader examples of an almost universal, [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[Human impact on the environment#Biodiversity|decline in biodiversity]].

This piked position is the classic look of Hollywood with the back straight and a slight forward tilt.  The Hollywood style is also a [[slotted dance]], meaning the follower travels in a straight line instead of the more elliptical or circular [[Savoy-style Lindy Hop]].\n\nA popular variation of Hollywood-Style Lindy Hop called '''LA-style Lindy Hop''' has a few technical changes in the [[footwork (dance)|footwork]] and fewer steps. The steps are shortened or \"cheated\" to create this look. The style is geared towards performance and is heavily based on short choreographies.

He convened a Commission of Inquiry, known as the [[Brent Commission]], for the purpose of examining alternatives to a licensing system for opium addicts. The Commission recommended that narcotics should be subject to international control. The recommendations of the Brent Commission were endorsed by the [[United States Department of State]] and in 1906 President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] called for an international conference, the [[International Opium Commission]], which was held in Shanghai in February 1909. A second conference was held at [[The Hague]] in May 1911, and out of it came the first international drug control treaty, the [[International Opium Convention]] of 1912.\n\n=== Domestic Background ===\nIn the 1800s opiates and cocaine were mostly unregulated drugs. In the 1890s the [[Sears & Roebuck]] catalogue, which was distributed to millions of Americans homes, offered a syringe and a small amount of cocaine for $1.50.<ref name=\"white\" />  On the other hand, as early as 1880 some states and localities had already passed laws against smoking opium, at least in public.<ref>See for example this [http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH18790118.2.11&srpos=3&e=--1866---1900--en--20-LAH%2cLASTAR-1-byDA-txt-txIN-smoking+opium-------1 article] in the Los Angeles Herald, mentioning the city law against opium smoking.

In 1900, the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' published an editorial stating, \"Negroes in the South are reported as being addicted to a new form of vice \u2013 that of 'cocaine sniffing' or the 'coke habit.'\"  Some newspapers later claimed cocaine use caused blacks to rape white women and was improving their pistol marksmanship.<ref>Meantioned in an 8 February 1914, New York New York Times article titled \"Negro Cocaine 'Fiends' Are a New Menace.\" by Edward Huntington Williams, M.D [http://lh.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/lh/article/download/5410/4605]</ref> Chinese immigrants were blamed for importing the opium-smoking habit to the U.S. The 1903 blue-ribbon citizens' panel, the Committee on the Acquirement of the Drug Habit, concluded, \"If the Chinaman cannot get along without his dope we can get along without him.\"\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed Dr. [[Hamilton Wright]] as the first Opium Commissioner of the United States in 1908. In 1909, Wright attended the International Opium Commission in Shanghai as the American delegate. He was accompanied by Charles Henry Brent, the Episcopal Bishop. On March 12, 1911, Dr. Wright was quoted as follows in an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"Of all the nations of the world, the United States consumes most habit-forming drugs per capita. Opium, the most pernicious drug known to humanity, is surrounded, in this country, with far fewer safeguards than any other nation in Europe fences it with.\"<ref name=\"hamilton\" /> Wright further claimed that \"it has been authoritatively stated that cocaine is often the direct incentive to the crime of rape by the negroes of the South and other sections of the country,\" though he failed to mention specifically ''which'' authorities had stated that, and did not provide any evidence for his claim.<ref>Wright, Hamilton.

Web. 17 Aug. 2014.</ref>\n\n=== Effect ===\n\nEnforcement began in 1915.<ref>[http://enforcement.lawin.org/drug-enforcement-administration Drug Enforcement Administration | Enforcement | Encyclopedia of Law].</ref>\n\nThe act appears to be concerned about the marketing of opiates. However a clause applying to doctors allowed distribution \"in the course of his professional practice only.\" This clause was interpreted after 1917 to mean that a doctor could not prescribe opiates to an addict, since addiction was not considered a disease. A number of doctors were arrested and some were imprisoned. The medical profession quickly learned not to supply opiates to addicts. In ''United States v. Doremus'', 249 U.S. 86 (1919), the Supreme Court ruled that the Harrison Act was constitutional, and in ''[[Webb v. United States]]'', 249 U.S. 96, 99 (1919) that physicians could not prescribe narcotics solely for maintenance.<ref name=\"kand\" />\n\nThe impact of diminished supply was obvious by mid-1915. A 1918 commission called for sterner law enforcement, while newspapers published sensational articles about addiction-related crime waves.<ref>Albert F. Nathan. \"Drug Fiends Make 'Crime Wave.'\" ''Los Angeles Times'' (1886\u20131922). Los Angeles, Calif.: Nov 30, 1919. p. II1 (2 pages)</ref> Congress responded by tightening up the Harrison Act\u2014the importation of [[heroin]] for any purpose was banned in 1924.\n\nAfter other complementary laws (for example implementing the Uniform State Narcotic Act in 1932), and other actions by the government the number of addicts of opium started to decrease fast from 1925 to a level that in 1945 that was about one tenth of the level in 1914.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe use of the term '[[narcotic]]s' in the title of the act to describe not just opiates but also [[cocaine]]\u2014which is a central nervous system stimulant, not a narcotic\u2014initiated a precedent of frequent legislative and judicial misclassification of various substances as 'narcotics'. Today, law enforcement agencies, popular media, the [[United Nations]], other nations and even some medical practitioners can be observed applying the term very broadly and often pejoratively in reference to a wide range of illicit substances, regardless of the more precise definition existing in medical contexts. For this reason, however, 'narcotic' has come to mean any illegally used drug, but it is useful as a shorthand for referring to a controlled drug in a context where its legal status is more important than its physiological effects.\n\nThe remaining effect of this act, which has largely been superseded by the [[Controlled Substances Act of 1970]], is the warning \"*Warning: May be habit forming\" on labels, package inserts, and other places where ingredients are listed in the case of many [[opioids]], [[barbiturates]], medicinal formulations of [[cocaine]], and [[chloral hydrate]].\n\nThe act also marks the beginning of the creation of the modern, criminal drug addict and the American [[black market]] for drugs. Within five years the Rainey Committee, a Special Committee on Investigation appointed by [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[William Gibbs McAdoo]] and led by Congressman T.

Saddles, stirrups, bridles, halters, reins, [[Bit (horse)|bits]], harnesses, [[Martingale (tack)|martingales]], and [[breastplate]]s are all forms of horse tack. Equipping a horse is often referred to as '''tacking up'''. A room to store such equipment, usually near or in a [[stable]], is a '''tack room'''.\n\n== Saddles ==\n{{main|Saddle}}\n[[Image:mounted-police.jpg|thumb|A horse equipped with a saddle for mounted police.]]\nSaddles  are seats for the [[horseback riding|rider]], fastened to the horse's [[Back (horse)|back]] by means of a ''[[Girth (tack)|girth]]'' (English-style riding), known as a ''cinch'' in the Western US, a wide [[strap]] that goes around the horse at a point about four inches behind the forelegs. Some western saddles will also have a second strap known as a ''flank'' or ''back cinch'' that fastens at the rear of the saddle and goes around the widest part of the horse's belly.<ref name=Catalog167>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 167-178</ref>\n\nIt is important that the saddle be comfortable for both the rider and the horse as an improperly fitting saddle may create pressure points on the horse's back muscle ([[Latissimus dorsi]]) and cause the horse pain and can lead to the horse, rider, or both getting injured.\n\nThere are many types of saddle, each specially designed for its given task.\nSaddles are usually divided into two major categories: \"[[English saddle]]s\" and \"[[Western saddle]]s\" according to the riding discipline they are used in. Other types of saddles, such as [[Horse racing|racing]] saddles, [[Australian Stock Saddle|Australian saddle]]s, [[sidesaddle]]s and [[Endurance riding|endurance]] saddles do not necessarily fit neatly in either category.<ref name=Catalog167/>\n\n===Saddle accessories===\n*[[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplate]] or breastcollar:  Prevents saddles of all styles from sliding sideways or backward on a horse's back\n*[[Surcingle]]\n*[[Crupper]]\n*[[Horse harness|Breeching]], also called \"britching\"\n*[[Saddle blanket]] or numnah\n\n=== Stirrups ===\n{{main|Stirrup}}\n[[Stirrup]]s are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle. They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's feet to get stuck in them.  If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away.  To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.  First, most riders wear [[riding boot]]s with a heel and a smooth sole. Next, some saddles, particularly [[English saddle]]s, have safety bars that allow a [[Stirrup#Stirrup leathers|stirrup leather]] to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider.  Other precautions are done with stirrup design itself.  [[Western saddle]]s have wide stirrup treads that make it more difficult for the foot to become trapped.  A number of saddle styles incorporate a [[tapedero]], which is  covering over the front of the stirrup that keeps the foot from sliding all the way through the stirrup.  The English stirrup (or \"iron\") has several design variations which are either shaped to allow the rider's foot to slip out easily or are closed with a very heavy rubber band.<ref name=Catalog185>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 185-187</ref>  The invention of stirrups was of great historic significance in [[horses in warfare|mounted combat]], giving the rider secure foot support while on horseback.\n\n==Headgear==\n[[Image:Horse Wearing Navy Blue Nylon Halter.jpg|thumb|right|A nylon halter/headcollar]]\n\n''[[Bridle]]s'', [[hackamore]]s, ''[[halter]]s'' or ''headcollars'', and similar equipment consist of various arrangements of straps around the horse's head, and are used for control and [[animal communication|communication]] with the animal.\n\n===Halters===\n{{main|halter}}\n\nA ''[[halter]]'' (US) or ''headcollar'' (UK) (occasionally ''headstall'') consists of a noseband and headstall that buckles around the horse's head and allows the horse to be led or tied.  The lead rope is separate, and it may be short (from six to ten feet, two to three meters) for everyday leading and tying, or much longer (up to {{convert|25|ft|m}}, eight meters) for tasks such as for leading [[packhorse]]s or for picketing a horse out to graze.\n\nSome horses, particularly [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]]s, may have a chain attached to the lead rope and placed over the nose or under the jaw to increase the control provided by a halter while being led.  Most of the time, horses are not ridden with a halter, as it offers insufficient precision and control.  Halters have no bit.<ref name=Ensg384>Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses & Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 384-385</ref>\n\nIn Australian and British English, a ''halter'' is a rope with a spliced running loop around the nose and another over the poll, used mainly for unbroken horses or for [[cattle]].  The lead rope cannot be removed from the halter. A show halter is made from rolled leather and the lead attaches to form the chinpiece of the noseband. These halters are not suitable for paddock usage or in loose stalls.  An ''underhalter'' is a lightweight halter or headcollar which is made with only one small buckle, and can be worn under a bridle for tethering a horse without untacking.\n\n===Bridles===\n{{Main|Bridle}}\nBridles usually have a ''[[bit (horse)|bit]]'' attached to ''reins'' and are used for [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[Driving (horse)|driving]] horses.<ref name=Catalog156>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 156-159</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chestnut Horse With Loose Ring Snaffle Bit.png|thumb|left|An English bridle with cavesson noseband]]\n\n''English Bridles'' have a ''[[caveson|cavesson]]'' style [[noseband]] and are seen in [[English riding]].  Their reins are buckled to one another, and they have little adornment or flashy hardware.<ref name=Catalog156/>\n\n''Western Bridles'' used in [[Western riding]] usually have no [[noseband]], are made of thin bridle leather.  They may have long, separated \"Split\" reins or shorter closed reins, which sometimes include an attached ''[[Romal]]''.  Western bridles are often adorned with silver or other decorative features.<ref name=Catalog156/>\n\n''[[Double bridle]]s'' are a type of English bridle that use two bits in the mouth at once, a snaffle and a curb. The two bits allow the rider to have very precise control of the horse.  As a rule, only very advanced horses and riders use double bridles. Double bridles are usually seen in the top levels of [[dressage]], but also are seen in certain types of show hack and [[Saddle seat]] competition.<ref name=Catalog158/>\n\n===Hackamores and other bitless designs===\n[[Image:BosalHorse.jpg|thumb|A bosal hackamore]]\n{{Main|Hackamore|Bitless bridle}}\nA ''[[hackamore]]'' is a headgear that utilizes a heavy [[noseband]] of some sort, rather than a bit, most often used to train young horses or to go easy on an older horse's mouth.  Hackamores are more often seen in [[western riding]].<ref name=Catalog158>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 158</ref>  Some related styles of headgear  that control a horse with a noseband rather than a bit are known as [[bitless bridle]]s.\n\nThe word \"[[hackamore]]\" is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''j\u00e1quima.''  Hackamores are seen in [[western riding]] disciplines, as well as in [[endurance riding]] and [[English riding]] disciplines such as [[show jumping]] and the stadium phase of [[eventing]].  While the classic [[bosal]]-style hackamore is usually used to start young horses, other designs, such as various [[bitless bridle]]s and the [[mechanical hackamore]] are often seen on mature horses with dental issues that make bit use painful, horses with certain training problems, and on horses with mouth or tongue injuries.  Some riders also like to use them in the winter to avoid putting a frozen metal bit into a horse's mouth.<ref name=Catalog153>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 153</ref>\n\nLike bitted bridles, noseband-based designs can be gentle or harsh, depending on the hands of the rider. It is a myth that a bit is cruel and a hackamore is gentler. The horse's face is very soft and sensitive with many nerve endings.  Misuse of a hackamore can cause swelling on the nose, scraping on the nose and jawbone, and extreme misuse may cause damage to the bones and [[cartilage]] of the horse's head.\n\n===Other headgear===\nA ''[[longeing cavesson]]'' (UK: ''lungeing'') is a special type of halter or noseband used for [[longeing]] a horse. Longeing is the activity of having a horse walk, trot and/or canter in a large circle around the handler at the end of a rope that is 25 to {{convert|30|ft|m}} long. It is used for training and exercise.<ref name=Catalog194>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 194</ref>\n\n== Reins ==\n{{main|Rein}}\n[[Reins]] consist of leather straps or rope attached to the outer ends of a ''bit'' and extend to the rider's or driver's hands. Reins are the means by which a horse rider or driver [[animal communication|communicates]] directional commands to the horse's head. Pulling on the reins can be used to steer or stop the horse. The sides of a horse's mouth are sensitive, so pulling on the reins pulls the bit, which then pulls the horse's head from side to side, which is how the horse is controlled.<ref name=Catalog159>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 159-161</ref>\n\nOn some types of [[Horse harness|harness]]es there might be supporting rings to carry the reins over the horse's back. When pairs of horses are used in drawing a [[wagon]] or [[coach (vehicle)|coach]] it is usual for the outer side of each pair to be connected to reins and the inside of the bits connected by a short bridging strap or rope. The driver carries \"four-in-hand\" or \"six-in-hand\" being the number of reins connecting to the pairs of horses.\n\nA rein may be attached to a halter to lead or guide the horse in a circle for training purposes or to lead a packhorse, but a simple lead rope is more often used for these purposes.  A [[longeing|longe line]] is sometimes called a \"longe rein,\" but it is actually a flat line about {{convert|30|ft|m}} long, usually made of nylon or cotton web, about one inch wide, thus longer and wider than even a driving rein.<ref name=Ensg385>Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses & Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 385-386</ref>\n\nHorses should never be tied by the reins.  Not only do they break easily, but, being attached to a bit in the horse's sensitive mouth, a great deal of pain can be inflicted if a bridled horse sets back against being tied.\n\n==Bits==\n{{Main|Bit (horse)}}\n[[Image:Pelham bit.jpg|thumb|A pelham bit with a jointed mouthpiece]]\nA [[Bit (horse)|bit]] is a device placed in a horse's mouth, kept on a horse's head by means of a headstall. There are many types, each useful for specific types of riding and training.<ref name=Ensg371>Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses & Tack: A Complete One Volume Reference on Horses and Their Care'' Rev. ed. Boston:Houghton Mifflin Co. 1991 {{ISBN|0-395-54413-0}} p. 371-376</ref>\n\nThe mouthpiece of the bit does not rest on the [[horse teeth|teeth of the horse]], but rather rests on the gums or \"bars\" of the horse's mouth in an interdental space behind the front [[incisors]] and in front of the back [[molars]].  It is important that the style of bit is appropriate to the horse's needs and is fitted properly for it to function properly and be as comfortable as possible for the horse.<ref name=Catalog149>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 149-159</ref>\n[[Image:Curb and bradoon.jpg|thumb|left|a curb and snaffle bit shown together on a double bridle]]\nThe basic \"classic\" styles of [[Bit (horse)|bits]] are:\n*[[Curb bit]]\n*[[Snaffle bit]]\n*[[Pelham bit]]\n*[[Double bridle|Weymouth or Double Bridle]]\n\nWhile there are literally hundreds of types of [[bit mouthpiece]]s, [[bit ring]]s and [[bit shank]]s, essentially there are really only two broad categories: direct pressure bits, broadly termed [[snaffle bit]]s; and leverage bits, usually termed [[curb bit|curbs]].\n\nBits that act with direct pressure on the tongue and lips of the bit are in the general category of ''snaffle'' bits. Snaffle bits commonly have a single jointed mouthpiece and act with a nutcracker effect on the bars, tongue and occasionally roof of the mouth.  However, regardless of [[bit mouthpiece|mouthpiece]], any bit that operates only on direct pressure is a \"snaffle\" bit.<ref name=Complete52>Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David & Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 52-58</ref>\n\nLeverage bits have [[bit shank|shanks]] coming off the mouthpiece to create leverage that applies pressure to the [[poll (livestock)|poll]], chin groove and mouth of the horse are in the category of ''curb'' bits. Any bit with shanks that works off of leverage is a \"curb\" bit, regardless of whether the [[bit mouthpiece|mouthpiece]] is solid or jointed.\n\nSome [[bit (horse)|combination or hybrid bits]] combine direct pressure and leverage, such as the [[Kimberwicke|Kimblewick or Kimberwicke]], which adds slight leverage to a two-rein design that resembles a snaffle;<ref name=Complete91>Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David & Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 91-93</ref> and the four rein designs such as the single mouthpiece [[Pelham bit]] and the [[double bridle]], which places a curb and a snaffle bit simultaneously in the horse's mouth.<ref name=Complete87>Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David & Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 87-89</ref>\n\nIn the wrong hands even the mildest bit can hurt the horse. Conversely, a very severe bit, in the right hands, can transmit subtle commands that cause no pain to the horse. Bit commands should be given with only the quietest [[riding aids|movements]] of the hands, and much steering and stopping should be done with the legs and seat.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Harness ==\n{{Main|Horse harness}}\nA [[horse harness]] is a set of devices and straps that attaches a horse to a [[cart]], [[carriage]], [[sledge]] or any other load.  There are two main styles of harnesses - [[breaststrap]] and [[Horse collar|collar and hames]] style.  These differ in how the weight of the load is attached.  Most Harnesses are made from leather, which is the traditional material for harnesses, though some designs are now made of nylon webbing or synthetic biothane.\n\nA breaststrap harness has a wide leather strap going horizontally across the horses' breast, attached to the [[trace (tack)|traces]] and then to the load.  This is used only for lighter loads.  A collar and hames harness has a [[horse collar|collar]] around the horses' neck with wood or metal [[horse collar|hames]] in the collar. The traces attach from the hames to the load.  This type of harness is needed for [[Draft horse|heavy draft]] work.\n\nBoth types will also have a [[bridle]] and [[rein]]s.  A harness that is used to support shafts, such as on a cart pulled by a single horse, will also have a ''saddle'' attached to the harness to help the horse support the shafts and ''breeching'' to brake the forward motion of the vehicle, especially when stopping or moving downhill. Horses guiding vehicles by means of a pole, such as two-horse teams pulling a [[wagon]], a hay-mower, or a [[Wagon|dray]], will have ''pole-straps'' attached to the lower part of the horse collar.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Breastplates and martingales==\n[[Image:Elastic Jumper Breastplate.jpg|thumb|An English-style breastplate with elastic and a running martingale attachment]]\n{{main|Breastplate (tack)|Martingale (tack)}}\n[[Image:Pc trakehner2.jpg|thumb|left|Horse wearing a breastplate]]\n\n[[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]], breastcollars or breastgirths attach to the front of the saddle, cross the horse's chest, and usually have a strap that runs between the horse's front legs and attaches to the girth.  They  keep the saddle from sliding back or sideways. They are usually seen in demanding, fast-paced sports.  They are crucial pieces of safety equipment for [[English riding]] activities requiring jumping, such as [[eventing]], [[show jumping]], [[polo]], and [[fox hunting]].  They are also seen in [[Western riding]] events, particularly in [[rodeo]], [[reining]] and [[cutting (sport)|cutting]], where it is particularly important to prevent a saddle from shifting.  They may also be worn in other [[horse show]] classes for decorative purposes.<ref name=Catalog179>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 179-181</ref>\n\nA [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]] is a piece of equipment that keeps a horse from raising its head too high.  Various styles can be used as a control measure, to prevent the horse from avoiding rider commands by raising its head out of position; or as a safety measure to keep the horse from tossing its head high or hard enough to smack its rider in the face.<ref name=Catalog163>Price, Steven D. (ed.) ''The Whole Horse Catalog: Revised and Updated'' New York:Fireside 1998 {{ISBN|0-684-83995-4}} p. 163-165</ref>\n\nThey are allowed in many types of competition, especially those where speed or jumping may be required, but are not allowed in most \"flat\" classes at [[horse show]]s, though an exception is made in a few classes limited exclusively to young or \"green\" horses who may not yet be fully trained.\n\nMartingales are usually attached to the horse one of two ways.  They are either attached to the center chest ring of a breastplate or, if no breastplate is worn, they are attached by two straps, one that goes around the horse's neck, and the other that attaches to the girth, with the martingale itself beginning at the point in the center of the chest where the neck and girth straps intersect.\n\nMartingale types include:\n\n*German martingale or Market Harborough: This design consists of a split fork that comes up from the chest, runs through the rings of the bit and attaches to the reins of the bridle between the bit and the rider's hand.  It acts in a manner similar to a running martingale, but with greater leverage.  It is not usually considered show legal and is used primarily as a training aid.\n*Irish martingale: Unlike the previous designs, this very simple \"martingale\" does not control the height of the horse's head, but merely keeps the reins from going over the horse's head in the result of a fall. It consists of a piece of leather with a ring on each end through which each rein runs.<ref name=Complete133>Edwards, Elwyn Hartley ''The Complete Book of Bits and Bitting'' Newton Abbot, Devonshire:David & Charles 2004 {{ISBN|0-7153-1163-8}} p. 133</ref>\n[[Image:Baltic Cup Shannon Mejnert Sandy2.jpg|thumb|left|a horse wearing a running martingale]]\n*Running martingale: This design adds leverage to a [[horse bit|bit]] and features a split ''fork'' beginning at the chest with a ring on each side of the fork through which the reins pass, enabling the rider to more easily keep the horse under control, but also allowing the horse freedom of movement when needed.  Fitted correctly, the running martingale only controls how high the horse carries its head when the rider tightens the reins.  The standard adjustment of a running martingale is to set the rings at a height where they do not engage and add leverage to the reins when the horse carries its head at the proper height.  Sometimes a running martingale may be adjusted at a greater or lesser length depending on the needs of the horse and rider.<ref name=Catalog163/>\n*Standing martingale: A design with one strap that runs from the girth or the chest and attaches to the [[noseband]] of the bridle. The standing martingale acts on the horse's nose and creates an absolute limit to how high a horse can raise its head.  The term used in [[western riding]] for this piece of equipment is the ''tie down''.  Standard adjustment of a standing martingale allows enough slack to bring the strap to the horse's [[horse anatomy|throatlatch]] when the animal has its head in a relaxed, natural position.  However, it is sometimes adjusted shorter.  Unlike the running martingale, it limits the freedom of the horse's head, no matter how long or short the reins may be.  While standing martingales are common in [[show hunter]] and [[equitation]] classes, the limits placed on the horse's movement are dangerous for [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]] riding or [[show jumping]]. Therefore, in these disciplines, a running martingale is necessary for safety reasons, if a martingale is used at all.<ref name=Catalog163/>\n\nThere are other training devices that fall loosely in the martingale category, in that they use straps attached to the reins or bit which limit the movement of the horse's head or add leverage to the rider's hands in order to control the horse's head.

It is also a recognised minority language in the [[United States]]. It has developed into a [[lingua franca]] across much of [[Western Africa]] for purposes of trade.\n\n==Classification==\n{{Main|Afroasiatic languages}}\nHausa belongs to the [[West Chadic languages]] subgroup of the [[Chadic languages]] group, which in turn is part of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic language]] family.\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n\n[[File:Nigeria linguistic 1979.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The linguistic groups of Nigeria in 1979]]\nNative speakers of Hausa, the [[Hausa people]], are mostly found in [[Niger]], in Northern [[Nigeria]], and in [[Chad]]. Furthermore, the language is used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' by non-native speakers in most of Northern Nigeria and Southern Niger, and as a [[trade language]] across a much larger swathe of West Africa ([[Benin]], [[Ghana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Togo]], [[Ivory Coast]]) and parts of [[Sudan]]).\n\n===Dialects===\n\n====Traditional dialects====\nEastern Hausa [[dialect]]s include ''Dauranchi'' in [[Daura]], ''Kananci'' in [[Kano]], ''Bausanchi'' in [[Bauchi]], ''Gudduranci'' in [[Katagum]] [[Misau]] and part of [[Borno State|Borno]], and ''Hadejanci'' in [[Hadejiya]].\n\nWestern Hausa dialects include ''Sakkwatanci'' in [[Sokoto]], ''Katsinanci'' in [[Katsina]], ''Arewanci'' in [[Gobir]], [[Adar]], [[Kebbi]], and [[Zamfara]], and ''Kurhwayanci'' in [[Kurfey]] in Niger. Katsina is transitional between Eastern and Western dialects.\n\nNorthern Hausa dialects include ''[[Arewa]]'' and ''Arawci''.\n\n''Zazzaganci'' in [[Zazzau]] is the major Southern dialect.\n\nThe Daura (''Dauranchi'') and Kano (''Kananci'') dialect are the standard.  The [[BBC]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France Internationale]] and [[Voice of America]] offer Hausa services on their international news web sites using Dauranci and Kananci. In recent language development Zazzaganci took over the innovation of writing and speaking the current Hausa language use.\n\n====Northernmost dialects and loss of tonality====\nThe western to eastern Hausa dialects of ''Kurhwayanci'', ''Daragaram'' and ''Aderawa'', represent the traditional northernmost limit of native Hausa communities. These are spoken in the northernmost [[sahel]] and mid-[[Sahara]]n regions in west and central [[Niger]] in the [[Tillaberi]], [[Tahoua]], [[Dosso Region|Dosso]], [[Maradi Region|Maradi]], [[Agadez]] and [[Zinder]] regions. While mutually comprehensible with other dialects (especially ''Sakkwatanci'', and to a lesser extent ''Gaananci''), the northernmost dialects have slight grammatical and lexical differences owing to frequent contact with the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] groups and cultural changes owing to the geographical differences between the grassland and desert zones. These dialects also have the quality of being non-[[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] or [[pitch accent]] dialects.\n\nThis link between non-tonality and geographic location is not limited to Hausa alone, but is exhibited in other northern dialects of neighbouring languages; such as the difference within [[Songhay language]] (between the non-tonal northernmost dialects of [[Koyra Chiini]] in [[Timbuktu]] and [[Koyraboro Senni]] in [[Gao]]; and the tonal southern [[Zarma language|Zarma]] dialect, spoken from western [[Niger]] to northern [[Ghana]]), and within the [[Soninke language]] (between the non-tonal northernmost dialects of [[Imraguen language|Imraguen]] and [[Nemadi]] spoken in east-central [[Mauritania]]; and the tonal southern dialects of [[Senegal]], [[Mali]] and the [[sahel]]).\n\n====Ghanaian Hausa dialect====\nThe [[Ghanaian]] Hausa dialect (''Gaananci''), spoken in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and western [[Ivory Coast]], is a distinct western native Hausa dialect-bloc with adequate linguistic and media resources available. Separate smaller Hausa dialects are spoken by an unknown number of Hausa further west in parts of [[Burkina Faso]], and in the [[Haoussa Foulane]], Badji Haoussa, Guezou Haoussa, and [[Ansongo]] districts of northeastern [[Mali]] (where it is designated as a minority language by the Malian government), but there are very little linguistic resources and research done on these particular dialects at this time.\n\nGaananci forms a separate group from other Western Hausa dialects, as it now falls outside the contiguous Hausa-dominant area, and is usually identified by the use of ''c'' for ''ky'', and ''j'' for ''gy''. This is attributed to the fact that Ghana's Hausa population descend from [[Hausa-Fulani]] traders settled in the [[Zongo settlements|zongo]] districts of major trade-towns up and down the previous [[Ashanti Empire|Asante]], [[Gonja people|Gonja]] and [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]] kingdoms stretching from the [[sahel]] to coastal regions, in particular the cities of [[Tamale]], [[Salaga]], [[Bawku]], [[Bolgatanga]], [[Achimota]], [[Nima, Ghana|Nima]] and [[Kumasi]].\n\nGaananci exhibits noted inflected influences from [[Zarma language|Zarma]], [[Gur languages|Gur]], [[Dyula language|Dyula]] and [[Soninke language|Soninke]], as Ghana is the westernmost area in which the Hausa language is a major lingua-franca; as well as it being the westernmost area both the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Zarma people|Djerma]] ethnic groups inhabit in large numbers. Immediately west from Ghana (in Ivory Coast, Togo, and Burkina Faso), Hausa is abruptly replaced with [[Dioula language|Dioula]]&ndash;[[Bambara language|Bambara]] as the main lingua-franca of what become predominantly [[Manding languages|Mandinka]] areas, and native Hausa populations plummet to a very small urban minority.\n\nBecause of this, and the presence of surrounding [[Central Tano languages|Akan]], [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Mande languages]], Gaananci was historically isolated from the other Hausa dialects.<ref>[http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/pdf-files/vol5num2/bodomo.pdf Njas.helsinki.fi]</ref> Despite this difference, grammatical similarities between ''Sakkwatanci'' and Ghanaian Hausa determine that the dialect, and the origin of the Ghanaian Hausa people themselves, are derived from the northwestern Hausa area surrounding Sokoto.<ref>[http://www.ethnorema.it/pdf/numero%204/03%20Articolo%201%20Guerini.pdf Ethnorema.it]</ref>\n\nHausa is also widely spoken by non-native [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] Ghanaian Muslims, but differs from Gaananci, and rather has features consistent with non-native Hausa dialects.\n\n====Other native dialects====\nHausa is also spoken in various parts of Cameroon and Chad, which combined the mixed dialects of northern Nigeria and Niger. In addition, Arabic has had a great influence in the way Hausa is spoken by the native Hausa speakers in these areas.\n\n====Non-native Hausa====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn [[West Africa]], Hausa's use as a [[lingua franca]] has given rise to a non-native pronunciation that differs vastly from native pronunciation by way of key omissions of [[Implosive consonant|implosive]] and [[Ejective consonant|ejective]] consonants present in native Hausa dialects, such as ''\u0257'', ''\u0253'' and ''k\u02bc/\u0199'', which are pronounced by non-native speakers as ''d'', ''b'' and ''k'' respectively. This creates confusion among non-native and native Hausa speakers, as non-native pronunciation does not distinguish words like ''{{wiktha|daidai}}'' (\"correct\") and ''{{wiktha|\u0257ai\u0257ai}}'' (\"one-by-one\"). Another difference between native and non-native Hausa is the omission of [[vowel length]] in words and change in the standard [[tonal languages|tone]] of native Hausa dialects (ranging from native [[Fulani]] and [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] Hausa-speakers omitting tone altogether, to Hausa speakers with [[Gur languages|Gur]] or [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] [[mother tongue]]s using additional tonal structures similar to those used in their native languages). Use of masculine and feminine [[Grammatical gender|gender]] nouns and sentence structure are usually omitted or interchanged, and many native Hausa nouns and verbs are substituted with non-native terms from local languages.\n\nNon-native speakers of Hausa numbered more than 25 million and, in some areas, live close to native Hausa. It has replaced many other languages especially in the north-central and north-eastern part of Nigeria and continues to gain popularity in other parts of Africa as a result of Hausa movies and music which spread out throughout the region.\n\n===Hausa-based pidgins===\n{{anchor|Gibanawa}}There are several [[pidgin]] forms of Hausa. [[Barikanchi]] was formerly used in the [[military of Nigeria|colonial army]] of Nigeria. Gibanawa is currently in widespread use in [[Jega, Nigeria|Jega]] in northwestern Nigeria, south of the native Hausa area.<ref>{{E17|gib|Gibanawa}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\nHausa has between 23 and 25 consonant phonemes depending on the speaker.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-style=font-size:90%\n|+Consonant phonemes\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!rowspan=2|[[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n!rowspan=2|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!rowspan=2|[[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br>alveolar]]\n!colspan=3|[[Dorsal consonant|Dorsal]]\n!rowspan=2|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!<small>[[palatal consonant|front]]\n!<small>[[velar consonant|plain]]\n!<small>[[labialized velar consonant|round]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 style=font-size:90%|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|{{IPAlink|m}}\n|{{IPAlink|n}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=4 style=font-size:90%|[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]/<br>[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!<small>[[implosive consonant|implosive]]</small>\n|{{IPAlink|\u0253}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u0257}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[voiced consonant|voiced]]\n|{{IPAlink|b}}\n|{{IPAlink|d}}\n|({{IPAlink|d\u0292|d}}){{IPAlink|\u0292}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u025f}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u0261}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u0261\u02b7}}\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]]\n|\n|{{IPAlink|t}}\n|{{IPAlink|t\u0283}}\n|{{IPAlink|c}}\n|{{IPAlink|k}}\n|{{IPAlink|k\u02b7}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u0294}}\n|-\n!<small>[[ejective consonant|ejective]]</small>\n|\n|({{IPAlink|ts\u02bc|t}}){{IPAlink|s\u02bc}}\n|({{IPAlink|t\u0283\u02bc}})\n|{{IPAlink|c\u02bc}}\n|{{IPAlink|k\u02bc}}\n|{{IPA|k\u02b7\u02bc}}\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=2 style=font-size:90%|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!<small>[[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]]\n|\n|{{IPAlink|z}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!<small>[[tenuis consonant|tenuis]]\n|{{IPAlink|\u0278}}\n|{{IPAlink|s}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u0283}}\n|\n|\n|\n|{{IPAlink|h}}\n|-\n!colspan=2 style=font-size:90%|[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n|{{IPAlink|l}}\n|\n|{{IPAlink|j}}; {{IPA|j\u0330}}\n|\n|{{IPAlink|w}}\n|\n|-\n!colspan=2 style=font-size:90%|[[Rhotic consonant|Rhotic]]\n|\n|{{IPAlink|r}}\n|{{IPAlink|\u027d}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\nThe three-way contrast between palatalized velars {{IPA|/c \u025f c\u02bc/}}, plain velars {{IPA|/k \u0261 k\u02bc/}}, and labialized velars {{IPA|/k\u02b7 \u0261\u02b7 k\u02b7\u02bc/}} is found only before long and short {{IPA|/a/}}, e.g. {{IPA|/c\u02bca\u02d0\u027da/}} ('grass'), {{IPA|/k\u02bca\u02d0\u027da\u02d0/}} ('to increase'), {{IPA|/k\u02b7\u02bca\u02d0\u027da\u02d0/}} ('shea-nuts').

Before the [[modern age]] and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. From 3000 BC the [[Mesopotamian]] states of [[Sumer]], [[Akkad (region)|Akkad]] and [[Assyria]], together with [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ebla]] began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] for purposes of taxation, commerce, trade and also in the field of [[astronomy]] and to formulate [[calendars]] and record time.\n\nThe most ancient mathematical texts available are from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] - ''[[Plimpton 322]]'' ([[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] c. 1900 BC),<ref>J.

All of these texts mention the so-called [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]], seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.\n\nThe study of mathematics as a \"demonstrative discipline\" begins in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], who coined the term \"mathematics\" from the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1'' (''mathema''), meaning \"subject of instruction\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Heath|title=A Manual of Greek Mathematics|page=5}}</ref> [[Greek mathematics]] greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and [[mathematical rigor]] in [[mathematical proof|proofs]]) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.<ref>Sir Thomas L.

[[Chinese mathematics]] made early contributions, including a [[place value system]] and the first use of [[negative numbers]].<ref>George Gheverghese Joseph, ''The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics'', Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140\u2014148</ref><ref>Georges Ifrah, ''Universalgeschichte der Zahlen'', Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428\u2014437</ref> The [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]] through the work of [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]].<ref>Robert Kaplan, \"The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero\", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999</ref><ref>\"The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value) emerged in India.

From ancient times through the [[Postclassical age|Middle Ages]], periods of mathematical discovery were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]] in the 15th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an [[exponential growth|increasing pace]] that continues through the present day. This includes the groundbreaking work of both [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in the development of infinitesimal [[calculus]] during the course of the 17th century. At the end of the 19th century the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] was founded and continues to spearhead advances in the field.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Prehistoric ==\nThe origins of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of [[number]], [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], and [[Configuration (geometry)|form]].<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Origins p. 3\">{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Origins\" p. 3}}</ref> Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans.

It is likely the sexagesimal system was chosen because 60 can be evenly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 25\"/> Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the [[decimal]] system.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> The power of the Babylonian notational system lay in that it could be used to represent fractions as easily as whole numbers; thus multiplying two numbers that contained fractions was no different than multiplying integers, similar to our modern notation.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> The notational system of the Babylonians was the best of any civilization until the [[Renaissance]],<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27\">{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 27}}</ref> and its power allowed it to achieve remarkable computation accuracy and power; for example, the Babylonian tablet [[YBC 7289]] gives an approximation of {{radic|2}} accurate to five decimal places.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 27\"/> The Babylonians lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> By the Seleucid period, the Babylonians had developed a zero symbol as a placeholder for empty positions; however it was only used for intermediate positions.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/> This zero sign does not appear in terminal positions, thus the Babylonians came close but did not develop a true place value system.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 26\"/>\n\nOther topics covered by Babylonian mathematics include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of [[Regular number|regular]] [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] [[Twin prime|pairs]].<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Aaboe | last = Aaboe | first = Asger | title = Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics | year = 1998 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | pages = 30\u201331}}</ref> The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving [[linear equation|linear]], [[quadratic equation]]s and [[cubic equation]]s, a remarkable achievement for the time.<ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 33}}</ref> Tablets from the Old Babylonian period also contain the earliest known statement of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].<ref>{{Harv|Boyer|1991|loc=\"Mesopotamia\" p. 39}}</ref> However, as with Egyptian mathematics, Babylonian mathematics shows no awareness of the difference between exact and approximate solutions, or the solvability of a problem, and most importantly, no explicit statement of the need for [[mathematical proof|proofs]] or logical principles.<ref name=\"Boyer 1991 loc=Mesopotamia p. 41\"/>\n\n== Egyptian ==\n{{Main|Egyptian mathematics}}\n[[File:Moskou-papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Image of Problem 14 from the [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]].

This claim and M\u0101dhava's achievements were ignored by Western historians, presumably at first because they could not admit that an Indian discovered the calculus, but later because no one read anymore the ''Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society'', in which Whish's article was published. The matter resurfaced in the 1950s, and now we have the Sanskrit texts properly edited, and we understand the clever way that M\u0101dhava derived the series ''without'' the calculus; but many historians still find it impossible to conceive of the problem and its solution in terms of anything other than the calculus and proclaim that the calculus is what M\u0101dhava found.

[[Persian people|Persians]] contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.\n\nIn the 9th century, the [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b]] wrote several important books on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book ''On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals'', written about 825, along with the work of [[Al-Kindi]], were instrumental in spreading [[Indian mathematics]] and [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system|Indian numerals]] to the West. The word ''[[algorithm]]'' is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word ''[[algebra]]'' from the title of one of his works, ''[[The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing|Al-Kit\u0101b al-mukhta\u1e63ar f\u012b h\u012bs\u0101b al-\u011fabr wa\u2019l-muq\u0101bala]]'' (''The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing'').

In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of [[utility theory]] in the 18th\u201319th century.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Leonhard Euler]] by [[Emanuel Handmann]].]]\n\nThe most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably [[Leonhard Euler]]. His contributions range from founding the study of [[graph theory]] with the [[Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsberg]] problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol [[Imaginary unit|<span style=\"font-family:times new Roman;\">''i''</span>]], and he popularized the use of the Greek letter <math>\\pi</math> to stand for the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.\n\nOther important European mathematicians of the 18th century included [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and [[Laplace]] who, in the age of [[Napoleon]], did important work on the foundations of [[celestial mechanics]] and on [[statistics]].\n\n== Modern ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\n<!-- Modern period stars here:\n * Mathematical analysis: Bolzano, Cauchy, Riemann, Weierstrass\n * \"Purely existential\" proofs by Dedekind and Hilbert\n * Dirichlet's \"arbitrary function\"\n * Cantor's different kinds of infinity\n * Concentration on structures instead of calculation (abstract algebra, non-Euclidean geometry)\n * Institutionalization\n-->\n[[Image:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].]]\nThroughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of [[complex variable]]s, in [[geometry]], and on the convergence of [[series (mathematics)|series]], leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] and of the [[quadratic reciprocity law]].\n\n[[Image:noneuclid.svg|right|thumb|400px|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry]]\nThis century saw the development of the two forms of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], where the [[parallel postulate]] of [[Euclidean geometry]] no longer holds.\nThe Russian mathematician [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], independently defined and studied [[hyperbolic geometry]], where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0. [[Elliptic geometry]] was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0. Riemann also developed [[Riemannian geometry]], which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a [[manifold]], which generalizes the ideas of [[curve]]s and [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s.\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of [[abstract algebra]]. [[Hermann Grassmann]] in Germany gave a first version of [[vector space]]s, [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in Ireland developed [[noncommutative algebra]]. The British mathematician [[George Boole]] devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called [[Boolean algebra]], in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of [[mathematical logic]] and has important applications in [[computer science]].\n\n[[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Karl Weierstrass]] reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. [[Niels Henrik Abel]], a Norwegian, and [[\u00c9variste Galois]], a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four ([[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to [[trisect an arbitrary angle]], to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three [[dimension]]s in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of [[parameter space]] and [[hypercomplex number]]s.\n\nAbel and Galois's investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of [[group theory]], and the associated fields of [[abstract algebra]]. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study [[symmetry]].\n\nIn the later 19th century, [[Georg Cantor]] established the first foundations of [[set theory]], which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of [[mathematical logic]] in the hands of [[Peano]], [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[A.N. Whitehead]], initiated a long running debate on the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1865, the [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France]] in 1872, the [[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]] in 1884, the [[Edinburgh Mathematical Society]] in 1883, and the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the [[Quaternion Society]], was formed in 1899, in the context of a [[hyperbolic quaternion#Historical review|vector controversy]].\n\nIn 1897, Hensel introduced [[p-adic number]]s.\n\n=== 20th century === <!-- Hibert's problems, foundational crisis, Bourbaki -->\n[[Image:Four Colour Map Example.svg|thumb|A map illustrating the [[Four Color Theorem]]]]\n\nThe 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in [[Klein's encyclopedia]].\n\nIn a 1900 speech to the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], [[David Hilbert]] set out a list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems in mathematics]]. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.\n\nNotable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, [[Wolfgang Haken]] and [[Kenneth Appel]] used a computer to prove the [[four color theorem]]. [[Andrew Wiles]], building on the work of others, proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in 1995. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved that the [[continuum hypothesis]] is [[logical independence|independent]] of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the [[ZFC|standard axioms of set theory]]. In 1998 [[Thomas Callister Hales]] proved the [[Kepler conjecture]].\n\nMathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the [[classification of finite simple groups]] (also called the \"enormous theorem\"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]], publishing under the [[pseudonym]] \"[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]\", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.<ref>Maurice Mashaal, 2006. ''Bourbaki: A Secret Society of Mathematicians''. [[American Mathematical Society]]. {{ISBN|0-8218-3967-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8218-3967-6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Relativistic precession.svg|thumb|Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|relativistic precession of apsides]]]]\n[[Differential geometry]] came into its own when [[Einstein]] used it in [[general relativity]]. Entirely new areas of mathematics such as [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], and [[John von Neumann]]'s [[game theory]] changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of [[Mathematical structure|structures]] were abstracted using axioms and given names like [[metric space]]s, [[topological space]]s etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to [[category theory]]. [[Grothendieck]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] recast [[algebraic geometry]] using [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf theory]]. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of [[dynamical systems theory|dynamical systems]] that [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]] had begun in the 1890s.\n[[Measure theory]] was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the [[Lebesgue integral]], [[Kolmogorov]]'s axiomatisation of [[probability theory]], and [[ergodic theory]]. [[Knot theory]] greatly expanded. [[Quantum mechanics]] led to the development of [[functional analysis]]. Other new areas include [[Laurent Schwartz]]'s [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]], [[Fixed-point theorem|fixed point theory]], [[singularity theory]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]], [[model theory]], and [[Benoit Mandelbrot|Mandelbrot]]'s [[fractals]]. [[Lie theory]] with its [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s became one of the major areas of study.\n\n[[Non-standard analysis]], introduced by [[Abraham Robinson]], rehabilitated the [[infinitesimal]] approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of [[Limit of a function|limits]], by extending the field of real numbers to the [[Hyperreal number]]s which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the [[surreal number]]s were discovered by [[John Horton Conway]] in connection with [[combinatorial game]]s.\n\nThe development and continual improvement of [[computer]]s, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed [[industry]] to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: [[Alan Turing]]'s [[computability theory]]; [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]; [[Derrick Henry Lehmer]]'s use of [[ENIAC]] to further number theory and the [[Lucas-Lehmer test]]; [[R\u00f3zsa P\u00e9ter]]'s [[recursive function theory]]; [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]; [[signal processing]]; [[data analysis]]; [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] and other areas of [[operations research]]. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on [[calculus]] and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] concepts and the expansion of [[combinatorics]] including [[graph theory]]. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as [[numerical analysis]] and [[symbolic computation]]. Some of the most important methods and [[algorithm]]s of the 20th century are: the [[simplex algorithm]], the [[Fast Fourier Transform]], [[error-correcting code]]s, the [[Kalman filter]] from [[control theory]] and the [[RSA algorithm]] of [[public-key cryptography]].\n\nAt the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the [[natural number]]s plus one of addition and multiplication, was [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as [[Peano arithmetic]], was in fact [[incompleteness theorem|incompletable]]. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of [[number theory]], including the notion of [[prime number]].) A consequence of G\u00f6del's two [[incompleteness theorem]]s is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[geometry]]), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that [[Incompleteness theorem|cannot be proved]] within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and [[David Hilbert]]'s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated.\n\n[[Image:GammaAbsSmallPlot.png|thumb|right|The [[absolute value]] of the Gamma function on the complex plane.]]\nOne of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was [[Srinivasa Aiyangar Ramanujan]] (1887\u20131920), an Indian [[autodidact]] who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of [[highly composite number]]s, the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]] and its [[asymptotics]], and [[Ramanujan theta function|mock theta functions]]. He also made major investigations in the areas of [[gamma function]]s, [[modular form]]s, [[divergent series]], [[General hypergeometric function|hypergeometric series]] and [[prime number]] theory.\n\n[[Paul Erd\u0151s]] published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the [[Kevin Bacon Game]], which leads to the [[Erd\u0151s number]] of a mathematician. This describes the \"collaborative distance\" between a person and Paul Erd\u0151s, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.\n\n[[Emmy Noether]] has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics.<ref>{{citation|authorlink=Pavel Alexandrov|last=Alexandrov|first=Pavel S.|chapter=In Memory of Emmy Noether | title = Emmy Noether: A Tribute to Her Life and Work|editor1-first =James W | editor1-last = Brewer | editor2-first = Martha K | editor2-last = Smith | place = New York | publisher= Marcel Dekker | year= 1981 | isbn = 0-8247-1550-0 |pages= 99\u2013111}}.</ref> She studied the theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[algebra over a field|algebras]].\n\nAs in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] was dozens of pages long.<ref>[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classifications2000.pdf Mathematics Subject Classification 2000]</ref> More and more [[mathematical journal]]s were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to online publishing.\n\n=== 21st century ===\n{{See also|List of unsolved problems in mathematics#Problems solved since 1995}}\nIn 2000, the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] announced the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]], and in 2003 the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] was solved by [[Grigori Perelman]] (who declined to accept an award, as he was critical of the mathematics establishment).\n\nMost mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched.

The [[Electric charge|electrically]] neutral atom contains a single positively charged [[proton]] and a single negatively charged [[electron]] bound to the nucleus by the [[Coulomb force]].

Instead, hydrogen tends to combine with other atoms in compounds, or with itself to form ordinary ([[diatomic]]) hydrogen gas, H<sub>2</sub>. \"Atomic hydrogen\" and \"hydrogen atom\" in ordinary English use have overlapping, yet distinct, meanings. For example, a water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, but does not contain atomic hydrogen (which would refer to isolated hydrogen atoms).\n\n[[Atomic spectroscopy]] shows that there is a discrete infinite set of states in which a hydrogen (or any) atom can exist, contrary to the predictions of [[classical physics]]. Attempts to develop a theoretical understanding of the states of the hydrogen atom have been important to the [[history of quantum mechanics]], since all other atoms can be roughly understood by knowing in detail about this simplest atomic structure.\n\n==Isotopes==\n{{Main|Isotopes of hydrogen}}\nThe most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundant]] [[isotope]], '''hydrogen-1''', '''protium''', or '''light hydrogen''', contains no [[neutron]]s and is simply a [[proton]] and an [[electron]]. Protium is [[Proton decay|stable]] and makes up 99.985% of naturally occurring hydrogen atoms.<ref name=Housecroft>{{cite book |last1=Housecroft |first=Catherine E. |last2=Sharpe |first2=Alan G. |edition=2nd |date=2005 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Pearson Prentice-Hall |page=237 |isbn=0130-39913-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Deuterium]] contains one neutron and one proton. Deuterium is stable and makes up 0.0156% of naturally occurring hydrogen<ref name=Housecroft/> and is used in industrial processes like [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Deuterium NMR|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]].\n\n[[Tritium]] contains two neutrons and one proton and is not stable, decaying with a [[half-life]] of 12.32 years. Because of the short half life, tritium does not exist in nature except in trace amounts.\n\nHigher isotopes of hydrogen are only created in artificial [[Particle accelerator|accelerators]] and reactors and have half lives around the order of 10<sup>\u221222</sup> seconds.\n\nThe formulas below are valid for all three isotopes of hydrogen, but slightly different values of the [[Rydberg constant]] (correction formula given below) must be used for each hydrogen isotope.\n\n==Hydrogen ion==\n{{Main|Hydron (chemistry)}}\nHydrogen is not found without its electron in ordinary chemistry (room temperatures and pressures), as ionized hydrogen is highly chemically reactive. When ionized hydrogen is written as \"H<sup>+</sup>\" as in the solvation of classical acids such as [[hydrochloric acid]], the [[hydronium ion]], [[hydrogen|H]]<sub>3</sub>[[oxygen|O]]<sup>+</sup>, is meant, not a literal ionized single hydrogen atom. In that case, the acid transfers the proton to H<sub>2</sub>O to form H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.\n\nIonized hydrogen without its electron, or free protons, are common in the [[interstellar medium]], and [[solar wind]].\n\n==Theoretical analysis==\nThe hydrogen atom has special significance in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]] as a simple [[two-body problem]] physical system which has yielded many simple [[closed-form expression|analytical]] solutions in closed-form.\n\n=== Failed classical description ===\n[[Rutherford model|Experiments]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in 1909 showed the structure of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable. [[Classical electromagnetism]] had shown that any accelerating charge radiates energy described through the [[Larmor formula]]. If the electron is assumed to orbit in a perfect circle and radiates energy continuously, the electron would rapidly spiral into the nucleus with a fall time of:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~mcdonald/examples/orbitdecay.pdf|title = Classical Lifetime of a Bohr Atom|date = March 7, 2005|website = |publisher = Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University|last = Olsen|first = James|last2 = McDonald|first2 = Kirk}}</ref>\n\n:<math>t_\\text{fall} \\approx \\frac{ a_0^3}{4 r_0^2 c} \\approx 1.6 \\cdot 10^{-11} \\text{s}</math>\n\nWhere <math>a_0</math> is the [[Bohr radius]] and <math>r_0</math> is the [[classical electron radius]]. If this were true, all atoms would instantly collapse, however atoms seem to be stable. Furthermore, the spiral inward would release a smear of electromagnetic frequencies as the orbit got smaller. Instead, atoms were observed to only emit discrete frequencies of radiation. The resolution would lie in the development of [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n=== Bohr-Sommerfeld Model ===\n{{Main|Bohr model}}In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] obtained the energy levels and spectral frequencies of the hydrogen atom after making a number of simple assumptions in order to correct the failed classical model. The assumptions included:\n# Electrons can only be in certain, discrete circular orbits or ''stationary states'', thereby having a discrete set of possible radii and energies.\n# Electrons do not emit radiation while in one of these stationary states.\n# An electron can gain or lose energy by jumping from one discrete orbital to another. \nBohr supposed that the electron's angular momentum is quantized with possible values:\n\n<math>L = n \\hbar</math>  where <math>n = 1,2,3,...</math>\n\nand <math>\\hbar</math> is [[Planck constant]] over <math>2 \\pi</math>. He also supposed that the [[centripetal force]] which keeps the electron in its orbit is provided by the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], and that energy is conserved. Bohr derived the energy of each orbit of the hydrogen atom to be:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://alpha.chem.umb.edu/chemistry/ch115/carter/files/103more/BohrEquations.pdf|title = Derivation of Bohr\u2019s Equations for the One-electron Atom|website = |publisher = University of Massachusetts Boston|last = |first = }}</ref>\n::<math>E_n = - \\frac{  m_e e^4}{2 ( 4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)^2 \\hbar^2 } \\frac{1}{n^2}   </math>,\n\nwhere <math>m_e   </math> is the [[electron mass]], <math>e   </math> is the [[electron charge]], <math>\\epsilon_0   </math> is the [[vacuum permittivity]], and <math>n   </math> is the [[quantum number]] (now known as the [[principal quantum number]]).

It is related to the [[Rydberg constant]] <math>R_\\infty</math> of [[atomic physics]] by <math>1 \\,\\text{Ry} \\equiv h c R_\\infty.</math>\n\nThe exact value of the Rydberg constant assumes that the nucleus is infinitely massive with respect to the electron. For hydrogen-1, hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]), and hydrogen-3 ([[tritium]]) the constant must be slightly modified to use the [[reduced mass]] of the system, rather than simply the mass of the electron. However, since the nucleus is much heavier than the electron, the values are nearly the same. The Rydberg constant ''R<sub>M</sub>'' for a hydrogen atom (one electron), ''R'' is given by\n\n<math>R_M = \\frac{R_\\infty}{1+m_{\\text{e}}/M},</math>\n\nwhere <math>M</math> is the mass of the atomic nucleus.  For hydrogen-1, the quantity <math>m_{\\text{e}}/M,</math> is about 1/1836 (i.e. the electron-to-proton mass ratio). For deuterium and tritium, the ratios are about 1/3670 and 1/5497 respectively. These figures, when added to 1 in the denominator, represent very small corrections in the value of ''R'', and thus only small corrections to all energy levels in corresponding hydrogen isotopes.\n\nThere were still problems with Bohr's model: \n# it failed to predict other spectral details such as [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]]\n# it could only predict energy levels with any accuracy for single\u2013electron atoms (hydrogen\u2013like atoms)\n# the predicted values were only correct to <math>\\alpha^2 \\approx 10^{-5}</math>, where <math>\\alpha</math> is the [[fine-structure constant]].\n\nMost of these shortcomings were repaired by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Arnold Sommerfeld's]] modification of the Bohr model. Sommerfeld introduced two additional degrees of freedom allowing an electron to move on an elliptical orbit, characterized by its [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[declination]] with respect to a chosen axis. This introduces two additional quantum numbers, which correspond to the orbital [[angular momentum]] and its projection on the chosen axis. Thus the correct multiplicity of states (except for the factor 2 accounting for the yet unknown electron spin) was found. Further applying special relativity theory to the elliptic orbits, Sommerfeld succeeded in deriving the correct expression for the fine structure of hydrogen spectra (which happens to be exactly the same as in the most elaborate Dirac theory). However some observed phenomena such as the anomalous [[Zeeman effect]] remain unexplained. These issues were resolved with the full development of quantum mechanics and the [[Dirac equation]]. It is often alleged, that the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is superior to the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory in describing hydrogen atom. This is however not the case, as the most results of both approaches coincide or are very close (a remarkable exception is the problem of hydrogen atom in crossed electric and magnetic fields, which cannot be solved in the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory self-consistently), and their main shortcomings result from the absence of the electron spin in both theories.  It was the complete failure of the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to explain many-electron systems (such as helium atom or hydrogen molecule) which demonstrated its inadequacy in describing quantum phenomena.\n\n=== Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation allows one to calculate the development of quantum systems with time and can give exact, analytical answers for the non-relativistic hydrogen atom.\n\n==== Wavefunction ====\nThe [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] of the hydrogen atom is the radial kinetic energy operator and coulomb attraction force between the positive proton and negative electron. Using the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, ignoring all spin-coupling interactions and using the [[reduced mass]] <math>\\mu=m_e M/(m_e + M)</math>, the equation is written as:\n\n<math>\\left(- \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 \\mu} \\nabla^2  - \\frac{  e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\right) \\psi(r,\\theta, \\phi) = E \\psi(r, \\theta, \\phi)</math>\n\nExpanding the [[Laplace operator|Laplacian]] in spherical coordinates:\n\n<math>-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 \\mu} \\left[ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{ \\partial \\psi}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin \\theta} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\theta} \\left( \\sin \\theta \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial \\theta}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial \\phi^2} \\right] - \\frac{e^2}{ 4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r} \\psi= E \\psi</math>\n\nThis is a [[Separation of variables|separable]], [[partial differential equation]] which can be solved in terms of special functions.

It also yields two other quantum numbers and the shape of the electron's wave function (\"orbital\") for the various possible quantum-mechanical states, thus explaining the [[anisotropic]] character of atomic bonds.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation also applies to more complicated atoms and [[molecule]]s. When there is more than one electron or nucleus the solution is not analytical and either computer calculations are necessary or simplifying assumptions must be made.\n\nSince the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is only valid for non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the solutions it yields for the hydrogen atom are not entirely correct. The [[Dirac equation]] of relativistic quantum theory improves these solutions (see below).\n\n==== Results of Schr\u00f6dinger equation ====\nThe solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (wave equation) for the hydrogen atom uses the fact that the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb potential]] produced by the nucleus is [[isotropic]] (it is radially symmetric in space and only depends on the distance to the nucleus). Although the resulting [[energy eigenfunctions]] (the ''orbitals'') are not necessarily isotropic themselves, their dependence on the [[Spherical coordinate system|angular coordinates]] follows completely generally from this isotropy of the underlying potential: the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (that is, the energy eigenstates) can be chosen as simultaneous eigenstates of the [[angular momentum operator]]. This corresponds to the fact that angular momentum is conserved in the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, the energy eigenstates may be classified by two angular momentum [[quantum number]]s, ''\u2113'' and ''m'' (both are integers). The angular momentum quantum number {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, ...}} determines the magnitude of the angular momentum. The magnetic quantum number {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} \u2212''\u2113'', ..., +''\u2113''}} determines the projection of the angular momentum on the (arbitrarily chosen) ''z''-axis.\n\nIn addition to mathematical expressions for total angular momentum and angular momentum projection of wavefunctions, an expression for the radial dependence of the wave functions must be found. It is only here that the details of the 1/''r'' Coulomb potential enter (leading to [[Laguerre polynomials]] in ''r''). This leads to a third quantum number, the principal quantum number {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3, ...}}. The principal quantum number in hydrogen is related to the atom's total energy.\n\nNote that the maximum value of the angular momentum quantum number is limited by the principal quantum number: it can run only up to ''n'' \u2212 1, i.e. {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} 0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}}.\n\nDue to angular momentum conservation, states of the same ''\u2113'' but different ''m'' have the same energy (this holds for all problems with [[rotational symmetry]]). In addition, for the hydrogen atom, states of the same ''n'' but different ''\u2113'' are also [[degenerate energy levels|degenerate]] (i.e. they have the same energy). However, this is a specific property of hydrogen and is no longer true for more complicated atoms which have an (effective) potential differing from the form 1/''r'' (due to the presence of the inner electrons shielding the nucleus potential).\n\nTaking into account the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of the electron adds a last quantum number, the projection of the electron's spin angular momentum along the ''z''-axis, which can take on two values. Therefore, any [[eigenstate]] of the electron in the hydrogen atom is described fully by four quantum numbers. According to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the actual state of the electron may be any [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of these states. This explains also why the choice of ''z''-axis for the directional [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of the angular momentum vector is immaterial: an orbital of given ''\u2113'' and ''m''&prime; obtained for another preferred axis ''z''&prime; can always be represented as a suitable superposition of the various states of different ''m'' (but same ''l'') that have been obtained for ''z''.\n\n==== Mathematical summary of eigenstates of hydrogen atom ====\n{{main|Hydrogen-like atom}}\n\nIn 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] found [[Dirac equation|an equation]] that was fully compatible with [[Special Relativity]], and (as a consequence) made the wave function a 4-component \"[[Dirac spinor]]\" including \"up\" and \"down\" spin components, with both positive and \"negative\" energy (or matter and antimatter). The solution to this equation gave the following results, more accurate than the Schr\u00f6dinger solution.\n\n=====Energy levels=====\nThe energy levels of hydrogen, including [[fine structure]] (excluding [[Lamb shift]] and [[hyperfine structure]]), are given by the [[Fine-structure constant|Sommerfeld fine structure]] expression:<ref name=\"Sommerfeld\">{{cite book|first=Arnold |last= Sommerfeld|title=Atombau und Spektrallinien'|  publisher=Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig|year=1919|isbn=3-87144-484-7}} [https://archive.org/stream/atombauundspekt00sommgoog German] [https://archive.org/details/AtomicStructureAndSpectralLines English]</ref>\n::<math>\\begin{array}{rl} E_{j\\,n} & = -\\mu c^2\\left[1-\\left(1+\\left[\\dfrac{\\alpha}{n-j-\\frac{1}{2}+\\sqrt{\\left(j+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2-\\alpha^2}}\\right]^2\\right)^{-1/2}\\right] \\\\ & \\approx -\\dfrac{\\mu c^2\\alpha^2}{2n^2} \\left[1 + \\dfrac{\\alpha^2}{n^2}\\left(\\dfrac{n}{j+\\frac{1}{2}} - \\dfrac{3}{4} \\right) \\right] , \\end{array}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b1'' is the [[fine-structure constant]] and ''j'' is the \"total angular momentum\" [[quantum number]], which is equal to |''\u2113'' \u00b1 {{sfrac|1|2}}| depending on the direction of the electron spin. This formula represents a small correction to the energy obtained by Bohr and Schr\u00f6dinger as given above. The factor in square brackets in the last expression is nearly one; the extra term arises from relativistic effects (for details, see [[#Features going beyond the Schr\u00f6dinger solution]]). It is worth noting that this expression was first obtained by [[Arnold Sommerfeld|A. Sommerfeld]] in 1916 based on the relativistic version of the [[Old quantum theory|old Bohr theory]]. Sommerfeld has however used different notation for the quantum numbers.\n\n=== Visualizing the hydrogen electron orbitals ===\n{{main|Atomic orbital}}\n[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|frame|Probability densities through the ''xz''-plane for the electron at different quantum numbers (''\u2113'', across top; ''n'', down side; ''m'' = 0)]]\nThe image to the right shows the first few hydrogen atom orbitals (energy eigenfunctions). These are cross-sections of the [[probability amplitude|probability density]] that are color-coded (black represents zero density and white represents the highest density). The angular momentum (orbital) quantum number ''\u2113'' is denoted in each column, using the usual spectroscopic letter code (''s'' means ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''p'' means ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''d'' means ''\u2113''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2). The main (principal) quantum number ''n'' (= 1, 2, 3, ...) is marked to the right of each row. For all pictures the magnetic quantum number ''m'' has been set to 0, and the cross-sectional plane is the ''xz''-plane (''z'' is the vertical axis). The probability density in three-dimensional space is obtained by rotating the one shown here around the ''z''-axis.\n\nThe \"[[ground state]]\", i.e. the state of lowest energy, in which the electron is usually found, is the first one, the 1''s'' state ([[principal quantum level]] ''n'' = 1, ''\u2113'' = 0).\n\nBlack lines occur in each but the first orbital: these are the nodes of the wavefunction, i.e. where the probability density is zero.  (More precisely, the nodes are [[spherical harmonics]] that appear as a result of solving [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] in polar coordinates.)\n\nThe [[quantum number]]s determine the layout of these nodes.<ref>[http://www.physics.byu.edu/faculty/durfee/courses/Summer2009/physics222/AtomicQuantumNumbers.pdf Summary of atomic quantum numbers]. Lecture notes. 28 July 2006</ref> There are:\n* <math>n-1</math> total nodes,\n* <math>l</math> of which are angular nodes:\n** <math>m</math> angular nodes go around the <math>\\phi</math> axis (in the xy plane). <small>(The figure above does not show these nodes since it plots cross-sections through the xz-plane.)</small>\n** <math>l-m</math> (the remaining angular nodes) occur on the <math>\\theta</math> (vertical) axis.\n* <math>n - l - 1</math> (the remaining non-angular nodes) are radial nodes.\n\n==== Features going beyond the Schr\u00f6dinger solution ====\nThere are several important effects that are neglected by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and which are responsible for certain small but measurable deviations of the real spectral lines from the predicted ones:\n\n* Although the mean speed of the electron in hydrogen is only 1/137th of the [[speed of light]], many modern experiments are sufficiently precise that a complete theoretical explanation requires a fully relativistic treatment of the problem. A relativistic treatment results in a momentum increase of about 1 part in 37,000 for the electron. Since the electron's wavelength is determined by its momentum, orbitals containing higher speed electrons show contraction due to smaller wavelengths.\n* Even when there is no external [[magnetic field]], in the [[inertial frame]] of the moving electron, the electromagnetic field of the nucleus has a magnetic component. The spin of the electron has an associated [[magnetic moment]] which interacts with this magnetic field. This effect is also explained by special relativity, and it leads to the so-called ''[[spin-orbit coupling]]'', i.e., an interaction between the [[electron]]'s [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] around the nucleus, and its [[spin (physics)|spin]].\n\nBoth of these features (and more) are incorporated in the relativistic [[Dirac equation]], with predictions that come still closer to experiment. Again the Dirac equation may be solved analytically in the special case of a two-body system, such as the hydrogen atom. The resulting solution quantum states now must be classified by the [[Total angular momentum quantum number|total angular momentum number]] ''j'' (arising through the coupling between [[electron spin]] and [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]). States of the same ''j'' and the same ''n'' are still degenerate. Thus, direct analytical solution of [[Dirac equation]] predicts 2S({{sfrac|1|2}}) and 2P({{sfrac|1|2}}) levels of Hydrogen to have exactly the same energy, which is in a contradiction with observations ([[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]]).\n\n* There are always [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s of the [[electromagnetic field]], according to quantum mechanics. Due to such fluctuations degeneracy between states of the same j but different l is lifted, giving them slightly different energies. This has been demonstrated in the famous [[Lamb shift|Lamb-Retherford experiment]] and was the starting point for the development of the theory of [[Quantum electrodynamics]] (which is able to deal with these vacuum fluctuations and employs the famous [[Feynman diagram]]s for approximations using [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]]). This effect is now called [[Lamb shift]].\n\nFor these developments, it was essential that the solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom could be worked out exactly, such that any experimentally observed deviation had to be taken seriously as a signal of failure of the theory.\n\n== Alternatives to the Schr\u00f6dinger theory ==\nIn the language of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg's]] [[matrix mechanics]], the hydrogen  atom was first solved by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]<ref name=\"pauli_1926\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Pauli | first = W | authorlink = Wolfgang Pauli\n | date = 1926\n | title = \u00dcber das Wasserstoffspektrum vom Standpunkt der neuen Quantenmechanik\n | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\n | volume = 36 | issue = 5 | pages = 336\u2013363\n | doi = 10.1007/BF01450175\n|bibcode = 1926ZPhy...36..336P }}</ref> using a [[rotational symmetry]] in four dimensions [O(4)-symmetry] generated by the angular momentum \nand the [[Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector]].

A member of the [[Severan dynasty]], he was [[Roman Syria|Syrian]], the second son of [[Julia Soaemias]] and [[Sextus Varius Marcellus]]. In his early youth he served as a priest of [[Elagabalus (deity)|the god Elagabalus]] in the hometown of his mother's family, [[Homs#Emesani dynasty and Roman rule|Emesa]]. As a private citizen, he was probably named Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus.<ref>For a detailed discussion of his nomenclature, see Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, ''Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'', p. 231.</ref> Upon becoming emperor he took the name '''Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus'''.

Caracalla's maternal aunt, [[Julia Maesa]], successfully instigated a revolt among the [[Legio III Gallica|Third Legion]] to have her eldest grandson (and Caracalla's cousin), Elagabalus, declared emperor in his place. Macrinus was defeated on 8 June 218 at the [[Battle of Antioch (218)|Battle of Antioch]]. Elagabalus, barely 14 years old, became emperor, initiating a reign remembered mainly for sex scandals and religious controversy.\n\nLater historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual [[taboos]]. He replaced the traditional head of the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]], [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], with the deity Elagabalus, of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, over which he personally presided.

His behavior estranged the [[Praetorian Guard]], the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], and the common people alike.

The assassination plot against Elagabalus was devised by his grandmother, Julia Maesa, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nElagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]], [[decadence]], and [[zealotry]].<ref name=emperorsatbay>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire at Bay: Ad 180\u2013395 |first=David Stone |last=Potter |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-10057-7}}</ref> This tradition has persisted, and with writers of the early modern age he suffers one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors.

Cassius Dio lived from the second half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor [[Commodus]] and governor of [[Smyrna]] after the death of [[Septimius Severus]].

His ''Roman History'' spans nearly a [[millennium]], from the arrival of [[Aeneas]] in Italy until the year 229. As a contemporary of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the ''Augustan History'', although by his own admission<ref name=\"chapter 80.18\"/> Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and had to rely on second-hand information.\n\nFurthermore, the political climate in the aftermath of Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as [[Sardanapalus]], partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake,<ref>80.11\u201312</ref> but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Emperors and biography: studies in the 'Historia Augusta' | year = 1971 | location = Oxford | publisher = Clarendon Press | pages = 145\u2013146 | isbn = 0-19-814357-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Herodian===\n[[File:Medal of Elagabalus.jpg|thumb|250px|Medal of Elagabalus, [[Louvre Museum]].]]\n\nAnother contemporary of Elagabalus' was [[Herodian]], a minor Roman civil servant who lived from c. 170 until 240.

It may seem probable, the vices and follies of Elagabalus have been adorned by fancy, and blackened by prejudice. Yet, confining ourselves to the public scenes displayed before the Roman people, and attested by grave and contemporary historians, their inexpressible infamy surpasses that of any other age or country.<ref>Gibbon, Edward, ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter VI</ref>}}\n\nThe 20th-century anthropologist [[James George Frazer]] (famous for ''[[The Golden Bough]]'') took seriously the monotheistic aspirations of the emperor, but also ridiculed him: \"The dainty priest of the Sun [was] the most abandoned reprobate who ever sat upon a throne...It was the intention of this eminently religious but crack-brained despot to supersede the worship of all the gods, not only at Rome but throughout the world, by the single worship of Elagabalus or the Sun.\"<ref>Fraser, J.G., [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.70276/2015.70276.Worship-Of-Nature-Vol1#page/n515/mode/2up ''The Worship of Nature, Volume I''], London: MacMillan and Co., 1926, pp. 496-98.</ref>\n\nThe first book-length biography was [https://archive.org/stream/rsamazingemperor00hayjuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Amazing Emperor Heliogabalus''] (1911) by J. Stuart Hay, \"a serious and systematic study\"<ref>[[J. B. Bury]] in introduction to Hay 1911, p. xxiii</ref> more sympathetic than that of previous historians, which nonetheless stressed the [[exoticism]] of Elagabalus, calling his reign one of \"enormous wealth and excessive prodigality, luxury and aestheticism, carried to their ultimate extreme, and sensuality in all the refinements of its Eastern habit.\"<ref>Hay 1911, p. 2</ref>\n\nSome recent historians paint a more favorable picture of the emperor's rule. Martijn Icks, in ''Images of Elagabalus'' (2008; republished as ''The Crimes of Elagabalus'' in 2012), doubts the reliability of the ancient sources and argues that it was the emperor's unorthodox religious policies that alienated the power elite of Rome, to the point that his grandmother saw fit to eliminate him and replace him with his cousin. Leonardo de Arrizabalaga y Prado, in ''The Emperor Elagabalus: Fact or Fiction?'' (2008), is also critical of the ancient historians and speculates that neither religion nor sexuality played a role in the fall of the young emperor. He was simply the loser in a power struggle within the imperial family; the loyalty of the Praetorian Guards was up for sale, and Julia Maesa had the resources to outmaneuver and outbribe her grandson. In this version of events, once Elagabalus, his mother, and his immediate circle had been murdered, a campaign of character assassination began, resulting in a grotesque caricature that has persisted to the present day. Historians have not only kept the tradition alive, but often embellished it, reflecting their own [[bias]] against [[effeminacy]], religious zealotry, and other traits with which Elagabalus is commonly identified.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Elagabalus Forchtenstein.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Elagabalus on a wall painting at [[Forchtenstein Castle]] ]]\nDue to the ancient tradition about him, Elagabalus became something of an (anti-)hero in the [[Decadent movement]] of the late 19th century.<ref name=\"glbtq-enc-elagabal\"/> He often appears in literature and other creative media as the epitome of a young, amoral [[aesthete]].

The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody.

Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims. All reported positive results but none could offer any science backing up their statements, only that \"it works\".

It may be used simply to secure long hair out of the way for convenience or as part of an elaborate [[hairstyle]] or coiffure.  The earliest evidence for dressing the hair may be seen in carved \"venus figurines\" such as the [[Venus of Brassempouy]] and the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. The creation of different hairstyles, especially among women, seems to be common to all cultures and all periods and many past, and current, societies use hairpins.\n\nHairpins made of [[metal]], [[ivory]], [[bronze]], carved [[wood]], etc. were used in [[ancient history|ancient]] [[Assyria]] and [[Egypt]]<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.42.6.5 | issue=42 | title=The Egyptian Hair Pin: practical, sacred, fatal | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | author=Fletcher Joann, University}}</ref> for securing decorated [[hairstyle]]s. Such hairpins suggest, as graves show, that many were luxury objects among the Egyptians and later the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans. Major success came in 1901 with the invention of the [[spiral hairpin]] by [[New Zealand]] [[inventor]] [[Ernest Godward]]. This was a predecessor of the hair clip.\n\nThe hairpin may be decorative and encrusted with jewels and ornaments, or it may be utiliarian, and designed to be almost invisible while holding a hairstyle in place.\n\nSome hairpins are a single straight pin, but modern versions are more likely to be constructed from different lengths of [[wire]] that are bent in half with a u-shaped end and a few kinks along the two opposite portions. The finished pin may vary from two to six inches in final length. The length of the wires enables placement in several styles of [[hairdo]]s to hold the style in place. The kinks enable retaining the pin during normal movements.\n\nA hairpin patent was issued to Kelly Chamandy in 1925.<ref>{{Ref patent|country= CA|number= 250155|status= patent|title= Hairpin / \u00c9pingle \u00e0 cheveux|pubdate= |gdate= 1925-06-02|fdate= |pridate= |invent1= Kelly Chamandy|invent2= |assign1= |assign2= |class= }} See also {{cite web| title= Hairpin / \u00c9pingle \u00e0 cheveux| url= http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/250155/summary.html| work= Canadian Patents Database| publisher= [[Canadian Intellectual Property Office]]| date= 2009-03-29| accessdate= 2009-03-30| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114537/http://patents.ic.gc.ca/cipo/cpd/en/patent/250155/summary.html| archivedate= 2007-12-12| df= }}</ref>\n\n==Hairpins in Chinese culture==\n[[File:Tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (\u6881\u838a\u738b) - Hairpin 1.jpg|thumb|260px|Gold [[Chinese Phoenix|phoenix]] hairpin found in the [[Ming dynasty]] tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (\u6881\u838a\u738b, 1411-1441), 15th century.]]\nHairpins (generally known as {{transl|zh|fa-zan}}; {{zh|\u9aee\u7c2a}}) are an important symbol in Chinese culture. In ancient China, hairpins were worn by all genders,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Z6vCGbf66YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | author=Sherrow, Victoria | year=2006 | pages=80}}</ref> and they were essential items for everyday hairstyling, mainly for securing and decorating a hair bun. Furthermore, hairpins worn by women could also represent their social status.\n\nIn Han Chinese culture, when young girls reached the age of fifteen, they were allowed to take part in a rite of passage known as \"{{transl|zh|ji li}}\" ({{zh|\u7b53\u79ae}}), or \u201chairpin initiation\u201d . This ceremony marks the coming of age of young women. Particularly, before the age of fifteen, girls did not use hairpins as they wore their hair in braids, and they were considered as children. When they turned fifteen, they could be considered as young women after the ceremony, and they started to style their hair as buns secured and embellished by hairpins. This practice indicated these young women may now enter into marriage. However, if a young woman hadn't been consented to marriage before age twenty, or she hadn't yet participated in a coming of age ceremony, she must attend a ceremony when she turned twenty.\n\nIn comparison with \u201c{{transl|zh|ji li}}\u201d, the male equivalent known as \u201c[[Guan Li|guan li]]\u201d ({{zh|\u51a0\u79ae}}) or \u201chat initiation\u201d, usually took place five years later, at the age of twenty. In the 21st century Hanfu Movement, an attempt to revive the traditional Han Chinese coming-of-age ceremonies has been made, and the ideal age to attend the ceremony is twenty years old for all genders.\n\nWhile hairpins can symbolize the transition from childhood to adulthood, they were closely connected to the concept of marriage as well. At the time of an engagement, the fianc\u00e9e may take a hairpin from her hair and give it to her fianc\u00e9 as a pledge: this can be seen as a reversal of the Western tradition, in which the future groom presents an engagement ring to his betrothed. After the wedding ceremony, the husband should put the hairpin back into his spouse\u2019s hair.\n\nHair has always carried many psychological, philosophical, romantic, and cultural meanings in Chinese culture. In Han culture, people call the union between two people \u201c{{transl|zh|jie-fa}}\u201d ({{zh|\u7d50\u9aee}}), literally  \u201ctying hair\u201d.  During the wedding ceremony, some Chinese couples exchange a lock of hair as a pledge, while others break a hairpin into two parts, and then, each of the betrothed take one part with them for keeping. If this couple were ever to get separated in the future, when they reunite, they can piece the two halves together, and the completed hairpin would serve as a proof of their identities as well as a symbol of their reunion. In addition, a married heterosexual couple is sometimes referred to as \u201c{{transl|zh|jie-fa fu-qi}}\u201d ({{zh|\u7d50\u9aee\u592b\u59bb}}), an idiom which implies the relationship between the pair is very intimate and happy, just like how their hair has been tied together.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Hairpin, China, Tang dynasty, 618-907, silver, gilt - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC04137.JPG|Chinese [[T'ang dynasty]] (618\u2013907) hairpin\nFile:Ming Dynasty Silver-gilt Hairpin 6.jpg|Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) hairpin\nFile:Ming Dynasty Silver-gilt Hairpin 7.jpg|Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) hairpin\nFile:Tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (\u6881\u838a\u738b) - Hairpins 1.jpg|Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] hairpins, 15th century\nFile:Tomb of Prince Chuang of Liang (\u6881\u838a\u738b) - Hairpins 2.jpg|Chinese [[Ming dynasty]] hairpins, 15th century\nFile:Kanzashi2.jpg|Ancient Japanese hairpins, period unknown\nFile:Hairpins moscow.jpg|Russian hairpins from [[Moscow]], probably 18th or 19th century\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fashion}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Hair pins}}\n*[[Bobby pin]]\n*[[Hair stick]]\n*[[Hatpin]]\n*[[Hair clip]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Historical clothing|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Fasteners]]\n[[Category:Hairdressing]]\n[[Category:Types of jewellery]]", "sha1": "16r7vmkuvjm4ugibrcentnrxcgbpuwz"}}, {"title": "Hz", "ns": "0", "id": "14232", "redirect": {"title": "Hertz"}, "revision": {"id": "783863976", "parentid": "705311730", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T04:03:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT  [[Hertz]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from initialism}}\n{{R mentioned in hatnote}}\n}}", "sha1": "2xpdd88om9x5ny38lhjtn2dw6hl7xot"}}, {"title": "Hate speech", "ns": "0", "id": "14233", "revision": {"id": "865697069", "parentid": "863320055", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T15:40:46Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fgnievinski", "id": "6727347"}, "comment": "/* See also */ * [[Criminal speech]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Discrimination sidebar |Manifestations}}\n'''Hate speech''' is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[ethnic origin]], [[national origin]], [[sex]], [[disability]], [[sexual orientation]], or [[gender identity]].<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hate+speech Definitions for \"hate speech\"], Dictionary.com.

In addition to being studied in civil and criminal law, engagement in hate speech or text is evidence of psychological and social disorder and ill-being such that the field is of importance to the study of medicine, social anthropology and religion also.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhile hate speech could be countered under obscenity law (on par with sexual obscenity, for example), as distinct from freedom of speech laws and censorship, little has been done to effectively pursue that direction of justice. Nonetheless, in terms of the adverse health effects hate speech is a matter that concerns Public Health for hate  - as a social disease - has the characteristics of a contagious disease where the medical model is used. Hate speech affects the first victim who is the perpetrator and then the second victim upon whom the perpetrator imposes his or her own self hate (Provost, 2013){{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}. Habitual hate speech is a form of verbal menacing of which there are two types: actual or vrais menacing and posturing or faux menacing and gesture. ''Vrais'' menacing constitutes intent to enact not just psychological harm but also bodily, psychological, metaphysical, spiritual and social harm. ''Faux'' menacing enacts all but bodily attacks to control and intimidate, being a form posturing and verbal gesture, as in the world of non-sentient animals, and is tolerated - even valorized - in some societies as \"honour crimes\" not so much against the primary victim who suffers the bodily, psychological, metaphysical, spiritual and social harm and attack but in actuality against a relative or member of the victim's family, organization, or community (Provost, 2017){{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}. Computer programming software -  new machine learning models - are now used to analyze speech and text for evidence of hate speech as overt and covert violence, including cyber-bullying. For example, the Hate Speech Detection Library for Python. The main challenge with detecting hate whether in speech or in text depends on distinguishing profane speech from hate speech (Malmasi and Zampier, 2017){{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}. There are more incidents of misogyny (hate of girls and women) which masquerades as pornography, prostitution and trafficking, for example, while incidents of misandry are rare (Dana Daniels, 2016){{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n==Hate speech laws==\nThe [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) states that \"any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law\".<ref>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 20</ref> The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD) prohibits all incitement of racism.<ref>[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], Article 4</ref> Concerning the debate over how [[freedom of speech]] applies to the Internet, conferences concerning such sites have been sponsored by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]].<ref>[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/FA869F4E19CCCBC1C1256A570031F062/$File/G0113724.doc?OpenElement ''Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the use of the Internet for purposes of incitement to racial hatred, racist propaganda and xenophobia, and on ways of promoting international cooperation in this area''], Preparatory Committee for the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance, United Nations, 27 April 2001</ref>\n\n=== Enforcement ===\nLaws against hate speech can be divided into two types: those intended to preserve public order and those intended to protect human dignity. Those designed to protect public order require a higher threshold be violated, so they are not specifically enforced frequently. For example, in Northern Ireland, as of 1992 only one person was prosecuted for violating the regulation in twenty-one years. Those meant to protect human dignity have a much lower threshold for violation, so those in Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands tend to be more frequently enforced.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Jeannine|title=Restraining the heartless: racist speech and minority rights.|journal=Indiana Law Journal|date=Summer 2009|volume=84|pages=963\u201379|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com.ezp1.lib.umn.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&csi=7410&sr=TITLE(Restraining+the+heartless%3A+racist+speech+and+minority+rights)%2BAND%2BDATE%2BIS%2B2009|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Hate speech laws by country==\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Main article|Hate speech laws in Australia}}\n[[Australia]]'s hate speech laws vary by jurisdiction, and seek especially to prevent [[victimisation]] on account of race.\n\n=== Belgium ===\n{{Main article|Belgian Anti-Racism Law|Belgian Holocaust denial law}}\nThe [[Belgian Anti-Racism Law]], in full, the ''Law of 30 July 1981 on the Punishment of Certain Acts inspired by Racism or Xenophobia'', is a law against hate speech and [[discrimination]] that the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Federal Parliament]] of [[Belgium]] passed in 1981.

Although most of his plays are set in Norway\u2014often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up\u2014Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into [[Ibsen (family)|a merchant family]] connected to the [[Patriciate of Norway|patriciate]] of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas have a strong influence upon contemporary culture.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|A [[silhouette]] of the [[Johan Andreas Altenburg|Altenburg]]/[[Paus]] family, members of the [[Skien]] [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]], shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar [[Georg Brandes]], \"my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien\", explaining that he was closely related with \"just about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings\", mentioning the families [[Paus]], [[Plesner (Norwegian family)|Plesner]], [[von der Lippe (Norwegian family)|von der Lippe]], [[Cappelen (family)|Cappelen]] and [[Blom (family from Skien)|Blom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter}}</ref><ref>Haugen (1979: 23)</ref> Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765\u20131797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] (1766\u20131855), after his mother Johanne, {{n\u00e9e}} Plesner (1770\u20131847), remarried.

Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref name=\"Templeton\"/>\n\nAt fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was aged 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym \"Brynjolf Bjarme\", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.<ref>Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen''. Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.</ref> Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently the Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.\n\n==Life and writings==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=December 2016}}\nHe spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.\n\nIbsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.\n\nHis next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.<ref>Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) {{ISBN|978-0-313-27290-5}}</ref><ref>Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)</ref>\n\nWith success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the \"drama of ideas\". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870]]\n\nIbsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.\n\n''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fianc\u00e9 despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often \"right\" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.\n\nAs audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the \"Summons of the Ideal\". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary \"invention\", his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIbsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the \"ideal\" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: \"30.8.[18]99.

Your amicably obliged Henrik Ibsen.\"]]\n\nLate in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society's moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' is probably Ibsen's most performed play,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day. ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll's House'' center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in ''A Doll's House'', many of today's audiences and theatre critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nIbsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel \"Stephen Hero\". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIbsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote [[Catiline]], Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish [[Norse saga]]-inspired [[Romantic period|Romantic]] tragedian [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]], \"the Scandinavian Moli\u00e8re\".

Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.\n\nThe oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632\u20131703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen \u2013 norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon}}</ref> Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.\n\nIbsen's biographer [[Henrik J\u00e6ger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that \"the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane\". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.<ref>[[Henrik J\u00e6ger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen.

Norsk eller fremmed?'', Nordisk forlag, Gyldendalske boghandel, Christiania and Copenhagen, 1916</ref>\n\nThe name Ibsen is originally a [[patronymic]], meaning \"son of Ib\" (Ib is a Danish variant of [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]]). The patronymic became \"frozen\", i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.\n\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

[[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] established the first Hawaiian-language [[constitution]] in 1839 and 1840.\n\nFor various reasons, including [[Hawaii Territory|territorial]] legislation establishing English as the official language in schools, the number of [[first language|native speakers]] of Hawaiian gradually decreased during the period from the 1830s to the 1950s. Hawaiian was essentially displaced by English on six of seven inhabited islands. In 2001, native speakers of Hawaiian amounted to less than 0.1% of the statewide population. Linguists were unsure that Hawaiian and other [[endangered language]]s would survive.<ref>see e.g. {{Harvcol|Hinton|Hale|2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The 1897 Petition Against the Annexation of Hawaii |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hawaii-petition/ |publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] }}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, from around 1949 to the present day, there has been a gradual increase in attention to and promotion of the language. Public Hawaiian-language immersion preschools called [[P\u016bnana Leo]] were established in 1984; other immersion schools followed soon after that. The first students to start in immersion preschool have now graduated from college and many are fluent Hawaiian speakers. The federal government has acknowledged this development. For example, the Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 changed the names of several [[national park]]s in Hawai{{Okina}}i, observing the Hawaiian spelling.<ref>[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/s939 Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000 (S.939)]</ref> However, the language is still classified as critically endangered by UNESCO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref>\n\nA [[creole language]] spoken in Hawai{{okina}}i is [[Hawaiian Pidgin]] (or Hawaii Creole English, HCE). It should not be mistaken for the Hawaiian language nor for a dialect of English.\n\nThe [[Hawaiian alphabet]] has 13 letters: five vowels (each with a long pronunciation and a short one) and eight consonants, one of which is the glottal stop called [[#Glottal stop |{{okina}}okina]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Hawaiian language takes its name from the largest island in the Hawaiian state, [[Hawaii]] (''{{lang|haw|Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' in the Hawaiian language). The island name was first written in English in 1778 by British explorer [[James Cook]] and his crew members. They wrote it as \"Owhyhee\" or \"Owhyee\". Explorers Mortimer (1791) and [[Otto von Kotzebue]] (1821) used that spelling.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=44, 459}}</ref>\n\nThe initial \"O\" in the name is a reflection of the fact that unique identity is predicated in Hawaiian by using a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] form, ''o'', immediately before a proper noun.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=144, 174}}</ref> Thus, in Hawaiian, the name of the island is expressed by saying ''{{lang|haw|O Hawai{{'okina}}i}}'', which means \"[This] is Hawai{{okina}}i.\"<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=187\u2013188}}</ref> The Cook expedition also wrote \"Otaheite\" rather than \"Tahiti.\"<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=41}}</ref>\n\nThe spelling \"why\" in the name reflects the {{IPA|[hw]}} pronunciation of ''wh'' in 18th-century English (still [[Pronunciation of English \u27e8wh\u27e9|used]] in parts of the [[English-speaking world]]). ''Why'' was pronounced {{IPA|[hwai]}}. The spelling \"hee\" or \"ee\" in the name represents the sounds {{IPA|[hi]}}, or {{IPA|[i]}}.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=61\u201365}}</ref>\n\nPutting the parts together, ''O-why-(h)ee'' reflects {{IPA|[o-hwai-i]}}, a reasonable approximation of the native pronunciation, {{IPA|[o h\u0250w\u0250i\u0294i]}}.\n\nAmerican missionaries bound for Hawai{{okina}}i used the phrases \"Owhihe Language\" and \"Owhyhee language\" in Boston prior to their departure in October 1819 and during their five-month voyage to Hawai{{okina}}i.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=304, 475}}</ref> They still used such phrases as late as March 1822.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=108\u2013109}}</ref> However, by July 1823, they had begun using the phrase \"Hawaiian Language.\"<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=306}}</ref>\n\nIn Hawaiian, ''{{lang|haw|{{okina}}\u014clelo Hawai{{okina}}i}}'' means \"Hawaiian language\", as adjectives follow nouns.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Carter|1996|pp=3 ''Figure 1''}}</ref>\n\n==Family and origin==\nHawaiian is a Polynesian member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=257\u2013258}}</ref> It is closely related to other [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] (the language of [[Easter Island]]) and [[Tongan language|Tongan]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAccording to Sch\u00fctz (1994), the [[Culture of the Marquesas Islands|Marquesans]] colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=334\u2013336; 338 ''20n''}}</ref> followed by later waves of immigration from the [[Society Islands]] and [[Samoa]]-[[Tonga]].

The Hawaiian cognate is part of the word {{IPA|/ana-hulu/}} ('ten days'); however, the more common word for \"10\" used in counting and quantifying is {{IPA|/\u0294umi/}}, a different root.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nApplication of the lexicostatistical method to the data in the table will show the four languages to be related to one another, with Tagalog having 100% cognacy with PAN, while Hawaiian and Tongan have 100% cognacy with each other, but 90% with Tagalog and PAN. This is because the forms for each number are cognates, except the Hawaiian and Tongan words for the number \"1\", which are cognate with each other, but not with Tagalog and PAN. When the full set of 200 meanings is used, the percentages will be much lower. For example, Elbert found Hawaiian and Tongan to have 49% (98 \u00f7 200) shared cognacy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=333}}</ref> This points out the importance of data-set size for this method, where less data leads to cruder results, while more data leads to better results.<ref name=\":2\" />{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nApplication of the comparative method will show partly different genetic relationships. It will point out [[sound changes]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=8\u201312}}</ref> such as:\n# the loss of all PAN word-final consonants in Tongan and Hawaiian;\n# [[Raising (phonetics)#Raised and lowered vowels|lowering]] of PAN {{IPA|*u}} to Tagalog {{IPA|[o]}} in word-final syllables;\n# retention of PAN {{IPA|*t}} in word-initial and word-medial position in Tagalog and Tongan, but shift to {{IPA|/k/}} in Hawaiian;\n# retention of PAN {{IPA|*p}} in Tagalog, but shift to {{IPA|/f/}} in Tongan and {{IPA|/h/}} in Hawaiian.\nThis method will recognize sound change #1 as a [[Comparative method#Genetically related languages|shared innovation]] of Hawaiian and Tongan. It will also take the Hawaiian and Tongan cognates for \"1\" as another shared innovation. Due to these exclusively shared features, Hawaiian and Tongan are found to be more closely related to one another than either is to Tagalog or PAN.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe forms in the table show that the Austronesian vowels tend to be relatively stable, while the consonants are relatively volatile.

The native people of the Hawaiian language relayed religion, traditions, history, and views of their world through stories that were handed down from generation to generation. One form of storytelling most commonly associated with the Hawaiian islands is [[hula]]. Nathaniel B. Emerson notes that \"It kept the communal imagination in living touch with the nation's legendary past\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Unwritten Literature of Hawaii: The Sacred Songs of the Hula |last=Emerson |first=Nathaniel B. |publisher=Washington Government Printing Office |year=1909 |isbn= |location= |pages=7 |quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe islanders' connection with their stories is argued to be one reason why Captain James Cook received a pleasant welcome.

Literacy in Hawaiian was widespread among the local population, especially ethnic Hawaiians. Use of the language among the general population might have peaked around 1881. Even so, some people worried, as early as 1854, that the language was \"soon destined to extinction.\"<ref>quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=269\u2013270}}</ref>\n\n===Suppression of Hawaiian===\nThe decline of the Hawaiian language dates back to a coup that overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy and dethroned the existing Hawaiian queen. Thereafter, a law was instituted that banned the Hawaiian language from being taught.<ref name=\":1\" /> The law cited as banning the Hawaiian language is identified as Act 57, sec. 30 of the 1896 Laws of the Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i:\n\n{{quote|text=The English Language shall be the medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools, provided that where it is desired that another language shall be taught in addition to the English language, such instruction may be authorized by the Department, either by its rules, the curriculum of the school, or by direct order in any particular instance. Any schools that shall not conform to the provisions of this section shall not be recognized by the Department.|source=The Laws of Hawaii, Chapter 10, Section 123<ref name=\"Congress 1898 p. 1-PA23\">{{cite book | last=Congress | first=United States. | title=Congressional Edition | publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office | issue=v. 3727 | year=1898 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VSxHAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA23 | access-date=2017-07-20 | page=1-PA23}}</ref>}}\n\nThis law established English as the medium of instruction for the government-recognized schools both \"public and private\". While it did not ban or make illegal the Hawaiian language in other contexts, its implementation in the schools had far-reaching effects. Those who had been pushing for English-only schools took this law as licence to extinguish the native language at the early education level. While the law stopped short of making Hawaiian illegal (it was still the dominant language spoken at the time), many children who spoke Hawaiian at school, including on the playground, were disciplined. This included corporal punishment and going to the home of the offending child to strongly advise them to stop speaking it in their home. Moreover, the law specifically provided for teaching languages \"in addition to the English language,\" reducing Hawaiian to the status of a foreign language, subject to approval by the Department. Hawaiian was not taught initially in any school, including the all-Hawaiian [[Kamehameha Schools]]. This is largely because when these schools were founded, like Kamehameha Schools founded in 1887 (nine years before this law), Hawaiian was being spoken in the home. Once this law was enacted, individuals at these institutions took it upon themselves to enforce a ban on Hawaiian. Beginning in 1900, Mary Kawena Pukui, who was later the co-author of the Hawaiian\u2013English Dictionary, was punished for speaking Hawaiian by being rapped on the forehead, allowed to eat only bread and water for lunch, and denied home visits on holidays.<ref>Mary Kawena Pukui, ''Nana i ke Kumu, Vol. 2'' p. 61\u201362</ref> [[Winona Beamer]] was expelled from Kamehameha Schools in 1937 for chanting Hawaiian.<ref>M. J. Harden, ''Voices of Wisdom: Hawaiian Elders Speak,'' p. 99</ref>\n\n===1949 to present===\nIn 1949, the legislature of the Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i commissioned Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert to write a new dictionary of Hawaiian, either revising the Andrews-Parker work or starting from scratch.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Sch\u00fctz|1994|pp=230}}</ref> Pukui and Elbert took a middle course, using what they could from the Andrews dictionary, but making certain improvements and additions that were more significant than a minor revision. The dictionary they produced, in 1957, introduced an era of gradual increase in attention to the language and culture.\n\nEfforts to promote the language have increased in recent decades.

In some dialects, {{IPA|/\u0294/}} remains as {{IPA|[k]}} in some words. These variations are largely free, though there are conditioning factors. {{IPA|/l/}} tends to {{IPA|[n]}} especially in words with both {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, such as in the island name ''L\u0101na{{okina}}i'' ({{IPA|[la\u02d0\u02c8n\u0250\u0294i]}}\u2013{{IPA|[na\u02d0\u02c8n\u0250\u0294i]}}), though this is not always the case: ''{{okina}}ele{{okina}}ele'' or ''{{okina}}ene{{okina}}ene'' \"black\".

While there is no use of [[inflection]] for verbs, in Hawaiian, like other [[Austronesian personal pronouns]],  [[declension]] is found in the differentiation between a- and o-class [[genitive case]] personal pronouns in order to indicate [[inalienable possession]] in a binary possessive class system. Also like many Austronesian languages, Hawaiian pronouns employ separate words for [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]] (clusivity), and distinguish [[Grammatical number|singular]], [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], and [[plural]]. The grammatical function of verbs is marked by adjacent [[grammatical particle|particles]] (short words) and by their relative positions, that indicate [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood]].\n\nSome examples of verb phrase patterns:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* ''ua'' {{sc|verb}} \u2013 [[perfective]]\n* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} ''ana'' \u2013 [[imperfective]]\n* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} ''nei'' \u2013 [[present progressive]]\n* ''e'' {{sc|verb}} \u2013 [[imperative mood|imperative]]\n* ''mai'' {{sc|verb}} \u2013 negative imperative\n* ''i'' {{sc|verb}} \u2013 purposive\n* ''ke'' {{sc|verb}} \u2013 infinitive\n\nNouns can be marked with [[article (grammar)|articles]]:\n* ''ka honu'' (the turtle)\n* ''n\u0101 honu'' (the turtles)\n* ''ka hale'' (the house)\n* ''ke kanaka'' (the person)\n\n''ka'' and ''ke'' are singular definite articles. ''ke'' is used before words beginning with a-, e-, o- and k-, and with some words beginning {{okina}}- and p-. ''ka'' is used in all other cases. ''n\u0101'' is the plural definite article.\n\nTo show part of a group, the word ''kekahi'' is used.

Officially known as the '''Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]] Polska}}), the Polish state was [[Polish Independence Day|re-established in 1918]], in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. When, after several regional conflicts, the borders of the state were fixed in 1922, Poland's neighbours were [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the [[Free City of Danzig]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. It had access to the [[Baltic Sea]] via a short strip of coastline either side of the city of [[Gdynia]]. Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-[[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungarian]] governorate of [[Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II|Subcarpathia]].  The Second Republic ceased to exist in 1939, when [[Invasion of Poland|Poland was invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)|Slovak Republic]], marking the beginning of [[World War II in Europe]]. \n\nIn 1938, the Second Republic was the sixth largest country in Europe. According to the [[Polish census of 1921|1921 census]], the number of inhabitants was 27.2 million. By 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, this had grown to an estimated 35.1 million. Almost a third of population came from [[minority group]]s: 13.9% [[Ukrainians]]; 10% [[Jew]]s; 3.1% [[Belarusians]]; 2.3% [[Germans]] and 3.4% [[Czechs]] and [[Lithuanians]]. At the same time, a significant number of ethnic Poles lived [[Polish diaspora|outside the country's borders]].\n\nThe political conditions of the Second Republic were heavily influenced by the [[aftermath of World War I]],  numerous conflicts with neighbouring states ([[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War|Ukraine]], [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak War|Czechoslovakia]], [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War|Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|Soviet Union]]) and the emergence of [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nThe Second Republic maintained moderate economic development. The cultural hubs of interwar Poland{{spaced ndash}}[[Warsaw]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Vilnius|Wilno]] and [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]]{{spaced ndash}}became major European cities and the sites of internationally acclaimed universities and other institutions of higher education.\n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|History of Poland (1918\u201339)|Timeline of Polish history#The Second Polish Republic (1918\u201339)}}\n\nAfter more than a [[Partitions of Poland|century of Partitions]] between [[Austrian Partition|the Austrian]], [[Prussian Partition|the Prussian]], and [[Russian Partition|the Russian]] imperial powers, Poland re-emerged as a sovereign state at the end of the First World War in Europe in 1917-1918.<ref>Mieczys\u0142aw Biskupski.

German and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] armies seized the [[Congress Poland|Russian-ruled part of what became Poland]]. In a failed attempt to resolve the [[Polish question]] as quickly as possible, Berlin set up a [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)|German puppet state]] on 5 November 1916, with a governing [[Provisional Council of State]] and (from 15 October 1917) a [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] (''Rada Regencyjna Kr\u00f3lestwa Polskiego''). The Council administered the country under German auspices (see also [[Mitteleuropa]]), pending [[Royal elections in Poland|the election of a king]]. A month before Germany surrendered on 11 November 1918 and the war ended, the Regency Council had dissolved the [[Council of State]], and announced its intention to restore Polish independence (7 October 1918).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} With the notable exception of the [[Marxism|Marxist]]-oriented [[Social Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] (''SDKPiL''), most Polish political parties supported this move. On 23 October the Regency Council appointed a new government under [[J\u00f3zef \u015awie\u017cy\u0144ski]] and began conscription into the [[Polish Army]].<ref>Richard M.

On 6 November socialists proclaimed the [[Republic of Tarnobrzeg]] at Tarnobrzeg in Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. The same day the Socialist, [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]], set up a [[Provisional People's Government of the Republic of Poland]] (''Tymczasowy Rz\u0105d Ludowy Republiki Polskiej'') in Lublin. On Sunday, 10 November at 7 a.m., [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], newly freed from 16 months in a German prison in [[Magdeburg]], returned by train to Warsaw. Pi\u0142sudski, together with Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], was greeted at Warsaw's railway station by Regent [[Zdzis\u0142aw Lubomirski]] and by Colonel [[Adam Koc]]. Next day, due to his popularity and support from most political parties, the Regency Council appointed Pi\u0142sudski as Commander in Chief of the Polish Armed Forces. On 14 November, the Council dissolved itself and transferred all its authority to Pi\u0142sudski as Chief of State (''[[Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa]]''). After consultation with Pi\u0142sudski, Daszy\u0144ski's government dissolved itself and a new government formed under [[J\u0119drzej Moraczewski]]. In 1918 Italy became the first country in Europe to recognise Poland's renewed sovereignty.<ref>Andrzej Garlicki (1995), ''J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, 1867\u20131935''.</ref>\n[[File:Polish-soviet war 1920 Polish defences near Milosna, August.jpg|left|thumb|Polish defences at [[Mi\u0142osna, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Mi\u0142osna]], during the decisive [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|battle of Warsaw]], August 1920.]]\n\nCenters of government that formed at that time in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (formerly Austrian-ruled southern Poland) included the National Council of the [[Principality of Cieszyn]] (established in November 1918), the [[Republic of Zakopane]] and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] (28 October). Soon afterward, the [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]] broke out in [[Lw\u00f3w]] (1 November 1918) between forces of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Military Committee of Ukrainians]] and the Polish irregular units made up of students known as the [[Lw\u00f3w Eaglets]], who were later supported by the Polish Army (see [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1918)]], [[Battle of Przemy\u015bl (1918)]]). Meanwhile, in western Poland, another war of national liberation began under the banner of the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u201319)]]. In January 1919 [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakian]] forces attacked Polish units in the area of Zaolzie (see [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak War]]). Soon afterwards the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian War]] (ca 1919-1920) began, and in August 1919 Polish-speaking residents of [[Upper Silesia]] initiated a series of three [[Silesian Uprisings]]. The most critical military conflict of that period, however, the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919-1921), ended in a decisive Polish victory.<ref>Norman Richard Davies, ''White Eagle, Red Star: the Polish-Soviet War, 1919\u201320'' (2nd ed. 2003)</ref> In 1919 the Warsaw government suppressed the Republic of Tarnobrzeg and the workers' councils.\n\n== Politics and government ==\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State (''Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa'')]] between November 1918 and December 1922]]\n\nThe Second Polish Republic was a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] from 1919 (see [[Small Constitution of 1919]]) to 1926, with the [[President of Poland|President]] having limited powers. The [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|Parliament]] elected him, and he could appoint the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] as well as the government with the [[Sejm]]'s (lower house's) approval, but he could only dissolve the Sejm with the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senate]]'s consent. Moreover, his power to pass decrees was limited by the requirement that the Prime Minister and the appropriate other Minister had to verify his decrees with their signatures. Poland was one of the first countries in the world to recognize [[women's suffrage]]. Women in Poland were granted the right to vote on 28 November 1918 by a decree of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski.<ref>A. Polonsky, ''Politics in Independent Poland, 1921\u20131939: The Crisis of Constitutional Government'' (1972)</ref>\n\nThe major political parties at this time were the [[Polish Socialist Party]], [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], various [[People's Party (Poland)|Peasant Parties]], [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]], and political groups of ethnic minorities (German: [[German Social Democratic Party of Poland]], Jewish: [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland]], [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]], and Ukrainian: [[Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance]]). Frequently changing governments (see [[Polish legislative election, 1919]], [[Polish legislative election, 1922]]) and other negative publicity the politicians received (such as accusations of corruption or [[1919 Polish coup attempt]]), made them increasingly unpopular. Major politicians at this time, in addition to Pi\u0142sudski, included peasant activist [[Wincenty Witos]] (Prime Minister three times) and right-wing leader [[Roman Dmowski]]. Ethnic minorities were represented in the [[Sejm]]; e.g. in 1928 \u2013 1930 there was the Ukrainian-Belarusian Club, with 26 Ukrainian and 4 Belarusian members.\n[[File:Czolg zamach majowy.jpg|thumb|left|[[May Coup (Poland)|The May Coup d'\u00c9tat]] (1926)]]\n\nAfter the Polish \u2013 Soviet war, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski led an intentionally modest life, writing historical books for a living. After he took power by a [[May Coup (Poland)|military coup]] in May 1926, he emphasized that he wanted to heal the Polish society and politics of excessive partisan politics. His regime, accordingly, was called [[Sanation|Sanacja]] in Polish. The [[Polish legislative election, 1928|1928 parliamentary elections]] were still considered free and fair, although the pro-Pi\u0142sudski [[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] won them. The following three parliamentary elections (in [[Polish legislative election, 1930|1930]], [[Polish legislative election, 1935|1935]] and [[Polish legislative election, 1938|1938]]) were manipulated, with opposition activists sent to [[Bereza Kartuska prison]] (see also [[Brest trials]]). As a result, pro-government party [[Camp of National Unity]] won huge majorities in them. Pi\u0142sudski died just after an [[April Constitution of Poland|authoritarian constitution]] was approved in the spring of 1935. During the last four years of the Second Polish Republic, the major politicians included President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]], Foreign Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Polish Army]], [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]].

Another 700,000 men served in the reserves. At the outbreak of the war, the Polish army was able to put in the field almost one million soldiers, 4,300 guns, 1,280 tanks and 745 aircraft.<ref name=\"Williamson2011\">{{cite book |author= David G.

The N.C.O.s were a competent body of men with expert knowledge and high ideals. The officers, both senior and junior, constantly refreshed their training in the field and in the lecture-hall, where modern technical achievement and the lessons of contemporary wars were demonstrated and discussed. The equipment of the Polish army was less developed technically than that of Nazi Germany and its rearmament was slowed down by confidence in Western European military support and by budget difficulties.<ref>Walter M.

In addition to the devastation wrought by World War I, the exploitation of the Polish economy by the German and Russian occupying powers, and the sabotage performed by retreating armies, the new republic was faced with the task of economically unifying disparate economic regions, which had previously been part of different countries.<ref name=\"wolf\"/> Within the borders of the Republic were the remnants of three different economic systems, with five different currencies (the [[German mark]], the [[Russian ruble]], the [[Austrian crown]], the [[Polish marka]] and the [[German ostruble|Ostrubel]])<ref name=wolf/> and with little or no direct infrastructural links. The situation was so bad that neighboring industrial centers as well as major cities lacked direct railroad links, because they had been parts of different nations. For example, there was no direct railroad connection between Warsaw and Krak\u00f3w until 1934. This situation was described by [[Melchior Wa\u0144kowicz]] in his book [[Sztafeta]].\n\nOn top of this was the massive destruction left after both World War I and the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]. There was also a great economic disparity between the [[Kresy Wschodnie|eastern]] (commonly called ''Poland B'') and western (called ''Poland A'') parts of the country, with the western half, especially areas that had belonged to the [[German Empire]] being much more developed and prosperous. Frequent border closures and a [[German\u2013Polish customs war|customs war]] with Germany also had negative economic impacts on Poland. In 1924 Prime Minister and Economic Minister [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]] introduced the [[z\u0142oty]] as a single common currency for Poland (it replaced the [[Polish marka]]), which remained a stable currency. The currency helped Poland to control the massive hyperinflation. It was the only country in Europe able to do this without foreign loans or aid.<ref name=\"onet\"/> The average annual growth rate ([[GDP per capita]]) was 5.24% in 1920\u201329 and 0.34% in 1929\u201338.<ref name=\"Broadberry\">Stephen Broadberry, Kevin H.

In the year 1937, [[foreign trade]] with all neighbours amounted to only 21% of Poland's total. Trade with Germany, Poland's most important neighbour, accounted for 14.3% of Polish exchange. Foreign trade with the Soviet Union (0.8%) was virtually nonexistent. Czechoslovakia accounted for 3.9%, Latvia for 0.3%, and Romania for 0.8%. By mid-1938, after the [[Anschluss]] of Austria, Greater Germany was responsible for as much as 23% of Polish foreign trade.\n[[File:MS Batory 1937.jpg|thumb|left|Poland's [[MS Batory]], and [[MS Pi\u0142sudski]], at the sea port of [[Gdynia]], 18 December 1937]]\n\nThe basis of Poland's gradual recovery after the [[Great Depression]] was its mass economic development plans (see [[Four Year Plan (Poland)|Four Year Plan]]), which oversaw the building of three key infrastructural elements. The first was the establishment of the [[Gdynia]] seaport, which allowed Poland to completely bypass [[Free City of Danzig|Gda\u0144sk]] (which was under heavy German pressure to boycott Polish coal exports). The second was construction of the 500-kilometer rail connection between [[Upper Silesia]] and Gdynia, called [[Polish Coal Trunk-Line]], which served freight trains with coal. The third was the creation of a central industrial district, named ''COP \u2013 Central Industrial Region'' ([[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy]]). Unfortunately, these developments were interrupted and largely destroyed by the German and Soviet invasion and the start of World War II.<ref name=\"AHP\"/> Other achievements of interbellum Poland included [[Stalowa Wola]] (a brand new city, built in a forest around a steel mill), [[Mo\u015bcice]] (now a district of [[Tarn\u00f3w]], with a large nitrate factory), and the creation of a central [[Bank of Poland|bank]]. There were several trade fairs, with the most popular being [[Pozna\u0144 International Fair]], Lw\u00f3w's [[Targi Wschodnie]], and Wilno's [[Targi P\u00f3\u0142nocne]]. [[Polish Radio]] had ten stations (see [[Radio stations in interwar Poland]]), with the eleventh one planned to be opened in the autumn of 1939. Furthermore, in 1935 Polish engineers began working on the TV services. By early 1939, experts of the Polish Radio built four TV sets. The first movie broadcast by experimental Polish TV was [[Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna (film)|Barbara Radziwi\u0142\u0142\u00f3wna]], and by 1940, regular TV service was scheduled to begin operation.<ref>[http://tvp.info/informacje/nauka/70-lat-telewizji-w-polsce/862059 70 years of television in Poland, TVP INFO, 26.08.2009]</ref>\n\nInterbellum Poland was also a country with numerous social problems. Unemployment was high, and poverty was widespread, which resulted in several cases of social unrest, such as the [[1923 Krak\u00f3w riot]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]. There were conflicts with national minorities, such as [[Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930)]], relations with Polish neighbors were sometimes complicated (see [[Soviet raid on Sto\u0142pce]], [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts]], [[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania]]). On top of this, there were natural disasters, such as [[1934 flood in Poland]].\n\n===Major industrial centers===\n[[File:Targi Wschodnie (1930th).jpg|thumb|right|[[Lw\u00f3w]], Eastern Trade Fair ([[Targi Wschodnie]]), 1930]]\n[[File:Gdynia_234669023555.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gdynia]], modern Polish seaport established 1926, photo dated 1938]]\nInterbellum, Poland was unofficially divided into two parts \u2013 better developed \"Poland A\" in the west, and underdeveloped \"Poland B\" in the east. Polish industry was concentrated in the west, mostly in Polish [[Upper Silesia]], and the adjacent [[Lesser Poland]]'s province of [[Zag\u0142\u0119bie D\u0105browskie]], where the bulk of coal mines and steel plants was located. Furthermore, heavy industry plants were located in [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] (''Huta Cz\u0119stochowa'', founded in 1896), [[Ostrowiec \u015awi\u0119tokrzyski]] (''Huta Ostrowiec'', founded in 1837\u20131839), [[Stalowa Wola]] (brand new industrial city, which was built from scratch in 1937 \u2013 1938), [[Chrzan\u00f3w]] (''[[Fablok]]'', founded in 1919), [[Jaworzno]], [[Trzebinia]] (oil refinery, opened in 1895), [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (the seat of Polish textile industry), [[Pozna\u0144]] ([[H. Cegielski \u2013 Pozna\u0144]]), Krak\u00f3w and Warsaw ([[Ursus Factory]]). Further east, in [[Kresy]], industrial centers included two major cities of the region \u2013 Lw\u00f3w and Wilno ([[Elektrit]]).<ref name=\"liberte.pl\"/>\n\nBesides coal mining, Poland also had deposits of oil in [[Boryslav|Borys\u0142aw]], [[Drohobych|Drohobycz]], [[Jas\u0142o]] and [[Gorlice]] (see [[Polmin]]), potassium salt ([[TESP (company)|TESP]]), and [[basalt]] ([[Bazaltove|Janowa Dolina]]). Apart from already-existing industrial areas, in the mid-1930s, an ambitious, state-sponsored project of [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]] was started under Minister [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]]. One of characteristic features of Polish economy in the interbellum was gradual nationalization of major plants. This was the case of [[Ursus Factory]] (see [[Pa\u0144stwowe Zak\u0142ady In\u017cynieryjne]]), and several steelworks, such as ''Huta Pok\u00f3j'' in [[Ruda \u015al\u0105ska]] \u2013 Nowy Bytom, ''Huta Kr\u00f3lewska'' in [[Chorz\u00f3w]] \u2013 Kr\u00f3lewska Huta, ''Huta Laura'' in [[Siemianowice \u015al\u0105skie]], as well as ''Scheibler and Grohman Works'' in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.<ref name=\"liberte.pl\"/>\n\n===Transport===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--first 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:WWII-Poland-1939-communications and industry.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Industry and communications in Poland before the start of World War II]]\n\nAccording to the 1939 Statistical Yearbook of Poland, total length of railways of Poland (as for 31 December 1937) was {{convert|20,118|km|0|abbr=off}}. Rail density was {{convert|5.2|km|1|abbr=off}} per {{convert|100|km2|abbr=off}}. Railways were very dense in western part of the country, while in the east, especially [[Polesie]], rail was non-existent in some counties. During the interbellum period, the Polish government constructed several new lines, mainly in the central part of the country (see also [[Polish State Railroads Summer 1939]]). Construction of extensive [[Warszawa G\u0142\u00f3wna railway station]] was never finished due to the war, and Polish railroads were famous for their punctuality (see [[Luxtorpeda]], [[Strza\u0142a Ba\u0142tyku]], [[Lataj\u0105cy Wilnianin]]).\n\nIn the interbellum, road network of Poland was dense, but the quality of the roads was very poor \u2013 only 7% of all roads was paved and ready for automobile use, and none of the major cities were connected with each other by a good-quality highway. Poles built in 1939 only one highway, 28&nbsp;km of straight concrete road connecting villages Warlubie and Osiek (mid-northern Poland). It was designed by Italian engineer Piero Puricelli.\n[[File:CwsT1 torpedo.jpg|thumb|left|[[CWS T-1]] ''Torpedo'' was the first serially-built car manufactured in Poland]]\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Poland had {{convert|340,000|km|0|abbr=off}} of roads, but only 58,000 had hard surface (gravel, [[cobblestone]] or [[Sett (paving)|sett]]), and 2,500 were modern, with asphalt or concrete surface. In different parts of the country, there were sections of paved roads, which suddenly ended, and were followed by dirt roads.<ref name=\"polityka\"/> The poor condition of the roads was the result of both long-lasting foreign dominance and inadequate funding. On 29 January 1931, the Polish Parliament created the State Road Fund, the purpose of which was to collect money for the construction and conservation of roads. The government drafted a 10-year plan, with road priorities: a highway from Wilno, through Warsaw and Cracow, to Zakopane (called Marshall Pilsudski Highway), asphalt highways from Warsaw to Pozna\u0144 and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, as well as a Warsaw ring road. However, the plan turned out to be too ambitious, with insufficient money in the national budget to pay for it. In January 1938, the Polish Road Congress estimated that Poland would need to spend three times as much money on roads to keep up with Western Europe.\n\nIn 1939, before the outbreak of the war, [[LOT Polish Airlines]], which was established in 1929, had its hub at [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|Warsaw Ok\u0119cie Airport]]. At that time, LOT maintained several services, both domestic and international. Warsaw had regular domestic connections with [[Gdynia|Gdynia-Rumia]], [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig-Langfuhr]], [[Katowice-Muchowiec Airport|Katowice-Muchowiec]], [[Krak\u00f3w-Rakowice-Czy\u017cyny Airport|Krak\u00f3w-Rakowice-Czy\u017cyny,]] [[Lviv International Airport|Lw\u00f3w-Skni\u0142\u00f3w]], [[Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica Airport|Pozna\u0144-\u0141awica]], and [[Vilnius|Wilno-Porubanek]]. Furthermore, in cooperation with [[Air France]], [[TAROM|LARES]], [[Lufthansa]], and [[Malert]], international connections were maintained with [[Athens]], [[Beirut]], Berlin, [[Bucharest]], [[Budapest]], Helsinki, [[Kaunas]], London, Paris, [[Prague]], [[Riga]], Rome, [[Tallinn]], and [[Zagreb]].<ref name=\"ministerstwa\"/>\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:PL Ursus Ci\u0105g\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|upright|''Ci\u0105g\u00f3wka Ursus'' was the first Polish farm tractor, produced in the years 1922-1927 in the [[Ursus Factory]]]]\n\nStatistically, the majority of citizens lived in the countryside (75% in 1921). Farmers made up 65% of the population. In 1929, agricultural production made up 65% of Poland's GNP.<ref name=\"lex\"/> After 123 years of partitions, regions of the country were very unevenly developed. Lands of former German Empire were most advanced; in [[Greater Poland]] and [[Pomerelia]], crops were on Western European level.<ref name=\"onet1\"/> The situation was much worse in parts of [[Congress Poland]], [[Eastern Borderlands]], and former [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where agriculture was most backward and primitive, with a large number of small farms, unable to succeed in either the domestic and international market. Another problem was the overpopulation of the countryside, which resulted in chronic unemployment. Living conditions were so bad that in several regions, such as counties inhabited by the [[Hutsuls]], there was permanent starvation.<ref name=\"przeglad-tygodnik\"/> Farmers rebelled against the government (see: [[1937 peasant strike in Poland]]), and the situation began to change in the late 1930s, due to construction of several factories for the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]], which gave employment to thousands of countryside residents.\n\n===German trade===\nBeginning in June 1925 there was a customs' war with the [[revanchist]] Weimar Republic [[German\u2013Polish customs war|imposing trade embargo against Poland]] for nearly a decade; involving tariffs, and broad economic restrictions. After 1933 the trade war ended. The new agreements regulated and promoted trade. Germany became Poland's largest trading partner, followed by Britain. In October 1938 Germany granted a credit of [[Reichsmark|Rm]] 60,000,000 to Poland (120,000,000 zloty, or \u00a34,800,000) which was never realized, due to the outbreak of war. Germany would deliver factory equipment and machinery in return for Polish timber and agricultural produce. This new trade was to be ''in addition'' to the existing German-Polish trade agreements.<ref name=\"biznes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20140729024023/http://biznes.pwn.pl/haslo/3883929/celna-wojna.html Wojna celna (German\u2013Polish customs' war)] (Internet Archive), Encyklopedia PWN, Biznes.</ref><ref>''Keesing's Contemporary Archives'' Volume 3, (October 1938) p. 3283.</ref>\n\n== Education and culture ==\n{{main|Polish culture in the Interbellum}}\n[[File:Kazimierz Bartel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Kazimierz Bartel]], also a scholar and mathematician]]\n[[File:Warsaw 1938.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The National Museum in Warsaw, opened in 1938.]]\nIn 1919, the Polish government [[Education in the Second Polish Republic|introduced compulsory education]] for all children aged 7 to 14, in an effort to limit illiteracy, which was widespread especially in the former [[Russian Partition]] and the [[Austrian Partition]] of eastern Poland. In 1921, one-third of citizens of Poland remained illiterate (38% in the countryside). The process was slow, but by 1931, the illiteracy level had dropped to 23% overall (27% in the countryside) and further down to 18% in 1937.

A graduate of middle school received a ''small [[matura]]'', while a graduate of high school received a ''big matura'', which enabled them to seek university-level education.\n\nBefore 1918, Poland had three universities: [[Jagiellonian University]], [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]].

[[Rudolf Weigl]] invented a vaccine against typhus. [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]] counted among the most important anthropologists of the 20th century. In [[Polish literature]], the 1920s were marked by the domination of poetry. Polish poets were divided into two groups \u2013 the [[Skamander]]ites ([[Jan Lecho\u0144]], [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Antoni S\u0142onimski]] and [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]) and the [[Futurism|Futurists]] ([[Anatol Stern]], [[Bruno Jasie\u0144ski]], [[Aleksander Wat]], [[Julian Przybo\u015b]]).

Theatre was very popular in the interbellum, with three main centers in the cities of Warsaw, Wilno and Lw\u00f3w. Altogether, there were 103 theaters in Poland and a number of other theatrical institutions (including 100 folk theaters). In 1936, different shows were seen by 5 million people, and main figures of Polish theatre of the time were [[Juliusz Osterwa]], [[Stefan Jaracz]], and [[Leon Schiller]]. Also, before the outbreak of the war, there were about a million radios (see [[Radio stations in interwar Poland]]).\n\n== Administrative division ==\nThe [[Administrative division of the Second Polish Republic|administrative division of the Republic]] was based on a three-tier system. On the lowest rung were the ''[[Gmina|gminy]]'', local town and village governments akin to districts or parishes.

The German [[invasion of Poland]] began on 1 September 1939, one week after [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] signed the secret [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]]. On that day, Germany and [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovakia]] attacked Poland, and on 17 September the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland|attacked]] [[Kresy|eastern Poland]]. [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw fell to the Nazis]] on 28 September after a twenty-day siege. Open organized Polish resistance ended on 6 October 1939 after the [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]], with Germany and the Soviet Union occupying most of the country. [[State of Lithuania|Lithuania]] annexed [[Vilnius Region|the area of Wilno]], and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)|Slovakia]] seized areas along Poland's southern border - including [[G\u00f3rna Orawa]] and [[Tatransk\u00e1 Javorina]] - which Poland had annexed from Czechoslovakia in October 1938. Poland did not surrender to the invaders, but continued fighting under the auspices of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] and of the [[Polish Underground State]]. After the signing of the [[German\u2013Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation]] on 28 September 1939, Polish areas occupied by Nazi Germany either became directly annexed to the [[Third Reich]], or became part of the so-called [[General Government]]. The Soviet Union, following [[Elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus]] (22 October 1939), annexed eastern Poland partly to the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], and partly to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (November 1939).\n[[File:7TP-2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish [[7TP|light tanks 7TP]]]]\n\nPolish war plans ([[Plan West]] and [[Plan East]]) failed as soon as Germany invaded in 1939. The Polish losses in combat against Germans (killed and missing in action) amounted to ca. 70,000 men. Some 420,000 of them were taken prisoners. Losses against the Red Army (which invaded Poland on 17 September) added up to 6,000 to 7,000 of casualties and MIA, 250,000 were taken prisoners. Although the Polish army \u2013 considering the inactivity of the Allies \u2013 was in an unfavorable position \u2013 it managed to inflict serious losses to the enemies: 14,000 German soldiers were killed or MIA, 674 tanks and 319 armored vehicles destroyed or badly damaged, 230 aircraft shot down; the Red Army lost (killed and MIA) about 2,500 soldiers, 150 combat vehicles and 20 aircraft. The Soviet invasion of Poland, and lack of promised aid from the Western Allies, contributed to the Polish forces defeat by 6 October 1939.\n[[File:ORP Orze\u0142 w Gdyni.jpg|thumb|right|[[ORP Orze\u0142 (1938)|ORP Orze\u0142]] was the [[lead ship]] of [[Orze\u0142-class submarine|her class]] of [[submarine]]s serving in the [[Polish Navy]] during [[World War II]]]]\n\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This often repeated account, first reported by Italian journalists as [[Polish cavalry#Cavalry charges and propaganda|German propaganda]], concerned an action by the Polish 18th Lancer Regiment near Chojnice. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September 1939 near [[Charge at Krojanty|Krojanty]], when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabers surprised and wiped out a German infantry formation with a mounted sabre charge. Shortly after midnight the 2nd (Motorized) Division was compelled to withdraw by Polish cavalry, before the Poles were caught in the open by German armored cars. The story arose because some German armored cars appeared and gunned down 20 troopers as the cavalry escaped. Even this failed to persuade everyone to reexamine their beliefs\u2014there were some who thought Polish cavalry had been improperly employed in 1939.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1990, the [[Polish government-in-exile]] operated in Paris and later in London, presenting itself as the only legal and legitimate representative of the [[Polish nation]]. In 1990 the last president in exile, [[Ryszard Kaczorowski]] handed the presidential insignia to the newly elected [[President of Poland|President]], [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], signifying continuity between the Second and [[Third Polish Republic|Third]] republics.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[History of Poland (1918\u201339)]]\n* [[1938 in Poland]]\n* [[1939 in Poland]]\n* [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], also known as the \"First Polish Republic\" and described as a \"republic under the presidency of the King\"\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"AHP\">''Atlas Historii Polski'', Demart Sp, 2004, {{ISBN|83-89239-89-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Davies\">[[Norman Davies]], [[God's Playground]], Columbia University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-231-12819-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0231128193&id=EBpghdZeIwAC&pg=PA299&lpg=PA299&vq=minorities+Jews+Ukrainians+percent&dq=Davies+minorities+Jews+Ukrainians&sig=DSpsbu1NQovhbLzjBqJyZM5-PRg Google Print, p.299]</ref>\n<ref name=\"lex\">[http://lex.pl/czasopisma/cph/sprawyrl.html Sprawa reformy rolnej w I Sejmie \u00c2l\u00e0skim (1922\u20131929) by Andrzej Drogon]</ref>\n<ref name=\"liberte.pl\">Witold Gadomski, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091117131412/http://www.liberte.pl/gospodarka/656-spata-dugu-po-ii-rp.html  Sp\u0142ata d\u0142ugu po II RP.] ''Liberte.pl'' {{pl icon}}.</ref>\n<ref name=\"ministerstwa\">Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazy i Lot\u00f3w, Lato 1939.

This message came with the visit of Helen Keller and her teacher, Mrs. John Macy, and both had a hand in imparting it Saturday evening to a splendid audience that filled The Memorial. The wonderful girl who has so brilliantly triumphed over the triple afflictions of blindness, dumbness and deafness, gave a talk with her own lips on \"Happiness,\" and it will be remembered always as a piece of inspired teaching by those who heard it.</blockquote>\n\nWhen part of the account was reprinted in the January 20, 2016, edition of the paper under the heading \"From the Files\", the column compiler added\n\n<blockquote>According to those who attended, Helen Keller spoke of the joy that life gave her. She was thankful for the faculties and abilities that she did possess and stated that the most productive pleasures she had were curiosity and imagination. Keller also spoke of the joy of service and the happiness that came from doing things for others&nbsp;... Keller imparted that \"helping your fellow men were one's only excuse for being in this world and in the doing of things to help one's fellows lay the secret of lasting happiness.\" She also told of the joys of loving work and accomplishment and the happiness of achievement.

For the first time I, who had thought blindness a misfortune beyond human control, found that too much of it was traceable to wrong industrial conditions, often caused by the selfishness and greed of employers. And the social evil contributed its share. I found that poverty drove women to a life of shame that ended in blindness.}}\n\nThe last sentence refers to prostitution and [[syphilis]], the former a frequent cause of the latter, and the latter a leading cause of blindness. In the same interview, Keller also cited the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 strike of textile workers]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] for instigating her support of socialism.\n\nKeller supported [[eugenics]]. In 1915 she wrote in favor of refusing life-saving medical procedures to infants with severe mental impairments or physical deformities, stating that their lives were not worthwhile and they would likely become criminals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Kim E.|title=The Radical Lives of Helen Keller|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0814758142|pages=36\u201337|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVQTCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA36&pg=PA36#v=onepage|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pernick|first1=M S|title=Eugenics and public health in American history.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 1997|volume=87|issue=11|pages=1767\u20131772|url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.87.11.1767|accessdate=October 12, 2016|doi=10.2105/ajph.87.11.1767|pmid=9366633|pmc=1381159}}</ref> Keller also expressed concerns about [[human overpopulation]].<ref name=\"pmquotes\">{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=https://www.populationmatters.org/making-case/quotations/|publisher=[[Population Matters]]|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref><ref name=wpbquotes>{{cite web|title=Quotes|url=http://www.worldpopulationbalance.org/quotes|publisher=World Population Balance|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Helen Keller13.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Keller, c. 1912]]\nKeller wrote a total of 12 published books and several articles.\n\nOne of her earliest pieces of writing, at age 11, was ''[[The Frost King]]'' (1891).

Adherents use several names to describe themselves, including Second Advent Christian, [[Swedenborgian]], and New Church.\n\nKeller described the progressive views of her belief in these words:\n\n<blockquote>But in Swedenborg's teaching it [Divine Providence] is shown to be the government of God's Love and Wisdom and the creation of uses. Since His Life cannot be less in one being than another, or His Love manifested less fully in one thing than another, His Providence must needs be universal&nbsp;...

Dunn traced the word back to the [[Cumbrian dialect|Cumbrian]] ''hoozer'', meaning anything unusually large, derived from the [[Old English]] ''hoo'' (as at [[Sutton Hoo]]), meaning \"high\" and \"hill\". The importance of immigrants from northern [[England]] and southern [[Scotland]] was reflected in numerous placenames including the [[Cumberland Mountains]], the [[Cumberland River]], and the [[Cumberland Gap]].<ref name=whatIsAHoosier /> Nicholson defended the people of Indiana against such an association, while Dunn concluded that the early settlers had adopted the nickname self-mockingly and that it had lost its negative associations by the time of Finley's poem.<ref name=H6>Haller, 6.</ref>\n\nJohnathan Clark Smith subsequently showed that Nicholson and Dunn's earliest sources within Indiana were mistaken. A letter by James Curtis cited by Dunn and others as the earliest known use of the term was actually written in 1846, not 1826. Similarly, the use of the term in an 1859 newspaper item quoting an 1827 diary entry by Sandford Cox was more likely an editorial comment and not from the original diary. Smith's earliest sources led him to argue that the word originated as a term along the [[Ohio River]] for [[flatboat]]men from Indiana and did not acquire its pejorative meanings until 1836, ''after'' Finley's poem.<ref name=\"smithNotSouthernScorn\">{{cite journal | url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/12270/18247 | title=Not Southern Scorn but Local Pride: The Origin of the Word Hoosier and Indiana's River Culture | author=Smith, Jonathan Clark | journal=[[Indiana Magazine of History]] |date=June 2007 | volume=103 | issue=2 | pages=183&ndash;194}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Harry Hoosier|Black Harry}}\nWilliam Piersen, a history professor at [[Fisk University]], argued for a connection to the [[African American|black]] [[Methodist]] minister [[Reverend#Methodist|Rev]].

He was a colorful figure in early Washington County history. Along with his son-in-law, John B. Brough, he was considered one of the two strongest men in Washington County, IN. He was always being challenged to prove his might, and seems to have won several fights over men half his age. After whipping six or eight men in a fist fight in Louisville, Ky, he cracked his fists and said, \"Ain't I a husher,\" which was changed in the news to \"Hoosier,\" and thus originated the name of Hoosier in connection with Indiana men.<ref>Salem Leader newspaper 1846 archive</ref>\n\nJorge Santander Serrano, a PhD student from [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] has also suggested that \"Hoosier\" might come from the [[French language|French]] words for redness \"''rougeur''\" or red-faced \"''rougeaud''\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.idsnews.com/article/2016/11/its-a-rouguer-nation|title=GUEST COLUMN: It's a \"rouguer\" nation?

In order to avoid being shot, a traveler would call out from afar to let themselves be known. The inhabitants of the [[log cabin|cabin]] would then reply \"Who's here?\" which {{ndash}} in the [[Appalachian English]] of the early settlers {{ndash}} slurred into \"Who'sh 'ere?\" and thence into \"Hoosier?\" A variant of this account had the Indiana pioneers calling out \"Who'sh 'ere?\" as a general greeting and warning when hearing someone in the bushes and tall grass, to avoid shooting a relative or friend in error.<ref>''The History of Indiana''. Textbook. {{c.|lk=no|1960}}.</ref>\n\nThe poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] facetiously suggested that the fierce brawling that took place in Indiana involved enough biting that the expression \"Whose ear?\" became notable. This arose from or inspired the story of two 19th-century French immigrants brawling in a tavern in the foothills of southern Indiana. One was cut and a third Frenchman walked in to see an ear on the dirt floor of the tavern, prompting him to slur out \"Whosh ear?\"<ref name=tri/>\n\n====Mr. Hoosier's men====\n[[Image:Portland1850s.jpg|thumb|right|350px|One possible origin of the term \"Hoosier\" came from the construction of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal]] (1826\u20131833).]]\nTwo related stories trace the origin of the term to gangs of workers from Indiana under the direction of a Mr. Hoosier.\n\nThe account related by Dunn<ref>Dunn, 16\u201317.</ref> is that a Louisville contractor named Samuel Hoosier preferred to hire workers from communities on the Indiana side of the Ohio River like [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]] rather than Kentuckians. During the excavation of the [[Louisville and Portland Canal|first canal]] around the [[Falls of the Ohio]] from 1826 to 1833, his employees became known as \"Hoosier's men\" and then simply \"Hoosiers\". The usage spread from these hard-working laborers to all of the Indiana boatmen in the area and then spread north with the settlement of the state. The story was told to Dunn in 1901 by a man who had heard it from a Hoosier relative while traveling in southern [[Tennessee]]. Dunn could not find any family of the given name in any directory in the region or anyone else in southern Tennessee who had heard the story and accounted himself dubious. This version was subsequently retold by [[list of Hoosier governors|Gov]].&thinsp;[[Evan Bayh]] and [[list of Hoosier senators|Sen]].&thinsp;[[Vance Hartke]], who introduced the story into the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' in 1975,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Graf.</ref> and matches the timing and location of Smith's subsequent research.

Murray carefully analyzed the use of \"hoosier\" in St. Louis, Missouri, where it is the favorite epithet of abuse. \"When asked what a Hoosier is,\" Murray writes, \"St. Louisans readily list a number of defining characteristics, among which are 'lazy,' 'slow-moving,' 'derelict,' and 'irresponsible.'\" He continues, \"Few epithets in St. Louis carry the pejorative connotations or the potential for eliciting negative responses that hoosier does.\" He conducted tests and interviews across lines of age and race and tabulated the results. He found the term ecumenically applied. He also noted the word was often used with a modifier, almost redundantly, as in \"some damn Hoosier.\"<br/><br/>In a separate section Murray speaks of the history of the word and cites Baker and Carmony (1975) and speculates on why Hoosier (in Indiana a \"neutral or, more often, positive\" term) should remain \"alive and well in St. Louis, occupying as it does the honored position of being the city's number one term of derogation.\" A radio broadcast took up where Murray left off. During the program ''[[Fresh Air]]'', [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], a language commentator, answered questions about regional nicknames. He cited [[Elaine Viets]], a ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch|Post-Dispatch]]'' columnist (also quoted by Paul Dickson), as saying that in St. Louis a \"Hoosier is a low-life [[redneck]], somebody you can recognize because they have a car on concrete blocks in their front yard and are likely to have just shot their wife who may also be their sister.\"|sign=Jeffrey Graff|source=\"The Word Hoosier\"<ref name=twh/>}}}} The word is also encountered in [[sea shanties]]. In the book ''[[Sea shanty#Stan Hugill and Shanties from the Seven Seas|Shanties from the Seven Seas]]''<ref name=\"hugillShanties\">{{cite book | title=Shanties from the Seven Seas | publisher=Mystic Seaport Museum | author=Hugill, Stan | year=1961 | location=Mystic, Connecticut | isbn=0913372706}}</ref> by Stan Hugill, in reference to its former use to denote [[cotton]]-stowers, who would move bales of cotton to and from the holds of ships and force them in tightly by means of [[jackscrew]]s. \"To hoosier\" is sometimes still encountered as a verb meaning \"to trick\" or \"to swindle\".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nA [[Hoosier cabinet]], often shortened to \"hoosier\", is a type of free-standing kitchen cabinet popular in the early decades of the twentieth century. Almost all of these cabinets were produced by companies located in Indiana and the name derives from the largest of them, the Hoosier Manufacturing Co. of [[New Castle, Indiana]]. Other Indiana businesses include [[Hoosier Racing Tire]] and the Hoosier Bat Company, manufacturer of wooden [[baseball bat]]s.\n\nThe word may have originated from the term for shooing a pig away from it's mate at feeding time.\n\nThe [[RCA Dome]], former home of the [[Indianapolis Colts]], was known as the \"Hoosier Dome\" before [[RCA]] purchased the [[naming rights]] in 1994.
