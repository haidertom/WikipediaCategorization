rite. Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of [[Jesus]], [[St. Bartholomew]] and [[St. Thaddeus]] in the 1st century.  The [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] can  trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D.

The author identifies and compares the formal powers of the president, prime minister, and parliament under the 1995 Constitution as well as the amendments introduced through the Constitutional referendum in 2005. Markarov argues that the highly presidentialized semi-presidential system that was introduced in the early 1990s gradually evolved into a Constitutionally more balanced structure. However, in practice, the president has remained dominant and backed by a presidential majority; the president has thus been able to set the policy agenda and implement his preferred policy. |postscript=. |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nArmenia became independent from the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic]] on 28 May 1918 as the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. After the First Republic collapsed on 2 December 1920, it was absorbed into the [[Soviet Union]] and became part of the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]]. The TSFSR dissolved in 1936 and Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union known as the [[Armenian SSR]].\n\nThe population of [[Armenia]] voted overwhelmingly for independence in a September 1991 referendum, followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the vote to [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]]. Ter-Petrosyan had been elected head of government in 1990, when the [[National Democratic Union of Armenia|National Democratic Union party]] defeated the Armenian Communist Party. Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected in 1996. Following public demonstrations against Ter-Petrosyan's policies on [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]], the President resigned in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]], who was elected President in March 1998. Following the [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting|assassination in Parliament]] of Prime Minister [[Vazgen Sargsyan]] and parliament Speaker [[Karen Demirchyan]] and six other officials, on 27 October 1999, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharyan to resign. Kocharyan was successful in riding out the unrest. In May 2000, [[Andranik Margaryan]] replaced [[Aram Sargsyan]] as Prime Minister.\n\nKocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament. These were rejected in a referendum the following May at the same time as parliamentary elections which left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in parliament. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.\n\nThe unicameral parliament (also called the [[National Assembly of Armenia|National Assembly]]) is dominated by a coalition, called \"Unity\" (Miasnutyun), between the [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican]] and [[People's Party of Armenia|Peoples]] Parties and the Agro-Technical Peoples Union, aided by numerous independents. [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaksutyun]], which was outlawed by Ter-Petrosyan in 1995\u201396 but legalized again after Ter-Petrosyan resigned, also usually supports the government. A new party, the [[Republic (Armenia)|Republic Party]], is headed by ex-Prime Minister [[Aram Sargsyan]], brother of [[Vazgen Sargsyan]], and has become the primary voice of the opposition, which also includes the [[Armenian Communist Party]], the [[National Unity (Armenia)|National Unity party]] of [[Artashes Geghamyan]], and elements of the former Ter-Petrosyan government.\n\nThe Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style [[parliamentary democracy]] as the basis of its [[form of government]]. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum since 1995, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the [[Electoral Commission (Armenia)|Electoral Commission]], and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. For the most part however, Armenia is considered one of the more pro-democratic nations in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]].  Observers noted, though, that opposition parties and candidates have been able to mount credible campaigns and proper polling procedures have been generally followed. Elections since 1998 have represented an improvement in terms of both fairness and efficiency, although they are still considered to have fallen short of international standards. The new constitution of 1995 greatly expanded the powers of the executive branch and gives it much more influence over the judiciary and municipal officials.\n\nThe observance of human rights in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings. [[Police brutality]] allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe. Most of Armenia's ethnic [[Azeri]] population was deported in 1988\u20131989 and remain refugees, largely in Azerbaijan. Armenia's record on discrimination toward the few remaining [[national minorities]] is generally good. The government does not restrict internal or international travel. Although freedom of the press and speech are guaranteed, the government maintains its monopoly over television and radio broadcasting.\n\n===Change to a parliamentary republic===\nIn December 2015, the country [[Armenian constitutional referendum, 2015|held a referendum]] which approved transformation of Armenia from a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] to a [[parliamentary republic]].<ref name=\"controlrisks.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.controlrisks.com/en/newsletters/russia-cis-riskwatch/issue-9/armenia-a-gateway-for-iranian-goods |title=Armenia a gateway for Iranian goods?|last=Ayriyan|first=Serine|work=ControlRisks {{pipe}} Russia/CIS Riskwatch Issue 9|date=April 2016|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, the president is stripped of his [[Veto#presidential veto|veto faculty]] and the presidency is downgraded to a figurehead position elected by parliament every seven years. The president is not allowed to be a member of any political party and [[re-election]] is forbidden.

[[Armenia]]''' grew by 7.5% in 2017 and reached a nominal [[gross domestic product|GDP]] of $11.5 billion per annum, while per capita figure grew by 10.1% and reached $3880.<ref name=\"arka2017gdp\"/>\n\nUntil independence, Armenia's economy was based largely on [[industry]]\u2014[[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[electronics|electronic products]], [[machinery]], [[processed food]], [[synthetic rubber]] and [[textiles]]; it was highly dependent on outside resources. [[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Armenian mines produce [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[gold]] and [[lead]]. The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel, including gas and nuclear fuel from Russia (for its one nuclear power plant.) The main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.\n\nLike other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nArmenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].\n\nContinued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and accelerating privatization. A liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program on state property privatization. The government has made major strides toward joining the World Trade Organization. By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace Metsamor, which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002. Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, [[remittances]] from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. The privatization of industry has been at a slower pace, but has been given renewed emphasis by the current administration. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however, the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-99. Armenia also managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years have been largely offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor. Continued Russian financial difficulties have hurt the trade sector especially, but have been offset by international aid, domestic restructuring and foreign direct investment.\n\n===Global competitiveness===\nArmenia ranks 70th out of 140 economies according to the 2018 [[Global Competitiveness Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_is_up_two_notches_in_global_competitiveness_index_2018/|title=Armenia is up two notches in Global Competitiveness Index 2018|website=arka.am|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>\n\nArmenia ranks 44th out of 180 economies according to the 2018 [[Index of Economic Freedom]].

From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\n[[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]]\n\nThe first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921&ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}\n\nThe Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a \"proletarian\" society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42&ndash;43}}\n\nArmenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}}\n\nIn 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992&ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}}\n\n=== Post-communist economic reform ===\n\nArmenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48&ndash;50}}\n\nBeginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nIn the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nA few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}\n\nArmenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50&ndash;51}}\n\n==GDP growth==\n[[File:GDP per capita growth in Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia in 2007-2016 in constant local currency.jpg|500px|thumb|GDP per capita growth in Armenia Azerbaijan Georgia in 2007-2016 in constant local currency, World Bank data]]\nThe economy of Armenia grew by 7.5% in 2017 and reached a nominal GDP of $11.5 billion per annum, while per capita figure grew by 10.1% and reached $3880.<ref name=\"arka2017gdp\" />\nWith 5.5% annual GDP growth rate in June 2017 Armenia was 4th best economy in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.imgur.com/ShspONb.jpg|title=GDP Annual growth rate, June 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=tradingeconomics.com|access-date=}}</ref>[[File:GDP Armenia Georgia Azerbaijan 1990 2016.jpg|500px|GDP per capita of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in years 1990-2016, World Bank data.|thumb]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and now President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], Kocharian's closest political associate. Other top government officials, including Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue.

The treaty establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of military equipment, such as tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft, and combat helicopters, and provides for the destruction of weaponry in excess of those limits. [[Armenia]]n officials have consistently expressed determination to comply with its provisions and thus Armenia has provided data on armaments as required under the CFE Treaty. Despite this, Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of diverting a large part of its military forces to [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|Nagorno-Karabakh]] and thus circumventing these international regulations. Armenia is not a significant exporter of conventional weapons, but it has provided support, including material, to the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] of Nagorno-Karabakh during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].\n\nIn March 1993, Armenia signed the multilateral [[Chemical Weapons Convention]], which calls for the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. Armenia acceded to the nuclear [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-[[nuclear weapon]]s state in July 1993. The U.S. and other Western governments have discussed efforts to establish effective nuclear export control systems with Armenia and expressed satisfaction with Armenia's full cooperation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Organization==\n===General staff===\nThe Armenian Armed Forces are Headquartered in [[Yerevan]], where most of the general staff is based.

These older systems are placing great demands on the logistics system for service, maintenance, replacement parts and necessary upgrades, costing the army both financially and in overall readiness. The ground force is engaged in an effort of reassessment, reorganisation and restructuring, as the future of Armenia's defence needs a revised force structure and unit mix. The army sees the need to maintain much of its traditional mechanised formations, but is looking to lighten and make more mobile and self-sustainable a small number of other formations. It must develop these newer formations to support its international requirements and effectively operate in mountainous and other rugged terrain, but it must do this without affecting the mechanised capability that is needed to confront Azerbaijan's conventional forces.<ref name=\"eskiyaordusu1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Armies/Armenia-Armenia.html|title=Defense & Security Intelligence & Analysis: IHS Jane's - IHS|publisher=|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Armenia has followed a policy of developing its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military.

Their main functions include deterrence, defense, [[peace]] support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Armenian society.\n\nThe Active Forces mainly have peacekeeping and defensive duties, and are further divided into Deployment Forces, Immediate Reaction, and Main Defense Forces. The Reserve Forces consists of Enhancement Forces, Territorial Defense Forces, and Training Grounds.

Soon, violence broke out against Armenians in Azerbaijan and Azeris in Armenia. In 1990, after violent episodes in Nagorno\u2013Karabakh and Azerbaijani cities like [[Baku]], [[Sumgait]] and [[Kirovabad]], Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sending troops to the region, and [[Black January|forcibly occupied Baku]], killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian populations in Karabakh, known as [[Operation Ring]]. Moscow also deployed troops to [[Yerevan]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], conflict escalated into a full-scale war between the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, supported by Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring sides in order to keep both under control.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMore than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting during the period of 1988 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized [[Shusha]] and [[Lachin]] (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in taking almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] adopted [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh War|four resolutions]] calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 at which time Russia brokered a cease-fire between the three sides.\n\nNegotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, [[sniper]]-fire and [[land mine|landmine]] incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMF3DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Negotiations+to+resolve+the+conflict+peacefully+have+been+ongoing+since+1992+under+the+aegis+of+the+Minsk+Group+of+the+Organization+for+Security+and+Co-operation+in+Europe.+The+Minsk+Group+is+co-chaired+by+Russia,+France,+and+the+United+States+and+has+representation+from+Turkey,+the+U.S.,+several+European+nations,+Armenia+and+Azerbaijan.+Despite+the+1994+cease-fire,+sporadic+violations,+sniper-fire+and+landmine+incidents+continue+to+claim+over+100+lives+each+year.%5B&source=bl&ots=c10lxy3XF-&sig=4KTSHQHY4higDLnWgjtvawm5u0s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi27rC0yqDXAhXm7oMKHQ-IBFwQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Negotiations%20to%20resolve%20the%20conflict%20peacefully%20have%20been%20ongoing%20since%201992%20under%20the%20aegis%20of%20the%20Minsk%20Group%20of%20the%20Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe.%20The%20Minsk%20Group%20is%20co-chaired%20by%20Russia,%20France,%20and%20the%20United%20States%20and%20has%20representation%20from%20Turkey,%20the%20U.S.,%20several%20European%20nations,%20Armenia%20and%20Azerbaijan.%20Despite%20the%201994%20cease-fire,%20sporadic%20violations,%20sniper-fire%20and%20landmine%20incidents%20continue%20to%20claim%20over%20100%20lives%20each%20year.%5B&f=false|title=Azerbaijan Business and Investment Opportunities Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic, Practical Information and Opportunities|last=Inc|first=IBP|date=2016-04-14|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781438776194|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSince 1997, the Minsk Group co-chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. Each proposal was rejected. Beginning in 1999, the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. The OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the presidents in [[Key West]], Florida. U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] launched the talks 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are still continuing to work with the two presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.\n\nThe two countries are still at war. Citizens of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of [[Armenian diaspora|Armenian descent]], are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.

There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived in relative peace under the Soviet iron fist. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast|Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO)]] of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] began a movement to unify with the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]]. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join [[Armenia]]. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The violence resulted in ''de facto'' Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when the three sides agreed to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 the sides also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is co-chaired by the [[United States|U.S.]], [[France]] and [[Russia]], and comprises [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]] and several [[Western europe during the cold war|Western European nations]].

Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms \"Apostolic\" and \"Orthodox\" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term \"Catholicos\" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).\n\nToday, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|Karabakh conflict]], Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its [[Black Sea]] ports. However, because of Armenia's reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 South Ossetia wa]]<nowiki/>r and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia's imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the [[Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline]] and [[South Caucasus Pipeline|South Caucasus natural gas pipeline]]) have also weighed on the mutual relations. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, \"We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.\"<sup>[59]</sup> However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve.

Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey's holding of historic Armenian lands{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{dubious|date=June 2015}} (ceded to them in the [[Treaty of Kars]], a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from the [[Ottoman Empire]] orchestrated by the [[Young Turks]] is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.\n\nOn 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to \"continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 |title=Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement |publisher=PanArmenian.net |date=5 June 2006 |access-date=12 November 2011}}</ref> Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the [[Armenian SSR]], it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.<ref>{{cite news\n  | title = In Vartan Oskanian's Words, Turkey Casts Doubt on the Treaty of Kars With Its Actions\n  | publisher = All Armenian Mass Media Association\n  | date = 13 December 2006\n  | url = http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&month=12&day=13&LangID=1\n  | access-date = 13 December 2006\n  | deadurl = yes\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009175655/http://www.mediaforum.am/armtoday.php?year=2006&month=12&day=13&LangID=1\n  | archivedate = 9 October 2007\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official [[Yerevan]] is not willing to do.\n\nIn the wake of the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship.

Its constitution was ratified 1966 and came into effect 1967. [[Executive power]] is discharged by the governor and the lieutenant governor. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The party system is a based on the United States party system. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThere is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the \"[[faamatai]]\" and the \"[[faasamoa]]\", which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the \"[[fono]]\" (council) and the chiefly system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters. The \"matai\" (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent Samoa.\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Government of American Samoa}}\n\nThe [[government of American Samoa]] is defined under the [[Constitution of American Samoa]].

The Secretary promulgated the [[Constitution of American Samoa]] which was approved by a Constitutional Convention of the people of American Samoa and a majority of the voters of American Samoa voting at the 1966 election, and came into effect in 1967.\n\nThe [[Governor of American Samoa]] is the head of government and along with the [[lieutenant governor of American Samoa]] is elected on the same ticket by popular vote for four-year terms.\n\nThe legislative power is vested in the [[American Samoa Fono]], which has [[bicameralism|two chambers]]. The [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 18 members, elected for a two-year term, 17 in single-seat constituencies and one by a public meeting on [[Swain Island]]. The [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] also has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands.\n\nThe [[judiciary of American Samoa]] is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the [[High Court of American Samoa]] is the highest court below the [[United States Supreme Court]] in American Samoa, with the District Courts below it. The High Court is located in the capital of [[Pago Pago]].

Ibn Sina's chief reward for this service was access to the royal library of the Samanids, well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Ibn Sina accused him of burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labors, but still found time to write some of his earliest works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nWhen Ibn Sina was 22 years old, he lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came to its end in December 1004. Ibn Sina seems to have declined the offers of [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], and proceeded westwards to [[Konye-Urgench|Urgench]] in modern [[Turkmenistan]], where the [[vizier]], regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small monthly stipend. The pay was small, however, so Ibn Sina wandered from place to place through the districts of [[Nishapur]] and [[Merv]] to the borders of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], seeking an opening for his talents. [[Qabus]], the generous ruler of [[Tabaristan]], himself a poet and a scholar, with whom Ibn Sina had expected to find asylum, was on about that date (1012) starved to death by his troops who had revolted. Ibn Sina himself was at this time stricken by a severe illness. Finally, at [[Gorgan]], near the [[Caspian Sea]], Ibn Sina met with a friend, who bought a dwelling near his own house in which Ibn Sina lectured on [[logic]] and [[astronomy]]. Several of Ibn Sina's treatises were written for this patron; and the commencement of his ''Canon of Medicine'' also dates from his stay in [[Hyrcania]].<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nIbn Sina subsequently settled at [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], in the vicinity of modern [[Tehran]], the home town of [[Al-Razi|Rhazes]]; where [[Abu Taleb Rostam|Majd Addaula]], a son of the last [[Buwayhid]] emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother ([[Seyyedeh Khatun]]). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, [[Shams al-Daula]], however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] he passed southwards to Hamad\u00e3n where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the ''Canon'' and the ''Sanatio'', were dictated and explained to his pupils. On the death of the emir, Ibn Sina ceased to be vizier and hid himself in the house of an [[apothecary]], where, with intense assiduity, he continued the composition of his works.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nMeanwhile, he had written to Abu Ya'far, the prefect of the dynamic city of [[Isfahan]], offering his services. The new emir of Hamadan, hearing of this correspondence and discovering where Ibn Sina was hiding, incarcerated him in a fortress. War meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad\u00e3n; in 1024 the former captured Hamadan and its towns, expelling the Tajik mercenaries. When the storm had passed, Ibn Sina returned with the emir to Hamadan, and carried on his literary labors. Later, however, accompanied by his brother, a favorite pupil, and two slaves, Ibn Sina escaped from the city in the dress of a [[Sufi]] [[ascetic]]. After a perilous journey, they reached Isfahan, receiving an honorable welcome from the prince.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\n=== Later life and death ===\n[[File:Avicenna canon 1597.jpg|thumb|upright|The first page of a manuscript of Avicenna's ''Canon'', dated 1596/7 (Yale, Medical Historical Library, Cushing Arabic ms. 5)]]\n[[File:Gravestone of Avicenna.jpg|thumb|upright|Gravestone of Avicenna, [[Hamedan]], Iran]]\nThe remaining ten or twelve years of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's life were spent in the service of the [[Kakuyid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Rustam Dushmanziyar]] (also known as Ala al-Dawla), whom he accompanied as physician and general literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns.<ref name=\"EB1911\" />\n\nDuring these years he began to study literary matters and [[philology]], instigated, it is asserted, by criticisms on his style.

Whereas existence is the domain of the contingent and the accidental, essence endures within a being beyond the accidental. The philosophy of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from [[Occasionalism]] can be seen in what is left of his work.\n\nFollowing al-Farabi's lead, Avicenna initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of being, in which he distinguished between essence (''Mahiat'') and existence (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things, and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.<ref name=\"Islam in Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071222082832/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-69190/Islam| archivedate= 22 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAvicenna's consideration of the essence-attributes question may be elucidated in terms of his ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (''mumkin bi-dhatihi'') has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (''wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi''). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (''wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi'') is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.<ref>Avicenna, ''Kitab al-shifa', Metaphysics II'', (eds.) G.C.

These included treatises on the [[Islamic prophet|prophets]] (whom he viewed as \"inspired philosophers\"), and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how Quranic [[cosmology]] corresponds to his own philosophical system. In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.\n\nThere are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works however that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider [[epistemological]] matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.<ref>James W. Morris (1992), \"The Philosopher-Prophet in Avicenna's Political Philosophy\", in C.

It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the [[madrasahs]].<ref>James W.

One of these texts included the ''Proof of Prophecies'', in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.<ref>Jules Janssens (2004), \"Avicenna and the Qur'an: A Survey of his Qur'anic commentaries\", ''MIDEO'' '''25''', p.&nbsp;177\u2013192.</ref>\n\n=== Thought experiments ===\n{{Main|floating man}}\nWhile he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \"[[floating man|Floating Man]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 literally falling man&nbsp;\u2013 [[thought experiment]] to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]], which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have [[self-consciousness]]. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance.<ref>See a discussion of this in connection with an analytic take on the philosophy of mind in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Avicenna and the Problem of Consciousness', in ''Consciousness and the Great Philosophers'', eds. S. Leach and J. Tartaglia (London: Routledge, 2016), 45\u201353</ref> The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human [[nous|intelligence]], particularly the [[active intellect]], which he believed to be the [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostasis]] by which God communicates [[truth]] to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\n{{quote|One of us (i.e. a human being) should be imagined as having been created in a single stroke; created perfect and complete but with his vision obscured so that he cannot perceive external entities; created falling through air or a void, in such a manner that he is not struck by the firmness of the air in any way that compels him to feel it, and with his limbs separated so that they do not come in contact with or touch each other. Then contemplate the following: can he be assured of the existence of himself? He does not have any doubt in that his self exists, without thereby asserting that he has any exterior limbs, nor any internal organs, neither heart nor brain, nor any one of the exterior things at all; but rather he can affirm the existence of himself, without thereby asserting there that this self has any extension in space. Even if it were possible for him in that state to imagine a hand or any other limb, he would not imagine it as being a part of his self, nor as a condition for the existence of that self; for as you know that which is asserted is different from that which is not asserted, and that which is inferred is different from that which is not inferred. Therefore the self, the existence of which has been asserted, is a unique characteristic, in as much that it is not as such the same as the body or the limbs, which have not been ascertained. Thus that which is ascertained (i.e. the self), does have a way of being sure of the existence of the soul as something other than the body, even something non-bodily; this he knows, this he should understand intuitively, if it is that he is ignorant of it and needs to be beaten with a stick [to realize it].|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000\" /><ref>Ibn Sina, ''\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062f\u0633 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644'' (Beirut, Lebanon.: M.A.J.D Enterprise Universitaire d'Etude et de Publication S.A.R.L)\n{{quote|{{lang|ar|\u064a\u062c\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u062f\u0641\u0639\u0629\u064b \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u062d\u062c\u0628 \u0628\u0635\u0631\u0647 \u0639\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062e\u0644\u0642 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0623\u0648 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0621 \u0647\u0648\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0635\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0641\u064a\u0647 \u0642\u0648\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0635\u062f\u0645\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0648\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062d\u0633 \u0648\u0641\u0631\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0648\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062b\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0647\u0644 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0634\u0643\u0643 \u0641\u064a \u0625\u062b\u0628\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0645\u0639 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u062f\u0645\u0627\u063a\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u064a\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0631\u0636\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0642\u0627\u064b \u0648\u0644\u0648 \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0623\u0645\u0643\u0646\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644 \u064a\u062f\u0627\u064b \u0623\u0648 \u0639\u0636\u0648\u0627\u064b \u0622\u062e\u0631  \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062a\u062e\u064a\u0644\u0647 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0644\u0627  \u0634\u0631\u0637\u0627\u064b \u0641\u064a \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u062a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0628\u0647 \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0623\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0648\u0623\u0639\u0636\u0627\u0626\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0641\u0625\u0630\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647 \u0633\u0628\u064a\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0634\u064a\u0626\u0627\u064b \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0628\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u062c\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0628\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0639\u0631 \u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627\u064b \u0639\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u062d\u062a\u0627\u062c \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0639\u0635\u0627\u0647.}}|Ibn Sina|Kitab Al-Shifa, On the Soul}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, Avicenna posited the brain as the place where reason interacts with sensation.

He discusses Aristotle's ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and significantly diverged from it on several points. Avicenna discussed the issue of a proper methodology for scientific inquiry and the question of \"How does one acquire the first principles of a science?\" He asked how a scientist would arrive at \"the initial [[axiom]]s or [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] of a [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] science without inferring them from some more basic premises?\" He explains that the ideal situation is when one grasps that a \"relation holds between the terms, which would allow for absolute, universal certainty\". Avicenna then adds two further methods for arriving at the [[first principle]]s: the ancient Aristotelian method of [[inductive reasoning|induction]] (''istiqra''), and the method of [[Hypothesis|examination]] and [[experiment]]ation (''tajriba''). Avicenna criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that \"it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide.\" In its place, he develops a \"method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGinnis|first=Jon|title=Scientific Methodologies in Medieval Islam|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|volume=41|issue=3|date=July 2003|pages=307\u2013327|doi=10.1353/hph.2003.0033}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\nAn early formal system of [[temporal logic]] was studied by Avicenna.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-65928 History of logic: Arabic logic], ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref> Although he did not develop a real theory of temporal propositions, he did study the relationship between ''temporalis'' and the implication.<ref>{{cite book |title=Temporal Logic: From Ancient Ideas to Artificial Intelligence |publisher=Springer |author1=Peter \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m |author2=Per Hasle |year=1995 |page=72}}</ref> Avicenna's work was further developed by [[Najm al-D\u012bn al-Qazw\u012bn\u012b al-K\u0101tib\u012b]] and became the dominant system of [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|Islamic logic]] until modern times.<ref>{{citation |title=Toward a History of Syllogistic After Avicenna: Notes on Rescher's Studies on Arabic Modal Logic |author=Tony Street |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=11 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=209\u2013228|doi=10.1093/jis/11.2.209 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521520690 |pages=247\u2013265 |editor1=Peter Adamson |last-author-amp=yes |editor2=Richard C.

He is apparently the first to conceive such a permanent type of impressed virtue for non-natural motion.\"</ref>\n\nThe theory of motion presented by Avicenna was probably influenced by the 6th-century Alexandrian scholar [[John Philoponus]]. Avicenna's is a less sophisticated variant of the [[theory of impetus]] developed by [[Buridan]] in the 14th century. It is unclear if Buridan was influenced by Avicenna, or by Philoponus directly.<ref>Jack Zupko, \"John Buridan\" in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2014\n([http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/buridan/notes.html#48 fn. 48])\n\"We do not know precisely where Buridan got the idea of impetus, but a less sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in Avicenna's doctrine of mayl (inclination). In this he was possibly influenced by Philoponus, who was developing the Stoic notion of horm\u00e9 (impulse). For discussion, see Zupko (1997) ['What Is the Science of the Soul? A Case Study in the Evolution of Late Medieval Natural Philosophy,' Synthese, 110(2): 297\u2013334].\"</ref>\n\nIn [[optics]], Ibn Sina was among those who argued that light had a speed, observing that \"if the perception of [[light]] is due to the emission of some sort of [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by a luminous source, the speed of light must be finite.\"<ref>[[George Sarton]], ''Introduction to the History of Science'', Vol. 1, p. 710.</ref> He also provided a wrong explanation of the [[rainbow]] phenomenon. [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] described Avicenna's (\"Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\") theory on the rainbow as follows:\n\n{{quote|Independent observation had demonstrated to him that the bow is not formed in the dark cloud but rather in the very thin mist lying between the cloud and the sun or observer.

These were known in Latin under the title [[De Anima]] (treatises \"on the soul\").{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Notably, Avicenna develops what is called the \"flying man\" argument in the Psychology of ''The Cure'' I.1.7 as defense of the argument that the soul is without quantitative extension, which has an affinity with [[Descartes]]'s ''cogito'' argument (or what [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] designates as a form of an \"''epoche''\").<ref name=\"Nader El-Bizri 2000 pp. 149-171\">[[Nader El-Bizri]], ''The Phenomenological Quest between Avicenna and Heidegger'' (Binghamton, NY: Global Publications SUNY, 2000), pp.&nbsp;149\u2013171.</ref><ref name=\"elbizri67-89\">Nader El-Bizri, \"Avicenna's De Anima between Aristotle and Husserl,\" in ''The Passions of the Soul in the Metamorphosis of Becoming'', ed.

Avicenna grounds his psychology on physiology, which means his account of the soul is one that deals almost entirely with the natural science of the body and its abilities of perception. Thus, the philosopher's connection between the soul and body is explained almost entirely by his understanding of perception; in this way, bodily perception interrelates with the immaterial human intellect. In sense perception, the perceiver senses the form of the object; first, by perceiving features of the object by our external senses. This sensory information is supplied to the internal senses, which merge all the pieces into a whole, unified conscious experience. This process of perception and abstraction is the nexus of the soul and body, for the material body may only perceive material objects, while the immaterial soul may only receive the immaterial, universal forms. The way the soul and body interact in the final abstraction of the universal from the concrete particular is the key to their relationship and interaction, which takes place in the physical body.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Avicenna | title = Avicenna's Psychology.

Avicenna was played by [[Ben Kingsley]].\n\n== Arabic works ==\nThe treatises of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 influenced later Muslim thinkers in many areas including theology, philology, mathematics, astronomy, physics, and music. His works numbered almost 450 volumes on a wide range of subjects, of which around 240 have survived. In particular, 150 volumes of his surviving works concentrate on philosophy and 40 of them concentrate on medicine.<ref name=\"MacTutor Biography|id=Avicenna\" />\nHis most famous works are ''The Book of Healing'', and ''The Canon of Medicine''.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been falsely attributed to him.  His ''Logic'', ''Metaphysics'', ''Physics'', and ''De Caelo'', are treatises giving a synoptic view of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian doctrine]],<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> though  ''Metaphysics'' demonstrates a significant departure from the brand of [[Neoplatonism]] known as Aristotelianism in Ibn S\u012bn\u0101's world;\nArabic philosophers{{who|date=February 2015}}{{year needed|date=February 2015}} have hinted at the idea that Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was attempting to \"re-Aristotelianise\" Muslim philosophy in its entirety, unlike his predecessors, who accepted the conflation of Platonic, Aristotelian, Neo- and Middle-Platonic works transmitted into the Muslim world.\n\nThe ''Logic'' and ''Metaphysics'' have been extensively reprinted, the latter, e.g., at Venice in 1493, 1495, and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine, logic, etc., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by Schmoelders in 1836).<ref>Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science & Mathematics by Fredrick Kennard, p. 115</ref> Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy, are often mentioned. The larger, ''[[The Book of Healing|Al-Shifa']]'' (''Sanatio''), exists nearly complete in manuscript in the [[Bodleian Library]] and elsewhere; part of it on the ''De Anima'' appeared at Pavia (1490) as the ''Liber Sextus Naturalium'', and the long account of Ibn Sina's philosophy given by [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]] seems to be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the Al-Shifa'. A shorter form of the work is known as the An-najat (''Liberatio'').

The Ashes are regarded as being held by the team that most recently won the Test series. If the test series is drawn, the team that currently holds the Ashes retains the trophy. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', immediately after Australia's [[History of Test cricket from 1877 to 1883#Australia win in England 1882|1882 victory]] at [[The Oval]], its first Test win on English soil.

The English media therefore dubbed the tour ''the quest to regain the Ashes''.\n\nAfter England had won two of the three Tests on the tour, a small urn was presented to Bligh by a group of [[Melbourne]] women including [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], whom Bligh married within a year.<ref name=events>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63185850 Summary of Events] ''[[The Illustrated Australian News]]'', 20 February 1884, (foot of column 2) at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> The contents of the urn are reputed to be the ashes of a wooden [[bail (cricket)|bail]], and were humorously described as \"the ashes of Australian cricket\".<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12673335 Cricket] ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|Hobart Mercury]]'', 4 June 1908, p.8, at [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]]</ref> It is not clear whether that \"tiny silver urn\" is the same as the small terracotta urn given to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] by Bligh's widow after his death in 1927.\n\n[[The Ashes urn|The urn]] has never been the official trophy of the Ashes series, having been a personal gift to Bligh.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ashes History|url=http://www.lords.org/history/mcc-history/the-ashes |publisher=Lords}}</ref> However, [[replica]]s of the urn are often held aloft by victorious teams as a symbol of their victory in an Ashes series. Since the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1998\u201399|1998\u201399 Ashes series]], a [[Waterford Crystal]] representation of the Ashes urn (called the Ashes Trophy) has been presented to the winners of an Ashes series as the official trophy of that series. Irrespective of which side holds the tournament, the urn remains in the MCC Museum at [[Lord's]]; it has however been taken to Australia to be put on touring display on two occasions: as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations in 1988, and to accompany the [[English cricket team in Australia in 2006\u201307|Ashes series in 2006\u201307]].\n\nAn Ashes series is traditionally of five Tests, hosted in turn by England and Australia at least once every two years. There have been 70 Ashes series: Australia have{{Clarification|why this particular style|date=August 2018}} won 33, England 32 and five series have been drawn.\n\n==1882 origins==\n{{main article|Australian cricket team in England in 1882}}\n[[File:Ranji 1897 page 143 F. R. Spofforth, the demon bowler.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fred Spofforth]], \"The Demon Bowler\", was instrumental in Australia's 1882 victory over England with 14 wickets for 90.]]\nThe first [[Test cricket|Test match]] between England and Australia was played in [[Melbourne]], Australia, [[English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1876\u201377|in 1877]], though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their [[Australian cricket team in England and the United States in 1882|tour of England]] that year the Australians played just one Test, at [[the Oval]] in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult [[Cricket pitch|wicket]].<ref>Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well.</ref> Australia made a mere 63 runs in its first [[innings]], and England, led by [[A. N. Hornby]], took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In its second innings, Australia, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from [[Hugh Massie]], managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler [[Fred Spofforth]], spurred on by the [[gamesmanship]] of his opponents, in particular [[W. G. Grace]], refused to give in. \"This thing can be done,\" he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory.\n\nWhen [[Ted Peate]], England's last batsman, came to the crease, his side needed just ten runs to win, but Peate managed only two before he was bowled by [[Harry Boyle (cricketer)|Harry Boyle]]. An astonished Oval crowd fell silent, struggling to believe that England could possibly have lost to a colony on home soil. When it finally sank in, the crowd swarmed onto the field, cheering loudly and chairing Boyle and Spofforth to the pavilion.\n\nWhen Peate returned to the pavilion he was reprimanded by his captain for not allowing his partner, [[Charles Studd]] (one of the best batsman in England, having already hit two centuries that season against the colonists), to get the runs. Peate humorously replied, \"I had no confidence in Mr Studd, sir, so thought I had better do my best.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n|first=Jack\n|last=Worrall\n|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83580262\n|title=A Great Bowlers' Victory\n|page=11 \n|newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] \n|location=Perth, WA |date=23 August 1930 \n|accessdate=25 August 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe momentous defeat was widely recorded in the British press, which praised the Australians for their plentiful \"pluck\" and berated the Englishmen for their lack thereof. A celebrated poem appeared in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' on Saturday, 9 September. The first verse, quoted most frequently, reads:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWell done, [[wikt:cornstalk|Cornstalks]]! Whipt us\nFair and square,\nWas it luck that tript us?\nWas it scare?\nKangaroo Land's 'Demon', or our own\nWant of 'devil', coolness, nerve, backbone?\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nOn 31 August, in the [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]]-edited magazine ''Cricket: A Weekly Record of The Game'', there appeared a mock obituary:\n\n:''SACRED TO THE MEMORY''\n:''OF''\n:''ENGLAND'S SUPREMACY IN THE''\n:''CRICKET-FIELD''\n:''WHICH EXPIRED''\n:''ON THE 29TH DAY OF AUGUST, AT THE OVAL''\n:''\"ITS END WAS PEATE\"''\n\n[[File:DeathofEnglishCricket.jpg|thumb|The death notice that appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]'']]\nOn 2 September a more celebrated mock obituary, written by [[Reginald Shirley Brooks]], appeared in ''[[The Sporting Times]]''. It read:\n\n:''In Affectionate Remembrance''\n:''of''\n:''ENGLISH CRICKET,''\n:''which died at the Oval''\n:''on''\n:''29 August 1882,''\n:''Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing''\n:''friends and acquaintances''\n\n:''R.I.P.''\n\n:''N.B.\u2014The body will be cremated and the''\n:''ashes taken to Australia.''\n\n[[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo Bligh]] promised that on [[English cricket team in Australia in 1882\u201383|1882\u201383 tour of Australia]], he would, as England's captain, \"recover those Ashes\". He spoke of them several times over the course of the tour, and the Australian media quickly caught on. The three-match series resulted in a two-one win to England, notwithstanding a fourth match, won by the Australians, whose status remains a matter of ardent dispute.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn the 20 years following Bligh's campaign the term \"the Ashes\" largely disappeared from public use. There is no indication that this was the accepted name for the series, at least not in England. The term became popular again in Australia first, when [[George Giffen]], in his memoirs (''With Bat and Ball'', 1899), used the term as if it were well known.<ref>Gibson, A., ''Cricket Captains of England'', p. 26.</ref>\n\nThe true and global revitalisation of interest in the concept dates from 1903, when [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]] took a team to Australia with the promise that he would regain \"the ashes\". As had been the case on Bligh's tour 20 years before, the Australian media latched fervently onto the term and, this time, it stuck. Having fulfilled his promise, Warner published a book entitled ''How We Recovered the Ashes''. Although the origins of the term are not referred to in the text, the title served (along with the general hype created in Australia) to revive public interest in the legend. The first mention of \"the Ashes\" in [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] occurs in 1905, while ''Wisden'''s first account of the legend is in the 1922 edition.\n\n==Urn==\n{{Main article|The Ashes urn}}\n[[File:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|right|thumb|The earliest published photo of [[the Ashes urn]], from ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 1921]]\n[[File:Rupertswood mansion side angle shot.jpg|thumb|[[Rupertswood]] outside Melbourne, where the urn was presented to Bligh]]\nAs it took many years for the name \"the Ashes\" to be given to ongoing series between England and Australia, there was no concept of there being a representation of the ashes being presented to the winners. As late as 1925 the following verse appeared in ''The Cricketers Annual'':\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nSo here's to Chapman, Hendren and Hobbs,\nGilligan, Woolley and Hearne\nMay they bring back to the Motherland,\nThe ashes which have no urn!\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nNevertheless, several attempts had been made to embody the Ashes in a physical memorial. Examples include one presented to Warner in 1904, another to Australian captain M. A. Noble in 1909, and another to Australian captain W. M. Woodfull in 1934.\n\nThe oldest, and the one to enjoy enduring fame, was the one presented to Bligh, later Lord Darnley, during the 1882\u201383 tour. The precise nature of the origin of [[The Ashes urn|this urn]] is matter of dispute. Based on a statement by Darnley in 1894, it was believed that a group of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] ladies, including Darnley's later wife [[Florence Bligh, Countess of Darnley|Florence Morphy]], made the presentation after the victory in the Third Test in 1883. More recent researchers, in particular Ronald Willis<ref>{{Cite book| first=Ronald | last=Willis | title=Cricket's Biggest Mystery: The Ashes | isbn=0-7270-1768-3}}</ref> and Joy Munns<ref>{{Cite book| first=Joy | last=Munns | title=Beyond Reasonable Doubt: The birthplace of the Ashes | isbn=0-646-22153-1}}</ref> have studied the tour in detail and concluded that the presentation was made after a private cricket match played over Christmas 1882 when the English team were guests of [[Sir William John Clarke|Sir William Clarke]], at his property \"[[Rupertswood]]\", in [[Sunbury, Victoria]]. This was before the matches had started. The prime evidence for this theory was provided by a descendant of Clarke.\n\nIn August 1926 Ivo Bligh (now Lord Darnley) displayed the Ashes urn at the ''[[Morning Post]]'' Decorative Art Exhibition held in the Central Hall, Westminster. He made the following statement about how he was given the urn:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58247421?searchTerm=darnley%20cricket%20ashes&searchLimits= |title=Sunday Times (Perth) 15 August 1926 page 9S. Online Reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=15 August 1926 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|When in the autumn the English Eleven went to Australia it was said that they had come to Australia to \"fetch\" the ashes. England won two out of the three matches played against Murdoch's Australian Eleven, and after the third match some Melbourne ladies put some ashes into a small urn and gave them to me as captain of the English Eleven.}}\n\nA more detailed account of how the Ashes were given to Ivo Bligh was outlined by his wife, the Countess of Darnley, in 1930 during a speech at a cricket luncheon. Her speech was reported by the London Times as follows:<ref>The Times (London), 27 June 1930. page 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In 1882, she said, it was first spoken of when the Sporting Times, after the Australians had thoroughly beaten the English at the Oval, wrote an obituary in affectionate memory of English cricket \"whose demise was deeply lamented and the body would be cremated and taken to Australia\". Her husband, then Ivo Bligh, took a team to Australia in the following year. Punch had a poem containing the words \"When Ivo comes back with the urn\" and when Ivo Bligh wiped out the defeat Lady Clarke, wife of Sir W. J. Clarke, who entertained the English so lavishly, found a little wooden urn, burnt a bail, put the ashes in the urn, and wrapping it in a red velvet bag, put it into her husband's (Ivo Bligh's) hands. He had always regarded it as a great treasure.}}\n\nThere is another statement which is not totally clear made by Lord Darnley in 1921 about the timing of the presentation of the urn. He was interviewed in his home at Cobham Hall by Montague Grover and the report of this interview was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article66512851?searchTerm=%22cobham%20hall%22%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192 |title=Geraldton Guardian 15 February 1921, page 1. Online reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=15 February 1921 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|This urn was presented to Lord Darnley by some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team, and before he returned with the members to England.}}\n\nHe made a similar statement in 1926. The report of this statement in the Brisbane Courier was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article21053463?searchTerm=darnley%20ashes%20urn&searchLimits=l-decade=192|title=Brisbane Courier, 9 June 1926, page 7. Online reference |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date=9 June 1926 |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The proudest possession of Lord Darnley is an earthenware urn containing the ashes which were presented to him by Melbourne residents when he captained the Englishmen in 1882. Though the team did not win, the urn containing the ashes was sent to him just before leaving Melbourne.}}\n\nThe contents of the urn are also problematic; they were variously reported to be the remains of a stump, bail or the outer casing of a ball, but in 1998 Darnley's 82-year-old daughter-in-law said they were the remains of her mother-in-law's veil, casting a further layer of doubt on the matter. However, during the tour of Australia in 2006/7, the MCC official accompanying the urn said the veil legend had been discounted, and it was now \"95% certain\" that the urn contains the ashes of a cricket bail. Speaking on Channel Nine TV on 25 November 2006, he said x-rays of the urn had shown the pedestal and handles were cracked, and repair work had to be carried out. The urn is made of [[terracotta]] and is about {{convert|6|in|mm}} tall and may originally have been a perfume jar.\n\n[[File:Ashes song.jpg|thumb|The full version of the song from the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'', the fourth verse of which is pasted onto the urn]]\nA label containing a six-line verse is pasted on the urn. This is the fourth verse of a song-lyric published in the ''[[Melbourne Punch]]'' on 1 February 1883:\n\n<blockquote>\n<poem>\nWhen [[Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley|Ivo]] goes back with the urn, the urn;\n[[Studd brothers|Studds]], [[A G Steel|Steel]], [[Walter Read|Read]] and [[Edward Tylecote|Tylecote]] return, return;\nThe [[wikt:make the welkin ring|welkin]] will ring loud,\nThe great crowd will feel proud,\nSeeing [[Dick Barlow|Barlow]] and [[Billy Bates|Bates]] with the urn, the urn;\nAnd the rest coming home with the urn.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn February 1883, just before the disputed Fourth Test, a velvet bag made by Mrs Ann Fletcher, the daughter of Joseph Hines Clarke and Marion Wright, both of [[Dublin]], was given to Bligh to contain the urn.\n\nDuring Darnley's lifetime there was little public knowledge of the urn, and no record of a published photograph exists before 1921.  ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' published this photo in January 1921 (shown above).\n\nWhen Darnley died in 1927 his widow presented the urn to the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] and that was the key event in establishing the urn as the physical embodiment of the legendary ashes. MCC first displayed the urn in the Long Room at [[Lord's]] and since 1953 in the MCC Cricket Museum at the ground. MCC's wish for it to be seen by as wide a range of cricket enthusiasts as possible has led to its being mistaken for an official trophy.\n\nIt is in fact a private memento, and for this reason it is never awarded to either England or Australia, but is kept permanently in the MCC Cricket Museum where it can be seen together with the specially made red and gold velvet bag and the scorecard of the 1882 match.\n\nBecause the urn itself is so delicate, it has been allowed to travel to Australia only twice. The first occasion was in 1988 for a museum tour as part of the [[Australian Bicentenary]] celebrations; the second was for the 2006/7 Ashes series.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6052544.stm | title=Ashes urn heads to Australia |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=15 October 2006 | accessdate=8 November 2007}}</ref> The urn arrived on 17 October 2006, going on display at the [[Museum of Sydney]]. It then toured to other states, with the final appearance at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery on 21 January 2007.\n\nIn the 1990s, given Australia's long dominance of the Ashes and the popular acceptance of the Darnley urn as \"the Ashes\", the idea was mooted that the victorious team should be awarded the urn as a trophy and allowed to retain it until the next series. As its condition is fragile and it is a prized exhibit at the MCC Cricket Museum, the MCC would not agree. Furthermore, in 2002, Bligh's great-great-grandson Lord Clifton, the heir-apparent to the [[Earl of Darnley|Earldom of Darnley]], argued that the Ashes urn should not be returned to Australia because it belonged to his family and was given to the MCC only for safe keeping.\n\nAs a compromise, the MCC commissioned a trophy in the form of a larger replica of the urn in [[Waterford Crystal]], to award to the winning team of each series from 1998\u201399. This is known as the Ashes Trophy.<ref>[http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy/ \"What is the Ashes Trophy?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910205923/http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/what-is-the-ashes-trophy |date=10 September 2013 }}, Lord's website.

Publicity surrounding the series was intense, and it was at some time during this series that the Ashes urn was crafted. Australia won the First Test by [[Result (cricket)|nine wickets]], but in the next two England were victorious. At the end of the Third Test, England were generally considered to have \"won back the Ashes\" 2\u20131. A fourth match was played, against a \"United Australian XI\", which was arguably stronger than the Australian sides that had competed in the previous three matches; this game, however, is not generally considered part of the 1882\u201383 series. It \"is\" counted as a Test, but as a standalone. This match ended in a victory for Australia.\n\n===1884 to 1896===\nAfter Bligh's victory, there was an extended period of English dominance. The tours generally had fewer Tests in the 1880s and 1890s than people have grown accustomed to in more recent years, the first five-Test series taking place only in 1894\u201395. England lost only four Ashes Tests in the 1880s out of 23 played, and they won all the seven series contested.\n\nThere was more chopping and changing in the teams, given that there was no official board of selectors for each country (in 1887\u201388, two separate English teams were on tour in Australia) and popularity with the fans varied. The 1890s games were more closely fought, Australia taking its first series win since 1882 with a 2\u20131 victory in 1891\u201392. But England dominated, winning the next three series to 1896 despite continuing player disputes.\n\nThe [[English cricket team in Australia in 1894-95|1894\u201395]] series began in sensational fashion when England won the First Test at Sydney by just 10 runs having followed on. Australia had scored a massive 586 ([[Syd Gregory]] 201, [[George Giffen]] 161) and then dismissed England for 325. But England responded with 437 and then dramatically dismissed Australia for 166 with [[Bobby Peel]] taking 6 for 67. At the close of the second last day's play, Australia were 113\u20132, needing only 64 more runs. But heavy rain fell overnight and next morning the two slow left-arm bowlers, Peel and [[Johnny Briggs (cricketer)|Johnny Briggs]], were all but unplayable. England went on to win the series 3\u20132 after it had been all square before the Final Test, which England won by 6 wickets. The English heroes were Peel, with 27 wickets in the series at an average of 26.70, and [[Tom Richardson (cricketer)|Tom Richardson]], with 32 at 26.53.\n\nIn 1896 England under the captaincy of [[W. G. Grace]] won the series 2\u20131, and this marked the end of England's longest period of Ashes dominance.\n\n===1897 to 1902===\nAustralia resoundingly won the 1897\u201398 series by 4\u20131 under the captaincy of [[Harry Trott]]. His successor [[Joe Darling]] won the next three series in 1899, 1901\u201302 and the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1902|classic 1902 series]], which became one of the most famous in the history of Test cricket.\n\nFive matches were played in 1902 but the first two were drawn after being hit by bad weather. In the First Test (the first played at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]]), after scoring 376 England bowled out Australia for 36 ([[Wilfred Rhodes]] 7/17) and reduced them to 46\u20132 when they followed on. Australia won the Third and Fourth Tests at [[Bramall Lane]] and [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] respectively. At Old Trafford, Australia won by just 3 runs after [[Victor Trumper]] had scored 104 on a \"bad wicket\", reaching his hundred before lunch on the first day. England won the last Test at [[The Oval]] by one wicket. Chasing 263 to win, it slumped to 48\u20135 before [[Gilbert Jessop|Jessop's]] 104 gave them a chance. He reached his hundred in just 75 minutes. The last-wicket pair of [[George Herbert Hirst|George Hirst]] and Rhodes were required to score 15 runs for victory. When Rhodes joined him, Hirst reportedly said: \"We'll get them in singles, Wilfred.\" In fact, they scored thirteen singles and a two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/152487.html|title=Wisden - The glorious uncertainty|author=|date=|website=espncricinfo.com}}</ref>\n\nThe period of Darling's captaincy saw the emergence of outstanding Australian players such as Trumper, [[Warwick Armstrong]], [[James Kelly (cricketer)|James Kelly]], [[Monty Noble]], [[Clem Hill]], [[Hugh Trumble]] and [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]].\n\n===Reviving the legend===\nAfter what the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] saw as the problems of the earlier professional and amateur series they decided to take control of organising tours themselves, and this led to the first MCC tour of Australia in 1903\u201304. England won it against the odds, and [[Plum Warner]], the England captain, wrote up his version of the tour in his book ''How We Recovered The Ashes''.<ref>[[Plum Warner]], ''How We Recovered The Ashes'', Longman, 1905</ref> The title of this book revived the Ashes legend and it was after this that England v Australia series were customarily referred to as \"The Ashes\".\n\n===1905 to 1912===\nEngland and Australia were evenly matched until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Five more series took place between 1905 and 1912. In 1905 England's captain [[Stanley Jackson]] not only won the series 2\u20130, but also won the toss in all five matches and headed both the batting and the bowling averages. Monty Noble led Australia to victory in both 1907\u201308 and 1909. Then England won in 1911\u201312 by four matches to one. [[Jack Hobbs]] establishing himself as England's first-choice opening batsman with three centuries, while [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] (32 wickets at 21.62) and [[Sydney Barnes]] (34 wickets at 22.88) formed a formidable bowling partnership.\n\nEngland retained the Ashes when it won the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]], which also featured [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The Australian touring party had been severely weakened by a [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|dispute]] between the board and players that caused [[Clem Hill]], [[Victor Trumper]], Warwick Armstrong, [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Sammy Carter]] and [[Vernon Ransford]] to be omitted.<ref>Harte, pp. 251\u2013256.</ref>\n\n===1920 to 1933===\nAfter the war, Australia took firm control of both the Ashes and world cricket. For the first time, the tactic of using two express bowlers in tandem paid off as [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]] crippled the English batting on a regular basis. Australia recorded overwhelming victories both in England and on home soil. It won the first eight matches in succession including a 5\u20130 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920-21|1920\u20131921]] at the hands of Warwick Armstrong's team.\n\nThe ruthless and belligerent Armstrong led his team back to England in 1921 where his men lost only two games late in the tour to narrowly miss out of being the first team to complete a tour of England without defeat.\n\n[[File:Herbert Sutcliffe 1924.jpg|thumb|left|[[Herbert Sutcliffe]] sweeps [[Arthur Mailey]] during the first Ashes Test in Sydney, 1924.]]\nEngland won only one Test out of 15 from the end of the war until 1925.<ref>Harte, pp. 274\u2013276.</ref><ref name=auslist>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/guru?sdb=team;team=AUS;class=testteam;filter=basic;opposition=0;notopposition=0;decade=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;season=0;startdefault=1877-03-15;start=1877-03-15;enddefault=2007-11-20;end=2007-11-20;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;followon=0;result=0;seriesresult=0;captainid=0;recent=;viewtype=resultlist;runslow=;runshigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;ballslow=;ballshigh=;overslow=;overshigh=;bpo=0;batevent=;conclow=;conchigh=;takenlow=;takenhigh=;ballsbowledlow=;ballsbowledhigh=;oversbowledlow=;oversbowledhigh=;bpobowled=0;bowlevent=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype |title=Statsguru \u2013 Australia \u2013 Tests \u2013 Results list |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |accessdate=21 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn a rain-hit series in 1926, England managed to eke out a 1\u20130 victory with a win in the final Test at The Oval. Because the series was at stake, the match was to be \"timeless\", i.e., played to a finish. Australia had a narrow first innings lead of 22. Jack Hobbs and [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] took the score to 49\u20130 at the end of the second day, a lead of 27. Heavy rain fell overnight, and next day the pitch soon developed into a traditional sticky wicket. England seemed doomed to be bowled out cheaply and to lose the match. In spite of the very difficult batting conditions, however, Hobbs and Sutcliffe took their partnership to 172 before Hobbs was out for exactly 100. Sutcliffe went on to make 161 and England won the game comfortably.<ref>Harte, pp. 298\u2013301.</ref> Australian captain [[Herbie Collins]] was stripped of all captaincy positions down to club level, and some accused him of throwing the match.\n\nAustralia's ageing post-war team broke up after 1926, with Collins, [[Charlie Macartney]] and [[Warren Bardsley]] all departing, and Gregory breaking down at the start of the 1928\u201329 series.\n\nDespite the debut of [[Donald Bradman]], the inexperienced Australians, led by [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], were heavily defeated, losing 4\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 312\u2013316.</ref> England had a very strong batting side, with [[Wally Hammond]] contributing 905 runs at an average of 113.12, and Hobbs, Sutcliffe and [[Patsy Hendren]] all scoring heavily; the bowling was more than adequate, without being outstanding.\n\nIn 1930, [[Bill Woodfull]] led an extremely inexperienced team to England.\n\nBradman fulfilled his promise in the 1930 series when he scored 974 runs at 139.14, which remains a world record Test series aggregate. A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying \"I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia.\"<ref name=\"Don Bradman on australianscreen online\">{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/spoken-word/1930-australian-xi-ashes/|title=Don Bradman in 'The 1930 Australian XI: Winners of the Ashes' on australianscreen online|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In the [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] Test, he made 334, reaching 309* at the end of the first day, including a century before lunch. Bradman himself thought that his 254 in the preceding match, at [[Lord's]], was a better innings. England managed to stay in contention until the deciding final Test at The Oval, but yet another double hundred by Bradman, and 7/92 by [[Percy Hornibrook]] in England's second innings, enabled Australia to win by an innings and take the series 2\u20131. [[Clarrie Grimmett]]'s 29 wickets at 31.89 for Australia in this high-scoring series were also important.\n\nAustralia had one of the strongest batting line-ups ever in the early 1930s, with Bradman, [[Archie Jackson]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Bill Woodfull]] and [[Bill Ponsford]]. It was the prospect of bowling at this line-up that caused England's 1932\u201333 captain [[Douglas Jardine]] to adopt the tactic of fast [[leg theory]], better known as [[Bodyline]].\n\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a ball from [[Harold Larwood]] with [[Bodyline]] field settings.]]\n\nJardine instructed his [[fast bowling|fast bowlers]], most notably [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], to bowl at the bodies of the Australian batsmen, with the goal of forcing them to defend their bodies with their bats, thus providing easy catches to a stacked [[leg side|leg-side]] field. Jardine insisted that the tactic was legitimate and called it \"leg theory\" but it was widely disparaged by its opponents, who dubbed it \"Bodyline\" (from \"on the line of the body\"). Although England decisively won the Ashes 4\u20131, Bodyline caused such a furore in Australia that diplomats had to intervene to prevent serious harm to Anglo-Australian relations, and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] eventually changed the [[Laws of cricket]] to curtail the number of leg side fielders.\n\nJardine's comment was: \"I've not travelled 6,000 miles to make friends. I'm here to win the Ashes\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Top 50 British achievements | first=Patrick | last=Kidd | date=4 September 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821160249/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/article2387560.ece | archivedate=21 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Australians wanted to use Bodyline in retaliation, but Woodfull flatly refused. He famously told England manager [[Pelham Warner]], \"There are two teams out there.

It should be borne in mind that Tests in Australia prior to the war were all played to a finish. Many batting records were set in this period.\n\nThe 1934 Ashes series began with the notable absence of Larwood, Voce and Jardine. The MCC had made it clear, in light of the revelations of the bodyline series, that these players would not face Australia. The MCC, although it had earlier condoned and encouraged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} bodyline tactics in the 1932\u201333 series, laid the blame on Larwood when relations turned sour. Larwood was forced by the MCC to either apologise or be removed from the Test side. He went for the latter.\n\nAustralia recovered the Ashes in 1934 and held them until 1953, though no Test cricket was played during the Second World War.\n\nAs in 1930, the 1934 series was decided in the final Test at The Oval. Australia, batting first, posted a massive 701 in the first innings. Bradman (244) and Ponsford (266) were in record-breaking form with a partnership of 451 for the second wicket. England eventually faced a massive 707-run target for victory and failed, Australia winning the series 2\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 356\u2013357.</ref> This made Woodfull the only captain to regain the Ashes and he retired upon his return to Australia.\n\nIn 1936\u201337 Bradman succeeded Woodfull as Australian captain. He started badly, losing the first two Tests heavily after Australia were caught on [[sticky wicket]]s. However, the Australians fought back and Bradman won his first series in charge 3\u20132.\n\nThe 1938 series was a high-scoring affair with two high-scoring draws, resulting in a 1\u20131 result, Australia retaining the Ashes. After the first two matches ended in stalemate and the Third Test at Old Trafford never started due to rain. Australia then scraped home by five wickets inside three days in a low-scoring match at Headingley to retain the urn. In the timeless Fifth Test at The Oval, the highlight was [[Len Hutton]]'s then world-record score of 364 as England made 903-7 declared. Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] injured themselves during Hutton's marathon effort, and with only nine men, Australia fell to defeat by an innings and 579 runs,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/6109836.stm Classic Ashes clashes - 1938, The Oval] at [[BBC Sport]], 5 November 2006. Accessed 4 March 2006</ref> the heaviest in Test history.\n\nThe Ashes resumed after the war when England toured in 1946\u201347 and, as in 1920\u201321, found that Australia had made the better post-war recovery. Still captained by Bradman and now featuring the potent new-ball partnership of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], Australia was convincing 3\u20130 winners.\n\nAged 38 and having been unwell during the war, Bradman had been reluctant to play. He batted unconvincingly and reached 28 when he hit a ball to [[Jack Ikin]]; England believed it was a catch, but Bradman stood his ground, believing it to be a bump ball. The umpire ruled in the Australian captain's favour and he appeared to regain his fluency of yesteryear, scoring 187. Australia promptly seized the initiative, won the First Test convincingly and inaugurated a dominant post-war era. The controversy over the Ikin catch was one of the biggest disputes of the era.\n\nIn 1948 Australia set new standards, completely outplaying its hosts to win 4\u20130 with one draw. This [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian team]], led by Bradman, who turned 40 during his final tour of England, has gone down in history as ''The Invincibles''. Playing 34 matches on tour\u2014three of which were not first-class\u2014and including the five Tests, they remained unbeaten, winning 27 and drawing 7.\n\nBradman's men were greeted by packed crowds across the country, and records for Test attendances in England were set in the [[Second Test, 1948 Ashes series|Second]] and [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fourth Tests]] at Lord's and Headingley respectively. Before a record attendance of spectators at Headingley, Australia set a world record by chasing down 404 on the last day for a seven-wicket victory.\n\nThe 1948 series ended with one of the most poignant moments in cricket history, as Bradman played his final innings for Australia in the [[Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series|Fifth Test]] at The Oval, needing to score only four runs to end with a career [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of exactly 100. However, Bradman made a second-ball duck, bowled by an [[Eric Hollies]] googly<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/8036237.stm 1948 - Bradman's final innings duck] at [[BBC Sport]], 27 May 2009. Accessed 4 March 2015</ref> that sent him into retirement with a career average of 99.94.\n\nBradman was succeeded as Australian captain by [[Lindsay Hassett]], who led the team to a 4\u20131 series victory in 1950\u201351. The series was not as one-sided as the number of wins suggest, with several tight matches.\n\nThe tide finally turned in 1953 when England won the final Test at The Oval to take the series 1\u20130, having narrowly avoided defeat in the preceding Test at Headingley. This was the beginning of one of the greatest periods in English cricket history with players such as captain Len Hutton, batsmen [[Denis Compton]], [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], [[Tom Graveney]], [[Colin Cowdrey]], bowlers [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]], [[Alec Bedser]], [[Jim Laker]], [[Tony Lock]], wicket-keeper [[Godfrey Evans]] and all-rounder [[Trevor Bailey]].\n\n===1954 to 1971===\n[[File:Peter May.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]] driving [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] on his way to a century at Sydney.]]\nIn [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954-55|1954\u201355]], Australia's batsmen had no answer to the pace of [[Frank Tyson]] and Statham. After winning the First Test by an innings after being controversially sent in by Hutton, Australia lost its way and England took a hat-trick of victories to win the series 3\u20131.<ref>Harte, pp. 435\u2013437.</ref>\n\nA dramatic series in 1956 saw a record that will probably never be beaten: off-spinner [[Jim Laker]]'s monumental effort at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] when he bowled 68 of 191 overs to take 19 out of 20 possible Australian wickets in the Fourth Test.<ref>Harte, pp. 444\u2013446.</ref> It was Australia's second consecutive innings defeat in a wet summer, and the hosts were in strong positions in the two drawn Tests, in which half the playing time was washed out. Bradman rated the team that won the series 2\u20131 as England's best ever.\n\nEngland's dominance was not to last. Australia won 4\u20130 in 1958\u201359, having found a high-quality spinner of their own in new skipper [[Richie Benaud]], who took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, and paceman [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who took 24 wickets at 19.00. The series was overshadowed by the furore over various Australian bowlers, most notably [[Ian Meckiff]], whom the English management and media accused of [[throwing (cricket)|illegally throwing]] Australia to victory.\n\nAustralia consolidated its status as the leading team in world cricket with a hard-fought 2\u20131 away series. After narrowly winning the Second Test at Lord's, dubbed \"The Battle of the Ridge\" because of a protrusion on the pitch that caused erratic bounce, Australia mounted a comeback on the final day of the Fourth Test at Old Trafford and sealed the series after a heavy collapse during the English runchase.\n\nThe tempo of the play changed over the next four series in the 1960s, held in 1962\u201363, 1964, 1965\u201366 and 1968. The powerful array of bowlers that both countries boasted in the preceding decade moved into retirement, and their replacements were of lesser quality, making it more difficult to force a result. England failed to win any series during the 1960s, a period dominated by draws as teams found it more prudent to save face than risk losing. Of the 20 Tests played during the four series, Australia won four and England three. As they held the Ashes, Australia's captains [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]] and [[Bill Lawry]] were happy to adopt safety-first tactics and their strategy of sedate batting saw many draws. During this period, spectator attendances dropped and media condemnation increased, but Simpson and Lawry flatly disregarded the public dissatisfaction.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that the bipolar dominance of England and Australia in world cricket was seriously challenged for the first time. West Indies defeated England twice in the mid-1960s and South Africa, in two series before they were banned for [[apartheid]], completely outplayed Australia 3\u20131 and 4\u20130. Australia had lost 2\u20131 during a tour of the West Indies in 1964\u201365, the first time it had lost a series to any team other than England.\n\nIn 1970\u201371, [[Ray Illingworth]] led England to a 2\u20130 win in Australia, mainly due to [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]]'s fast bowling, and the prolific batting of [[Geoffrey Boycott]] and [[John Edrich]]. It was not until the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and heard his fate over the radio.<ref>Harte, pp. 526\u2013530.</ref>\n\n===1972 to 1987===\nThe 1972 series finished 2\u20132, with England under Illingworth retaining the Ashes.<ref>Harte, pp. 538\u2013540.</ref>\n\nIn the 1974\u201375 series, with the England team breaking up and their best batsman Geoff Boycott refusing to play, Australian pace bowlers [[Jeff Thomson]] and [[Dennis Lillee]] wreaked havoc. A 4\u20131 result was a fair reflection as England were left shell shocked.<ref>Harte, pp. 557\u2013559.</ref> England then lost the 1975 series 0\u20131, but at least restored some pride under new captain [[Tony Greig]].<ref>Harte, pp. 561\u2013563.</ref>\n\nAustralia won the 1977 Centenary Test<ref>Harte, pp. 580\u2013581.</ref> which was not an Ashes contest, but then a storm broke as [[Kerry Packer]] announced his intention to form [[World Series Cricket]].<ref>Harte, pp. 579\u2013590</ref> WSC affected all Test-playing nations but it weakened Australia especially as the bulk of its players had signed up with Packer; the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) would not select WSC-contracted players and an almost completely new Test team had to be formed. WSC came after an era during which the duopoly of Australian and English dominance dissipated; the Ashes had long been seen as a cricket world championship but the rise of the West Indies in the late 1970s challenged that view. The West Indies would go on to record resounding Test series wins over Australia and England and dominated world cricket until the 1990s.\n\nWith Greig having joined WSC, England appointed [[Mike Brearley]] as its captain and he enjoyed great success against Australia. Largely assisted by the return of Boycott, Brearley's men won the 1977 series 3\u20130 and then completed an overwhelming 5\u20131 series win against an Australian side missing its WSC players in 1978\u201379. [[Allan Border]] made his Test debut for Australia in 1978\u201379.\n\nBrearley retired from Test cricket in 1979 and was succeeded by [[Ian Botham]], who started the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1981|1981 series]] as England captain, by which time the WSC split had ended. After Australia took a 1\u20130 lead in the first two Tests, Botham was forced to resign or was sacked (depending on the source). Brearley surprisingly agreed to be reappointed before the Third Test at Headingley. This was a remarkable match in which Australia looked certain to take a 2\u20130 series lead after it had forced England to follow-on 227 runs behind. England, despite being 135 for 7, produced a second innings total of 356, Botham scoring 149*. Chasing just 130, Australia were sensationally dismissed for 111, [[Bob Willis]] taking 8\u201343. It was the first time since 1894\u201395 that a team following on had won a Test match. Under Brearley's leadership, England went on to win the next two matches before a drawn final match at The Oval.<ref>Harte, pp. 627\u2013628.</ref>\n\nIn 1982\u201383 Australia had [[Greg Chappell]] back from WSC as captain, while the England team was weakened by the enforced omission of their [[South African rebel tours|South African tour rebels]], particularly [[Graham Gooch]] and [[John Emburey]]. Australia went 2\u20130 up after three Tests, but England won the Fourth Test by 3 runs (after a 70-run last wicket stand) to set up the final decider, which was drawn.<ref>Harte, pp. 636\u2013637.</ref>\n\nIn 1985 [[David Gower]]'s England team was strengthened by the return of Gooch and Emburey as well as the emergence at international level of [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]] and [[Mike Gatting]]. Australia, now captained by [[Allan Border]], had itself been weakened by a rebel South African tour, the loss of [[Terry Alderman]] being a particular factor. England won 3\u20131.\n\nDespite suffering heavy defeats against the West Indies during the 1980s, England continued to do well in the Ashes.

After re-establishing its credibility in 1989, Australia underlined its superiority with victories in the 1990\u201391, 1993, 1994\u201395, 1997, 1998\u201399, 2001 and 2002\u201303 series, all by convincing margins.\n\nGreat Australian players in the early years included batsmen Border, Boon, Taylor and Steve Waugh. The captaincy passed from Border to Taylor in the mid-1990s and then to Steve Waugh before the 2001 series. In the latter part of the 1990s Waugh himself, along with his twin brother [[Mark Waugh|Mark]], scored heavily for Australia and fast bowlers [[Glenn McGrath]] and [[Jason Gillespie]] made a serious impact, especially the former. The wicketkeeper-batsman position was held by [[Ian Healy]] for most of the 1990s and by [[Adam Gilchrist]] from 2001 to 2006\u201307. In the 2000s, batsmen [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] became noted players for Australia. But the most dominant Australian player was leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]], whose first delivery in Ashes cricket in 1993, to dismiss Mike Gatting, became known as the [[Ball of the Century]].\n\nAustralia's record between 1989 and 2005 had a significant impact on the statistics between the two sides. Before the 1989 series began, the win-loss ratio was almost even, with 87 test wins for Australia to England's 86, 74 tests having been drawn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+1989;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> By the 2005 series Australia's test wins had increased to 115 whereas England's had increased to only 93 (with 82 draws).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;opposition=1;orderby=won;spanmax2=1+Apr+2005;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;trophy=1;type=team |title=Team records &#124; Test matches &#124; Cricinfo Statsguru &#124; ESPN Cricinfo |publisher=Stats.cricinfo.com |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> In the period between 1989 and the beginning of the 2005 series, the two sides had played 43 times; Australia winning 28 times, England 7 times, with 8 draws.

The rain-affected Third Test ended with the last two Australian batsmen holding out for a draw; and England won the Fourth Test by three wickets after forcing Australia to [[follow-on]] for the first time in 191 Tests being a period of 17 years. A draw in the final Test gave England victory in an Ashes series for the first time in 18 years and their first Ashes victory at home since 1985.\n\nAustralia regained the Ashes on its home turf in the [[2006-07 Ashes series|2006\u201307 series]] with a convincing 5\u20130 victory, only the second time an Ashes series has been won by that margin.

England then achieved its first Ashes win at Lord's since 1934 to go 1\u20130 up. After a rain-affected draw at Edgbaston, the fourth match at Headingley was convincingly won by Australia by an innings and 80 runs to level the series. Finally, England won the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]] by a margin of 197 runs to regain the Ashes. [[Andrew Flintoff]] retired from Test cricket soon afterwards.\n\nThe [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 series]] was played in Australia. The First Test at Brisbane ended in a draw, but England won the Second Test, at Adelaide, by an innings and 71 runs. Australia came back with a victory at Perth in the Third Test. In the Fourth Test at Melbourne Cricket Ground, England batting second scored 513 to defeat Australia (98 and 258) by an innings and 157 runs. This gave England an unbeatable 2\u20131 lead in the series and so it retained the Ashes. England went on to win the series 3\u20131, beating Australia by an innings and 83 runs at Sydney in the Fifth Test. Australia, captained by Michael Clarke, batted first on a cloudy day after winning the toss and were bowled out for 280. England made 644, their highest innings total since 1938. England then bowled Australia out again for 281. England's series victory was its first on Australian soil for 24 years. The 2010\u201311 Ashes series was the only one in which a team had won three Tests by innings margins and it was the first time England had scored 500 or more four times in a single series.\n\nAustralia's build-up to the [[2013 Ashes series]] was far from ideal.

In the face of high-class swing bowling from [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]], who ended with 10 wickets in the match, Australia collapsed to 117\u20139. However, debutant 19-year-old [[Ashton Agar]] made a world-record 98 for a number 11 and [[Phillip Hughes|Phil Hughes]] an unbeaten 81 to secure an unlikely lead of 65. England's second-innings total of 375 set Australia a target of 311, against which it fell short by only 14 runs in a tense finish. In the Second Test, England beat Australia by 347 runs in a very one-sided contest. In the Third Test, held at a newly refurbished Old Trafford, Australia won the toss and elected to bat first. It amassed a commanding score of 527\u20137, led by captain Michael Clarke's 187. The pressure was then on the home side to avoid the follow-on. England scored 368 with a century for Kevin Pietersen. Australia's second innings score was 172\u20137 at the end of Day 4, characterised by batting order changes to achieve a fast run rate to allow enough time to bowl England out amid inclement weather forecasts. Australia declared overnight to post England a target of 332 to win. Contrary to expectations, play resumed with only a minor delay on Day 5, and with captain Alastair Cook being bowled out for 0 (his first duck in 26 innings as captain), Australia looked to be in with a significant chance of a win, keeping its series hopes alive. By lunch England were 37\u20133, but on resumption of play only 3 balls were bowled before rain stopped play. This rain persisted and, at 16:40, the captains shook hands and the match was declared a draw.

In the second innings England scored 330, Ian Bell top-scoring with 113. Needing only 298 runs to win Australia was in a strong position at 138/2, only 160 short with eight wickets in hand. Following a rain delay, Australia crashed to a 74-run defeat, losing all eight wickets for only 86 runs. England had taken 9 wickets in the final session of the fourth day. Stuart Broad was England's top wicket-taker in the match with 11 wickets. England held a 3\u20130 lead going into the final Fifth Test at The Oval.\n\nThe final Test was drawn. On the fourth day no play was possible due to rain, but on the final day after an aggressive Australian declaration, England came close to achieving its first 4\u20130 victory in an Ashes series.

Although England won the first Test in Cardiff, Australia won comfortably in the second Test at Lords. In the next two Tests, the Australian batsmen struggled, being bowled out for 136 in the first innings at [[Edgbaston]] , with England proceeding to win by eight wickets. This was followed by Australia being bowled out for 60 as [[Stuart Broad]] took fastest five wickets{{clarify|date=May 2017}} and finished the spell with 8 for 15 in the first innings at Trent Bridge, the quickest - in terms of balls faced - a team has been bowled out in the first innings of a Test match.

Despite losing Alistair Cook early they thrived on the unusually slow pitch and were well placed before Patrick Cummins removed opener Mark Stoneman and Nathan Lyon abruptly ended James Vince's innings with a brilliant run out. England eventually went on to make 302. Australia, however, started terribly, with debutant Bancroft, Khawaja, Warner and Handscomb all falling early. A partnership between Steve Smith and Shaun Marsh ensured Australia wouldn't be blown away, before Smith then paired with Patrick Cummins to see Australia pass England's score. Facing a first-innings deficit, England again lost Alistair Cook early, but Joe Root was able to steady the ship. After he was removed by Josh Hazlewood, little resistance was provided, and the Aussies only required 170 to win from tea on day four.

A drawn series results in the previous holders retaining the Ashes. Ashes series have generally been played over five Test matches, although there have been four-match series (1938; 1975) and six-match series (1970\u201371; 1974\u201375; 1978\u201379; 1981; 1985; 1989; 1993 and 1997). Australians have made 264 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] in Ashes Tests, of which 23 have been scores over 200, while Englishmen have scored 212 centuries, of which 10 have been over 200. Australians have taken 10 [[dismissal (cricket)|wickets]] in a match on 41 occasions, Englishmen 38 times.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n==Match venues==\nThe series alternates between the United Kingdom and Australia, and within each country each of the usually five matches is held at different grounds.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the grounds currently used are [[the Gabba]] in Brisbane (first staged an England\u2013Australia Test in the 1932\u201333 season), [[Adelaide Oval]] (1884\u201385), the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) (1876\u201377), and the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] (SCG) (1881\u201382). A single Test was held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] in 1928\u201329. Traditionally, Melbourne hosts the [[Boxing Day Test]] and Sydney hosts the New Year Test. Additionally [[WACA Ground|the WACA]] in Perth (1970\u201371) hosted its [[2017\u201318 Ashes series#3rd Test|final Ashes Test]] in 2017\u201318 and is due to be replaced by [[Perth Stadium]] for the [[2021\u201322 Ashes series|2021\u201322 series]]. \n\nCricket Australia proposed that the 2010\u201311 series consist of six Tests, with the additional game to be played at [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart. The England and Wales Cricket Board declined and the series was played over five Tests.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]], the grounds used are: [[County Ground, Old Trafford|Old Trafford]] in Manchester (1884), [[The Oval]] in [[Kennington]], [[South London]] (1884); [[Lord's]] in [[St John's Wood]], [[North London]] (1884); [[Trent Bridge]] at [[West Bridgford]], Nottinghamshire (1899), [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] (1899); [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] in [[Birmingham]] (1902); [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] (2009); and the [[Riverside Ground]] in [[Chester-le-Street]], County Durham (2013). One Test was also held at [[Bramall Lane]] in [[Sheffield]] in 1902. Traditionally the final Test of the series is played at the Oval. Sophia Gardens and the Riverside were excluded as Test grounds between the years of 2020 and 2024 and therefore will not host an Ashes Test until at least 2027. Trent Bridge is also not due to host an Ashes Test in 2019 or 2023.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:The Ashes Urn Replica (2016).jpg|150px|thumb|right|A modern-day replica of [[The Ashes urn|the Ashes Urn]]]]\n\nThe popularity and reputation of the cricket series has led to other sports or games, and/or their followers, using the name \"Ashes\" for contests between England and Australia. The best-known and longest-running of these events is the [[rugby league]] rivalry between [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] (see [[The Ashes (rugby league)|rugby league \"Ashes\"]]). Use of the name \"Ashes\" was suggested by the Australian team when rugby league matches between the two countries commenced in 1908.

The focus can be as diverse as the analysis of [[analysis (Homer)|Homer]] or [[psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freud]]. While not all literary-critical methods are primarily analytical in nature, the main approach to the teaching of literature in the west since the mid-twentieth century, literary formal analysis or close reading, is. This method, rooted in the academic movement labelled [[The New Criticism]], approaches texts \u2013 chiefly short poems such as [[sonnets]], which by virtue of their small size and significant complexity lend themselves well to this type of analysis \u2013 as units of discourse that can be understood in themselves, without reference to biographical or historical frameworks. This method of analysis breaks up the text linguistically in a study of [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] (the formal analysis of meter) and phonic effects such as [[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]], and cognitively in examination of the interplay of syntactic structures, figurative language, and other elements of the poem that work to produce its larger effects.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Mathematical analysis}}\n\nModern mathematical analysis is the study of infinite processes. It is the branch of mathematics that includes calculus.  It can be applied in the study of [[classical mathematics|classical]] concepts of mathematics, such as [[real analysis|real numbers]], [[complex analysis|complex variables]], [[Fourier analysis|trigonometric functions]], and [[numerical analysis|algorithms]], or of [[non-classical analysis|non-classical]] concepts like [[constructivist analysis|constructivism]], [[harmonic analysis|harmonics]], [[non-standard analysis|infinity]], and [[functional analysis|vectors]].\n\n[[Florian Cajori]] explains in [[wikiquote:A History of Mathematics|''A History of Mathematics'']] (1893) the difference between modern and ancient mathematical analysis, as distinct from logical analysis, as follows:\n<blockquote>\nThe terms ''synthesis'' and ''analysis'' are used in mathematics in a more special sense than in logic. In ancient mathematics they had a different meaning from what they now have. The oldest definition of mathematical analysis as opposed to synthesis is that given in  [appended to] [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]], XIII. 5, which in all probability was framed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]]: \"Analysis is the obtaining of the thing sought by assuming it and so reasoning up to an admitted truth; synthesis is the obtaining of the thing sought by reasoning up to the inference and proof of it.\" \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe analytic method is not conclusive, unless all operations involved in it are known to be reversible. To remove all doubt, the Greeks, as a rule, added to the analytic process a synthetic one, consisting of a reversion of all operations occurring in the analysis. Thus the aim of analysis was to aid in the discovery of synthetic proofs or solutions.\n</blockquote>\n\nJames Gow uses a similar argument as Cajori, with the following clarification, in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC& ''A Short History of Greek Mathematics''] (1884):\n\n<blockquote>\nThe synthetic proof proceeds by shewing that the proposed new truth involves certain admitted truths. An analytic proof begins by an assumption, upon which a synthetic reasoning is founded. The Greeks distinguished ''theoretic'' from ''problematic'' analysis. A theoretic analysis is of the following kind. To ''prove'' that A is B, ''assume'' first that A is B. If so, then, since B is C and C is D and D is E, therefore A is E. If this be known a falsity, A is not B. But if this be a known truth and all the intermediate propositions be [[wiktionary:convertible#Adjective|convertible]], then the reverse process, A is E, E is D, D is C, C is B, therefore A is B, constitutes a synthetic proof of the original theorem. Problematic analysis is applied in all cases where it is proposed to construct a figure which is assumed to satisfy a given condition. The problem is then converted into some theorem which is involved in the condition and which is proved synthetically, and the steps of this synthetic proof taken backwards are a synthetic solution of the problem.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Music===\n* [[Musical analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a process attempting to answer the question \"How does this music work?\"\n* [[Schenkerian analysis]]\n\n===Philosophy===\n* [[Philosophical analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a general term for the techniques used by philosophers\n* ''[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]'' is the name of a prominent journal in philosophy.\n\n===Psychotherapy===\n* [[Psychoanalysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 seeks to elucidate connections among unconscious components of patients' mental processes\n* [[Transactional analysis]]\n\n===Public Policy===\n* [[Policy Analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 The use of statistical data to predict the effects of policy decisions made by governments and agencies\n* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative Analysis]]\u2013 The use of anecdotal evidence to predict the effects of policy decisions or, more generally, influence policy decisions\n\n===Signal processing===\n* [[Finite element analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a computer simulation technique used in engineering analysis\n* [[Independent component analysis]]\n* [[Link quality analysis]]&nbsp;\u2013 the analysis of signal quality\n* [[Path quality analysis]]\n* [[Fourier analysis]]\n\n===Statistics===\nIn [[statistics]], the term ''analysis'' may refer to any method used\nfor [[data analysis]].

When his corps commander, Major General [[John F. Reynolds]], was killed very early in the fighting, Doubleday found himself in command of the corps at 10:50 am. His men fought well in the morning, putting up a stout resistance, but as overwhelming Confederate forces massed against them, their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] to the relative safety of [[Cemetery Hill]] south of town. It was Doubleday's finest performance during the war, five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000. Seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent, indicating the ferocity of the Union defense. On Cemetery Hill, however, the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty, and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle; it would be decommissioned in March 1864, its surviving units consolidated into other corps.<ref name=Tagg/>\n\nOn July 2, 1863, Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] replaced Doubleday with Major General [[John Newton (engineer)|John Newton]], a more junior officer from another corps. The ostensible reason was a false report by [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]] commander Major General [[Oliver O. Howard]] that Doubleday's corps broke first, causing the entire Union line to collapse, but Meade also had a long history of disdain for Doubleday's combat effectiveness, dating back to South Mountain. Doubleday was humiliated by this snub and held a lasting grudge against Meade, but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle.<ref name=Tagg/> He was wounded in the neck on the second day of Gettysburg and received a brevet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service.<ref name=Eicher/> He formally requested reinstatement as I Corps commander, but Meade refused, and Doubleday left Gettysburg on July 7 for Washington.<ref>Coddington, pp. 690-91.</ref>\n\nDoubleday's indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his uncomplimentary nickname \"Forty-Eight Hours.\"<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n===Washington===\nDoubleday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of Washington, D.C., where he was in charge of courts martial, which gave him legal experience that he used after the war. His only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jubal A. Early]] in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Also while in Washington, Doubleday testified against George Meade at the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the Battle of Gettysburg.<ref name=Beckenbaugh/> While in Washington, Doubleday remained a loyal [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and staunch supporter of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Doubleday rode with Lincoln on the train to Gettysburg for the [[Gettysburg Address]] and Col. and Mrs. Doubleday attended events with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in Washington.\n\n==Postbellum career==\nAfter the Civil War, Doubleday mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and became the colonel of the 35th U.S. Infantry in September 1867. He was stationed in San Francisco from 1869 through 1871 and he took out a patent for the [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] railway that still runs there, receiving a charter for its operation, but signing away his rights when he was reassigned. In 1871 he commanded the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th U.S. Infantry]], an all African-American regiment with headquarters at [[Fort McKavett]], [[Texas]].<ref name=TX/> He retired in 1873\n\nIn the 1870s, he was listed in the New York business directory as lawyer.\n\nDoubleday spent much of his time writing. He published two important works on the Civil War: ''Reminiscences of Forts Sumter and Moultrie'' (1876), and ''Chancellorsville and Gettysburg'' (1882), the latter being a volume of the series ''Campaigns of the Civil War''.<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n==Theosophy==\nIn the summer of 1878, Doubleday lived in [[Mendham Township, New Jersey]], and became a prominent member of the [[Theosophical Society]]. When two of the founders of that society, [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], moved to India at the end of that year, he was constituted as the president of the American body. Another prominent member was [[Thomas A. Edison]].<ref>Gomes, [http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sunrise/40-90-1/th-tsgom.htm Theosophy article]</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Abner Doubleday (18988417840).jpg|thumb|right|Doubleday's tombstone in Arlington National Cemetery]]\nDoubleday died of heart disease in 1893. Doubleday's body was laid in state in New York's City Hall and then was taken to Washington by train<ref name=Tagg/> from Mendham Township, and is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n==Baseball==\n{{Main article|Doubleday myth}}\n\nAlthough Doubleday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles, he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball, in [[Elihu Phinney]]'s cow pasture in [[Cooperstown, New York]], in 1839.\n\nThe [[Mills Commission]], chaired by [[Abraham G. Mills]], the fourth president of the [[National League]], was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball. The committee's final report, on December 30, 1907, stated, in part, that \"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence obtainable to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, New York, in 1839.\" It concluded by saying, \"in the years to come, in the view of the hundreds of thousands of people who are devoted to baseball, and the millions who will be, Abner Doubleday's fame will rest evenly, if not quite as much, upon the fact that he was its inventor ... as upon his brilliant and distinguished career as an officer in the Federal Army.\"<ref>Kirsch, pp. xiii.</ref>\n\nHowever, there is considerable evidence to dispute this claim. Baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a \"myth\". He wrote, \"Robert Henderson, Harold Seymour, and other scholars have since debunked the Doubleday-Cooperstown myth, which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Baseball and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\" At his death, Doubleday left many letters and papers, none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game, and his ''New York Times'' obituary did not mention the game at all. Chairman Mills himself, who had been a Civil War colleague of Doubleday and a member of the honor guard for Doubleday's body as it lay in state in New York City, never recalled hearing Doubleday describe his role as the inventor. Doubleday was a cadet at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooperstown the prior year. Furthermore, the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Doubleday was that of Abner Graves, whose credibility is questionable; a few years later, he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life.<ref name=Kirschxiiixiv/> Part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooperstown in 1839.<ref>Morris, Peter. ''But Didn't We Have Fun''. Ivan R. Dee Publishing. 2008</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of solid evidence linking Doubleday to the origins of baseball, Cooperstown, New York, became the new home of what is today the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 1937.\n\nThere may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and Abner Doubleday.  While the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 1840s, it was the scattering of New Yorkers exposed to these rules throughout the country, that spread not only baseball, but also the \"New York Rules\", thereby harmonizing the rules, and being a catalyst for its growth.  Doubleday was a high-ranking officer, whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states.  For the morale of the men, he is said to have provisioned balls and bats for the men.<ref>Bats, Balls, and Bullets Essay by George B.

In amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] (signal strength) of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to that of the message signal being transmitted.  The message signal is, for example, a function of the sound to be reproduced by a [[loudspeaker]], or the light intensity of pixels of a television screen.  This technique contrasts with [[frequency modulation]], in which the [[frequency]] of the [[carrier signal]] is varied, and [[phase modulation]], in which its [[Phase (waves)|phase]] is varied.\n\nAM was the earliest modulation method used to transmit voice by radio. It was developed during the first quarter of the 20th century beginning with [[Landell de Moura]] and [[Reginald Fessenden]]'s [[radiotelephone]] experiments in 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aminharadio.com/radio/files/Artigo-Revista-PCP-USA.pdf|format=PDF|title=Father Landell de Moura : Radio Broadcasting Pioneer : FABIO S.

''AM'' is often used to refer to [[mediumwave]] [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]].\n\n[[File:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|right|250px|Fig 1: An audio signal (top) may be carried by a [[carrier signal]] using AM or FM methods.|alt=Animation of audio, AM and FM modulated carriers.]]\n\n==Forms==\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}\nIn [[electronics]] and [[telecommunication]]s, [[modulation]] means varying some aspect of a [[continuous wave]] [[carrier signal]] with an information-bearing modulation waveform, such as an [[audio signal]] which represents sound, or a [[video signal]] which represents images. In this sense, the carrier wave, which has a much higher frequency than the message signal, ''carries'' the information.  At the receiving station, the message signal is extracted from the modulated carrier by [[demodulation]].\n\nIn amplitude modulation, the [[amplitude]] or ''strength'' of the carrier oscillations is varied. For example, in AM radio communication, a [[continuous wave]] radio-frequency signal (a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[carrier wave]]) has its amplitude modulated by an audio waveform before transmission. The audio waveform modifies the amplitude of the carrier wave and determines the ''[[Envelope (waves)|envelope]]'' of the waveform. In the [[frequency domain]], amplitude modulation produces a signal with power concentrated at the [[carrier frequency]] and two adjacent [[sideband]]s. Each sideband is equal in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] to that of the modulating signal, and is a mirror image of the other. Standard AM is thus sometimes called \"double-sideband amplitude modulation\" (DSB-AM) to distinguish it from more sophisticated modulation methods also based on AM.\n\nOne disadvantage of all amplitude modulation techniques (not only standard AM) is that the receiver amplifies and detects [[Noise (radio)|noise]] and [[electromagnetic interference]] in equal proportion to the signal. Increasing the received [[signal-to-noise ratio]], say, by a factor of 10 (a 10 [[decibel]] improvement), thus would require increasing the transmitter power by a factor of 10. This is in contrast to [[frequency modulation]] (FM) and [[digital radio]] where the effect of such noise following [[demodulation]] is strongly reduced so long as the received signal is well above the threshold for reception. For this reason AM broadcast is not favored for music and [[high fidelity]] broadcasting, but rather for voice communications and broadcasts (sports, news, [[talk radio]] etc.).\n\nAnother disadvantage of AM is that it is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal.  The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]], providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the [[intermediate frequency]]) from a greatly reduced \"pilot\" carrier (in [[reduced-carrier transmission]] or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]], carrier regeneration is possible using a [[Costas loop|Costas phase-locked loop]]. This doesn't work however for [[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic \"Donald Duck\" sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. Single sideband is nevertheless used widely in [[amateur radio]] and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]] broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.\n\nAn additional function provided by the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the [[automatic gain control]] (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is ''no'' transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called ''fast attack, slow decay'' circuit which holds the AGC level for a second or more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where [[Dynamic range compression|compression]] of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.\n\nA trivial form of AM which can be used for transmitting [[Digital data|binary data]] is [[on-off keying]], the simplest form of ''[[amplitude-shift keying]]'', in which [[Binary numeral system|ones and zeros]] are represented by the presence or absence of a carrier. On-off keying is likewise used by radio amateurs to transmit [[Morse code]] where it is known as [[continuous wave]] (CW) operation, even though the transmission is not strictly \"continuous.\"  A more complex form of AM, [[QAM|quadrature amplitude modulation]] is now more commonly used with digital data, while making more efficient use of the available bandwidth.\n\n===ITU designations===\n\nIn 1982, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) designated the types of amplitude modulation:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Designation!!Description\n|-\n|A3E||[[double sideband|double-sideband]] a full-carrier - the basic amplitude modulation scheme\n|-\n|R3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] [[Reduced-carrier transmission|reduced-carrier]]\n|-\n|H3E||[[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] full-carrier\n|-\n|J3E||[[Single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|single-sideband suppressed-carrier]]\n|-\n|B8E||[[independent sideband|independent-sideband]] emission\n|-\n|C3F||[[vestigal sideband|vestigial-sideband]]\n|-\n|Lincompex||linked [[compander|compressor and expander]] (a submode of any of the above ITU Emission Modes)\n|}<!--single mid band linked modulation\n[B4E side bander inter linked] [expand carrier] full reduced.aLTIDOE-->\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Telefunken arc radiotelephone.jpg|thumb|One of the crude pre-vacuum tube AM transmitters, a Telefunken [[arc converter|arc transmitter]] from 1906.

They couldn't transmit audio because the carrier consisted of strings of [[damped wave]]s, pulses of radio waves that declined to zero, that sounded like a buzz in receivers.  In effect they were already amplitude modulated.\n\n===Continuous waves===\nThe first AM transmission was made by Canadian researcher [[Reginald Fessenden]] on 23 December 1900 using a [[spark gap transmitter]] with a specially designed high frequency 10&nbsp;kHz [[induction coil|interrupter]], over a distance of 1 mile (1.6&nbsp;km) at Cobb Island, Maryland, USA. His first transmitted words were, \"Hello. One, two, three, four. Is it snowing where you are, Mr. Thiessen?\". The words were barely intelligible above the background buzz of the spark.\n\nFessenden was a significant figure in the development of AM radio. He was one of the first researchers to realize, from experiments like the above, that the existing technology for producing radio waves, the spark transmitter, was not usable for amplitude modulation, and that a new kind of transmitter, one that produced [[sinusoidal]] ''[[continuous wave]]s'', was needed.  This was a radical idea at the time, because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed. He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the [[Alexanderson alternator]], with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906.  He also discovered the principle on which AM is based, [[heterodyne|heterodyning]], and invented one of the first [[detector (radio)|detector]]s able to [[rectifier|rectify]] and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or \"liquid baretter\", in 1902.  Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the [[Fleming valve]] (1904) and the [[crystal detector]] (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.\n\n===Early technologies===\nEarly experiments in AM radio transmission, conducted by Fessenden, Valdemar Poulsen, Ernst Ruhmer, [[Quirino Majorana]], Charles Harrold, and [[Lee De Forest]], were hampered by the lack of a technology for [[amplifier|amplification]].  The first practical continuous wave AM [[transmitter]]s were based on either the huge, expensive [[Alexanderson alternator]], developed 1906-1910, or versions of the [[Poulsen arc]] transmitter (arc converter), invented in 1903.  The modifications necessary to transmit AM were clumsy and resulted in very low quality audio.  Modulation was usually accomplished by a carbon [[microphone]] inserted directly in the antenna or ground wire; its varying resistance varied the current to the antenna.  The limited power handling ability of the microphone severely limited the power of the first radiotelephones; many of the microphones were water-cooled.\n\n===Vacuum tubes===\nThe discovery in 1912 of the amplifying ability of the [[Audion]] [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1906 by [[Lee De Forest]], solved these problems.  The vacuum tube [[electronic oscillator|feedback oscillator]], invented in 1912 by [[Edwin Armstrong]] and [[Alexander Meissner]], was a cheap source of [[continuous wave]]s and could be easily [[modulation|modulated]] to make an AM transmitter.  Modulation did not have to be done at the output but could be applied to the signal before the final amplifier tube, so the microphone or other audio source didn't have to handle high power.  Wartime research greatly advanced the art of AM modulation, and after the war the availability of cheap tubes sparked a great increase in the number of radio stations experimenting with AM transmission of news or music. The vacuum tube was responsible for the rise of [[AM broadcasting|AM radio broadcasting]] around 1920, the first electronic [[mass communication|mass entertainment]] medium.  Amplitude modulation was virtually the only type used for [[radio broadcasting]] until [[FM broadcasting]] began after World War 2.\n\nAt the same time as AM radio began, [[telephone company|telephone companies]] such as [[AT&T]] were developing the other large application for AM: sending multiple telephone calls through a single wire by modulating them on separate [[carrier signal|carrier]] frequencies, called ''[[frequency division multiplexing]]''.<ref name=\"Bray\" />\n\n===Single-sideband===\nJohn Renshaw Carson in 1915 did the first mathematical analysis of amplitude modulation, showing that a signal and carrier frequency combined in a nonlinear device would create two sidebands on either side of the carrier frequency, and passing the modulated signal through another nonlinear device would extract the original baseband signal.<ref name=\"Bray\" /> His analysis also showed only one sideband was necessary to transmit the audio signal, and Carson patented [[single-sideband modulation]] (SSB) on 1 December 1915.<ref name=\"Bray\" /> This more advanced variant of amplitude modulation was adopted by AT&T for [[longwave]] transatlantic telephone service beginning 7 January 1927. After WW2 it was developed by the military for aircraft communication.\n\n==Simplified analysis of standard AM==\n[[File:Illustration of Amplitude Modulation.png|thumb|391x391px|Illustration of amplitude modulation]]\nConsider a carrier wave ([[sine wave]]) of frequency ''f<sub>c</sub>'' and amplitude ''A'' given by:\n\n:<math>c(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f_c t)\\,</math>.\n\nLet ''m''(''t'') represent the modulation waveform. For this example we shall take the modulation to be simply a sine wave of a frequency ''f<sub>m</sub>'', a much lower frequency (such as an audio frequency) than ''f<sub>c</sub>'':\n\n:<math>m(t) = M \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_m t + \\phi\\right)= Am \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_m t + \\phi\\right)\\,</math>,\n\nwhere ''m'' is the amplitude sensitivity, ''M'' is the amplitude of modulation. If ''m'' < 1, ''(1 + m(t)/A)'' is always positive for undermodulation. If ''m'' > 1 then overmodulation occurs and reconstruction of message signal from the transmitted signal would lead in loss of original signal. Amplitude modulation results when the carrier ''c(t)'' is multiplied by the positive quantity  ''(1 + m(t)/A)'':\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  y(t) &= \\left[1 + \\frac{m(t)}{A}\\right] c(t) \\\\\n       &= \\left[1 + m \\cos\\left(2\\pi f_m t + \\phi\\right)\\right] A \\sin\\left(2\\pi f_c t\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this simple case ''m'' is identical to the [[#Modulation index|modulation index]], discussed below. With ''m'' = 0.5 the amplitude modulated signal ''y''(''t'') thus corresponds to the top graph (labelled \"50% Modulation\") in figure 4.\n\nUsing [[prosthaphaeresis#The identities|prosthaphaeresis identities]], ''y''(''t'') can be shown to be the sum of three sine waves:\n\n:<math>y(t) = A \\sin(2\\pi f_c t) + \\frac{1}{2}Am \\left[\\sin\\left(2\\pi \\left[f_c + f_m\\right] t + \\phi\\right) + \\sin\\left(2\\pi \\left[f_c - f_m\\right] t - \\phi\\right)\\right].\\,</math>\n\nTherefore, the modulated signal has three components: the carrier wave ''c(t)'' which is unchanged, and two pure sine waves (known as [[sideband]]s) with frequencies slightly above and below the carrier frequency ''f<sub>c</sub>''.\n\n==Spectrum==\n[[File:AM spectrum.svg|thumb|400px|Fig 2: Double-sided spectra of baseband and AM signals.|alt=Diagrams of an AM signal, with formulas]]\nOf course a useful modulation signal ''m(t)'' will generally not consist of a single sine wave, as treated above. However, by the principle of [[Fourier decomposition]], ''m(t)'' can be expressed as the sum of a number of sine waves of various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. Carrying out the multiplication of  ''1 + m(t)'' with ''c(t)'' as above then yields a result consisting of a sum of sine waves. Again the carrier ''c(t)'' is present unchanged, but for each frequency component of ''m'' at ''f<sub>i</sub>'' there are two sidebands at frequencies ''f<sub>c</sub> + f<sub>i</sub>'' and  ''f<sub>c</sub> - f<sub>i</sub>''. The collection of the former frequencies above the carrier frequency is known as the upper sideband, and those below constitute the lower sideband. In a slightly different way of looking at it, we can consider the modulation ''m(t)'' to consist of an equal mix of positive and negative frequency components (as results from a formal [[Fourier transform]] of a real valued quantity) as shown in the top of Fig. 2. Then one can view the sidebands as that modulation ''m(t)'' having simply been shifted in frequency by ''f<sub>c</sub>'' as depicted at the bottom right of Fig. 2 (formally, the modulated signal also contains identical components at negative frequencies, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 2 for completeness).\n\n[[File:AM signal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Fig 3: The [[spectrogram]] of an AM voice broadcast shows the two sidebands (green) on either side of the carrier (red) with time proceeding in the vertical direction.|alt=Sonogram of an AM signal, showing the carrier and both sidebands vertically]]\nIf we just look at the short-term spectrum of modulation, changing as it would for a human voice for instance, then we can plot the frequency content (horizontal axis) as a function of time (vertical axis) as in Fig. 3. It can again be seen that as the modulation frequency content varies, at any point in time there is an upper sideband generated according to those frequencies shifted ''above'' the carrier frequency, and the same content mirror-imaged in the lower sideband below the carrier frequency. At all times, the carrier itself remains constant, and of greater power than the total sideband power.\n\n==Power and spectrum efficiency==\nThe RF bandwidth of an AM transmission (refer to Figure 2, but only considering positive frequencies) is twice the bandwidth of the modulating (or \"[[baseband]]\") signal, since the upper and lower sidebands around the carrier frequency each have a bandwidth as wide as the highest modulating frequency. Although the bandwidth of an AM signal is narrower than one using [[frequency modulation]] (FM), it is twice as wide as [[single-sideband]] techniques; it thus may be viewed as spectrally inefficient. Within a frequency band, only half as many transmissions (or \"channels\") can thus be accommodated. For this reason analog television employs a variant of single-sideband (known as [[vestigial sideband]], somewhat of a compromise in terms of bandwidth) in order to reduce the required channel spacing.\n\nAnother improvement over standard AM is obtained through reduction or suppression of the carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus there is a great advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband ([[single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]]) or with both sidebands remaining ([[double sideband suppressed carrier]]). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing [[Product detector|synchronous detection]] and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using [[envelope detector|envelope detection]]. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.\n\nA technique used widely in broadcast AM transmitters is an application of the Hapburg carrier, first proposed in the 1930s but impractical with the technology then available. During periods of low modulation the carrier power would be [[Dynamic carrier control|reduced]] and would return to full power during periods of high modulation levels. This has the effect of reducing the overall power demand of the transmitter and is most effective on speech type programmes. Various trade names are used for its implementation by the transmitter manufacturers from the late 80's onwards.\n\n==Modulation index==\nThe AM modulation index is a measure based on the ratio of the modulation excursions of the RF signal to the level of the unmodulated carrier. It is thus defined as:\n:<math>m = \\frac{\\mathrm{peak\\ value\\ of\\ } m(t)}{A} = \\frac{M}{A}  </math>\n\nwhere <math>M\\,</math> and <math>A\\,</math> are the modulation amplitude and carrier amplitude, respectively; the modulation amplitude is the peak (positive or negative) change in the RF amplitude from its unmodulated value. Modulation index is normally expressed as a percentage, and may be displayed on a meter connected to an AM transmitter.\n\nSo if <math>m=0.5</math>, carrier amplitude varies by 50% above (and below) its unmodulated level, as is shown in the first waveform, below. For <math>m=1.0</math>, it varies by 100% as shown in the illustration below it. With 100% modulation the wave amplitude sometimes reaches zero, and this represents full modulation using standard AM and is often a target (in order to obtain the highest possible [[signal-to-noise ratio]]) but mustn't be exceeded. Increasing the modulating signal beyond that point, known as [[overmodulation]], causes a standard AM modulator (see below) to fail, as the negative excursions of the wave envelope cannot become less than zero, resulting in [[distortion]] (\"clipping\") of the received modulation. Transmitters typically incorporate a [[limiter]] circuit to avoid overmodulation, and/or a [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] circuit (especially for voice communications) in order to still approach 100% modulation for maximum intelligibility above the noise. Such circuits are sometimes referred to as a [[vogad]].\n\nHowever it is possible to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of [[double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission]]. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power [[broadcast]] transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a [[linear amplifier]]. What's more, a standard AM receiver using an [[envelope detector]] is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally ''not'' referred to as \"AM\" even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of [[double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission]] where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term \"modulation index\" loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.\n\n[[File:Amplitude Modulated Wave-hm-64.svg|thumb|400px|center|Fig 4: Modulation depth.

The audio power requirement is 50 percent of the RF-carrier power.\n; Heising (constant-current) modulation: RF amplifier plate voltage is fed through a [[choke (electronics)|choke]] (high-value inductor). The AM modulation tube plate is fed through the same inductor, so the modulator tube diverts current from the RF amplifier. The choke acts as a constant current source in the audio range. This system has a low power efficiency.\n; Control grid modulation: The operating bias and gain of the final RF amplifier can be controlled by varying the voltage of the control grid. This method requires little audio power, but care must be taken to reduce distortion.\n; Clamp tube (screen grid) modulation: The screen-grid bias may be controlled through a ''clamp tube'', which reduces voltage according to the modulation signal. It is difficult to approach 100-percent modulation while maintaining low distortion with this system.\n; [[Doherty amplifier|Doherty modulation]]: One tube provides the power under carrier conditions and another operates only for positive modulation peaks. Overall efficiency is good, and distortion is low.\n; [[Ampliphase|Outphasing modulation]]: Two tubes are operated in parallel, but partially out of phase with each other. As they are differentially phase modulated their combined amplitude is greater or smaller. Efficiency is good and distortion low when properly adjusted.\n; [[Pulse-width modulation|Pulse-width modulation (PWM) or pulse-duration modulation (PDM)]]: A highly efficient high voltage power supply is applied to the tube plate. The output voltage of this supply is varied at an audio rate to follow the program.

The simpler [[Dioptrics|dioptric]] (purely refractive) stepped lens, first proposed by [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Count Buffon]]{{hsp}}{{r|chisholm-1911-lighthouse}} and independently reinvented by Fresnel, is used in screen [[magnifying glass|magnifiers]] and in condenser lenses for [[overhead projector]]s.\n\nBy expressing [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' principle of secondary waves and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]'s principle of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] in quantitative terms, and supposing that simple colors consist of [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] waves, Fresnel gave the first satisfactory explanation of [[diffraction]] by straight edges, including the first satisfactory wave-based explanation of rectilinear propagation.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}205.</ref> Part of his argument was a proof that the addition of sinusoidal functions of the same frequency but different [[phase (waves)|phases]] is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions. By further supposing that light waves are purely [[transverse wave|transverse]], Fresnel explained the nature of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] and lack thereof, the mechanism of chromatic polarization (the colors produced when polarized light is passed through a slice of doubly-refractive crystal followed by a second polarizer), and the [[transmission coefficient|transmission]] and [[reflection coefficient]]s at the interface between two transparent [[isotropy|isotropic]] media (including [[Brewster's angle]]). Then, by generalizing the direction-speed-polarization relation for [[calcite]], he accounted for the directions and polarizations of the refracted rays in [[birefringence|doubly-refractive]] crystals of the ''biaxial'' class (those for which Huygens' secondary [[wavefront]]s are not [[axial symmetry|axisymmetric]]). The period between the first publication of his pure-transverse-wave hypothesis and the submission of his first correct solution to the biaxial problem was less than a year. Later, he coined the terms ''[[linear polarization]]'', ''[[circular polarization]]'', and ''[[elliptical polarization]]'', explained how [[optical rotation]] could be understood as a difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization, and (by allowing the reflection coefficient to be [[complex number|complex]]) accounted for the change in polarization due to [[total internal reflection]], as exploited in the [[Fresnel rhomb]]. Defenders of the established corpuscular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions.\n\nFresnel's legacy is the more remarkable in view of his lifelong battle with [[tuberculosis]], to which he succumbed at the age of 39.  Although he did not become a public celebrity in his short lifetime, he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers, including (on his deathbed) the [[Rumford Medal]] of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves. Inevitably, after the wave theory of light was subsumed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] theory in the 1860s, some attention was diverted from the magnitude of Fresnel's contribution. In the period between Fresnel's unification of physical optics and Maxwell's wider unification, a contemporary authority, Professor [[Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)|Humphrey Lloyd]], described Fresnel's transverse-wave theory as \"the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's system of the universe alone excepted.\"{{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1841}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:Augustin Fresnel buste Broglie.jpg|thumb|Monument to Augustin Fresnel on the facade of his birthplace at 2&nbsp;Rue Augustin Fresnel, [[Broglie, Eure|Broglie]] (facing Rue Jean Fran\u00e7ois M\u00e9rim\u00e9e),{{r|martan-2014}} inaugurated on 14 September 1884.{{r|bibmed|academie}} The inscription, when translated, says:<br>\"Augustin Fresnel, engineer of Bridges and Roads, member of the Academy of Sciences, creator of lenticular lighthouses, was born in this house on 10&nbsp;May 1788.

The sickly Augustin was considered the slow one, hardly beginning to read until the age of eight. At nine and ten he was undistinguished except for his ability to turn tree-branches into toy bows and guns that worked far too well, earning himself the title ''l'homme de g\u00e9nie'' (the man of genius) from his accomplices, and a united crackdown from their elders.<ref>Levitt, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}24\u20135; Arago, 1857, p.{{hsp}}402; Boutry, 1948, pp.{{tsp}}590\u201391.</ref>\n\nIn 1801, Augustin was sent to the ''\u00c9cole Centrale'' at [[Caen]], as company for Louis.

Successive positions of the [[wavefront]] are shown in blue before refraction, and in green after refraction. For ''ordinary'' refraction, the secondary wavefronts (gray curves) are spherical, so that the rays (straight gray lines) are perpendicular to the wavefronts.]]\n\nThe [[corpuscular theory of light]], favored by [[Isaac Newton]] and accepted by nearly all of Fresnel's seniors, easily explained '''[[rectilinear propagation]]''': the corpuscles obviously moved very fast, so that their paths were very nearly straight. The [[wave theory of light|wave theory]], as developed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in his ''[[Treatise on Light]]'' (1690), explained rectilinear propagation on the assumption that each point crossed by a traveling wavefront becomes the source of a secondary wavefront. Given the initial position of a traveling wavefront, any later position (according to Huygens) was the common [[tangent]] surface ([[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]]) of the secondary wavefronts emitted from the earlier position.<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{tsp}}20\u201321.</ref> As the extent of the common tangent was limited by the extent of the initial wavefront, the repeated application of Huygens' construction to a plane wavefront of limited extent (in a uniform medium) gave a straight, parallel beam. While this construction indeed predicted rectilinear propagation, it was difficult to reconcile with the common observation that wavefronts on the surface of water can bend around obstructions, and with the similar behavior of [[sound]] waves \u2014 causing Newton to maintain, to the end of his life, that if light consisted of waves it would \"bend and spread every way\" into the shadows.<ref>Newton, 1730, p.{{hsp}}362.</ref>\n\nHuygens' theory neatly explained the law of '''[[specular reflection|ordinary reflection]]''' and the law of '''[[Snell's law|ordinary refraction]]''' (\"Snell's law\"), provided that the secondary waves traveled slower in denser media (those of higher [[refractive index]]).<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{tsp}}22\u201338.</ref> The corpuscular theory, with the hypothesis that the corpuscles were subject to forces acting perpendicular to surfaces, explained the same laws equally well,<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}93\u20134,{{tsp}}103.</ref> albeit with the implication that light traveled ''faster'' in denser media; that implication was wrong, but could not be directly disproven with the technology of Newton's time or even Fresnel's time {{xref|(see [[Fizeau\u2013Foucault apparatus]])}}.\n\nSimilarly inconclusive was '''[[aberration of light|stellar aberration]]''' \u2014 that is, the apparent change in the position of a star due to the velocity of the earth across the line of sight (not to be confused with stellar [[stellar parallax|parallax]], which is due to the ''displacement'' of the earth across the line of sight). Identified by [[James Bradley]] in 1728, stellar aberration was widely taken as confirmation of the corpuscular theory. But it was equally compatible with the wave theory, as [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] noted in 1746 \u2014 tacitly assuming that the [[luminiferous aether|aether]] (the supposed wave-bearing medium) near the earth was not disturbed by the motion of the earth.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}129\u201330,{{tsp}}258.</ref>\n\nThe outstanding strength of Huygens' theory was his explanation of the '''[[birefringence]]''' (double refraction) of \"[[Iceland spar|Iceland crystal]]\" (transparent [[calcite]]), on the assumption that the secondary waves are spherical for the ordinary refraction (which satisfies Snell's law) and [[spheroid]]al for the ''extraordinary'' refraction (which does not).<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{tsp}}52\u2013105.</ref> In general, Huygens' common-tangent construction implies that rays are ''paths of least time'' between successive positions of the wavefront, in accordance with [[Fermat's principle]].{{r|deWitte-1959}}<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}225\u20136,{{tsp}}229.</ref> In the special case of [[isotropy|isotropic]] media, the secondary wavefronts must be spherical, and Huygens' construction then implies that the rays are perpendicular to the wavefront; indeed, the law of ''ordinary'' refraction can be separately derived from that premise, as [[Ignace-Gaston Pardies]] did before Huygens.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}62\u20134.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ggb in soap bubble 3.JPG|thumb|left|Altered colors of skylight reflected in a soap bubble, due to ''[[thin-film interference]]'' (formerly called \"thin-plate\" interference).]]\n\nAlthough Newton rejected the wave theory, he noticed its potential to explain colors, including the colors of \"[[thin-film interference|'''thin plates''']]\" (e.g., \"[[Newton's rings]]\", and the colors of skylight reflected in soap bubbles), on the assumption that light consists of ''periodic'' waves, with the lowest [[frequency|frequencies]] (longest [[wavelength]]s) at the red end of the spectrum, and the highest frequencies (shortest wavelengths) at the violet end. In&nbsp;1672 he published a heavy hint to that effect,<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}87.</ref>{{r|newton-1672e|p=5088\u20139}} but contemporary supporters of the wave theory failed to act on it: [[Robert Hooke]] treated light as a periodic sequence of pulses but did not use frequency as the criterion of color,<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}53\u20136.</ref> while Huygens treated the waves as individual pulses without any periodicity;<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, p.{{hsp}}17.</ref> and Pardies died young in 1673.

Newton, who called diffraction \"inflexion\", supposed that rays of light passing close to obstacles were bent (\"inflected\"); but his explanation was only qualitative.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}101\u20132; Newton, 1730, Book&nbsp;{{serif|III}}, Part&nbsp;{{serif|I}}.</ref> Huygens' common-tangent construction, without modifications, could not accommodate diffraction at all. Two such modifications were proposed by Young in the same 1801 Bakerian Lecture: first, that the secondary waves near the edge of an obstacle could diverge into the shadow, but only weakly, due to limited reinforcement from other secondary waves;{{r|young-1801|p=25\u20137}} and second, that diffraction by an edge was caused by interference between two rays: one reflected off the edge, and the other inflected while passing near the edge. The latter ray would be undeviated if sufficiently far from the edge, but Young did not elaborate on that case.{{r|young-1801|p=42\u20134}} These were the earliest suggestions that the degree of diffraction depends on wavelength.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}177\u20139.</ref> Later, in the 1803 Bakerian Lecture, Young ceased to regard inflection as a separate phenomenon,<ref>Young, 1855, p.{{hsp}}188.</ref> and produced evidence that diffraction fringes ''inside'' the shadow of a narrow obstacle were due to interference: when the light from one side was blocked, the internal fringes disappeared.<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}179\u201381.</ref> But Young was alone in such efforts until Fresnel entered the field.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}187.</ref>\n\nHuygens, in his investigation of double refraction, noticed something that he could not explain: when light passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence, the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second, while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second; but when the second crystal is rotated 90\u00b0 about the incident rays, the roles are interchanged, so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second, and vice versa.<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{tsp}}92\u20134.

But, as Young pointed out, the existence of such a velocity law was guaranteed by Huygens' spheroid, because Huygens' construction leads to Fermat's principle, which becomes Maupertuis's principle if the ray speed is replaced by the reciprocal of the particle speed! The corpuscularists had not found a ''force'' law that would yield the alleged velocity law. Worse, it was doubtful that any such force law would satisfy the conditions of Maupertuis's principle.<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}225\u20138; Frankel, 1974.</ref> In contrast, Young proceeded to show that \"a&nbsp;medium more easily compressible in one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it, as if it consisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connected by a substance somewhat less elastic\" admits spheroidal longitudinal wavefronts, as Huygens supposed.<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}228\u201332; cf.&nbsp;Whewell, 1857, p.{{hsp}}329.</ref>\n\n[[File:Calcite and polarizing filter.gif|thumb|300px|Printed label seen through a doubly-refracting calcite crystal and a modern polarizing filter, rotated to show the different polarizations of the two images.]]\n\nBut Malus, in the course of his experiments on double refraction, noticed something else: when a ray of light is reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaves like ''one'' of the two rays emerging from a calcite crystal.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}191\u20132.</ref> It was Malus who coined the term '''[[polarizer|polarization]]''' to describe this behavior, although the polarizing angle became known as '''[[Brewster's angle]]''' after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by [[David Brewster]] in 1815.{{r|brewster-1815b}} Malus also introduced the term ''[[plane of polarization]]''. In the case of polarization by reflection, his \"plane of polarization\" was the plane of the incident and reflected rays; in modern terms, this is the plane ''normal'' to the ''electric'' vibration. In&nbsp;1809, Malus further discovered that the intensity of light passing through ''two'' polarizers is proportional to the squared cosine of the angle between their planes of polarization ('''[[Malus's law]]'''),<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}192.</ref> whether the polarizers work by reflection or double refraction, and that ''all'' birefringent crystals produce both extraordinary refraction and polarization.<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}249\u201350.</ref> As the corpuscularists started trying to explain these things in terms of polar \"molecules\" of light, the wave-theorists had ''no working hypothesis'' on the nature of polarization, prompting Young to remark that Malus's observations \"present greater difficulties to the advocates of the undulatory theory than any other facts with which we are acquainted.\"{{hsp}}<ref>Young, 1855, p.{{hsp}}233.</ref>\n\nMalus died in February 1812, at the age of 36, shortly after receiving the [[Rumford Medal]] for his work on polarization.\n\nIn August 1811, [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] reported that if a thin plate of [[mica]] was viewed against a white polarized backlight through a calcite crystal, the two images of the mica were of [[complementary colors]] (the overlap having the same color as the background). The light emerging from the mica was \"''de''polarized\" in the sense that there was no orientation of the calcite that made one image disappear; yet it was not ordinary (\"''un''polarized\") light, for which the two images would be of the same color. Rotating the calcite around the line of sight changed the colors, though they remained complementary. Rotating the mica changed the ''saturation'' (not the hue) of the colors. This phenomenon became known as '''chromatic polarization'''. Replacing the mica with a much thicker plate of [[quartz]], with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis (the axis of Huygens' spheroid or Malus's velocity function), produced a similar effect, except that rotating the quartz made no difference. Arago tried to explain his observations in ''corpuscular'' terms.<ref>Levitt, 2009, p.{{hsp}}37; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}193\u20134,{{tsp}}290.</ref>\n\n[[File:Arago Francois portrait.jpg|thumb|left|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Fran\u00e7ois Arago (1786\u20131853).</div>]]\n\nIn 1812, as Arago pursued further qualitative experiments and other commitments, [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] reworked the same ground using a [[gypsum]] lamina in place of the mica, and found empirical formulae for the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images. The formulae contained two coefficients, supposedly representing colors of rays \"affected\" and \"unaffected\" by the plate \u2014 the \"affected\" rays being of the same color mix as those reflected by amorphous thin plates of proportional, but lesser, thickness.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}194\u20135 (ordinary intensity); Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}148 (both intensities).</ref>\n\n[[File:T1- d642 - Fig. 327. \u2014 J. B.

In fact the overlap between Arago's work and Biot's was minimal, because Arago's was only qualitative and sought to include other topics. But the dispute triggered a notorious falling-out between the two men.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}79\u201388; Levitt, 2009, pp.{{tsp}}33\u201357.</ref>{{r|buchwald-1989b}}<!-- Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}156; Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}194; Buchwald, 2013, p.{{hsp}}450. -->\n\nLater that year, Biot tried to explain the observations as an oscillation of the alignment of the \"affected\" corpuscles at a frequency proportional to that of Newton's \"fits\", due to forces depending on the alignment. This theory became known as ''mobile polarization''. To reconcile his results with a sinusoidal oscillation, Biot had to suppose that the corpuscles emerged with one of two permitted orientations, namely the extremes of the oscillation, with probabilities depending on the [[phase (waves)|phase]] of the oscillation.<ref>Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}149\u201350; Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}99\u2013103; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}195\u20136.</ref> Corpuscular optics was becoming expensive on assumptions. But in 1813, Biot reported that the case of quartz was simpler: the observable phenomenon (now called '''[[optical rotation]]''' or ''optical activity'' or sometimes ''rotary polarization'') was a gradual rotation of the polarization direction with distance, and could be explained by a corresponding rotation (''not'' oscillation) of the corpuscles.<ref>Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}151\u20132; Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}196.</ref>\n\nEarly in 1814, reviewing Biot's work on chromatic polarization, Young noted that the periodicity of the color as a function of the plate thickness \u2014 including the factor by which the period exceeded that for a reflective thin plate, and even the effect of obliquity of the plate (but not the role of polarization) \u2014 could be explained by the wave theory in terms of the different propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves through the plate.<ref>Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}269\u201372.</ref> But Young was then the only public defender of the wave theory.<ref name=frankel-p176>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}176.</ref>\n\nIn summary, in the spring of 1814, as Fresnel tried in vain to guess what polarization was, the corpuscularists thought that they knew, while the wave-theorists (if we may use the plural) literally had no idea. Both theories claimed to explain rectilinear propagation, but the wave explanation was overwhelmingly regarded as unconvincing. The corpuscular theory could not link double refraction to specific surface forces; the wave theory could not yet link it to polarization. The corpuscular theory was weak on thin plates and silent on gratings;<ref>Newton (1730) observed feathers acting as reflection gratings and as a transmission gratings, but classified the former case under thin plates (p.{{hsp}}252), and the latter, more vaguely, under inflection (p.{{hsp}}322). In retrospect, the latter experiment (p.{{hsp}}322, end of Obs.{{tsp}}2) is dangerous to eyesight and should not be repeated as written.</ref> the wave theory was strong on both, but under-appreciated. Concerning diffraction, the corpuscular theory did not yield quantitative predictions, while the wave theory had begun to do so by considering diffraction as a manifestation of interference, but had only considered two rays at a time. Only the corpuscular theory gave even a vague insight into Brewster's angle, Malus's law, or optical rotation. Concerning chromatic polarization, the wave theory explained the periodicity far better than the corpuscular theory, but had nothing to say about the role of polarization; and its explanation of the periodicity was largely ignored.<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}155.</ref> And Arago had founded the study of chromatic polarization, only to lose the lead, controversially, to Biot. Such were the circumstances in which Arago first heard of Fresnel's interest in optics.\n\n=== R\u00eaveries ===\n\n[[File:L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e.jpg|thumb|[[Bas-relief]] of Fresnel's uncle L\u00e9onor M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (1757\u20131836), on the same wall as the Fresnel monument in Broglie.{{r|martan-2014}}]]\n\nFresnel's letters from later in 1814 reveal his interest in the wave theory, including his awareness that it explained the constancy of the speed of light and was at least compatible with stellar aberration.

He requested a two-month leave of absence, which was readily granted because roadworks were in abeyance.<ref>Levitt, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}39,{{hsp}}239.</ref>\n\nOn 23 September he wrote to Arago, beginning \"I&nbsp;think I&nbsp;have found the explanation and the law of colored fringes which one notices in the shadows of bodies illuminated by a luminous point.\" In the same paragraph, however, Fresnel implicitly acknowledged doubt about the novelty of his work: noting that he would need to incur some expense in order to improve his measurements, he wanted to know \"whether this is not useless, and whether the law of diffraction has not already been established by sufficiently exact experiments.\"{{hsp}}<ref>Kipnis, 1991, p.{{hsp}}167; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}5\u20136.</ref> He explained that he had not yet had a chance to acquire the items on his reading lists,<ref name=readings-english /> with the apparent exception of \"Young's book\", which he could not understand without his brother's help.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}198. \"Young's book\", which Fresnel distinguished from the ''Philosophical Transactions'', is presumably ''A&nbsp;Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts'' (2&nbsp;volumes, 1807).

In [https://archive.org/details/lecturescourseof02younrich vol.{{tsp}}2], which includes the Bakerian lectures from the ''Philosophical Transactions'', Fig.{{hsp}}108 (p.{{hsp}}632) shows just one case of an undeviated direct ray intersecting a reflected ray.</ref> Not surprisingly, he had retraced many of Young's steps.\n\nIn a memoir sent to the Institute on 15 October 1815, Fresnel mapped the external and internal fringes in the shadow of a wire. He noticed, like Young before him, that the internal fringes disappeared when the light from one side was blocked, and concluded that \"the vibrations of two rays that cross each other under a very small angle can contradict each other\u2026\"{{hsp}}<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}199.</ref> But, whereas Young took the disappearance of the internal fringes as ''confirmation'' of the principle of interference, Fresnel reported that it was the internal fringes that first drew his attention to the principle. To explain the diffraction pattern, Fresnel constructed the internal fringes by considering the intersections of circular wavefronts emitted from the two edges of the obstruction, and the external fringes by considering the intersections between direct waves and waves reflected off the nearer edge. For the external fringes, to obtain tolerable agreement with observation, he had to suppose that the reflected wave was [[phase inversion|inverted]]; and he noted that the predicted paths of the fringes were hyperbolic. In the part of the memoir that most clearly surpassed Young, Fresnel explained the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction in terms of interference, noting that if two parallel rays were reflected or refracted at other than the prescribed angle, they would no longer have the same [[phase (waves)|phase]] in a common perpendicular plane, and every vibration would be cancelled by a nearby vibration. He noted that his explanation was valid provided that the surface irregularities were much smaller than the wavelength.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}119,{{tsp}}131\u20132; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}199\u2013201; Kipnis, 1991, pp.{{tsp}}175\u20136.</ref>\n\nOn 10 November, Fresnel sent a supplementary note dealing with Newton's rings and with gratings,<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}201.</ref> including, for the first time, ''transmission'' gratings \u2014 although in that case the interfering rays were still assumed to be \"inflected\", and the experimental verification was inadequate because it used only two threads.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}48\u20139; Kipnis, 1991, pp.{{tsp}}176\u20138.</ref>\n\nAs Fresnel was not a member of the Institute, the fate of his memoir depended heavily on the report of a single member. The reporter for Fresnel's memoir turned out to be Arago (with [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]] as the other reviewer).<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}158; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}9n.</ref> On 8 November, Arago wrote to Fresnel:\n{{quote|I have been instructed by the Institute to examine your memoir on the diffraction of light; I have studied it carefully, and found many interesting experiments, some of which had already been done by Dr.&nbsp;Thomas Young, who in general regards this phenomenon in a manner rather analogous to the one you have adopted. But what neither he nor anyone had seen before you is that the ''external'' colored bands do not travel in a straight line as one moves away from the opaque body. The results you have achieved in this regard seem to me very important; perhaps they can serve to prove the truth of the undulatory system, so often and so feebly combated by physicists who have not bothered to understand it.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}38; italics added.</ref>}}\nFresnel was troubled, wanting to know more precisely where he had collided with Young.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}137\u20139.</ref> Concerning the curved paths of the \"colored bands\", Young had noted the hyperbolic paths of the fringes in the [[Young's interference experiment|two-source interference]] pattern, corresponding roughly to Fresnel's ''internal'' fringes, and had described the hyperbolic fringes that appear ''on the screen'' within rectangular shadows.<ref>Young, 1807, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}787 & Figs.{{tsp}}442,{{hsp}}445; Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}180\u201381,{{tsp}}184.</ref> But Arago erred in his belief that the curved paths of the fringes were fundamentally incompatible with the corpuscular theory.<ref>Kipnis, 1991, pp.{{tsp}}204\u20135.&nbsp; Cf.&nbsp;Newton, 1730, p.{{hsp}}321, Fig.{{hsp}}1, where the straight rays {{serif|DG,{{tsp}}EH,{{tsp}}FI}} contribute to the curved path of a fringe, so that the same fringe is made by different rays at different distances from the obstacle{{tsp}} (cf.&nbsp;Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}101, Fig.{{hsp}}3.11 \u2014 where, in the caption, \"1904\" should be \"1704\" and \"{{serif|CFG}}\" should be \"{{serif|CFI}}\"). In short, Newton evidently thought the fringes were ''[[caustic (optics)|caustics]]''.</ref>\n\nArago's letter went on to request more data on the external fringes. Fresnel complied, until he exhausted his leave and was assigned to [[Rennes]] in the d\u00e9partement of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]]. At this point Arago interceded with [[Gaspard de Prony]], head of the \u00c9cole des Ponts, who wrote to [[Louis-Mathieu Mol\u00e9]], head of the Corps des Ponts, suggesting that the progress of science and the prestige of the Corps would be enhanced if Fresnel could come to Paris for a time. He arrived in March 1816, and his leave was subsequently extended through the middle of the year.<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}158; Boutry, 1948, p.{{hsp}}597; Levitt, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}41\u20133.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in an experiment reported on 26 February 1816, Arago verified Fresnel's prediction that the internal fringes were shifted if the rays on one side of the obstacle passed through a thin glass lamina.

In the shaded region, the beams from the two virtual images overlap and interfere in the manner of Young (above).]]\n\nOn 24 May 1816, Fresnel wrote to Young (in French), acknowledging how little of his own memoir was new.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}201; letter printed in Young, 1855, pp.{{tsp}}376\u20138.</ref> But in a \"supplement\" signed on 14 July and read the next day,<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}129\u201370.</ref> Fresnel noted that the internal fringes were more accurately predicted by supposing that the two interfering rays came from some distance ''outside'' the edges of the obstacle. To explain this, he divided the incident wavefront at the obstacle into what we now call ''[[Fresnel zone]]s'', such that the secondary waves from each zone were spread over half a cycle when they arrived at the observation point. The zones on each side of the obstacle largely canceled out in pairs, except the first, which was represented by an \"efficacious ray\". This approach worked for the internal fringes, but the superposition of the efficacious ray and the direct ray did ''not'' work for the ''external'' fringes.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}201\u20133.</ref>\n\nThe contribution from the \"efficacious ray\" was thought to be only ''partly'' canceled, for reasons involving the dynamics of the medium: where the wavefront was continuous, symmetry forbade oblique vibrations; but near the obstacle that truncated the wavefront, the asymmetry allowed some sideways vibration towards the geometric shadow. This argument showed that Fresnel had not (yet) fully accepted Huygens' principle, which would have permitted oblique radiation from all portions of the front.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}134,{{tsp}}144\u20135.</ref>\n\nIn the same supplement, Fresnel described his well-known double mirror, comprising two flat mirrors joined at an angle of slightly less than 180\u00b0, with which he produced a two-slit interference pattern from two virtual images of the same slit. A conventional double-slit experiment required a preliminary ''single'' slit to ensure that the light falling on the double slit was ''[[coherence (physics)|coherent]]'' (synchronized). In Fresnel's version, the preliminary single slit was retained, and the double slit was replaced by the double mirror \u2014 which bore no physical resemblance to the double slit and yet performed the same function. This result (which had been announced by Arago in the March issue of the ''Annales'') made it hard to believe that the two-slit pattern had anything to do with corpuscles being deflected as they passed near the edges of the slits.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}137\u20138; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}201\u20132; Boutry, 1948, p.{{hsp}}597; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}123\u20138 (Arago's announcement).</ref>\n\nBut 1816 was the \"[[Year Without a Summer]]\": crops failed; hungry farming families lined the streets of Rennes; the central government organized \"charity workhouses\" for the needy; and in October, Fresnel was sent back to Ille-et-Vilaine to supervise charity workers in addition to his regular road crew.<ref>Levitt, 2013, p.{{hsp}}43; Boutry, 1948, p.{{hsp}}599.</ref> According to Arago,\n{{quote|with Fresnel conscientiousness was always the foremost part of his character, and he constantly performed his duties as an engineer with the most rigorous scrupulousness.

He restated Huygens' principle in combination with the [[superposition principle]], saying that the vibration at each point on a wavefront is the sum of the vibrations that would be sent to it at that moment by all the elements of the wavefront in any of its previous positions, all elements acting separately {{xref|(see [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]])}}. For a wavefront partly obstructed in a previous position, the summation was to be carried out over the unobstructed portion. In directions other than the normal to the primary wavefront, the secondary waves were weakened due to obliquity, but weakened much more by destructive interference, so that the effect of obliquity alone could be ignored.<ref>Cf.

He acknowledged the directionality of the secondary sources and the variation in their distances from the observation point, chiefly to explain why these things make negligible difference in the context, provided of course that the secondary sources do not radiate in the retrograde direction. Then, applying his theory of interference to the secondary waves, he expressed the intensity of light diffracted by a single straight edge (half-plane) in terms of integrals which involved the dimensions of the problem, but which could be converted to the normalized forms above. With reference to the integrals, he explained the calculation of the maxima and minima of the intensity (external fringes), and noted that the calculated intensity falls very rapidly as one moves into the geometric shadow.<ref>Crew, 1900, pp.{{tsp}}101\u20138 (vector-like representation), 109 (no retrograde radiation), 110\u201311 (directionality and distance), 118\u201322 (derivation of integrals), 124\u20135 (maxima & minima), 129\u201331 (geometric shadow).</ref> The last result, as Olivier Darrigol says, \"amounts to a proof of the rectilinear propagation of light in the wave theory, indeed the first proof that a modern physicist would still accept.\"{{hsp}}<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}204\u20135.</ref>\n\nFor the experimental testing of his calculations, Fresnel used red light with a wavelength of 638{{hsp}}nm, which he deduced from the diffraction pattern in the simple case in which light incident on a single slit was focused by a cylindrical lens. For a variety of distances from the source to the obstacle and from the obstacle to the field point, he compared the calculated and observed positions of the fringes for diffraction by a half-plane, a slit, and a narrow strip \u2014 concentrating on the minima, which were visually sharper than the maxima. For the slit and the strip, he could not use the previously computed table of maxima and minima; for each combination of dimensions, the intensity had to be expressed in terms of sums or differences of Fresnel integrals and calculated from the table of integrals, and the extrema had to be calculated anew.<ref>Crew, 1900, pp.{{tsp}}127\u20138 (wavelength), 129\u201331 (half-plane), 132\u20135 (extrema, slit); Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}350\u201355 (narrow strip).</ref> The agreement between calculation and measurement was better than 1.5% in almost every case.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}179\u201382.</ref>\n\nNear the end of the memoir, Fresnel summed up the difference between Huygens' use of secondary waves and his own: whereas Huygens says there is light only where the secondary waves exactly agree, Fresnel says there is complete darkness only where the secondary waves exactly cancel out.<ref>Crew, 1900, p.{{hsp}}144.</ref>\n\n[[File:Simeon Poisson.jpg|thumb|left|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson (1781\u20131840).</div>]]\n\nThe judging committee comprised Laplace, Biot, and [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (all corpuscularists), [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac|Gay-Lussac]] (uncommitted), and Arago, who eventually wrote the committee's report.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}xlii; Worrall, 1989, p.{{hsp}}136; Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}171,{{hsp}}183; Levitt, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}45\u20136.</ref> Although entries in the competition were supposed to be anonymous to the judges, Fresnel's must have been recognizable by the content.<ref>Levitt, 2013, p.{{hsp}}46.</ref> There was only one other entry, of which neither the manuscript nor any record of the author has survived.<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}162.

First, although the professionalization of science in France had established common standards, it was one thing to acknowledge a piece of research as meeting those standards, and another thing to regard it as conclusive.<ref name=frankel-p176 /> Second, it was possible to interpret Fresnel's integrals as rules for combining ''rays''. Arago even encouraged that interpretation, presumably in order to minimize resistance to Fresnel's ideas.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}183\u20134; Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}205.</ref> Even Biot began teaching the Huygens-Fresnel principle without committing himself to a wave basis.<ref>Kipnis, 1991, pp.{{tsp}}219\u201320,{{tsp}}224,{{tsp}}232\u20133; Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{hsp}}870.</ref> Third, Fresnel's theory did not explain the mechanism of generation of secondary waves or why they had any significant angular spread; this issue particularly bothered Poisson.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}188\u201398; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}205\u20136; Kipnis, 1991, p.{{hsp}}220.</ref> Fourth, the question that most exercised optical physicists at that time was not diffraction, but polarization \u2014 on which Fresnel had been working, but was yet to make his critical breakthrough.\n\n=== Polarization ===\n\n==== Background: Emissionism and selectionism ====\n\nAn ''emission'' theory of light was one that regarded the propagation of light as the transport of some kind of matter. While the corpuscular theory was obviously an emission theory, the converse did not follow: in principle, one could be an emissionist without being a corpuscularist. This was convenient because, beyond the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction, emissionists never managed to make testable quantitative predictions from a theory of forces acting on corpuscles of light. But they ''did'' make quantitative predictions from the premises that rays were countable objects, which were conserved in their interactions with matter (except absorbent media), and which had particular orientations with respect to their directions of propagation. According to this framework, polarization and the related phenomena of double refraction and partial reflection involved altering the orientations of the rays and/or selecting them according to orientation, and the state of polarization of a beam (a&nbsp;bundle of rays) was a question of how many rays were in what orientations: in a fully polarized beam, the orientations were all the same. This approach, which [[Jed Buchwald]] has called ''selectionism'', was pioneered by Malus and diligently pursued by Biot.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}50\u201351,{{tsp}}63\u20135,{{tsp}}103\u20134; 2013, pp.{{tsp}}448\u20139.</ref>{{r|buchwald-1989b|p=110\u201313}}\n\nFresnel, in contrast, decided to introduce polarization into interference experiments.\n\n==== Interference of polarized light, chromatic polarization (1816\u201321) ====\n\nIn the summer of 1816, Fresnel discovered that when a birefringent crystal produced two images of a single slit, he could ''not'' obtain the usual two-slit interference pattern, even if he compensated for the different propagation times. A more general experiment, suggested by Arago, found that if the two beams of a double-slit device were separately polarized, the interference pattern appeared and disappeared as the polarization of one beam was rotated, giving full interference for parallel polarizations, but no interference for perpendicular polarizations {{xref|(see [[Fresnel\u2013Arago laws]])}}.<ref name=darrigol-p206>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}206.</ref> These experiments, among others, were eventually reported in a brief memoir published in 1819 and later translated into English.{{r|arago-fresnel-1819}}\n\nIn a memoir drafted on 30 August 1816 and revised on 6 October, Fresnel reported an experiment in which he placed two matching thin laminae in a double-slit apparatus \u2014 one over each slit, with their optic axes perpendicular \u2014 and obtained two interference patterns offset in opposite directions, with perpendicular polarizations. This, in combination with the previous findings, meant that each lamina split the incident light into perpendicularly polarized components with different velocities \u2014 just like a normal (thick) birefringent crystal, and contrary to Biot's \"mobile polarization\" hypothesis.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}207; Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}163\u20134.</ref>\n\nAccordingly, in the same memoir, Fresnel offered his first attempt at a wave theory of chromatic polarization. When polarized light passed through a crystal lamina, it was split into ordinary and extraordinary waves (with intensities described by Malus's law), and these were perpendicularly polarized and therefore did not interfere, so that no colors were produced (yet). But if they then passed through an ''analyzer'' (second polarizer), their polarizations were brought into alignment (with intensities again modified according to Malus's law), and they would interfere.<ref name=darrigol-p206 /> This explanation, by itself, predicts that if the analyzer is rotated 90\u00b0, the ordinary and extraordinary waves simply switch roles, so that if the analyzer takes the form of a calcite crystal, the two images of the lamina should be of the same hue (this issue is revisited below). But in fact, as Arago and Biot had found, they are of complementary colors. To correct the prediction, Fresnel proposed a phase-inversion rule whereby ''one'' of the constituent waves of ''one'' of the two images suffered an additional 180\u00b0 phase shift on its way through the lamina. This inversion was a weakness in the theory relative to Biot's, as Fresnel acknowledged,<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}164.</ref> although the rule specified which of the two images had the inverted wave.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}386.</ref> Moreover, Fresnel could deal only with special cases, because he had not yet solved the problem of superposing sinusoidal functions with arbitrary phase differences due to propagation at different velocities through the lamina.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}216,{{hsp}}384.</ref>\n\nHe solved that problem in a \"supplement\" signed on 15 January 1818{{hsp}}{{r|fresnel-1818b}} (mentioned above). In the same document, he accommodated Malus's law by proposing an underlying law: that if polarized light is incident on a birefringent crystal with its optic axis at an angle ''\u03b8'' to the \"plane of polarization\", the ordinary and extraordinary vibrations (as functions of time) are scaled by the factors cos{{tsp}}''\u03b8'' and sin{{tsp}}''\u03b8'', respectively. Although modern readers easily interpret these factors in terms of perpendicular components of a ''transverse'' oscillation, Fresnel did not (yet) explain them that way. Hence he still needed the phase-inversion rule. He applied all these principles to a case of chromatic polarization not covered by Biot's formulae, involving ''two'' successive laminae with axes separated by 45\u00b0, and obtained predictions that disagreed with Biot's experiments (except in special cases) but agreed with his own.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}333\u20136; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}207\u20138. (Darrigol gives the date as 1817, but the page numbers in his footnote 95 fit reference \"1818b\", not \"1817\".)</ref>\n\nFresnel applied the same principles to the standard case of chromatic polarization, in which ''one'' birefringent lamina was sliced parallel to its axis and placed between a polarizer and an analyzer. If the analyzer took the form of a thick calcite crystal with its axis in the plane of polarization, Fresnel predicted that the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the lamina were respectively proportional to\n\n::<math>I_o = \\cos^2i\\,\\cos^2(i{-}s) + \\sin^2i\\,\\sin^2(i{-}s) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin 2i\\,\\sin 2(i{-}s)\\cos\\phi\\,,</math>\n\n::<math>I_e = \\cos^2i\\,\\sin^2(i{-}s) + \\sin^2i\\,\\cos^2(i{-}s) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sin 2i\\,\\sin 2(i{-}s)\\cos\\phi\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>i</math> is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the optic axis of the lamina,{{tsp}} <math>s</math> is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the plane of polarization of the final ordinary image, and <math>\\phi</math> is the phase lag of the extraordinary wave relative to the ordinary wave due to the difference in propagation times through the lamina. The terms in <math>\\phi</math> are the frequency-dependent terms and explain why the lamina must be ''thin'' in order to produce discernible colors: if the lamina is too thick, <math>\\cos\\phi</math> will pass through too many cycles as the frequency varies through the visible range, and the eye (which divides the visible spectrum into only [[cone cell|three bands]]) will not be able to resolve the cycles.\n\nFrom these equations it is easily verified that <math>\\,I_o+I_e=1\\,</math> for all <math>\\phi,</math> so that the colors are complementary. Without the phase-inversion rule, there would be a ''plus'' sign in front of the last term in the second equation, so that the <math>\\phi</math>-dependent term would be the same in both equations, implying (incorrectly) that the colors were of the same hue.\n\nThese equations were included in an undated note that Fresnel gave to Biot,<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}533\u20137. On the provenance of the note, see p.{{hsp}}523. In the above text, ''\u03c6'' is an abbreviation for Fresnel's {{nowrap|2''\u03c0''(''e''{{hsp}}\u2212{{hsp}}''o'')}}, where ''e'' and ''o'' are the numbers of cycles taken by the extraordinary and ordinary waves to travel through the lamina.</ref> to which Biot added a few lines of his own. If we substitute\n\n::<math>U=\\cos^2\\tfrac{\\phi}{2}</math> &nbsp;and&nbsp; <math>A=\\sin^2\\tfrac{\\phi}{2}\\,,</math>\n\nthen Fresnel's formulae can be rewritten as\n\n::<math> \\!I_o = U\\cos^2 s + A\\cos^2(2i-s)\\,,</math>\n::<math>   I_e = U\\sin^2 s + A\\sin^2(2i-s)\\,,</math>\n\nwhich are none other than Biot's empirical formulae of 1812,<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}97; Frankel, 1976, p.\u200a148.</ref> except that Biot interpreted <math>U</math> and <math>A</math> as the \"unaffected\" and \"affected\" selections of the rays incident on the lamina. If Biot's substitutions were accurate, they would imply that his experimental results were more fully explained by Fresnel's theory than by his own.\n\nArago delayed reporting on Fresnel's works on chromatic polarization until June 1821, when he used them in a broad attack on Biot's theory. In his written response, Biot protested that Arago's attack went beyond the proper scope of a report on the nominated works of Fresnel. But Biot also claimed that the substitutions for <math>U</math> and <math>A,</math> and therefore Fresnel's expressions for <math>I_o</math> and <math>I_e,</math> were empirically wrong because when Fresnel's intensities of spectral colors were mixed according to Newton's rules, the squared cosine and sine functions varied too smoothly to account for the observed sequence of colors. That claim drew a written reply from Fresnel, who disputed whether the colors changed as abruptly as Biot claimed, and whether the human eye could judge color with sufficient objectivity for the purpose. On the latter question, Fresnel pointed out that different observers may give different names to the same color. Furthermore, he said, a single observer can only compare colors side-by-side; and even if they are judged to be the same, the identity is of sensation, not necessarily of composition. Fresnel's oldest and strongest point \u2014 that thin crystals were subject to the same laws as thick ones and did not need or allow a separate theory \u2014 Biot left unanswered.&nbsp; Arago and Fresnel were seen to have won the debate.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}237\u201351; Levitt, 2009, pp.{{tsp}}54\u20137; Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}165\u20138; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}208\u20139.</ref>\n\nMoreover, by this time Fresnel had a new, simpler derivation of his equations on chromatic polarization.\n\n==== Breakthrough: Pure transverse waves (1821) ====\n\n[[File:Andre-marie-ampere2.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re (1775\u20131836).</div>]]\n\nIn the draft memoir of 30 August 1816, Fresnel mentioned two hypotheses \u2014 one of which he attributed to Amp\u00e8re \u2014 by which the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams could be explained if polarized light waves were ''partly'' [[transverse wave|transverse]]. But Fresnel could not develop either of these ideas into a comprehensive theory. According to his later account, both he and Amp\u00e8re realized as early as September 1816 that the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams, together with the phase-inversion rule in chromatic polarization, would be most easily explained if the waves were ''purely'' transverse. But that would raise a new difficulty: as natural light seemed to be ''un''polarized and its waves were therefore presumed to be longitudinal, one would need to explain how the longitudinal component of vibration disappeared on polarization, and why it did not reappear when polarized light was reflected or refracted obliquely by a glass plate.{{hsp}}<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}205\u20136,{{tsp}}208,{{tsp}}212.</ref>\n\nIndependently, on 12 January 1817, Young wrote to Arago (in&nbsp;English) noting that a transverse vibration would constitute a polarization, and that if two longitudinal waves crossed at a significant angle, they could not cancel without leaving a residual transverse vibration.<ref>Young, 1855, p.{{hsp}}383.</ref> Young repeated this idea in an article published in a supplement to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' in February 1818, in which he added that Malus's law would be explained if polarization consisted in a transverse motion.{{r|young-1818|p=333\u20135}}\n\nThus Fresnel, by his own testimony, may not have been the first person to suspect that light waves could have a transverse ''component'', or that ''polarized'' waves were exclusively transverse. And it was Young, not Fresnel, who first ''published'' the idea that polarization depends on the orientation of a transverse vibration. But these incomplete theories had not reconciled the nature of polarization with the apparent existence of ''unpolarized'' light; that achievement was to be Fresnel's alone.\n\nIn a note that Buchwald dates in the summer of 1818, Fresnel entertained the idea that unpolarized waves could have vibrations of the same energy and obliquity, with their orientations distributed uniformly about the wave-normal, and that the degree of polarization was the degree of ''non''-uniformity in the distribution. Two pages later he noted, apparently for the first time in writing, that his phase-inversion rule and the non-interference of orthogonally-polarized beams would be easily explained if the vibrations of fully polarized waves were \"perpendicular to the normal to the wave\" \u2014 that is, purely transverse.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}225\u20136; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}526\u20137,{{tsp}}529.</ref>\n\nBut if he could account for ''lack'' of polarization by averaging out the transverse component, he did not also need to assume a longitudinal component. It was enough to suppose that light waves are ''purely'' transverse, hence ''always'' polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation, and that the \"unpolarized\" state of natural or \"direct\" light is due to rapid and random variations in that orientation, in which case two ''coherent'' portions of \"unpolarized\" light will still interfere because their orientations will be synchronized.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Fresnel made this last step, because there is no relevant documentation from 1820 or early 1821{{hsp}}<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}226.</ref> (perhaps because he was too busy working on lighthouse-lens prototypes; see [[#Prototypes|below]]). But he first ''published'' the idea in a paper on \"''Calcul des teintes\u2026''\" (\"calculation of hues\u2026\"), serialized in Arago's ''Annales'' for May, June, and July 1821.{{r|fresnel-1821a}} In the first installment, Fresnel described \"direct\" (unpolarized) light as \"the rapid succession of systems of waves polarized in all directions\",<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}227; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}612.</ref> and gave the modern explanation of chromatic polarization. In the second installment, he revealed the suspicion that he and Amp\u00e8re had harbored since 1816, and the difficulty it raised.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}212; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}629\u201330.</ref> He continued:\n{{quote|It has only been for a few months that, in meditating more attentively on this subject, I have recognized that it is very probable that the oscillatory movements of the light waves are executed solely according to the plane of these waves, ''for direct light as for polarized light''{{hsp}}.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}630; emphasis added.</ref>}}\nAccording to this new view, he wrote, \"''the act of polarization consists not in creating transverse motions, but in decomposing them in two fixed, mutually perpendicular directions, and in separating the two components''\".<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}228; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}636; emphasis added by Buchwald.</ref>\n\nWhile selectionists could insist on interpreting Fresnel's diffraction integrals in terms of discrete, countable rays, they could not do the same with his theory of polarization. For a selectionist, the state of polarization of a beam concerned the distribution of orientations over the ''population'' of rays, and that distribution was presumed to be static. For Fresnel, the state of polarization of a beam concerned the variation of a displacement over ''time''. That displacement might be constrained but was ''not'' static, and rays were geometric constructions, ''not'' countable objects. The conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had become unbridgeable.<ref>Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}230.</ref>\n\nThe other difficulty posed by pure transverse waves, of course, was the apparent implication that the aether was an elastic solid (!) but, unlike other elastic solids, incapable of transmitting ''longitudinal'' waves. The wave theory was cheap on assumptions, but its latest assumption was expensive on credulity. If that assumption was to be widely entertained, its explanatory power would need to be impressive.\n\n==== Partial reflection (1821) ====\n\nIn the second installment of \"Calcul des teintes\" (June 1821), Fresnel supposed, by analogy with [[sound]] waves, that the density of the aether in a refractive medium was inversely proportional to the square of the wave velocity, and therefore directly proportional to the square of the refractive index. For reflection and refraction at the surface between two isotropic media of different indices, Fresnel decomposed the transverse vibrations into two perpendicular components, now known as the ''s'' and ''p'' components, which are parallel to the ''surface'' and the ''plane'' of incidence, respectively; in other words, the ''s'' and ''p'' components are respectively ''square'' and ''parallel'' to the plane of incidence.<ref>The ''s'' originally comes from the German ''senkrecht'', meaning perpendicular (to the plane of incidence).</ref> For the ''s'' component, Fresnel supposed that the interaction between the two media was analogous to an [[elastic collision]], and obtained a formula for what we now call the ''[[reflectivity]]'': the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity. The predicted reflectivity was non-zero at all angles.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}388\u201390; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}643.</ref>\n\nThe third installment (July 1821) was a short \"postscript\" in which Fresnel announced that he had found, by a \"mechanical solution\", a formula for the reflectivity of the ''p'' component, which predicted that ''the reflectivity was zero at the Brewster angle''. So polarization by reflection had been accounted for \u2014 but with the proviso that the direction of vibration in Fresnel's model was ''perpendicular'' to the plane of polarization as defined by Malus. (On the ensuing controversy, see ''[[Plane of polarization]]''.) For other angles of incidence, the technology of the time did not allow the ''s'' and ''p'' reflectivities to be measured accurately enough to test Fresnel's formulae. But the formulae could be rewritten in terms of what we now call the ''[[reflection coefficient]]'': the signed ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude. Then, if the plane of polarization of the incident ray was at 45\u00b0 to the plane of incidence, the tangent of the corresponding angle for the reflected ray was obtainable from the ''ratio'' of the two reflection coefficients, and this angle could be measured. Fresnel measured it for a range of angles of incidence, for glass and water, and the agreement between the calculated and measured angles was better than 1.5\u00b0 in all cases.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}390\u201391; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}646\u20138.</ref>\n\nFresnel gave details of the \"mechanical solution\" in a memoir read to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on 7 January 1823.{{r|fresnel-1823a}} Conservation of energy was combined with continuity of the ''tangential'' vibration at the interface.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}391\u20133; Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{tsp}}133\u20135.</ref> The resulting formulae for the reflection coefficients and reflectivities became known as the ''[[Fresnel equations]]''.

It would be considered left-handed/anti-clockwise circularly polarized if defined from the point of view of the receiver. If the rotating vector is resolved into horizontal and vertical components (not shown), these are a quarter-cycle out of phase with each other.]]\n\nIn a memoir dated 9 December 1822,{{r|fresnel-1822z}} Fresnel coined the terms ''[[linear polarization]]'' (French: ''polarisation rectiligne'') for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180\u00b0 out of phase, ''[[circular polarization]]'' for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter-cycle (\u00b190\u00b0) out of phase, and ''[[elliptical polarization]]'' for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference. He then explained how [[optical rotation]] could be understood as a species of birefringence. Linearly-polarized light could be resolved into two circularly-polarized components rotating in opposite directions. If these components propagated at slightly different speeds, the phase difference between them \u2014 and therefore the direction of their linearly-polarized resultant \u2014 would vary continuously with distance.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}230\u201332,{{tsp}}442.</ref>\n\nThese concepts called for a redefinition of the distinction between polarized and unpolarized light. Before Fresnel, it was thought that polarization could vary in direction, and in degree (e.g., due to variation in the angle of reflection off a transparent body), and that it could be a function of color (chromatic polarization), but not that it could vary in ''kind''. Hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed by an analyzer with the appropriate orientation. Light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization (e.g., by passage through a crystal lamina, or by total internal reflection) was described as partly or fully \"depolarized\" because of its behavior in an analyzer. ''After'' Fresnel, the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of amplitudes and a fixed difference in phase. By that definition, elliptically or circularly polarized light is ''fully'' polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone.<ref>Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}232.</ref> The conceptual gap between the wave theory and selectionism had widened again.\n\n==== Total internal reflection (1817\u201323) ====\n\n[[File:Fresnel rhomb linear to elliptical.svg|thumb|305px|Cross-section of a Fresnel rhomb (blue) with graphs showing the ''p'' component of vibration (''parallel'' to the ''plane'' of incidence) on the vertical axis, vs. the ''s'' component (''square'' to the plane of incidence and parallel to the ''surface'') on the horizontal axis. If the incoming light is ''linearly'' polarized, the two components are in phase (top&nbsp;graph). After one reflection at the appropriate angle, the ''p'' component is advanced by 1/8 of a cycle relative to the ''s'' component (middle&nbsp;graph). After two such reflections, the phase difference is 1/4 of a cycle (bottom&nbsp;graph), so that the polarization is ''elliptical'' with axes in the ''s''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''p'' directions. If the ''s''&nbsp;and&nbsp;''p'' components were initially of equal magnitude, the initial polarization (top&nbsp;graph) would be at 45\u00b0 to the plane of incidence, and the final polarization (bottom&nbsp;graph) would be ''circular''.]]\n\nBy 1817 it had been discovered by Brewster,{{r|brewster-1817}} but not adequately reported,<ref>Lloyd, 1834, p.{{hsp}}368.</ref>{{r|young-1818|p=324}} that plane-polarized light was partly depolarized by total internal reflection if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence. Fresnel rediscovered this effect and investigated it by including total internal reflection in a chromatic-polarization experiment. With the aid of his ''first'' theory of chromatic polarization, he found that the apparently depolarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}207.</ref> Choosing an appropriate angle of incidence (not yet exactly specified) gave a phase difference of 1/8 of a cycle (45\u00b0). Two such reflections from the \"parallel faces\" of \"two coupled [[prism]]s\" gave a phase difference of 1/4 of a cycle (90\u00b0). These findings were contained in a memoir submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie on 10 November 1817 and read a fortnight later. An undated marginal note indicates that the two coupled prisms were later replaced by a single \"parallelepiped in glass\" \u2014 now known as a ''[[Fresnel rhomb]]''.{{r|fresnel-1817}}\n\nThis was the memoir whose \"supplement\",{{r|fresnel-1818b}} dated January 1818, contained the method of superposing sinusoidal functions and the restatement of Malus's law in terms of amplitudes. In the same supplement, Fresnel reported his discovery that optical rotation could be imitated by passing the polarized light through a Fresnel rhomb (still in the form of \"coupled prisms\"), followed by an ordinary birefringent lamina sliced parallel to its axis, with the axis at 45\u00b0 to the plane of reflection of the Fresnel rhomb, followed by a second Fresnel rhomb at 90\u00b0 to the first.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}223,{{hsp}}336; on the latter page, a \"prism\" means a Fresnel rhomb or equivalent.</ref> In a further memoir read on 30 March,{{r|fresnel-1818d}} Fresnel reported that if polarized light was fully \"depolarized\" by a Fresnel rhomb \u2014 now described as a parallelepiped \u2014 its properties were not further modified by a subsequent passage through an optically rotating medium or device.\n\nThe connection between optical rotation and birefringence was further explained in 1822, in the memoir on elliptical and circular polarization.{{r|fresnel-1822z}} This was followed by the memoir on reflection, read in January 1823, in which Fresnel quantified the phase shifts in total internal reflection, and thence calculated the precise angle at which a Fresnel rhomb should be cut in order to convert linear polarization to circular polarization. For a refractive index of 1.51, there were two solutions: about 48.6\u00b0 and 54.6\u00b0.{{r|fresnel-1823a|p=760}}\n\n=== Double refraction ===\n\n==== Background: Uniaxial and biaxial crystals; Biot's laws ====\n\nWhen light passes through a slice of calcite cut perpendicular to its optic axis, the difference between the propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves has a second-order dependence on the angle of incidence. If the slice is observed in a highly convergent cone of light, that dependence becomes significant, so that a chromatic-polarization experiment will show a pattern of concentric rings. But most minerals, when observed in this manner, show a more complicated pattern of rings involving two foci and a [[lemniscate]] curve, as if they had ''two'' optic axes.<ref>Jenkins & White, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}576\u20139 (\u00a7{{hsp}}27.9, esp. Fig.{{hsp}}27M).</ref>{{r|derochette-2004}} The two classes of minerals naturally become known as ''uniaxal'' and ''biaxal'' \u2014 or, in later literature, ''uniaxial'' and ''biaxial''.\n\nIn 1813, Brewster observed the simple concentric pattern in \"[[beryl]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]] &c.\" The same pattern was later observed in calcite by [[William Hyde Wollaston|Wollaston]], Biot, and [[Thomas Johann Seebeck|Seebeck]].&nbsp; Biot, assuming that the concentric pattern was the general case, tried to calculate the colors with his theory of chromatic polarization, and succeeded better for some minerals than for others. In&nbsp;1818, Brewster belatedly explained why: seven of the twelve minerals employed by Biot had the lemniscate pattern, which Brewster had observed as early as 1812; and the minerals with the more complicated rings also had a more complicated law of refraction.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}254\u20135,{{tsp}}402.</ref>\n\nIn a uniform crystal, according to Huygens' theory, the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time is the ''ray-velocity surface'' \u2014 that is, the surface whose \"distance\" from the origin in any direction is the ray velocity in that direction. In calcite, this surface is two-sheeted, consisting of a sphere (for the ordinary wave) and an oblate spheroid (for the extraordinary wave) touching each other at opposite points of a common axis \u2014 touching at the north and south poles, if we may use a geographic analogy. But according to Malus's ''corpuscular'' theory of double refraction, the ray velocity was proportional to the reciprocal of that given by Huygens' theory, in which case the velocity law was of the form\n\n::<math>v_o^{2\\!}-v_e^2 = k\\sin^2\\theta \\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>v_o</math> and <math>v_e</math> were the ordinary and extraordinary ray velocities ''according to the corpuscular theory'', and <math>\\theta</math> was the angle between the ray and the optic axis.<ref>Cf. Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}269.</ref> By Malus's definition, the plane of polarization of a ray was the plane of the ray and the optic axis if the ray was ordinary, or the perpendicular plane (containing the ray) if the ray was extraordinary. In Fresnel's model, the direction of vibration was normal to the plane of polarization. Hence, for the sphere (the ordinary wave), the vibration was along the lines of latitude (continuing the geographic analogy); and for the spheroid (the extraordinary wave), the vibration was along the lines of longitude.\n\nOn 29 March 1819,<ref>Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{hsp}}885.</ref> Biot presented a memoir in which he proposed simple generalizations of Malus's rules for a crystal with ''two'' axes, and reported that both generalizations seemed to be confirmed by experiment. For the velocity law, the squared sine was replaced by the ''product'' of the sines of the angles from the ray to the two axes (''Biot's sine law''). And for the polarization of the ordinary ray, the plane of the ray and the axis was replaced by the plane bisecting the [[dihedral angle]] between the two planes each of which contained the ray and one axis (''Biot's dihedral law'').<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}269,{{hsp}}418. It appears that the dihedral law was also proposed separately at an earlier date (p.{{hsp}}459, ref.{{tsp}}1817).</ref>{{r|biot-1820}} Biot's laws meant that a biaxial crystal with axes at a small angle, cleaved in the plane of those axes, behaved nearly like a uniaxial crystal at near-normal incidence; this was fortunate because [[gypsum]], which had been used in chromatic-polarization experiments, is biaxial.<ref>Cf.{{tsp}} Fresnel, 1822a, tr.&nbsp;Young, in ''Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and Art'',{{tsp}} Jul.\u2013{{hsp}}Dec.{{tsp}}1828, at pp.{{tsp}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=N69MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA178 178\u20139].</ref>\n\n==== First memoir and supplements (1821\u201322) ====\n\nUntil Fresnel turned his attention to biaxial birefringence, it was assumed that one of the two refractions was ordinary, even in biaxial crystals.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}260.</ref> But, in a memoir submitted{{hsp}}<ref>In Fresnel's collected works (1866\u201370), a paper is said to have been \"presented\" (\"''pr\u00e9sent\u00e9''\") if it was merely delivered to the Permanent Secretary of the Acad\u00e9mie for witnessing or processing (cf. vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}487; vol.{{tsp}}2, pp.{{tsp}}261,{{hsp}}308). In such cases this article prefers the generic word \"submitted\", to avoid the impression that the paper had a formal reading.</ref> on 19 November 1821,<ref>Printed in Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}2, pp.{{tsp}}261\u2013308.</ref> Fresnel reported two experiments on [[topaz]] showing that ''neither refraction'' was ordinary in the sense of satisfying Snell's law; that is, neither ray was the product of spherical secondary waves.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}261\u20137.</ref>\n\nThe same memoir contained Fresnel's first attempt at the biaxial velocity law. For calcite, if we interchange the equatorial and polar radii of Huygens' oblate spheroid while preserving the polar direction, we obtain a ''prolate'' spheroid touching the sphere at the equator. A&nbsp;plane through the center/origin cuts this prolate spheroid in an ellipse whose major and minor semi-axes give the magnitudes of the extraordinary and ordinary ray velocities in the direction normal to the plane, and (said Fresnel) the directions of their respective vibrations. The direction of the optic axis is the normal to the plane for which the ellipse of intersection reduces to a ''circle''. So, for the biaxial case, Fresnel simply replaced the prolate spheroid with a triaxial [[ellipsoid]], which he called the \"ellipsoid of elasticity\", to be sectioned by a plane in the same way. In general there would be ''two'' planes passing through the center of the ellipsoid and cutting it in a circle, and the normals to these planes would give ''two'' optic axes. From the geometry, Fresnel deduced Biot's sine law (with the ray velocities replaced by their reciprocals).<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}268\u201372.</ref>\n\nThe \"ellipsoid of elasticity\" indeed gave the correct ray velocities, although the initial experimental verification was only approximate. But it did not give the correct directions of vibration, for the biaxial case or even for the uniaxial case, because the vibrations in Fresnel's model were tangential to the wavefront, which is ''not'' generally normal to the ray (for an extraordinary ray). This mistake was corrected in an \"extract\" that Fresnel read to the Acad\u00e9mie a week later, on 26 November. Starting with Huygens' spheroid, Fresnel obtained the 4th-degree \"surface of elasticity\" which, when sectioned by a plane as above, would yield the ''wave-normal velocities'' for a wavefront in that plane, together with their vibration directions. For the biaxial case, he generalized the surface to allow three unequal principal dimensions. But he retained the former \"ellipsoid of elasticity\" as an approximation, from which he deduced Biot's dihedral law.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}274\u20139.</ref>\n\nFresnel's initial derivation of the \"surface of elasticity\" had been purely geometric, and not deductively rigorous. His first attempt at a ''mechanical'' derivation, contained in a \"supplement\" dated 13 January 1822, assumed that (i)&nbsp;there were three mutually perpendicular directions in which a displacement produced a reaction in the same direction, (ii)&nbsp;the reaction was otherwise a linear function of the displacement, and (iii)&nbsp;the radius of the surface in any direction was the square root of the component, ''in that direction'', of the reaction to a unit displacement in that direction. The last assumption recognized the requirement that if a wave was to maintain a fixed direction of propagation and a fixed direction of vibration, the reaction must not be outside the plane of those two directions.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}279\u201380.</ref>\n\nIn the same supplement, Fresnel considered how he might find, for the biaxial case, the secondary wavefront that expands from the origin in unit time \u2014 that is, the surface that reduces to Huygens' sphere and spheroid in the uniaxial case. He noted that this \"wave surface\" (''surface de l'onde'') is tangential to all possible plane wavefronts that could have crossed the origin one unit of time ago, and he listed the mathematical conditions that it must satisfy.

He attended to these matters in his \"second memoir\" on double refraction, published in the ''Recueils'' of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences for 1824, which was not actually printed until late 1827, a few months after his death. Having confirmed the three perpendicular axes on which a displacement produced a parallel reaction, and thence constructed the surface of elasticity, he showed that Biot's dihedral law is exact provided that the binormals are taken as the optic axes, and the wave-normal direction as the direction of propagation.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}286\u20137,{{tsp}}447.

Acknowledging Fresnel's influence, Cauchy went on to develop the first rigorous theory of elasticity of non-isotropic solids (1827), hence the first rigorous theory of transverse waves therein (1830) \u2014 which he promptly tried to apply to optics.<ref>Grattan-Guinness, 1990, pp.{{tsp}}1003\u20139,{{tsp}}1034\u201340,{{tsp}}1043; Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{tsp}}143\u20135; Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}228.&nbsp; Grattan-Guinness offers evidence against any earlier dating of Cauchy's theories.</ref> The ensuing difficulties drove a long competitive effort to find an accurate mechanical model of the aether.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, chapter&nbsp;{{serif|V}}; Darrigol, 2012, chapter&nbsp;6; Buchwald, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}460\u201364.</ref> Fresnel's own model was not dynamically rigorous; for example, it considered only the displacement of one particle while all others were fixed, and it simply ''assumed'' that the relation between the stiffness and the wave-normal velocity was analogous to that for longitudinal [[sound]] waves.

Brewster himself immediately and correctly attributed this phenomenon to stress-induced birefringence{{hsp}}{{r|brewster-1815a|brewster-1816}} \u2014 now known as ''[[photoelasticity]]''.\n\nIn a memoir read in September 1822, Fresnel announced that he had verified Brewster's diagnosis more directly, by compressing a combination of glass prisms so severely that one could actually see a double image through it. In his experiment, Fresnel lined up seven [[Porro prism|45\u00b0-90\u00b0-45\u00b0&nbsp;prisms]], short side to short side, with their 90\u00b0&nbsp;angles pointing in alternating directions. Two half-prisms were added at the ends to make the whole assembly rectangular. The prisms were separated by thin films of [[turpentine]] (''[[Pistacia terebinthus|t\u00e9r\u00e9benthine]]'') to suppress internal reflections, allowing a clear line of sight along the row. When the four prisms with similar orientations were compressed in a [[vise]], from apex to base across the line of sight, an object viewed through the assembly produced two images with perpendicular polarizations, with an apparent spacing of 1.5{{hsp}}mm at one metre.{{r|fresnel-1822s}}<ref>Whewell, 1857, pp.{{tsp}}355\u20136.</ref>\n\nAt the end of that memoir, Fresnel predicted that one could use an analogous arrangement of prisms, without compression, to verify that optical rotation is a form of birefringence. If the prisms were cut from monocrystalline quartz with their optic axes aligned along the row, and with alternating directions of optical rotation, an object seen by looking along the common optic axis would give two images, which would seem unpolarized if viewed through an analyzer alone; but if viewed through a Fresnel rhomb, they would be polarized at \u00b145\u00b0 to the plane of reflection (because they would initially be circularly polarized in opposite directions). In the memoir of December 1822, in which he introduced the term ''circular polarization'', he reported that he had confirmed this prediction. To obtain a visible separation of the images, he needed only one 14\u00b0-152\u00b0-14\u00b0 prism and two half-prisms; he merely remarked in passing that one could increase the separation by increasing the number of prisms.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}737\u20139.&nbsp; Cf.&nbsp;Whewell, 1857, p.{{hsp}}356\u20138; Jenkins & White, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}589\u201390.</ref>\n\n=== Reception ===\n\nFor the supplement to Riffault's translation of [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomson]]'s ''System of Chemistry'', Fresnel was chosen to contribute the article on light. The resulting 137-page essay, titled ''De la Lumi\u00e8re'' (''On Light''),<ref>Fresnel, 1822a.</ref> was apparently finished in June 1821 and published by February 1822.<ref name=gg-p884>Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{hsp}}884.</ref> With sections covering the nature of light, diffraction, thin-film interference, reflection and refraction, double refraction and polarization, chromatic polarization, and modification of polarization by reflection, it made a comprehensive case for the wave theory to a readership that was not restricted to physicists.<ref>Cf. Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}169.</ref>\n\nTo examine Fresnel's first memoir and supplements on double refraction, the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences appointed Amp\u00e8re, Arago, [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], and Poisson.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}2, pp.{{tsp}}261n,{{hsp}}369n.</ref> Their report,<ref>Printed in Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}2, pp.{{tsp}}459\u201364.</ref> of which Arago was clearly the main author,<ref name=buchwald-p288 /> was delivered at the meeting of 19 August 1822. Then, in the words of [[\u00c9mile Verdet]], as translated by [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]:\n{{quote|Immediately after the reading of the report, Laplace took the floor, and\u2026 proclaimed the exceptional importance of the work which had just been reported: he congratulated the author on his steadfastness and his sagacity which had led him to discover a law which had escaped the cleverest, and, anticipating somewhat the judgement of posterity, declared that he placed these researches above everything that had been communicated to the Acad\u00e9mie for a long time.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, pp.{{tsp}}lxxxvi\u2013lxxxvii; Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{hsp}}896.</ref>}}\nWhether Laplace was announcing his conversion to the wave theory \u2014 at the age of 73 \u2014 is uncertain. Grattan-Guinness entertained the idea.<ref>Grattan-Guinness, 1990, p.{{hsp}}898.</ref> Buchwald, noting that Arago failed to explain that the \"ellipsoid of elasticity\" did not give the correct planes of polarization, suggests that Laplace may have merely regarded Fresnel's theory as a successful generalization of Malus's ray-velocity law, embracing Biot's laws.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}289\u201390.</ref>\n\nIn the following year, Poisson, who did not sign Arago's report, disputed the possibility of transverse waves in the aether. Starting from assumed equations of motion of a fluid medium, he noted that they did not give the correct results for partial reflection and double refraction \u2014 as if that were Fresnel's problem rather than his own \u2014 and that the predicted waves, even if they were initially transverse, became more longitudinal as they propagated. In reply Fresnel noted, ''inter alia'', that the equations in which Poisson put so much faith did not even predict [[viscosity]]. The implication was clear: given that the behavior of light had not been satisfactorily explained except by transverse waves, it was not the responsibility of the wave-theorists to abandon transverse waves in deference to pre-conceived notions about the aether; rather, it was the responsibility of the aether modelers to produce a model that accommodated transverse waves.<ref>Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}170\u201371.</ref> According to Eugene Frankel, Poisson eventually accepted the wave theory in the late 1830s.<ref>Frankel, 1976, p.{{hsp}}173, citing Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}lxxxix, note{{tsp}}2.&nbsp; But cf.&nbsp;Worrall, 1989, p.{{hsp}}140.</ref>\n\nAmong the French, Poisson's reluctance was an exception. According to Frankel, \"in Paris no debate on the issue seems to have taken place after 1825. Indeed, almost the entire generation of physicists and mathematicians who came to maturity in the 1820s \u2014 Pouillet, [[F\u00e9lix Savart|Savart]], [[Gabriel Lam\u00e9|Lam\u00e9]], [[Claude-Louis Navier|Navier]], [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]], Cauchy \u2014 seem to have adopted the theory immediately.\" Fresnel's other prominent French opponent, Biot, appeared to take a neutral position in 1830, and eventually accepted the wave theory \u2014 possibly by 1846 and certainly by 1858.<ref>Frankel, 1976, pp.{{tsp}}173\u20134.</ref>\n\n[[File:Beugungsscheibchen.k.720.jpg|thumb|Airy diffraction pattern 65{{hsp}}mm from a 0.09{{hsp}}mm circular aperture illuminated by red laser light.

The resulting article by Herschel, titled simply \"Light\", was highly sympathetic to the wave theory, although not entirely free of selectionist language. It was circulating privately by 1828 and was published in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana]]'' in 1830.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}291\u20136; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}220\u201321,{{tsp}}303.</ref> Meanwhile, Young's translation of Fresnel's ''De la Lumi\u00e8re'' was published in installments from 1827 to 1829.<ref>Fresnel, 1822a; Kipnis, 1991, pp.{{tsp}}227\u20138.</ref> [[George Biddell Airy]], the former [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian Professor]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and future [[Astronomer Royal]], unreservedly accepted the wave theory by 1831.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}296.</ref> In 1834 he famously calculated the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture from the wave theory,{{r|airy-1834}} thereby explaining the limited [[angular resolution]] of a perfect [[telescope]] {{xref|(see [[Airy disk]])}}. By the end of the 1830s, the only prominent British physicist who held out against the wave theory was Brewster, whose objections included the difficulty of explaining [[photochemistry|photochemical]] effects and (in his opinion) [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]].<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}222\u20133,{{tsp}}248.</ref>\n\nA German translation of ''De la Lumi\u00e8re'' was published in installments in 1825 and 1828.

In the corpuscular system, \"every new class of facts requires a new supposition,\" whereas in the wave system, a hypothesis devised in order to explain one phenomenon is then found to explain or predict others.

Fresnel was disappointed to discover that he had again \"broken through an open door\".<ref name=levitt-p59 /> But, whereas Buffon's version was [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|biconvex]] and in one piece, Fresnel's was [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|plano-convex]] and made of multiple prisms for easier construction. With an official budget of 500 francs, Fresnel approached three manufacturers. The third, Fran\u00e7ois Soleil, found a way to remove defects by reheating and remolding the glass. Arago assisted Fresnel with the design of a modified [[Argand lamp]] with concentric wicks (a concept that Fresnel attributed to [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]{{hsp}}<ref>Fresnel, 1822b, p.{{hsp}}11.</ref>), and accidentally discovered that [[fish glue]] was heat-resistant, making it suitable for use in the lens. The prototype, with a lens panel 55{{hsp}}cm square, containing 97 polygonal (not annular) prisms, was finished in March 1820 \u2014 and so impressed the Commission that Fresnel was asked for a full eight-panel version. Completed a year later, largely at Fresnel's personal expense, this model had panels 72{{hsp}}cm square.

But the curved refracting surfaces were segments of [[toroid]]s about a common vertical axis, so that the dioptric panel looked like a cylindrical drum and the entire apparatus looked like a beehive.\n\nIn 1825 he unveiled the ''Carte des Phares'' (Lighthouse Map), calling for a system of 51 lighthouses plus smaller harbor lights, in a hierarchy of lens sizes (called ''orders'', the first order being the largest), with different characteristics to facilitate recognition: a constant light (from a fixed lens), one flash per minute (from a rotating lens with eight panels), and two per minute (sixteen panels).

The first-order [[Skerryvore]] lens, installed in 1844, was only partly catadioptric; it was similar to the Cordouan lens except that the lower slats were replaced by French-made catadioptric prisms, while mirrors were retained at the top. The first ''fully'' catadioptric first-order lens, installed at Ailly in 1852, also gave eight rotating beams plus a fixed light at the bottom; but its top section had eight catadioptric panels focusing the light about 4&nbsp;degrees ahead of the main beams, in order to lengthen the flashes. The first fully catadioptric lens with ''purely revolving'' beams \u2014 also of first order \u2014 was installed at [[Saint-Cl\u00e9ment-des-Baleines]] in 1854, and marked the completion of Fresnel's original ''Carte des Phares''.<ref>Levitt, 2013, pp.{{tsp}}108\u201310, 113\u201316.</ref>\n\n[[File:Flat flexible plastic sheet lens.JPG|thumb|Close-up view of a thin plastic Fresnel lens.]]\n\n=== Later developments ===\n\nProduction of one-piece stepped lenses (roughly as envisaged by Buffon) eventually became profitable.

Fresnel suggested instead that there was a ''microscopic'' current circulating around each particle of the magnet. In his first note, he argued that microscopic currents, unlike macroscopic currents, would explain why a hollow cylindrical magnet does not lose its magnetism when cut longitudinally. In his second note, dated 5 July 1821, he further argued that a macroscopic current had the counterfactual implication that a permanent magnet should be hot, whereas microscopic currents circulating around the molecules might avoid the heating mechanism.{{r|assis-chaib-2015|p=101\u20134}} He was not to know that the fundamental units of permanent magnetism are even smaller than molecules {{xref|(see [[Electron magnetic moment]])}}.

The manuscript was received by the publisher's agent in Paris in early September 1824, and promptly forwarded to London. But the journal failed before Fresnel's contribution could be published. Fresnel tried unsuccessfully to recover the manuscript.

In&nbsp;1818, Fresnel showed that this result could be explained by the wave theory,<ref>Cf. Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}258\u201360.</ref> on the hypothesis that if an object with refractive index <math>n</math> moved at velocity <math>v</math> relative to the external aether (taken as stationary), then the velocity of light inside the object gained the additional component <math>\\,v(1-1/n^2)</math>. He supported that hypothesis by supposing that if the density of the external aether was taken as unity, the density of the internal aether was <math>n^2</math>, of which the excess, namely <math>\\,n^2{-}1\\,</math>, was dragged along at velocity <math>v</math>, whence the ''average'' velocity of the internal aether was <math>\\,v(1-1/n^2)</math>. The factor in parentheses, which Fresnel originally expressed in terms of wavelengths,<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}2, pp.{{tsp}}627\u201336.</ref> became known as the ''Fresnel drag coefficient''. {{xref|(See [[Aether drag hypothesis]].)}}\n\nIn his analysis of double refraction, Fresnel supposed that the different refractive indices in different directions within the ''same medium'' were due to a directional variation in elasticity, not density (because the concept of mass per unit volume is not directional). But in his treatment of partial reflection, he supposed that the different refractive indices of ''different media'' were due to different aether densities, not different elasticities.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}212.</ref> The latter decision is puzzling in the context of double refraction, but makes sense in the earlier context of aether drag.\n\nIn 1846, [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]] pointed out that there was no need to divide the aether inside a moving object into two portions; all of it could be considered as moving at a common velocity. Then, if the aether was conserved while its density changed in proportion to <math>n^2</math>, the resulting velocity of the aether inside the object was equal to Fresnel's additional velocity component.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, p.{{hsp}}117.</ref>{{r|stokes-1846}}\n\nConversely, Fresnel could have started with the required additional velocity component, equated it to aether drag, combined that with conservation of aether, and arrived at the relation between refractive index and aether density, thereby justifying his choice in the case of partial reflection.\n\n=== Dispersion ===\n\nThe analogy between light waves and transverse waves in elastic solids does not predict ''[[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]'' \u2014 that is, the frequency-dependence of the speed of propagation, which enables [[dispersive prism|prisms]] to produce spectra and causes lenses to suffer from [[chromatic aberration]]. Fresnel, in ''De la Lumi\u00e8re'' and in the second supplement to his first memoir on double refraction, suggested that dispersion could be accounted for if the particles of the medium exerted forces on each other over distances that were significant fractions of a wavelength.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}246; Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{tsp}}307\u20138;{{tsp}} Fresnel, 1822a, tr.&nbsp;Young, in ''Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and Art'',{{tsp}} Jan.\u2013{{hsp}}Jun.{{tsp}}1828, at pp.{{tsp}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=SbJMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA213 213\u201315].&nbsp; Whittaker, 1910, p.{{hsp}}132; Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}2, p.{{hsp}}438.</ref> Later, more than once, Fresnel referred to the demonstration of this result as being contained in a note appended to his second memoir on double refraction. But no such note appeared in print,<ref>Lloyd, 1834, p.{{hsp}}316.</ref> and the relevant manuscripts found after his death showed only that, around 1824, he was comparing refractive indices (measured by Fraunhofer) with a theoretical formula, the meaning of which was not fully explained.<ref>Fresnel, 1866\u201370, vol.{{tsp}}1, p.{{hsp}}xcvi.</ref> One obvious possibility is that the explanation of the formula was given in the appended note, which should be counted as another lost work.\n\nIn the 1830s, Fresnel's suggestion was taken up by Cauchy, [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Powell]], and [[Philip Kelland|Kelland]], and it was indeed found to be tolerably consistent with the variation of refractive indices with wavelength over the [[visible spectrum]], for a variety of transparent media {{xref|(see [[Cauchy's equation]])}}.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{tsp}}182\u20133; Whewell, 1857, pp.{{tsp}}365\u20137; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{tsp}}246\u20139.</ref> These investigations were enough to show that the wave theory was at least ''compatible'' with dispersion. However, if the model of dispersion was to be accurate over a wider range of frequencies, it needed to be modified so as to take account of resonances within the medium {{xref|(see [[Sellmeier equation]])}}.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{hsp}}252.</ref>\n\n=== Conical refraction ===\n\nThe analytical complexity of Fresnel's derivation of the ray-velocity surface was an implicit challenge to find a shorter path to the result. This was answered by MacCullagh in 1830, and by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1832.<ref>Lloyd, 1834, pp.{{tsp}}387\u20138.</ref>{{r|macCullagh-1830|hamilton-1832}}\n\nHamilton went further, establishing two properties of the surface that Fresnel, in the short time given to him, had overlooked: (i)&nbsp;at each of the four points where the inner and outer sheets of the surface make contact, the surface has a tangent cone (tangential to both sheets), hence a cone of normals, indicating that a cone of wave-normal directions corresponds to a single ray-velocity vector; and (ii)&nbsp;around each of these points, the outer sheet has a circle of contact with a tangent plane, indicating that a cone of ray directions corresponds to a single wave-normal velocity vector. As Hamilton noted, these properties respectively imply that (i)&nbsp;a&nbsp;narrow beam propagating inside the crystal in the direction of the single ray velocity will, on exiting the crystal through a flat surface, break into a hollow cone (''external conical refraction''), and (ii)&nbsp;a&nbsp;narrow beam striking a flat surface of the crystal in the appropriate direction (corresponding to that of the single internal wave-normal velocity) will, on entering the crystal, break into a hollow cone (''internal conical refraction'').<ref>Lloyd, 1834, p.{{hsp}}389.</ref>{{r|hamilton-1832}}\n\nThus a new pair of phenomena, ''qualitatively'' different from anything previously observed or suspected, had been predicted by mathematics as consequences of Fresnel's theory. The prompt experimental confirmation of those predictions by [[Humphrey Lloyd (physicist)|Humphrey Lloyd]]{{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1833}} brought Hamilton a prize that had never come to Fresnel: immediate fame.{{r|lunney-weaire-2006|oHara-1982}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n[[File:Cordouan6.jpg|thumb|The lantern room of the [[Cordouan Lighthouse]], in which the first Fresnel lens entered service in 1823.

Whereas [[Albert Einstein]] described Maxwell's work as \"the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton,\"{{hsp}}{{r|jamesCMF}} commentators of the era between Fresnel and Maxwell made similarly strong statements about Fresnel:\n\n* MacCullagh, as early as 1830, wrote that Fresnel's mechanical theory of double refraction \"would do honour to the sagacity of Newton\".{{r|macCullagh-1830|p=78}}\n<!-- These dot-points are spaced because they include blockquotes. -->\n\n* Lloyd, in his ''Report on the progress and present state of physical optics'' (1834) for the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]], surveyed previous knowledge of double refraction and declared:<blockquote>The theory of Fresnel to which I now proceed,\u2014 and which not only embraces all the known phenomena, but has even outstripped observation, and predicted consequences which were afterwards fully verified,\u2014 will, I am persuaded, be regarded as the finest generalization in physical science which has been made since the discovery of universal gravitation.<ref>Lloyd, 1834, p.{{hsp}}382.</ref></blockquote>In 1841 Lloyd published his ''Lectures on the Wave-theory of Light'', in which he described Fresnel's transverse-wave theory as \"the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science, Newton's system of the universe alone excepted.\"{{hsp}}{{r|lloyd-1841}}\n<!-- These dot-points are spaced because they include blockquotes. -->\n\n* [[William Whewell]], in all three editions of his ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' (1837, 1847, and 1857), at the end of Book&nbsp;{{serif|IX}}, compared the histories of physical astronomy and physical optics and concluded:\n{{quote|It would, perhaps, be too fanciful to attempt to establish a parallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two histories. If we were to do this, we must consider [[Christiaan Huygens|Huyghens]] and [[Robert Hooke|Hooke]] as standing in the place of [[Copernicus]], since, like him, they announced the true theory, but left it to a future age to give it development and mechanical confirmation; [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus|Malus]] and [[David Brewster|Brewster]], grouping them together, correspond to [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], laborious in accumulating observations, inventive and happy in discovering laws of phenomena; and Young and Fresnel combined, make up the Newton of optical science.<ref>Whewell, 1857, pp.{{tsp}}370\u201371.</ref>}}\n\nWhat Whewell called the \"true theory\" has since undergone two major revisions. The first, by Maxwell, specified the physical fields whose variations constitute the waves of light. The second, initiated by Einstein's explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]], supposed that the energy of light waves was divided into [[quantum|quanta]], which were eventually identified with particles called [[photon]]s. But photons did not exactly correspond to Newton's corpuscles; for example, Newton's explanation of ordinary refraction required the corpuscles to travel faster in media of higher refractive index, which photons do not. Neither did photons displace waves; rather, they led to the paradox of [[wave\u2013particle duality]].\n\nAlthough Fresnel did not know that light waves are electromagnetic, he managed to construct the world's first coherent theory of light. In retrospect, this shows that his methods are applicable to multiple types of waves. And although light is now known to have both wavelike and particle-like aspects, the phenomena studied by Fresnel are still most easily explained in terms of waves. In these respects, his edifice still stands.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n*[[Birefringence]]\n*[[Circular polarization]]\n*[[Diffraction]]\n*[[Elliptical polarization]]\n*[[Fresnel (unit of frequency)]]\n*[[Fresnel\u2013Arago laws]]\n*[[Fresnel equations]]\n*[[Fresnel imager]]\n*[[Fresnel integral]]\n*[[Fresnel lantern]]\n*[[Fresnel lens]]\n*[[Fresnel number]]\n*[[Fresnel rhomb]]\n*[[Fresnel zone]]\n*[[Fresnel zone antenna]]\n*Fresnel [[zone plate]]\n*[[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]]\n*[[Linear polarization]]\n*[[Optical rotation]]\n*[[Phasor]]\n*[[Physical optics]]\n*[[Arago spot|Poisson's{{hsp}}/Arago's spot]]\n*[[polarization (waves)|Polarization]]\n*[[Ridged mirror]]\n}}\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=academie>Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, [http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Fresnel/Fresnel_oeuvre.htm \"Augustin Fresnel\"], accessed 21 August 2017; [https://web.archive.org/web/20170215201835/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Fresnel/Fresnel_oeuvre.htm archived] 15 February 2017.</ref>\n\n<ref name=academie-hist>Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, [http://www.academie-sciences.fr/en/Histoire-de-l-Academie-des-sciences/history-of-the-french-academie-des-sciences.html \"History of the French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\"], accessed 8 December 2017; [https://web.archive.org/web/20170813034716/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/en/Histoire-de-l-Academie-des-sciences/history-of-the-french-academie-des-sciences.html archived] 13 August 2017.</ref>\n\n<ref name=academie-pv6>Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, ''Proces-verbaux des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie tenues depuis la fondation de l'Institut jusqu'au mois d'ao\u00fbt 1835'', [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3299b vol.{{tsp}}{{serif|VI}}] (for&nbsp;1816\u201319), Hendaye, Basses Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: Imprimerie de l'Observatoire d'Abbadia, 1915.</ref>\n\n<ref name=airy-1834>G.B.

The [[office]] may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is [[abbess]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe title had its origin in the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], spread through the eastern [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the designation of the head of a monastery. The word is derived from the [[Aramaic]] ''av'' meaning \"father\" or ''abba'', meaning \"my father\". In the [[Septuagint]], it was written as \"abbas\".<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|last= |first= |authorlink= |editor-first= |editor-last= |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|title=Abbey Austin|edition=15th |year=2010| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A\u2013Ak&nbsp;\u2013 Bayes|location= Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=12}}</ref> At first it was employed as a respectful title for any monk, but it was soon restricted by [[canon law]] to certain priestly superiors. At times it was applied to various priests, e.g. at the court of the Frankish monarchy the ''Abbas palatinus'' (\"of the palace\"') and ''Abbas castrensis'' (\"of the camp\") were chaplains to the Merovingian and Carolingian sovereigns\u2019 court and army respectively. The title abbot came into fairly general use in western [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[order (religious)|orders]] whose members include priests.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n==Monastic history==\n[[File:StPakhom.jpg|thumb|[[Copt]]ic [[icon]] of St. [[Pachomius]], the founder of [[cenobitic]] [[monasticism]].]]\n[[File:Bendeikt von Nursia in Muensterschwazach.jpg|thumb|Carving of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]], holding an abbot's [[crozier]] and his [[Rule of St. Benedict|Rule for Monasteries]] (M\u00fcnsterschwarzach, Germany).]]\n[[File:Abbatia CIST Sbernadiensis 27a.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Thomas Schoen]], abbot at Bornem Abbey]]\n[[File:Erzabt Ildefons Schober OSB.JPG|thumb|Benedictine Abbot Schober in Prelate Dress and [[Cappa Magna]]]]\nAn abbot (from [[Old English]] ''abbod'', ''abbad'', from [[Latin]] ''abbas'' (\u201cfather\u201d), from [[Ancient Greek]] ''\u1f00\u03b2\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c2'' (abbas), from Aramaic ''\u0710\u0712\u0710''/''\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0'' (\u2019abb\u0101, \u201cfather\u201d); confer German ''Abt''; French ''abb\u00e9'') is the head and chief governor of a community of monks, called also in the East ''[[hegumen]]'' or ''[[archimandrite]]''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} The English version for a female monastic head is [[abbess]].\n\n===Early history===\nIn [[Egypt]], the first home of monasticism, the jurisdiction of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint [[John Cassian]] speaks of an abbot of the [[Thebaid]] who had 500 monks under him. By the [[Rule of St Benedict]], which, until the [[Cluniac reforms]], was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; but it was not until the foundation of the [[Abbey of Cluny|Cluniac]] Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over all the houses of an order, was definitely recognised.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nMonks, as a rule, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. For the reception of the [[sacrament]]s, and for other religious offices, the abbot and his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church. This rule proved inconvenient when a monastery was situated in a desert or at a distance from a city, and necessity compelled the [[ordination]] of some monks. This innovation was not introduced without a struggle, [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher [[spirituality|spiritual]] life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East, abbots seem almost universally to have become [[deacon]]s, if not priests. The change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century. The ecclesiastical leadership exercised by abbots despite their frequent lay status is proved by their attendance and votes at ecclesiastical councils. Thus at the [[first Council of Constantinople]], AD 448, 23 [[archimandrite]]s or abbots sign, with 30 [[bishop]]s.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe [[second Council of Nicaea]], AD 787, recognized the right of abbots to ordain their monks to the inferior orders{{sfn|Venables|1911}} below the [[deacon|diaconate]], a power usually reserved to bishops.\n\nAbbots used to be subject to [[bishop|episcopal]] jurisdiction, and continued generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The [[Code of Justinian]] (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an ''imperium in imperio,'' and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his [[diocese]].{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\n{{main|Mitre#Christian clergy|l1=Mitres}}\nIn the 12th century, the abbots of [[Fulda monastery|Fulda]] claimed precedence of the [[archdiocese of Cologne|archbishop of Cologne]]. Abbots more and more assumed almost episcopal state, and in defiance of the prohibition of early councils and the protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of [[mitre]], ring, gloves and sandals.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nIt has been maintained that the right to wear mitres was sometimes granted by the popes to abbots before the 11th century, but the documents on which this claim is based are not genuine (J. Braun, ''Liturgische Gewandung'', p.&nbsp;453). The first undoubted instance is the bull by which [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] in 1063 granted the use of the mitre to Egelsinus, abbot of the monastery of St Augustine at Canterbury. The mitred abbots in England were those of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], [[St Albans Abbey|St Alban's]], [[Bardney Abbey|Bardney]], [[Battle Abbey|Battle]], [[Bury St. Edmunds Abbey|Bury St Edmunds]], [[St Augustine's Abbey|St Augustine's Canterbury]], [[Colchester Abbey|Colchester]], [[Crowland Abbey|Croyland]], [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], [[Gloucester Abbey|Gloucester]], [[St Benet's Abbey|St Benet's Hulme]], [[Hyde Abbey|Hyde]], [[Malmesbury Abbey|Malmesbury]], [[Peterborough Abbey|Peterborough]], [[Ramsey Abbey|Ramsey]], [[Reading Abbey|Reading]], [[Selby Abbey|Selby]], [[Shrewsbury Abbey|Shrewsbury]], [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], [[Thorney Abbey|Thorney]], [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]], [[Winchcombe Abbey|Winchcombe]], and [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's York]].<ref>[http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/361/361-03.htm#ecclmap Government in Church and State] from ''University of Wisconsin-Madison'' retrieved 15 June 2013</ref> Of these the precedence was yielded to the abbot of Glastonbury, until in AD 1154 [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] (Nicholas Breakspear) granted it to the abbot of St Alban's, in which monastery he had been brought up.

In the East abbots, if in priests' orders and with the consent of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the [[Second Council of Nicaea|second Nicene council]], AD 787, to confer the [[tonsure]] and admit to the order of reader; but gradually abbots, in the West also, advanced higher claims, until we find them in AD 1489 permitted by [[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]] to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate.  Of course, they always and everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks and vesting them with the religious habit.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nThe power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the [[canon law]].  One of the main goals of monasticism was the purgation of self and selfishness, and obedience was seen as a path to that perfection. It was sacred duty to execute the abbot's orders, and even to act without his orders was sometimes considered a transgression. Examples among the Egyptian monks of this submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as a goal, are detailed by Cassian and others, e.g. a monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavoring to remove a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}<!-- but paragraph lower down in EB1911-->\n\n====Appointments====\nWhen a vacancy occurred, the bishop of the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the [[abbey|convent]], but the right of election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new abbot. In [[abbey]]s exempt from the (arch)bishop's diocesan jurisdiction, the confirmation and [[benediction]] had to be conferred by the pope in person, the house being taxed with the expenses of the new abbot's journey to [[Rome]]. It was necessary that an abbot should be at least 30 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house for at least 10 years,<ref name=EB/> unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience.{{sfn|Venables|1911}} In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor. Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the pope had usurped the nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Cluny, Premontr\u00e9 and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life, unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or when he was directly subject to them, by the pope or the bishop, and also in England it was for a term of 8\u201312 years.<ref name=EB/>\n\nThe ceremony of the formal admission of a [[Benedictine]] abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the [[Consuetudinary (book)|consuetudinary]] of Abingdon.  The newly elected abbot was to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession.  After proceeding up the [[nave]], he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his [[commissary]], and placed in his stall.  The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his [[staff of office]].  He then put on his shoes in the [[vestry]], and a [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n==General information==\nBefore the late modern era, the abbot was treated with the utmost reverence by the brethren of his house.  When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and bowed.  His letters were received kneeling, as were those of the pope and the king.  No monk might sit in his presence, or leave it without his permission, reflecting the hierarchical etiquette of families and society.  The highest place was assigned to him, both in church and at table.  In the East he was commanded to eat with the other monks.  In the West the [[Rule of St Benedict]] appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and strangers.  Because this permission opened the door to luxurious living, [[Synods of Aachen (816\u2013819)]], decreed that the abbot should dine in the [[refectory]], and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of the abbots.  When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his [[chaplain]]s waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the Rule of St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels, slanderous talk and idle gossiping.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[File:Template-Abbot - Provost.svg|right|thumb|Arms of a Roman Catholic abbot are distinguished by a gold [[crozier]] with a veil attached and a black [[galero]] with twelve tassels (the galero of a [[territorial abbot]] would be green)]]\nThe ordinary attire of the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the 10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of abbots dressing in silk, and adopting sumptuous attire.  Some even laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular dress. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords, chiefly distinguished from lay lords by [[clerical celibacy|celibacy]].  Thus we hear of abbots going out to hunt, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs and huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of [[Leicester]], c. 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in hare hunting.  In magnificence of equipage and [[retinue]] the abbots vied with the first nobles of the realm.  They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, followed by an immense train of attendants.  The bells of the churches were rung as they passed.  They associated on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their pleasures and pursuits.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}  This rank and power was, however, often used most beneficially.  For instance, we read of Whiting, the last abbot of [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]], judicially murdered by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], that his house was a kind of well-ordered court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a lesser rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance and officers were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a week. He had his country houses and fisheries, and when he travelled to attend parliament his retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons.  The [[abbots of Cluny]] and [[Trinity Abbey, Vend\u00f4me|Vend\u00f4me]] were, by virtue of their office, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]]s of the Roman church.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nIn the process of time, the title abbot was extended to [[clergy#Catholic clergy|clerics]] who had no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of parochial clergy; and under the [[Charlemagne|Carolingians]] to the chief chaplain of the king, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Curiae}}'', or military chaplain of the emperor, ''{{lang|la|Abbas Castrensis.}}'' It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials.  Thus the chief magistrate of the republic at [[Genoa]] was called ''{{lang|la|Abbas Populi}}''.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[Lay abbot]]s (M. Lat. ''{{lang|la|defensores}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbacomites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates laici}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates milites}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbates saeculares}}'' or ''{{lang|la|irreligiosi}}'', ''{{lang|la|abbatiarii}}'', or sometimes simply ''{{lang|la|abbates}}'') were the outcome of the growth of the [[Feudalism|feudal]] system from the 8th century onwards.  The practice of [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]], by which\u2014to meet a contemporary emergency\u2014the revenues of the community were handed over to a lay lord, in return for his protection,\nearly suggested to the emperors and kings the expedient of rewarding their warriors with rich abbeys held ''in [[commendam]].''{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nDuring the Carolingian epoch, the custom grew up of granting these as regular heritable [[fiefdom|fiefs]] or [[benefice]]s, and by the 10th century, before the great [[Cluniac]] reform, the system was firmly established. Even the [[Saint Denis Basilica|abbey of St Denis]] was held in commendam by [[Hugh Capet]]. The example of the kings was followed by the feudal nobles, sometimes by making a temporary concession permanent, sometimes without any form of commendation whatever.  In England the abuse was rife in the 8th century, as may be gathered from the acts of the [[council of Cloveshoe]].  These lay abbacies were not merely a question of overlordship, but implied the concentration in lay hands of all the rights, immunities and jurisdiction of the foundations, i.e. the more or less complete secularization of spiritual institutions.  The lay abbot took his recognized rank in the feudal hierarchy, and was free to dispose of his fief as in the case of any other.  The [[enfeoffment]] of abbeys differed in form and degree.  Sometimes the monks were directly subject to the lay abbot; sometimes he appointed a substitute to perform the spiritual functions, known usually as [[dean (religion)|dean]] (decanus), but also as abbot (''abbas legitimas'', ''monasticus'', ''regularis'').{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\nWhen the great reform of the 11th century had put an end to the direct jurisdiction of the lay abbots, the honorary title of abbot continued to be held by certain of the great feudal families, as late as the 13th century and later, with the head of the community retaining the title of dean.  The connection of the lesser lay abbots with the abbeys, especially in the south of France, lasted longer; and certain feudal families retained the title of abbes chevaliers (abbates milltes) for centuries, together with certain rights over the abbey lands or revenues. The abuse was not confined to the West.  John, [[patriarch of Antioch]], at the beginning of the 12th Century, informs us that in his time most monasteries had been handed over to laymen, ''bencficiarii,'' for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.{{sfn|Venables|1911}}\n\n[[Giraldus Cambrensis]] reported (''Itinerary'', ii.iv) the common customs of lay abbots in the late 12th-century Church of Wales:\n{{quote|for a bad custom has prevailed amongst the clergy, of appointing the most powerful people of a parish stewards, or, rather, patrons, of their churches; who, in process of time, from a desire of gain, have usurped the whole right, appropriating to their own use the possession of all the lands, leaving only to the clergy the altars, with their tenths and oblations, and assigning even these to their sons and relations in the church. Such defenders, or rather destroyers, of the church, have caused themselves to be called abbots, and presumed to attribute to themselves a title, as well as estates, to which they have no just claim.}}\n\nIn conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a [[prior]].\n\n==Modern practices==\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, abbots continue to be elected by the monks of an abbey to lead them as their religious superior in those orders and monasteries that make use of the term (some orders of monks, as the [[Carthusians]] for instance, have no abbots, only [[prior]]s). A monastery must have been granted the status of an abbey by the pope,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and such monasteries are normally raised to this level after showing a degree of stability\u2014a certain number of monks in vows, a certain number of years of establishment, a certain firmness to the foundation in economic, vocational and legal aspects. Prior to this, the monastery would be a mere priory, headed by a prior who acts as superior but without the same degree of legal authority that an abbot has.\n\n[[File:Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi.jpg|thumb|220px|Abbot Francis Michael and Prior Anthony Delisi (on the left) of [[Monastery of the Holy Spirit]], a [[Trappist]] monastery in [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers]], Georgia, US.]]\nThe abbot is chosen by the monks from among the fully professed monks. Once chosen, he must request blessing: the blessing of an abbot is celebrated by the bishop in whose diocese the monastery is or, with his permission, another abbot or bishop. The ceremony of such a blessing is similar in some aspects to the consecration of a bishop, with the new abbot being presented with the [[mitre]], the ring, and the [[crosier]] as symbols of office and receiving the laying on of hands and blessing from the celebrant. Though the ceremony installs the new abbot into a position of legal authority, it does not confer further sacramental authority- it is not a further degree of Holy Orders (although some abbots have been ordained to the episcopacy).\n\nOnce he has received this blessing, the abbot not only becomes father of his monks in a spiritual sense, but their major superior under canon law, and has the additional authority to confer the ministries of acolyte and lector (formerly, he could confer the minor orders, which are not sacraments, that these ministries have replaced). The abbey is a species of \"exempt religious\" in that it is, for the most part, answerable to the pope, or to the abbot primate, rather than to the local bishop.\n\nThe abbot wears the same habit as his fellow monks, though by tradition he adds to it a pectoral cross.\n\n[[Territorial abbot]]s follow all of the above, but in addition must receive a mandate of authority from the pope over the territory around the monastery for which they are responsible.\n\n==Abbatial hierarchy==\nIn some monastic families, there is a hierarchy of precedence or authority among abbots. In some cases, this is the result of an abbey being considered the \"mother\" of several \"daughter\" abbeys founded  as dependent priories of the \"mother.\" In other cases, abbeys have affiliated in networks known as \"congregations.\" Some monastic families recognize one abbey as the motherhouse of the entire order.\n\n* The abbot of [[Sant'Anselmo]] di Aventino, in Rome, is styled the \"abbot primate,\" and is acknowledged the senior abbot for the Order of St. Benedict (O.S.B.)\n* An abbot president is the head of a congregation (federation) of abbeys within the Order of St. Benedict (for instance, the English Congregation, The American Cassinese Congregation, etc.), or of the Cistercians (O. Cist.)\n* An archabbot is the head of some monasteries which are the motherhouses of other monasteries (for instance, [[Saint Vincent Archabbey]], [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], Pennsylvania)\n* [[Mauro-Giuseppe Lepori]] O. Cist. is the current Abbot General of the Cistercians of the Common Observance.\n\n==Modern abbots not as superior==\nThe title [[abb\u00e9]] (French; Ital. ''abate''), as commonly used in the Catholic Church on the European continent, is the equivalent of the English \"Father\" (parallel etymology), being loosely applied to all who have received the [[tonsure]].  This use of the title is said to have originated in the right conceded to the king of France, by the [[concordat]] between [[Pope Leo X]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1516), to appoint ''abb\u00e9s commendataires'' to most of the abbeys in France.  The expectation of obtaining these [[sinecure]]s drew young men towards the church in considerable numbers, and the class of abb\u00e9s so formed\u2014''abb\u00e9s de cour'' they were sometimes called, and sometimes (ironically) ''abb\u00e9s de sainte esp\u00e9rance'', (abb\u00e9s of holy hope; or the [[jeu de mots]], of St. Hope)\u2014came to hold a recognized position.  The connection many of them had with the church was of the slenderest kind, consisting mainly in adopting the title of abb\u00e9, after a remarkably moderate course of theological study, practising [[celibacy]] and wearing a distinctive dress\u2014a short dark-violet coat with narrow collar.  Being men of presumed learning and undoubted leisure, many of the class found admission to the houses of the French nobility as tutors or advisers. Nearly every great family had its abb\u00e9. The class did not survive the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]; but the [[courtesy title]] of abb\u00e9, having long lost all connection in people's minds with any special ecclesiastical function, remained as a convenient general term applicable to any clergyman.\n\n==Eastern Christian==\n{{further|Hegumen|Archimandrite}}\n\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the abbot is referred to as the ''hegumen''. The Superior of a convent of nuns is called the ''H\u0113gum\u00e9n\u0113''. The title of ''archimandrite'' (literally the head of the enclosure) used to mean something similar.\n\nIn the East{{huh|date=December 2016}}, the principle set forth in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' still applies, whereby most abbots are immediately subject to the local bishop. Those monasteries which enjoy the status of being ''stauropegiac'' will be subject only to a [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] or his [[Synod]] of Bishops and not the local bishop.\n\n==Honorary and other uses of the title==\nAlthough currently in the Western Church the title \"abbot\" is given only abbots of monasteries, the title archimandrite is given to \"monastics\" (i.e., celibate) priests in the East, even when not attached to a monastery, as an honor for service, similar to the title of [[monsignor]] in the Western/Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church. In the [[Orthodox Church]], only monastics are permitted to be elevated to the rank of archimandrite. Married priests are elevated to the parallel rank of [[Archpriest]] or [[Protopresbyter]]. Normally there are no celibate priests who are not monastics in the Orthodox Church, with the exception of married priests who have been [[widow]]ed. Since the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] the ranks of Abbot and Archimandrite have been given as honorary titles in the Russian Church, and may be given to any monastic, even if he does not in fact serve as the superior of a monastery. In Greek practice the title or function of Abbot corresponds to a person who serves as the head of a monastery, although the title of the Archimandrite may be given to any celibate priest who could serve as the head of a monastery.\n\nIn the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|German Evangelical Church]], the German title of ''Abt'' (abbot) is sometimes bestowed, like the French ''abb\u00e9'', as an honorary distinction, and survives to designate the heads of some monasteries converted at the Reformation into collegiate foundations.\nOf these the most noteworthy is [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Hanover]], founded as a [[Cistercian]] house in 1163 by Count Wilbrand of Hallermund, and reformed in 1593. The abbot of Loccum, who still carries a pastoral staff, takes precedence over all the clergy of Hanover, and was ''ex officio'' a member of the [[wiktionary:consistory|consistory]] of the kingdom.  The governing body of the abbey consists of the abbot, prior and the \"convent\" of ''[[Stiftsherr]]en'' (canons).\n\nIn the [[Church of England]], the [[Bishop of Norwich]], by royal decree given by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], also holds the honorary title of \"Abbot of St. Benet.\"  This title hails back to England's separation from the See of Rome, when King Henry, as supreme head of the newly independent church, took over all of the monasteries, mainly for their possessions, except for St. Benet, which he spared because the abbot and his monks possessed no wealth, and lived like simple beggars, deposing the incumbent Bishop of Norwich and seating the abbot in his place, thus the dual title still held to this day.\n\nAdditionally, at the [[enthronement]] of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], there is a threefold enthronement, once in the throne the chancel as the [[diocesan bishop]] of [[Canterbury]], once in the [[Chair of St. Augustine]] as the [[Primate of All England]], and then once in the chapter-house as Titular Abbot of Canterbury.\n\nThere are several Benedictine abbeys throughout the [[Anglican Communion]].  Most of them have mitred abbots.\n\n==Abbots in art and literature==\n[[File:Houghton Typ 515.38.456a - Totentanz, 14.jpg|thumb|\"The Abbot\", from the ''[[Dance of Death]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\n\"The Abbot\" is one of the archetypes traditionally illustrated in scenes of ''[[Danse Macabre]]''.\n\nThe lives of numerous abbots make up a significant contribution to Christian [[hagiography]], one of the most well-known being the ''Life of St. [[Benedict of Nursia]]'' by St. [[Gregory the Great]].\n\nDuring the years 1106\u20131107 AD, Daniel, a Russian Orthodox abbot, made a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]] and recorded his experiences. His diary was much-read throughout [[Russia]], and at least seventy-five manuscript copies survive. [[Joseph Volotsky|Saint Joseph]], Abbot of [[Volokolamsk]], Russia (1439\u20131515), wrote a number of influential works against [[heresy]], and about monastic and liturgical discipline, and Christian [[philanthropy]].\n\nIn the [[Redwall|''Tales of Redwall'' series]], the creatures of Redwall are led by an abbot or abbess.  These \"abbots\" are appointed by the brothers and sisters of Redwall to serve as a superior and provide paternal care, much like real abbots.\n\n\"The Abbot\" was a nickname of [[RZA]] from the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abb\u00e9]]\n*[[Abb\u00e9 Pierre]]\n*[[Abbot (Buddhism)]]\n*[[Abthain]]\n*[[Commendatory abbot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Abbot}}\n*{{EB1911|first=Edmund|last=Venables|authorlink=Edmund Venables|wstitle=Abbot}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Collier's poster|Abbot}}\n{{Nuttall poster|Abbot}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002412/http://www.valaam.ru/en/photos/lightval/551/ Russian Orthodox Abbot] of [[Valaam Monastery]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070609102251/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/history/seminar/daniel.htm ''The Pilgrimage of the Russian Abbot Daniel in the Holy Land'']\n\n{{RC consecrated life|state=collapsed}}\n{{Catholic Church footer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n\n\n[[Category:Abbots| ]]\n[[Category:Religious terminology]]\n[[Category:Ecclesiastical titles]]\n[[Category:Monasticism]]\n[[Category:Organisation of Catholic religious orders]]\n[[Category:Religious leadership roles]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church offices]]\n[[Category:Christian religious occupations]]", "sha1": "mt2d9xiie4hgz2nwgko42lw03j36z7d"}}, {"title": "Ardipithecus", "ns": "0", "id": "1144", "revision": {"id": "863923758", "parentid": "863665099", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T00:03:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Sumanuil", "id": "31876559"}, "comment": "Reverted to revision 863612929 by [[Special:Contributions/2607:F140:6000:A:21B7:923B:3938:B6CD|2607:F140:6000:A:21B7:923B:3938:B6CD]]: That's not how it worka.

In particular, it has been used to suggest that the [[last common ancestor]] of hominids and African apes was characterized by relatively little aggression between males and between groups. This is markedly different from social patterns in common chimpanzees, among which intermale and intergroup aggression are typically high. Researchers in a 2009 study said that this condition \"compromises the living chimpanzee as a behavioral model for the ancestral hominid condition.\"<ref name=\"Suwa_2009b\"/>\n\n''A. ramidus'' existed more recently than the [[most recent common ancestor]] of humans and chimpanzees ([[Chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|CLCA or ''Pan''-''Homo'' LCA]]) and thus is not fully representative of that common ancestor.

After the chimpanzee and human lineages diverged, both underwent substantial evolutionary change. Chimp feet are specialized for grasping trees; ''A. ramidus'' feet are better suited for walking. The canine teeth of ''A. ramidus'' are smaller, and equal in size between males and females, which suggests reduced male-to-male conflict, increased pair-bonding, and increased parental investment. \"Thus, fundamental reproductive and social behavioral changes probably occurred in hominids long before they had enlarged brains and began to use stone tools,\" the research team concluded.<ref name=\"AndThePaleobiology\" />\n\n=== Ardi ===\n{{Main|Ardi}}\nOn October 1, [[2009 in science|2009]], paleontologists formally announced the discovery of the relatively complete ''A. ramidus'' fossil skeleton first unearthed in 1994.

In other words, humans seem to have replaced craniofacial growth with an extended and intensified period of socio-emotional development. As ''A. ramidus'' no longer has an ontogeny that results in the development of a prognathic jaw with a C/P3 complex (which is one of the most important means by which males vie for status within the mating hierarchies of other primate species), young and sub-adult members of the species must have pursued other avenues by which to become reproductively successful members of the social group. The implication of these interspecific differences is that ''A. ramidus'' would have most likely had a period of infant and juvenile socialisation different from that of chimpanzees. Consequently, it is possible that in ''A.ramidus'' we see the first, albeit incipient trend toward human forms of child socialisation and social organisation'.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2015\"/>\n\nIt should be noted that this view has yet to be corroborated by more detailed studies of the ontogeny of ''A.ramidus''. The study also provides support for Stephen Jay Gould's theory in [[Ontogeny and Phylogeny (book)|''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'']] that the paedomorphic form of early hominin craniofacial morphology results from heterochronic dissociation of growth trajectories.\n\n== ''Ardipithecus ramidus'' and the evolution of human vocal ability ==\n{{Non-free|section|date=November 2017}}\nA study published in ''Homo: Journal of Comparative Human Biology'' in 2017 claims that ''A.ramidus'' possessed an ontogeny and idiosyncratic skull morphology more conducive to the production of modulated vocalisations than any other species of extant great ape.

In integrating data on anatomical correlates of primate mating and social systems with studies of skull and vocal tract architecture that facilitate speech production, the authors argue that paleoanthropologists to date have failed to grasp the important relationship between early hominin social evolution and language capacity. As they write:\n\n{{quote|text=In the paleoanthropological literature, these changes in early hominin skull morphology [reduced facial prognathism and lack of canine armoury] have to date been analysed in terms of a shift in mating and social behaviour, with little consideration given to vocally mediated sociality. Similarly, in the literature on language evolution there is a distinct lacuna regarding links between craniofacial correlates of social and mating systems and vocal ability. These are surprising oversights given that pro-sociality and vocal capability require identical alterations to the common ancestral skull and skeletal configuration. We therefore propose a model which integrates data on whole organism morphogenesis with evidence for a potential early emergence of hominin socio-vocal adaptations. Consequently, we suggest vocal capability may have evolved much earlier than has been traditionally proposed. Instead of emerging in the ''Homo genus'', we suggest the palaeoecological context of late Miocene and early Pliocene forests and woodlands facilitated the evolution of hominin socio-vocal capability. We also propose that paedomorphic morphogenesis of the skull via the process of self-domestication enabled increased levels of pro-social behaviour, as well as increased capacity for socially synchronous vocalisation to evolve at the base of the hominin clade.<ref name=\"Clark & Henneberg 2017\"/>}}\n\nWhile the skull of ''A.ramidus'', according to the authors, lacks the anatomical impediments to speech evident in chimpanzees, it is unclear what the vocal capabilities of this early hominin were. While they suggest ''A.ramidus'' - based on similar vocal tract ratios - may have had vocal capabilities equivalent to a modern human infant or very young child, they concede this is obviously a debatable and speculative hypothesis. However, they do claim that changes in skull architecture through processes of social selection were a necessary prerequisite for language evolution.

By mechanically moving the parts to the assembly work and moving the semi-finished assembly from work station to work station, a finished product can be assembled faster and with less labor than by having workers carry parts to a stationary piece for assembly.\n\nAssembly lines are common methods of assembling complex items such as [[automobile]]s and other [[transportation]] equipment, [[household]] appliances and [[Consumer electronics|electronic goods]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Final assembly 3.jpg|thumb|[[Lotus Cars]] assembly line as of 2008]]\nAssembly lines are designed for the sequential organization of [[worker]]s, [[tool]]s or machines, and parts. The motion of workers is minimized to the extent possible. All parts or assemblies are handled either by [[conveyor]]s or motorized vehicles such as [[fork lifts]], or [[gravity]], with no manual trucking. Heavy lifting is done by machines such as [[overhead crane]]s or fork lifts. Each worker typically performs one simple operation.\n\nAccording to [[Henry Ford]]:\n\n{{quote|The principles of assembly are these:\n\n(1) Place the tools and the men in the sequence of the operation so that each component part shall travel the least possible distance while in the process of finishing.\n\n(2) Use work slides or some other form of carrier so that when a workman completes his operation, he drops the part always in the same place\u2014which place must always be the most convenient place to his hand\u2014and if possible have gravity carry the part to the next workman for his own.\n\n(3) Use sliding assembling lines by which the parts to be assembled are delivered at convenient distances.<ref name=\"Ford1922\">{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, p. 45 (on line version), p. 80 (print version)</ref>}}\n\n==Simple example==\n\nConsider the assembly of a [[car]]: assume that certain steps in the assembly line are to install the engine, install the hood, and install the wheels (in that order, with arbitrary interstitial steps); only one of these steps can be done at a time. In traditional production, only one car would be assembled at a time. If [[engine]] installation takes 20 minutes, [[Hood (vehicle)|hood]] installation takes five minutes, and [[wheel]]s installation takes 10 minutes, then a car can be produced every 35 minutes.\n\nIn an assembly line, car assembly is split between several stations, all working simultaneously. When one station is finished with a car, it passes it on to the next. By having three stations, a total of three different cars can be operated on at the same time, each one at a different stage of its assembly.\n\nAfter finishing its work on the first car, the engine installation crew can begin working on the second car. While the engine installation crew works on the second car, the first car can be moved to the hood station and fitted with a hood, then to the wheels station and be fitted with wheels. After the engine has been installed on the second car, the second car moves to the hood assembly. At the same time, the third car moves to the engine assembly. When the third car's engine has been mounted, it then can be moved to the hood station; meanwhile, subsequent cars (if any) can be moved to the engine installation station.\n\nAssuming no loss of time when moving a car from one station to another, the longest stage on the assembly line determines the [[throughput (business)|throughput]] (20 minutes for the engine installation) so a car can be produced every 20 minutes, once the first car taking 35 minutes has been produced.\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[Industrial Revolution]], most manufactured products were made individually by hand. A single [[Artisan|craftsman]] or team of craftsmen would create each part of a product. They would use their skills and tools such as [[File (tool)|files]] and [[knives]] to create the individual parts. They would then assemble them into the final product, making cut-and-try changes in the parts until they fit and could work together ([[craft production]]).\n\n[[Division of labor]] was practiced in China where state run monopolies [[mass-produced]] metal agricultural implements, china, armor, and weapons centuries before it appeared in Europe on the eve of the Industrial Revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Merson|1990||p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> [[Adam Smith]] discussed the [[division of labour]] in the manufacture of [[pins]] at length in his book ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (published in 1776).\n\nThe [[Venetian Arsenal]], dating to about 1104, operated similar to a production line. Ships moved down a canal and were fitted by the various shops they passed. At the peak of its [[efficiency]] in the early 16th century, the [[Venetian Arsenal]] employed some 16,000 people who could apparently produce nearly one ship each day, and could fit out, arm, and provision a newly built [[galley]] with standardized parts on an assembly-line basis. Although the Venice Arsenal lasted until the early [[Industrial Revolution]], production line methods did not become common even then.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] led to a proliferation of manufacturing and invention. Many industries, notably [[textile]]s, [[firearm]]s, [[clockmaking|clocks and watches]],<ref name = \"xovodv\">[[G.N. Georgano]] 1985.{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[Locomotive|railway locomotive]]s, [[sewing machine]]s, and [[bicycle]]s, saw expeditious improvement in materials handling, machining, and assembly during the 19th century, although modern concepts such as [[industrial engineering]] and [[logistics]] had not yet been named.\n\n[[File:PulleyShip.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pulley#Block and tackle|pulley block]] was the first manufacture to become fully automated at the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]] in the early 19th century.]]\n\nThe automatic [[flour]] [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] built by [[Oliver Evans]] in 1785 was called the beginning of modern [[bulk material handling]] by Roe (1916). Evans's mill used a leather belt bucket elevator, [[screw conveyor]]s, canvas belt conveyors, and other mechanical devices to completely automate the process of making flour. The innovation spread to other mills and breweries.<ref>{{harvnb|Roe|1916|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hounshell|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\nProbably the earliest industrial example of a linear and continuous assembly process is the [[Portsmouth Block Mills]], built between 1801 and 1803. [[Marc Isambard Brunel]] (father of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]), with the help of [[Henry Maudslay]] and others, designed 22 types of machine tools to make the parts for the rigging [[Block (sailing)|blocks]] used by the [[Royal Navy]]. This factory was so successful that it remained in use until the 1960s, with the workshop still visible at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Dockyard]] in [[Portsmouth]], and still containing some of the original machinery.\n\nOne of the earliest examples of an almost modern factory layout, designed for easy material handling, was the [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]]. The factory grounds were bordered by the [[Bridgewater Canal]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. The buildings were arranged in a line with a railway for carrying the work going through the buildings. [[Crane (machine)|Crane]]s were used for lifting the heavy work, which sometimes weighed in the tens of tons. The work passed sequentially through to erection of framework and final assembly.<ref>{{harvnb|Musson|Robinson|1969|pp=491\u20135}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bridgewater foundary.gif|thumb|left|The [[Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company|Bridgewater Foundry]], pictured in 1839, one of the earliest factories to use an almost modern [[Process layout|layout]], workflow, and material-handling system]]\n\nThe first flow assembly line was initiated at the factory of [[Richard Garrett & Sons]], Leiston Works in [[Leiston]] in the [[English county]] of [[Suffolk]] for the manufacture of [[portable steam engine]]s. The assembly line area was called '[[Long Shop Museum|The Long Shop]]' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The [[boiler]] was brought up from the foundry and put at the start of the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be completed.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.industriouseast.org.uk/index.php?pageId=147&anchor=164&filter=gb |title= Long Shop Museum |accessdate= 2012-12-17}}{{full citation needed|date= December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Interchangeable parts===\n\nDuring the early 19th century, the development of [[machine tool]]s such as the [[screw-cutting lathe]], [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]], and [[milling machine]], and of toolpath control via [[Jig (tool)|jigs]] and [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making [[interchangeable parts]] a practical reality.\n\n===Late 19th century steam and electric conveyors===\n\nSteam powered [[conveyor lift]]s began being used for loading and unloading ships some time in the last quarter of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Wells1890\">{{harvnb|Wells|1890|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref> Hounshell (1984) shows a {{circa|1885}} sketch of an electric powered conveyor moving cans through a filling line in a canning factory.\n\nThe [[meatpacking]] industry of [[Chicago]] is believed to be one of the first industrial assembly lines (or dis-assembly lines) to be utilized in the United States starting in 1867.

The efficiency of one person removing the same piece over and over without himself moving caught his attention. He reported the idea to [[Peter E. Martin]], soon to be head of Ford production, who was doubtful at the time but encouraged him to proceed. Others at Ford have claimed to have put the idea forth to [[Henry Ford]], but Pa Klann's slaughterhouse revelation is well documented in the archives at the Henry Ford Museum<ref>{{cite journal |last= Klann |first= W. C. |date= n.d. |title= Reminiscences |id= Accession 65 |publisher= Henry Ford Museum & Greenfield Village Archives}}</ref> and elsewhere, making him an important contributor to the modern automated assembly line concept. Ford was appreciative, having visited the highly automated 40-acre [[Sears]] [[mail order]] handling facility around 1906. At Ford, the process was an evolution by trial and error<ref name=Weber2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/91581-the-moving-assembly-line-turns-100 |title=The Moving Assembly Line Turns 100 |last=Weber |first=Austin |publisher=Assembly Magazine |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2017-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826161557/http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/91581-the-moving-assembly-line-turns-100 |archive-date=2016-08-26 |dead-url=no |quote=The assembly line ... was the result of a long period of trial and error.

Two individuals were essential to the success of the moving assembly line: Clarence Avery and Charles Sorensen. constant redesign of the Model T. Many components were tweaked regularly to make the vehicle easier to assemble. In 1913 alone, Ford made more than 100 design changes every month. Continuous experimentation was the rule rather than the exception at Ford's Highland Park plant. Ford engineers were constantly redesigning and tweaking jigs and fixtures, and planning new machine tools or fixing old ones, to achieve higher production. }}</ref> of a team consisting primarily of [[Peter E.

Some of the groundwork for such development had recently been laid by the intelligent layout of [[machine tool]] placement that [[Walter Flanders]] had been doing at Ford up to 1908.\n\nThe moving assembly line was developed for the [[Ford Model T]] and began operation on October 7, 1913, at the [[Highland Park Ford Plant]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2013|title=Ford's Assembly Line Turns 100: How It Changed Manufacturing and Society|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=August 27, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021237/http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/ford-assembly-line-turns-100-changed-society-article-1.1478331|archivedate=November 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/moving-assembly-line-at-ford |title=Moving Assembly Line at Ford|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|work=This Day in History|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}</ref> and continued to evolve after that, using [[time and motion study]].<ref name=Weber2013/> The assembly line, driven by [[conveyor belts]], reduced production time for a [[Model T]] to just 93 minutes<ref name=\"michigan yesterday\"/> by dividing the process into 45 steps.<ref name=Weber2008>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/85803-how-the-model-t-was-assembled |title=How the Model T Was Assembled |last=Weber |first=Austin |publisher=Assembly Magazine |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2017-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306031306/http://www.assemblymag.com/articles/85803-how-the-model-t-was-assembled |archive-date=2016-03-06 |dead-url=no |quote= }}</ref> Producing cars quicker than paint of the day could dry, it had an immense influence on the world.\n\nIn 1922, Ford (through his ghostwriter Crowther) said of his 1913 assembly line:\n\n{{quote|I believe that this was the first moving line ever installed. The idea came in a general way from the overhead trolley that the Chicago packers use in dressing beef.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|p= 81}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Charles E. Sorensen]], in his 1956 memoir ''My Forty Years with Ford'', presented a different version of development that was not so much about individual \"inventors\" as a gradual, logical development of [[industrial engineering]]:\n\n{{quote|What was worked out at Ford was the practice of moving the work from one worker to another until it became a complete unit, then arranging the flow of these units at the right time and the right place to a moving final assembly line from which came a finished product. Regardless of earlier uses of some of these principles, the direct line of succession of mass production and its intensification into automation stems directly from what we worked out at Ford Motor Company between 1908 and 1913. Henry Ford is generally regarded as the father of mass production. He was not. He was the sponsor of it.<ref>{{harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=116}}.</ref>}}\n\nAs a result of these developments in method, Ford's cars came off the line in three-minute intervals, or six feet per minute.<ref>{{harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922|Chapter IV}}{{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> This was much faster than previous methods, increasing production by eight to one (requiring 12.5 man-hours before, 1 hour 33 minutes after), while using less manpower.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/> It was so successful, [[paint]] became a bottleneck. Only [[japan black]] would dry fast enough, forcing the company to drop the variety of colors available before 1914, until fast-drying [[Duco]] [[lacquer]] was developed in 1926.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe assembly line technique was an integral part of the diffusion of the automobile into American society. Decreased costs of production allowed the cost of the Model T to fall within the budget of the American middle class. In 1908, the price of a Model T was around $825, and by 1912 it had decreased to around $575. This price reduction is comparable to a reduction from $15,000 to $10,000 in dollar terms from the year 2000. In 1914, an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months' pay.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nFord's complex safety procedures\u2014especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about\u2014dramatically reduced the rate of [[injury]]. The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called \"[[Fordism]]\", and was copied by most major industries. The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the take-off of the United States. The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods.\n\nIn the [[automotive industry]], its success was dominating, and quickly spread worldwide. Ford France and Ford Britain in 1911, Ford Denmark 1923, Ford Germany and Ford Japan 1925; in 1919, Vulcan (Southport, Lancashire) was the first native European manufacturer to adopt it. Soon, companies had to have assembly lines, or risk going broke by not being able to compete; by 1930, 250 companies which did not had disappeared.<ref name = \"xovodv\"/>\n\nThe massive demand for military hardware in World War II prompted assembly-line techniques in shipbuilding and aircraft production. Thousands of [[Liberty Ship]]s were built making extensive use of prefabrication, enabling ship assembly to be completed in weeks or even days. After having produced fewer than 3,000 planes for the United States Military in 1939, American aircraft manufacturers built over 300,000 planes in World War II. [[Vultee]] pioneered the use of the powered assembly line for aircraft manufacturing. Other companies quickly followed. As [[William S. Knudsen]] (having worked at Ford,<ref name=Weber2013/> GM and the National Defense Advisory Commission) observed, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Herman|2012|pp=176\u201391}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Parker|2012|pp=5\u201312}}</ref>\n\n==Improved working conditions==\nIn his 1922 autobiography,<ref name=\"Ford1922\"/> Henry Ford mentions several benefits of the assembly line including:\n\n*Workers do no heavy lifting.\n*No stooping or bending over.\n*No special training required.\n*There are jobs that almost anyone can do.\n*Provided employment to immigrants.\n\nThe gains in [[productivity]] allowed Ford to increase worker pay from $1.50 per day to $5.00 per day once employees reached three years of service on the assembly line. Ford continued on to reduce the hourly work week while continuously lowering the Model T price. These goals appear altruistic; however, it has been argued that they were implemented by Ford in order to reduce high employee turnover: when the assembly line was introduced in 1913, it was discovered that \"every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963\" in order to counteract the natural distaste the assembly line seems to have inspired.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Matthew |title=Shop Class as Soulcraft |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |work=[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601015022/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft |archivedate=2013-06-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Sociological problems==\n[[Sociology|Sociological]] work has explored the [[social alienation]] and [[boredom]] that many workers feel because of the repetition of doing the same specialized task all day long.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 4105309 |title= Alienation and Freedom: The Factory Worker and His Industry |authorlink= Bob Blauner |first= Robert |last= Blauner |journal= [[Technology and Culture]] |volume= 6 |issue= 3 |date= Summer 1965 |pages= 518\u2013519}}</ref>\n\nOne of capitalism's most famous critics, [[Karl Marx]], expressed in his ''[[Marx's theory of alienation|Entfremdung]]'' theory the belief that in order to achieve job satisfaction workers need to see themselves in the objects they have created, that products should be \"mirrors in which workers see their reflected essential nature.\" Marx viewed labour as a chance for us to externalize facets of our personality. Marxists argue that specialization makes it very difficult for any worker to feel they may be contributing to the real needs of humanity. The repetitive nature of specialized tasks causes, they say, a feeling of disconnection between what a worker does all day, who they really are, and what they would ideally be able to contribute to society.

Gawler was recalled and replaced by [[George Edward Grey]] in 1841. Grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition, although its impact was negligible at this point: silver was discovered in [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]] that year, agriculture was well underway, and other mines sprung up all over the state, aiding Adelaide's commercial development. The city exported meat, wool, wine, fruit and wheat by the time Grey left in 1845, contrasting with a low point in 1842 when one-third of Adelaide houses were abandoned.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nTrade links with the rest of the Australian states were established after the [[Murray River]] was successfully navigated in 1853 by [[Francis Cadell (explorer)|Francis Cadell]], an Adelaide resident.

In the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe economic depression, ending a hectic era of land booms and tumultuous expansionism. Financial institutions in Melbourne and banks in Sydney closed. The national fertility rate fell and immigration was reduced to a trickle. The value of South Australia's exports nearly halved. Drought and poor harvests from 1884 compounded the problems, with some families leaving for Western Australia.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Adelaide was not as badly hit as the larger gold-rush cities of Sydney and Melbourne, and silver and lead discoveries at [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] provided some relief.

His plan, now known as '''Light's Vision''', arranged Adelaide in a grid, with [[:Category:Squares in Adelaide|five squares]] in the [[Adelaide city centre]] and a ring of parks, known as the [[Adelaide Parklands]], surrounding it. Light's selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers, as well as South Australia's first governor, John Hindmarsh, due to its distance from the harbour at Port Adelaide, and the lack of fresh water there.<ref>Page, M. (1981): ''Port Adelaide and its Institute, 1851\u20131979.'' Rigby Publishers Ltd. Pp.17\u201320. {{ISBN|0-7270-1510-9}}</ref> Light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition.\n\nThe benefits of Light's design are numerous: Adelaide has had wide multi-lane roads from its beginning, an easily navigable [[cardinal direction]] grid layout and an expansive green ring around the city centre. There are two sets of [[ring road]]s in Adelaide that have resulted from the original design. The [[City Ring Route, Adelaide|inner ring route]] ([[A21 road (Australia)|A21]]) borders the parklands, and the outer route ([[A3 road (South Australia)|A3]]/[[South Road, Adelaide|A13]]/[[A16 highway (Australia)|A16]]/[[A17 highway (Australia)|A17]]) completely bypasses the inner city via (in clockwise order) [[Grand Junction Road]], Hampstead Road, Ascot Avenue, [[Portrush Road]], [[Cross Road, Adelaide|Cross Road]] and [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]].<ref>[http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp ''Adelaide's Inner and Outer Ring Routes''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306220115/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/transport_network/projects/better_roads/adelaides_inner_outer_ring_routes.asp |date=6 March 2014 }}, 24 August 2004, South Australian Department of Transport.</ref>\n\n[[File:Adelaide nth tce1.8.jpg|thumb|left|The corner of [[North Terrace, Adelaide|North Terrace]] (right) and [[Pulteney Street, Adelaide|Pulteney Street]] (left), looking south-west from [[Bonython Hall]].]]\n\nSuburban expansion has to some extent outgrown Light's original plan. Numerous former outlying villages and \"country towns\", as well as the satellite city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], have been enveloped by its [[urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Expanding developments in the Adelaide Hills region led to the construction of the [[South Eastern Freeway]] to cope with growth, which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor. Similarly, the booming development in Adelaide's [[City of Onkaparinga|South]] led to the construction of the [[Southern Expressway (Australia)|Southern Expressway]].\n\nNew roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth. The [[O-Bahn Busway]] is an example of a unique solution to [[Tea Tree Gully, South Australia|Tea Tree Gully's]] transport woes in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adelaide's Freeways \u2013 A History from MATS to the Port River Expressway |work=Ozroads |url=http://www.ozroads.com.au/SA/freeways.htm}}</ref> The development of the nearby suburb of [[Golden Grove, South Australia|Golden Grove]] in the late 1980s is an example of well-thought-out urban planning.\n\n[[File:King William Street-Adelaide.jpg|thumb|King William Street, one of the widest main streets in an Australian capital city, viewed from Victoria Square.]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study]] Plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city. The plan involved the construction of freeways, [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system. The then premier [[Steele Hall]] approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project. The later [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government elected under [[Don Dunstan]] shelved the plan, but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant, should the future need for freeways arise. In 1980, the [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal party]] won government and premier [[David Tonkin]] committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the MATS plan, ensuring that even when needs changed, the construction of most MATS-proposed freeways would be impractical. Some parts of this land have been used for transport, (e.g. the O-Bahn Busway and Southern Expressway), while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Government of South Australia|SA Government]] announced plans for a network of [[transport-oriented development]]s across the Adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a [[Clipsal site development|10 hectare industrial site]] at [[Bowden, South Australia|Bowden]] for $52.5&nbsp;million as the first of these developments.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206075528/http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=3826 \"Clipsal site at Bowden to become a green village\"], Ministerial Press Release, 24 October 2008, SA Govt.

A relative lack of suitable, locally-available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brick-making industry, as well as the use of stone, for houses and other buildings. By 1891 68% of houses were built of stone, 15% of timber, and 10% of brick, with brick also being widely used in stone houses for quoins, door and window surrounds, and chimneys and fireplaces.<ref>Gibbs, R.M.

After both of the World Wars, the use of red bricks was popular. In the 1960s, cream bricks became popular, and in the 1970s, deep red and brown bricks became popular.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Until the 1970s, roofs tended to be clad with corrugated (iron) steel or clay tiles (usually red clay). Since then, cement tiles and Colorbond(R) corrugated (and other types of) steel have also become popular. Most roofs are pitched; flat roofs are not common. Up to the 1970s, the majority of houses were of \"double brick\" construction on concrete footings, with timber floors laid on joists supported by \"dwarf walls\".

The renowned [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]] and [[Adelaide Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] were established in 1960 under Thomas Playford. Construction of the [[Adelaide Festival Centre]] began under Steele Hall in 1970 and was completed under the subsequent government of Don Dunstan, who also established the [[South Australian Film Corporation]] and, in 1976, the [[State Opera of South Australia]].\n\nOver time, the Adelaide Festival has expanded to include the [[Adelaide Cabaret Festival]], [[Adelaide Film Festival]], [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]], [[Adelaide Writers' Week]], and [[WOMADelaide]], all held predominately in the autumnal month of March (sometimes jocularly called 'mad March' by locals due to the hectic clustering of these events). Other festivals include [[Feast Festival|FEAST]] (a [[LGBT culture|queer culture]] celebration), [[Tasting Australia]] (a biennial food and wine affair), and the [[Royal Adelaide Show]] (an annual [[agricultural show]] and [[state fair]]).\n\n[[File:Adelaide Convention Centre at night.jpg|thumb|The [[Adelaide Convention Centre]], the first of its kind in South Australia, is situated on the River Torrens.

The Adelaide Metro consists of a contracted bus system including the [[O-Bahn Busway]], [[Railways in Adelaide|metropolitan railways]] (with diesel and electric lines), and the Adelaide-[[Glenelg Tram]], which was extended as a metropolitan tram in 2010 through the city centre to the inner north-west suburb of [[Hindmarsh, South Australia|Hindmarsh]].

Historically, Adelaide was known as a \"twenty-minute city\", with commuters having been able to travel from metropolitan outskirts to the city proper in roughly twenty minutes. However, these roads are now often considered inadequate to cope with Adelaide's growing road traffic, and often experience traffic congestion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Malcontent \u2013 The Twenty Minute City No More |work=Royal Automobile Association, South Australia |format=PDF |year=2005 |url=http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents\\document_677.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115022910/http://www.raa.net/download.asp?file=documents%5Cdocument_677.pdf |archivedate=15 January 2009 |df=dmy }} (1.18MB)</ref>\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has one freeway and three expressways.

It duplicates the route of [[South Road]].\n* The [[North-South Motorway]] (M2), is an ongoing major project that will become the major north-south corridor, replacing most of what is now [[South Road, Adelaide|South Road]], connecting the Southern Expressway and the [[Port River Expressway]]. Currently, the motorway runs as an elevated freeway from its junction with the Port River Expressway to Regency Road, in Adelaide's inner north-west. Continuation of the motorway is currently under construction at both ends of the motorway, at Darlington and in the \"Torrens to Torrens\" project.\n* The [[Port River Expressway]] (A9), connects Port Adelaide and [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor]] to Port Wakefield Road at the northern \"entrance\" to the metropolitan area.\n* The [[Northern Expressway]] (Max Fatchen Expressway) (M20), is the northern suburbs bypass route connecting the Sturt Highway (National Highway 20) via the [[Gawler bypass road|Gawler Bypass]] to Port Wakefield Road at a point a few kilometres north of the Port River Expressway connection.\n* The [[Northern Connector]] (proposed route M20) commenced construction in 2016, to connect the North-South Motorway with the Northern Expressway. The road will not be subject to direct tolls, but South Australia will become a testing ground for a \"network fee\" that involves charging trucks based on road use and impact in place of high registration fees.\n\n==== Airports ====\n[[File:Adelaide Airport, 2008.jpg|thumb|A [[Qantas]] plane leaving [[Adelaide Airport]].]]\n\nThe Adelaide metropolitan area has two commercial airports, [[Adelaide Airport]] and [[Parafield Airport]].

Much of his work is firmly rooted in the landscape, history and folklore of his native county of [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]], being set in the region and making use of the native [[Cheshire dialect]].\n\nBorn in [[Congleton]], Garner grew up around the nearby town of [[Alderley Edge]], and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as 'The Edge', where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region. Studying at [[Manchester Grammar School]] and then briefly at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of Blackden, where he bought and renovated an Early Modern building known as Toad Hall. His first novel, ''[[The Weirdstone of Brisingamen]]'', was published in 1960. A children's fantasy novel set on the Edge, it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters. Garner completed a sequel, ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]'' (1963), but left the third book of the trilogy he had envisioned. Instead he wrote several fantasy novels, ''[[Elidor]]'' (1965), ''[[The Owl Service]]'' (1967) and ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]'' (1973).\n\nTurning away from fantasy as a genre, Garner produced ''[[The Stone Book Quartet]]'' (1979), a series of four short novellas detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family. He also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled ''Alan Garner's Fairy Tales of Gold'' (1979), ''Alan Garner's Book of British Fairy Tales'' (1984) and ''A Bag of Moonshine'' (1986). In his subsequent novels, ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' (1996) and ''[[Thursbitch (novel)|Thursbitch]]'' (2003), he continued writing tales revolving around Cheshire, although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work. In 2012, he finally published a third book in the Weirdstone trilogy, ''[[Boneland]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life: 1934\u201356===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|\"I had to get aback [to familial ways of doing things], by using skills that had been denied to my ancestors; but I had nothing that they would have called worthwhile.

Instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Garner later remarked that as a result he was \"aware of [the Edge's] magic\" as a child, and he and his friends often played there.{{sfn|Garner|2010|p=9}} The story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life, becoming, he explained, \"deeply embedded in my psyche\" and heavily influencing his later novels.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner faced several life-threatening childhood illnesses, which left him bed ridden for much of the time.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He attended a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native [[Cheshire dialect]];{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=11}} for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with soapy water.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Garner then won a place at [[Manchester Grammar School]], where he received his secondary education; entry was [[Means test#United Kingdom|means-tested]], resulting in his school fees being waived.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=11|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at [[Sprint (running)|sprinting]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=12}} He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician [[Alan Turing]], who shared his fascination with the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.<ref>{{cite article |last=Garner |first=Alan |title=My hero: Alan Turing |date=11 November 2011 |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/11/alan-turing-my-hero-alan-garner |accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref> Garner was then conscripted into [[national service]], serving for a time with the [[Royal Artillery]] while posted to [[Woolwich]] in [[South East (London sub region)|Southeast London]].{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}}\n\nAt school, Garner had developed a keen interest in the work of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Homer]], as well as the [[Ancient Greek language]].{{sfn|Garth|2013}} Thus, he decided to pursue the study of [[Classics]] at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], passing his entrance exams in January 1953; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} He was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education, and he noted that this removed him from his \"cultural background\" and led to something of a schism with other members of his family, who \"could not cope with me, and I could not cope with\" them.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Looking back, he remarked, \"I soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In 1955, he joined the university theatrical society, playing the role of [[Mark Antony]] in a performance of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' where he co-starred alongside [[Dudley Moore]] and where [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] was the stage manager.{{sfn|Garth|2013}} In August 1956, he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing, and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree; he left Oxford in late 1956.{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Garth|2y=2013}} He nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained \"a permanent strength through all my life\".{{sfn|Garth|2013}}\n\n===''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' and ''The Moon of Gomrath'': 1957\u201364===\n\nAged 22, Garner was out cycling when he came across a hand-painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in Toad Hall &ndash; a Late Medieval building situated in Blackden, seven miles from Alderley Edge &ndash; was on sale for \u00a3510.

Set in Alderley Edge, it revolved around two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to live in the area with their mother's old nurse maid, Bess, and her husband, Gowther Mossock. Setting about to explore the Edge, they discover a race of malevolent creatures, the ''svart alfar'', who dwell in the Edge's abandoned mines and who seem intent on capturing them, until they are rescued by the wizard Cadellin who reveals that the forces of darkness are massing at the Edge in search of the eponymous \"weirdstone of Brisingamen\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|pp=12&ndash;13}} Whilst engaged in writing in his spare time, Garner attempted to gain employment as a teacher, but soon gave that up, believing that \"I couldn't write and teach; the energies were too similar\", and so began working as a general labourer for four years, remaining unemployed for much of that time.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}}\n\nGarner sent his debut novel to the publishing company [[William Collins, Sons|Collins]], where it was picked up by the company's head, Sir William Collins, who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of [[J.

Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954\u201355).{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} Garner, who went on to become a personal friend of Collins, would later relate that \"Billy Collins saw a title with funny-looking words in it on the stockpile, and he decided to publish it.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|p=317}} On its release in 1960, ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'' proved to be a critical and commercial success,{{sfnm|1a1=Philip|1y=1981|1p=12|2a1=Lake|2y=2010|2pp=316&ndash;317}} later being described as \"a tour de force of the imagination, a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children.\"{{sfn|Lake|2010|pp=316\u2013317}} Garner himself however would later denounce this novel as \"a fairly bad book\" in 1968.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=23}}\n\nWith his first book published, Garner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter, living a \"hand to mouth\" lifestyle on a \"shoestring\" budget.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} He also worked on a sequel to ''The Weirdstone of Brisingamen'', which would be known as ''[[The Moon of Gomrath]]''. ''The Moon of Gomrath'' also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan, with the latter being possessed by a malevolent creature called the [[Brollachan]] who has recently entered the world. With the help of the wizard Cadellin, the Brollachan is exorcised, but Susan's soul also leaves her body, being sent to another dimension, leading Colin to find a way to bring it back.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} Critic Neil Philip characterised it as \"an artistic advance\" but \"a less satisfying story\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=13}} In a 1989 interview, Garner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan, envisioning a trilogy, but that he had intentionally decided not to write it, instead moving on to write something different.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} However ''[[Boneland]]'', the conclusion to the sequence, was belatedly published in August 2012.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/15/alan-garner-weirdstone-brisingamen-trilogy-boneland \"Alan Garner to conclude Weirdstone of Brisingamen trilogy\"].

Here, they are entrusted by King Malebron to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of the kingdom.

Inspired by this design, he produced his fourth novel, ''[[The Owl Service]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} The story was also heavily influenced by the Medieval Welsh tale of [[Math fab Mathonwy]] from, the ''[[Mabinogion]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} ''The Owl Service'' was critically acclaimed, winning both the [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] and [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]].{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}} It also sparked discussions among critics as to whether Garner should properly be considered a children's writer, given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=15}}\n\nIt took Garner six years to write his next novel, ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]]''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}} In this, he provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the [[English Civil War]], and the third in the second century CE.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Philip referred to it as \"a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nAcademic specialist in children's literature [[Maria Nikolajeva]] characterised ''Red Shift'' as \"a difficult book\" for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of \"loneliness and failure to communicate\".{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=128}} Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that \"it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called \"realistic\" juvenile novels.\"{{sfn|Nikolajeva|1989|p=131}}\n\n===''The Stone Book'' series and folkloric collections: 1974\u201394===\n\nFrom 1976 to 1978, Garner published a series of four novellas, which have come to be collectively known as ''[[The Stone Book]]'' quartet: ''The Stone Book'', ''Granny Reardun'', ''The Aimer Gate'', and ''Tom Fobble's Day''.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}} Each focused on a day in the life of a child in the Garner family, each from a different generation.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\nIn a 1989 interview, Garner noted that although writing ''The Stone Book Quartet'' had been \"exhausting\", it had been \"the most rewarding of everything\" he'd done to date.{{sfn|Thompson|Garner|1989}} Philip described the quartet as \"a complete command of the material he had been working and reworking since the start of his career\".{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=16}}\nGarner pays particular attention to language, and strives to render the cadence of the Cheshire tongue in modern English. This he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading \"[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]\": the footnotes would not have been needed by his father.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1981, the literary critic Neil Philip published an analysis of Garner's novels as ''A Fine Anger'', which was based on his doctoral thesis, produced for the [[University of London]] in 1980.{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=9}} In this study he noted that \"''The Stone Book'' quartet marks a watershed in Garner's writing career, and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far.\"{{sfn|Philip|1981|p=17}}\n\n===''Strandloper'', ''Thursbitch'' and ''Boneland'': 1995&ndash;present===\n\n[[File:Garner in the field.jpg|thumb|right|Garner at his home in Blackden, 2011]]\n\nIn 1996, Garner's novel ''[[Strandloper (novel)|Strandloper]]'' was published. His collection of essays and public talks, ''The Voice That Thunders'', contains much autobiographical material (including an account of his life with [[bipolar disorder]]), as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language, literature and education, the nature of myth and time. In ''The Voice That Thunders'' he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade-long drought which preceded ''Strandloper'' to 'forsake \"literature\", and become instead a \"popular\" writer, cashing in on my established name by producing sequels to, and making series of, the earlier books'.<ref>Alan Garner, ''The Voice That Thunders'' (London 1997), p. 35.</ref> Garner feared that \"making series ... would render sterile the existing work, the life that produced it, and bring about my artistic and spiritual death\"<ref>Garner, ''Thunders'', p. 36.</ref> and felt unable to comply.\n\nGarner's novel ''[[Thursbitch]]'' was published in 2003.

R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], and in many respects better than Tolkien, because deeper and more truthful... Any country except Britain would have long ago recognised his importance, and celebrated it with postage stamps and statues and street-names.

polynomial to equal 0) in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently \u2013 by [[clearing denominators]] \u2013 with [[integer]] coefficients). All integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all [[nth root|roots of integers]]. The same is not true for all real numbers or all complex numbers. Those real and complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. They include [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]]. While the set of complex numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]], the set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] and has [[measure zero]] in the [[Lebesgue measure]] as a subset of the complex numbers, and in this sense [[almost all]] complex numbers are transcendental.\n\n==Examples==\n*All [[rational number]]s are algebraic. Any rational number, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''b''}} not equal to zero, satisfies the above definition because {{math|1=''x'' = {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}}} is the root of a non-zero polynomial, namely {{math|''bx'' \u2212 ''a''}}.<ref>Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972: 159\u2013160 and pp. 178\u2013179</ref>\n*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' + ''c''}} with integer coefficients {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}}) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic ({{math|1=''a'' = 1}}) then the roots are further qualified as [[quadratic integer]]s.\n*The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (Note that by designating cardinal directions for 1, \u22121, {{math|''i''}}, and {{math|\u2212''i''}}, complex numbers such as {{math|3 + {{sqrt|2}}''i''}} are considered constructible.)\n*Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] gives another algebraic number.\n*Polynomial roots that ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of {{math|''n''}}th roots (such as the roots of {{math|''x''<sup>5</sup> \u2212 ''x'' + 1}}). This [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.\n*[[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are integers are also quadratic integers.\n*Values of [[trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of {{pi}} (except when undefined): that is, the [[trigonometric number]]s. For example, each of {{math|cos {{sfrac|\u03c0|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|3\u03c0|7}}}}, {{math|cos {{sfrac|5\u03c0|7}}}} satisfies {{math|8''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 4''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, {{math|tan {{sfrac|3\u03c0|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|7\u03c0|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|11\u03c0|16}}}}, {{math|tan {{sfrac|15\u03c0|16}}}} all satisfy the irreducible polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>4</sup> \u2212 4''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 6''x''<sup>2</sup> + 4''x'' + 1 {{=}} 0}}, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].\n*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:\n**The numbers {{sqrt|2}} and {{math|{{sfrac|{{radic|3|3}}|2}}}} are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} and {{math|8''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 3}}, respectively.\n**The [[golden ratio]] {{mvar|\u03c6}} is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1}}.\n**The numbers [[Pi|{{pi}}]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]);<ref>Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to \"produce as many examples of transcendental numbers as we please,\" cf Hardy and Wright p.&nbsp;161ff</ref> hence they are transcendental.\n\n=={{anchor|Degree of an algebraic number}} Properties==\n<!-- This anchor tag serves to provide a  target for incoming section links.

This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree {{mvar|n}}, then the algebraic number is said to be of degree {{mvar|n}}. An algebraic number of degree 1 is a [[rational number]]. An algebraic number of degree 2 is a [[quadratic irrational]].\n*All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]].\n*The set of real algebraic numbers is [[linearly ordered]], countable, [[densely ordered]], and without first or last element, so is [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers.\n*For real numbers {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} is algebraic if and only if both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are algebraic.<ref>Niven 1956, Corollary 7.3.</ref>\n\n==The field of algebraic numbers==\n[[File:Algebraic number in the complex plane.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by degree (blue = 4, cyan = 3, red = 2, green = 1). The unit circle is black.]]\nThe sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}}} (sometimes denoted by {{math|'''A'''}}, though this usually denotes the [[adele ring]]). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.\n\nThe set of ''real'' algebraic numbers itself forms a field.<ref>Niven 1956, p.&nbsp;92.</ref>\n\n==Related fields==\n\n===Numbers defined by radicals===\nAll numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of integer [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking {{mvar|n}}th roots where {{mvar|n}} is a positive integer ([[radical expression]]s) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are roots of polynomials of degree 5 or more. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>5</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1}} (which is approximately {{val|1.167304}}).\n\n===Closed-form number===\n{{Main|Closed-form number}}\nAlgebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to \"[[closed-form number]]s\", which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called \"elementary numbers\", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms \u2013 this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as {{mvar|e}} or [[Natural logarithm of 2|ln&nbsp;2]].\n\n==Algebraic integers==\n[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer)]]\n{{Main|Algebraic integer}}\nAn '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{math|5 + 13{{sqrt|2}}}}, {{math|2 \u2212 6''i''}} and {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + ''i''{{sqrt|3}})}}. Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''k''}} for all {{math|''k'' \u2208 '''Z'''.}} In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s.\n\nThe sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If {{math|''K''}} is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in {{math|''K''}}, and is frequently denoted as {{math|''O<sub>K</sub>''}}.

It is, in some sense, a [[symmetry]] of the object, and a way of [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] the object to itself while preserving all of its structure. The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]], called the '''automorphism group'''. It is, loosely speaking, the [[symmetry group]] of the object.\n\n==Definition==\nIn the context of [[abstract algebra]], a mathematical object is an [[algebraic structure]] such as a [[group (mathematics)|group]], [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], or [[vector space]]. An '''automorphism''' is simply a [[bijective]] [[homomorphism]] of an object with itself. (The definition of a homomorphism depends on the type of algebraic structure; see, for example, [[group homomorphism]], [[ring homomorphism]], and [[linear operator]]).\n\nThe [[identity morphism]] ([[identity mapping]]) is called the '''trivial automorphism''' in some contexts. Respectively, other (non-identity) automorphisms are called '''nontrivial automorphisms'''.\n\nThe exact definition of an automorphism depends on the type of \"mathematical object\" in question and what, precisely, constitutes an \"isomorphism\" of that object. The most general setting in which these words have meaning is an abstract branch of mathematics called [[category theory]]. Category theory deals with abstract objects and [[morphism]]s between those objects.\n\nIn category theory, an '''automorphism''' is an [[endomorphism]] (i.e., a [[morphism]] from an object to itself) which is also an [[isomorphism]] (in the categorical sense of the word).\n\nThis is a very abstract definition since, in category theory, morphisms aren't necessarily functions and objects aren't necessarily sets. In most concrete settings, however, the objects will be sets with some additional structure and the morphisms will be functions preserving that structure.\n\n==Automorphism group==\nIf the automorphisms of an object {{var|X}} form a set (instead of a proper [[class (set theory)|class]]), then they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[Function composition|composition]] of [[morphism]]s. This group is called the '''automorphism group''' of {{var|X}}.\n;[[Closure (binary operation)|Closure]]: Composition of two automorphisms is another automorphism.\n;[[Associativity]]: It is part of the definition of a category that composition of morphisms is associative.\n;[[Identity element|Identity]]: The identity is the identity morphism from an object to itself, which is an automorphism.\n;[[Inverse element|Inverses]]: By definition every isomorphism has an inverse which is also an isomorphism, and since the inverse is also an endomorphism of the same object it is an automorphism.\n\nThe automorphism group of an object ''X'' in a category ''C'' is denoted Aut<sub>''C''</sub>(''X''), or simply Aut(''X'') if the category is clear from context.\n\n==Examples==\n* In [[set theory]], an arbitrary [[permutation]] of the elements of a set ''X'' is an automorphism. The automorphism group of ''X'' is also called the [[symmetric group]] on ''X''.\n* In [[elementary arithmetic]], the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''', considered as a group under addition, has a unique nontrivial automorphism: negation. Considered as a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]], however, it has only the trivial automorphism. Generally speaking, negation is an automorphism of any [[abelian group]], but not of a ring or field.\n* A group automorphism is a [[group isomorphism]] from a group to itself. Informally, it is a permutation of the group elements such that the structure remains unchanged. For every group ''G'' there is a natural group homomorphism ''G'' \u2192 Aut(''G'') whose [[image (mathematics)|image]] is the group Inn(''G'') of [[inner automorphism]]s and whose [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''.

In the cases of the [[rational number]]s ('''Q''') and the [[real number]]s ('''R''') there are no nontrivial field automorphisms. Some subfields of '''R''' have nontrivial field automorphisms, which however do not extend to all of '''R''' (because they cannot preserve the property of a number having a square root in '''R''').

In particular, if two nodes are joined by an edge, so are their images under the permutation.\n* In [[geometry]], an automorphism may be called a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of the space. Specialized terminology is also used:\n** In [[metric geometry]] an automorphism is a self-[[isometry]]. The automorphism group is also called the [[isometry group]].\n** In the category of [[Riemann surface]]s, an automorphism is a [[biholomorphy|biholomorphic]] map (also called a [[conformal map]]), from a surface to itself. For example, the automorphisms of the [[Riemann sphere]] are [[M\u00f6bius transformation]]s.\n** An automorphism of a differentiable [[manifold]] ''M'' is a [[diffeomorphism]] from ''M'' to itself. The automorphism group is sometimes denoted Diff(''M'').\n** In [[topology]], morphisms between topological spaces are called [[Continuous function (topology)|continuous maps]], and an automorphism of a topological space is a [[homeomorphism]] of the space to itself, or self-homeomorphism (see [[homeomorphism group]]). In this example it is ''not sufficient'' for a morphism to be bijective to be an isomorphism.\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest group automorphisms (automorphism of a group, not simply a group of automorphisms of points) was given by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his [[icosian calculus]], where he discovered an order two automorphism,<ref>{{Cite journal\n|title=Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity\n|author=Sir William Rowan Hamilton\n|author-link=William Rowan Hamilton\n|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Icosian/NewSys.pdf\n|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n|volume=12\n|year=1856\n|pages=446\n}}</ref> writing:\n<blockquote>so that <math>\\mu</math> is a new fifth root of unity, connected with the former fifth root <math>\\lambda</math> by relations of perfect reciprocity.</blockquote>\n\n==Inner and outer automorphisms==\n{{main article|Inner automorphism|Outer automorphism group}}\nIn some categories\u2014notably [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[Lie algebra]]s\u2014it is possible to separate automorphisms into two types, called \"inner\" and \"outer\" automorphisms.\n\nIn the case of groups, the [[inner automorphism]]s are the conjugations by the elements of the group itself. For each element ''a'' of a group ''G'', conjugation by ''a'' is the operation {{nowrap|''\u03c6''<sub>''a''</sub> : ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}} given by {{nowrap|1=''\u03c6''<sub>''a''</sub>(''g'') = ''aga''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} (or ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>''ga''; usage varies). One can easily check that conjugation by ''a'' is a group automorphism.

The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandone\u00f3n]] are related; the [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family.\n\nThe instrument is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.\n\nThe accordion is widely spread across the world.

The oldest name for this group of instruments is ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning \"harmonic, musical\". Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common.

What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:\n* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement\n* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size.\n* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual\n* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual\n* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual\n* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]]\n* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might [[voicing (music)|voice]] a particular instrument\n\n=== Universal components ===\n\n==== Bellows ====\n{{Listen\n|filename=AccordionBellowsSounds.ogg\n|title=Accordion bellows controlled sounds\n|description=A sample of effects that can be achieved with the bellows\u2014949&nbsp;KB\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Squeeze boxes accordion bandoneon concertina diatonic chromatic.jpg|thumb|265px|'''Bellows-Driven Instruments'''\n<br>\nPiano accordions\uff65\uff65\uff651,2,13<br>\nDiatonic button accordion\uff65\uff65\uff653<br>\nChromatic button accordions\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,14<br>\nDigital accordions(V-Accordions,[[Roland Corporation]])\uff65\uff65\uff6511,12,13,14<br>\n[[Bandoneon]]\uff65\uff65\uff654<br>\n[[English concertina]]\uff65\uff65\uff655<br>\n[[Anglo concertina|Anglo-german concertinas]](Anglo concertinas)\uff65\uff65\uff656,7,8,9,10]]\nThe [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.\n\nThe keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows.

These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as  to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n==== Pallet mechanism ====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.]]\n\n=== Variable components ===\nThe term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format. Not all have switches. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in several musical traditions, including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n==== Right-hand manual systems ====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody. Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7-9 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].    \n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows\n* [[6-plus-6-instruments|6-plus-6]] accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A [[Weltmeister]] piano accordion\n</gallery>\n\n==== Left-hand manual systems ====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for [[chord (music)|chords]].\n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was poorly traded outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n==== Reed ranks and switches ====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples.\n\nAll but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches.\n\n==== Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions ====\nIn describing  or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. Typically, these could be announced as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side.\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n==== Straps ====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing.\n\nOther accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n=== Unusual accordions ===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities \u2014 only a few have remained in use:\n*The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n*The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol\n*The [[schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement \u2014  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass \u2013 that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n*The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n*The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 09 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg.

It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability.\n\n== Use in various music genres ==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n=== Use in traditional music ===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nInvented in 1829, its popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was spread by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

Some popular acts use the instrument in their distinctive sounds. A notable example is [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award-winning]] [[Parody music|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his [[polka]]s.

The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Th\u00eame vari\u00e9 tr\u00e8s brillant pour accord\u00e9on methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]], wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.\n\nThe first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref>[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] Accordion Online</ref> In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. In 1937 the first [[accordion concerto]] was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Henry Doktorski, \"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,\" The Classical Free-Reed, Inc. (1997)</ref> Included among this group was the Italian-American [[John Serry Sr.]], whose ''[[Concerto for Free Bass Accordion]]'' was completed in 1964.<ref>Library of Congress Copyright Office, \"Concerto in C Major for Bassetti Accordion\", Composer: John Serry, June 4, 1968, Copyright # EP247602.</ref><ref>''Accordion World'', Bedford Hills, NY, 1968.</ref> American composer [[William P. Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite ''Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie'' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work ''Drang'' (1999), British composer [http://www.johnpalmer.org John Palmer]  pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan. [[Luciano Berio]] wrote ''Sequenza XIII'' (1995) for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universaledition.com/composers-and-works/luciano-berio-54/works/sequenza-xiii-4612|title=Luciano Berio: Sequenza XIII|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Accordionists like [[Mogens Ellegaard]], [[Joseph Macerollo]], [[Friedrich Lips]], [[Hugo Noth]], [[Stefan Hussong]], [[Italo Salizzato]], [[Teodoro Anzellotti]], [[Mie Miki]], and [[Geir Draugsvoll]], encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music on the free bass accordion.\n\nFrench composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles ''Correspondances'' (2003) and ''[[Le Temps l'horloge|Le Temps l'Horloge]]'' (2009).  Russian-born composer [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion.   Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely.   Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works are performed on either bandoneon or accordion.\n\n===Bosnia and Herzegovina===\nThe accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe accordion was brought to Brazil by settlers and immigrants from Europe (predominantly [[Portugal]] where the instrument is very popular) it is used today in both traditional and pop music.   Compared to many other countries, the instrument is very popular in mainstream pop music.   In some parts of the country, such as the north-east it is the most popular melodic instrument.   As opposed to most European folk accordion, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.\n\nThe accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forr\u00f3]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]) as principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the \"King of the [[bai\u00e3o (music)|Bai\u00e3o]]\") and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum).   This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the south-east of the country (in the Forr\u00f3 Universit\u00e1rio genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada).   Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music.\n\nIt is an important instrument in [[M\u00fasica sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the centre-west and south-east of Brazil and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country. In the south of the country (where there is a preponderance of the button accordion), in particular in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], it is used in the Brazilian ga\u00facho musical style, an important exponent of this music being [[Renato Borghetti]].\n\n=== Colombia ===\nThe accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andr\u00e9s Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as rock musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, who emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, and have come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia.\n\nEvery year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the \"King of Kings\" accordion competition takes place, where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the ''Pilonera Mayor'' prize.<ref>Smithsonian Channel, [https://archive.is/20130630080628/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 \"The Accordion Kings\"], 15 August 2010.</ref> This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.\n\n=== Mexico ===\n\n[[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]] heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to polka. [[Ram\u00f3n Ayala]] known in Mexico as the \"King of the Accordion\" is a norte\u00f1o musician. [[Cumbia]] which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as [[Celso Pi\u00f1a]] creating a more contemporary style.\n\nU.S. born Mexican musician [[Julieta Venegas]] incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock, pop and folk. She was influenced by her fellow Chicanos [[Los Lobos]] who also use the music of the accordion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Julieta-Venegas-6839928.php|title=Julieta Venegas: Life and songs in two cultures}}</ref>\n\n=== North Korea ===\nAccording to [[Barbara Demick]] in [[Nothing to Envy]], the accordion is known as \"the people's instrument\" and all North Korean teachers were expected to learn the accordion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/accordians/|title=20 incredible things you didn't know about North Korea|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in heavy metal music ===\nAccordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances.\n\nNotably, the Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist. One of their accordionists, Netta Skog, is now a member of [[Ensiferum]], another folk-metal band. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death-folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a ''zuger\u00f6rgeli''.\n\n== Manufacturing process ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017|small=yes}}\n\nThe most expensive{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} accordions are always fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a far{{peacock term|date=June 2017}} better tonal quality than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure{{clarify|date=June 2017}} sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,<ref>[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.</ref>{{irrelevant citation|reason=adds nothing to the article, except a gratuitous link to an external website, possibly for promotional purposes|date=June 2017}} a Japanese-born craftsman.\n\nThe manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion how-products-encyclopedia_accordion] Old way Back link to: how-products-encyclopedia accordion</ref>\n\nFamous{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} {{peacock term|date=June 2017}} centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter.

German companies such as [[Hohner]] and [[Weltmeister]] made large numbers of accordions, but production diminished by the end of the 20th century.  Hohner still manufactures its top-end models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in Germany, and Weltmeister instruments are still handmade by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA Akkordeon GmbH]] in [[Klingenthal]].

Goals can be explicitly defined, or can be induced. If the AI is programmed for \"[[reinforcement learning]]\", goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior and punishing others.{{efn|The act of doling out rewards can itself be formalized or automated into a \"[[reward function]]\".}} Alternatively, an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a \"[[fitness function]]\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems; this is similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food, or how dogs can be bred via [[artificial selection]] to possess desired traits.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 5}} Some AI systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead reason by analogy; these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are somehow implicit in their training data.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 7}} Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task.<ref>Lindenbaum, M., Markovitch, S., & Rusakov, D. (2004). Selective sampling for nearest neighbor classifiers. Machine learning, 54(2), 125\u2013152.</ref>\n\nAI often revolves around the use of [[algorithms]]. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.{{efn|Terminology varies; see [[algorithm characterizations]].}} A complex algorithm is often built on top of other, simpler, algorithms. A simple example of an algorithm is the following recipe for optimal play at [[tic-tac-toe]]:{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 1}}\n\n# If someone has a \"threat\" (that is, two in a row), take the remaining square. Otherwise,\n# if a move \"forks\" to create two threats at once, play that move. Otherwise,\n# take the center square if it is free. Otherwise,\n# if your opponent has played in a corner, take the opposite corner. Otherwise,\n# take an empty corner if one exists. Otherwise,\n# take any empty square.\n\nMany AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] (strategies, or \"rules of thumb\", that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms. Some of the \"learners\" described below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could theoretically, if given infinite data, time, and memory, learn to approximate any [[function (mathematics)|function]], including whatever combination of mathematical functions would best describe the entire world. These learners could therefore, in theory, derive all possible knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching it against the data. In practice, it is almost never possible to consider every possibility, because of the phenomenon of \"[[combinatorial explosion]]\", where the amount of time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering broad swaths of possibilities that are unlikely to be fruitful.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 3}} For example, when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from [[Denver]] to [[New York City|New York]] in the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through [[San Francisco]] or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding an pathfinding algorithm like [[A*]] can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered in turn.<ref>{{cite journal\n | first = P.

A second, more general, approach is [[Bayesian inference]]: \"If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way\". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI applications, are analogizers such as [[Support vector machine|SVM]] and [[K-nearest neighbor algorithm|nearest-neighbor]]: \"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza\". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the [[artificial neural network]] approach uses artificial \"[[neurons]]\" that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to \"reinforce\" connections that seemed to be useful. These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize, and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms;<ref>{{cite web | url=https://artificial-future.com/artificial-intelligence | title= Algorithm in Artificial Intelligence }}</ref> the best approach is often different depending on the problem.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 2, Chapter 4, Chapter 6}}<!-- The influenza example is expanded from Domingos chapter 6; feel free to put in a better example if you have one --><ref>{{cite news|title=Can neural network computers learn from experience, and if so, could they ever become what we would call 'smart'?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-neural-network-comput/|accessdate=24 March 2018|work=Scientific American|date=2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Overfitted Data.png|thumb|The blue line could be an example of [[overfitting]] a linear function due to random noise.]]\nLearning algorithms work on the basis that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious, such as \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". They can be nuanced, such as \"X% of [[Family (biology)|families]] have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is an Y% chance that undiscovered [[black swans]] exist\". Learners also work on the basis of \"[[Occam's razor#Probability theory and statistics|Occam's razor]]\": The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, to be successful, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as [[overfitting]]. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 6, Chapter 7}} Besides classic overfitting, learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=286}} A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers don't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture; instead, they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an \"adversarial\" image that the system misclassifies.{{efn|Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=AI Has a Hallucination Problem That's Proving Tough to Fix|url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-has-a-hallucination-problem-thats-proving-tough-to-fix/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=WIRED|date=2018}}</ref><ref>Goodfellow, Ian J., Jonathon Shlens, and Christian Szegedy. \"Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1412.6572 (2014).</ref>\n\n[[File:D\u00e9tection de personne - exemple 3.jpg|thumb|A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians, and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Matti|first1=D.|last2=Ekenel|first2=H.

The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.<ref name=\"Problems of AI\"/>\n\n=== Reasoning, problem solving ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction --><!-- SOLVED PROBLEMS -->\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref name=\"Reasoning\"/> By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref name=\"Uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\nThese algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems, because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name=\"Intractability\"/>  In fact, even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research was able to model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgements.<ref name=\"Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning\"/>\n\n=== Knowledge representation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:GFO taxonomy tree.png|right|thumb|An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts.]]\n{{Main|Knowledge representation|Commonsense knowledge}}\n\n[[Knowledge representation]]<ref name=\"Knowledge representation\"/> and [[knowledge engineering]]<ref name=\"Knowledge engineering\"/> are central to classical AI research. Some \"expert systems\" attempt to gather together explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the \"commonsense knowledge\" known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> situations, events, states and time;<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> causes and effects;<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/> and many other, less well researched domains. A representation of \"what exists\" is an [[ontology (computer science)|ontology]]: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them. The [[semantics]] of these are captured as [[description logic]] concepts, roles, and individuals, and typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the [[Web Ontology Language]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |date=June 2017 |title=Description Logics in Multimedia Reasoning |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-54066-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-54066-5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829120912/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319540658 |archivedate=29 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most general ontologies are called [[upper ontology|upper ontologies]], which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge<ref name=\"Ontology\"/> by acting as mediators between [[Domain ontology|domain ontologies]] that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern).

For example, if a bird comes up in conversation, people typically picture an animal that is fist sized, sings, and flies. None of these things are true about all birds. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] identified this problem in 1969<ref name=\"Qualification problem\"/> as the qualification problem: for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.<ref name=\"Default reasoning and non-monotonic logic\"/>\n;The breadth of commonsense knowledge: The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of [[commonsense knowledge]] (e.g., [[Cyc]]) require enormous amounts of laborious [[ontology engineering|ontological engineering]]\u2014they must be built, by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Breadth of commonsense knowledge\"/> \n;The subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge: Much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it \"feels too exposed\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}} or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.{{sfn|Gladwell|2005}} These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/> Knowledge like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge. As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that [[situated artificial intelligence|situated AI]], [[computational intelligence]], or [[#Statistical|statistical AI]] will provide ways to represent this kind of knowledge.<ref name=\"Intuition\"/>\n\n=== Planning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:Hierarchical-control-system.svg|thumb| A [[hierarchical control system]] is a form of [[control system]] in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy.]]\n\n{{Main|Automated planning and scheduling}}\n\nIntelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them.<ref name=\"Planning\"/> They need a way to visualize the future\u2014a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it\u2014and be able to make choices that maximize the [[utility]] (or \"value\") of available choices.<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/>\n\nIn classical planning problems, the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions.<ref name=\"Classical planning\"/> However, if the agent is not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment and make predictions, but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its assessment.<ref name=\"Non-deterministic planning\"/>\n\n[[Multi-agent planning]] uses the [[cooperation]] and competition of many agents to achieve a given goal. [[Emergent behavior]] such as this is used by [[evolutionary algorithms]] and [[swarm intelligence]].<ref name=\"Multi-agent planning\"/>\n\n=== Learning ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine learning}}\n\nMachine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,<ref>[[Alan Turing]] discussed the centrality of learning as early as 1950, in his classic paper \"[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]\".{{Harv|Turing|1950}} In 1956, at the original Dartmouth AI summer conference, [[Ray Solomonoff]] wrote a report on unsupervised probabilistic machine learning: \"An Inductive Inference Machine\".{{Harv|Solomonoff|1956}}</ref> is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.<ref>This is a form of [[Tom M. Mitchell|Tom Mitchell]]'s widely quoted definition of machine learning: \"A computer program is set to learn from an experience ''E'' with respect to some task ''T'' and some performance measure ''P'' if its performance on ''T'' as measured by ''P'' improves with experience ''E''.\"</ref><ref name=\"Machine learning\"/>\n\n[[Unsupervised learning]] is the ability to find patterns in a stream of input. [[Supervised learning]] includes both [[statistical classification|classification]] and numerical [[Regression analysis|regression]]. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from several categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.<ref name=\"Machine learning\"/> Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\". [[Computational learning theory]] can assess learners by [[computational complexity]], by [[sample complexity]] (how much data is required), or by other notions of [[optimization theory|optimization]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=M.

The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.\n\n=== Natural language processing ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n[[File:ParseTree.svg|thumb| A [[parse tree]] represents the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a sentence according to some [[formal grammar]].]]\n{{Main|Natural language processing}}\n\n[[Natural language processing]]<ref name=\"Natural language processing\"/> (NLP) gives machines the ability to read and [[natural language understanding|understand]] human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable [[natural-language user interface]]s and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include [[information retrieval]], [[text mining]], [[question answering]]<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis \"Versatile question answering systems: seeing in synthesis\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201125047/http://www.academia.edu/2475776/Versatile_question_answering_systems_seeing_in_synthesis |date=1 February 2016 }}, Mittal et al., IJIIDS, 5(2), 119\u2013142, 2011\n</ref> and [[machine translation]].<ref name=\"Applications of natural language processing\"/> Many current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic representations of text. \"Keyword spotting\" strategies for search are popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for \"dog\" might only match documents with the literal word \"dog\" and miss a document with the word \"poodle\". \"Lexical affinity\" strategies use the occurrence of words such as \"accident\" to [[sentiment analysis|assess the sentiment]] of a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, but continue to lack the semantic understanding required to classify isolated sentences well. Besides the usual difficulties with encoding semantic commonsense knowledge, existing semantic NLP sometimes scales too poorly to be viable in business applications. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of \"narrative\" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense reasoning.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cambria|first1=Erik|last2=White|first2=Bebo|title=Jumping NLP Curves: A Review of Natural Language Processing Research [Review Article]|journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine|date=May 2014|volume=9|issue=2|pages=48\u201357|doi=10.1109/MCI.2014.2307227}}</ref>\n\n=== Perception ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Machine perception|Computer vision|Speech recognition}}\n\n[[File:\u00c4\u00e4retuvastuse n\u00e4ide.png|thumb|[[Feature detection (computer vision)|Feature detection]] (pictured: [[edge detection]]) helps AI compose informative abstract structures out of raw data.]]\n\n[[Machine perception]]<ref name=\"Machine perception\"/> is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras (visible spectrum or infrared), microphones, wireless signals, and active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include [[speech recognition]],<ref name=\"Speech recognition\"/> [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]], and [[object recognition]].<ref name=\"Object recognition\"/> [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce exactly the same pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for example by using its \"object model\" to assess that fifty-meter pedestrians do not exist.<ref name=\"Computer vision\"/>\n\n=== Motion and manipulation ===\n<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->\n{{Main|Robotics}}\n\nAI is heavily used in [[robotics]].<ref name=\"Robotics\"/> Advanced [[robotic arm]]s and other [[industrial robot]]s, widely used in modern factories, can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of friction and gear slippage.<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> A modern mobile robot, when given a small, static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and [[robotic mapping|map]] its environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in [[endoscopy]]) the interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.

Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/>\n\n=== Cybernetics and brain simulation ===\n{{Main|Cybernetics|Computational neuroscience}}\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [[neurobiology]], [[information theory]], and [[cybernetics]]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [[W. Grey Walter]]'s [[turtle (robot)|turtles]] and the [[Johns Hopkins Beast]]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [[Princeton University]] and the [[Ratio Club]] in England.<ref name=\"AI's immediate precursors\"/> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.\n\n=== Symbolic ===\n{{Main|Symbolic AI}}\nWhen access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was centered in three institutions: [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Stanford]] and [[MIT]], and as described below, each one developed its own style of research. [[John Haugeland]] named these symbolic approaches to AI \"good old fashioned AI\" or \"[[GOFAI]]\".<ref name=\"GOFAI\"/> During the 1960s, symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level thinking in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on [[cybernetics]] or [[artificial neural network]]s were abandoned or pushed into the background.<ref>The most dramatic case of sub-symbolic AI being pushed into the background was the devastating critique of [[perceptron]]s by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]] in 1969. See [[History of AI]], [[AI winter]], or [[Frank Rosenblatt]].</ref>\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with [[artificial general intelligence]] and considered this the goal of their field.\n\n==== Cognitive simulation ====\nEconomist [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] and [[Allen Newell]] studied human problem-solving skills and attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field of artificial intelligence, as well as [[cognitive science]], [[operations research]] and [[management science]]. Their research team used the results of [[psychology|psychological]] experiments to develop programs that simulated the techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] would eventually culminate in the development of the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] architecture in the middle 1980s.<ref name=\"AI at CMU in the 60s\"/><ref name=\"Soar\"/>\n\n==== Logic-based ====\nUnlike Simon and Newell, [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem-solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.<ref name=\"Biological intelligence vs. intelligence in general\"/> His laboratory at [[Stanford University|Stanford]] ([[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|SAIL]]) focused on using formal [[logic]] to solve a wide variety of problems, including [[knowledge representation]], [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] and [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"AI at Stanford in the 60s\"/> Logic was also the focus of the work at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming language [[Prolog]] and the science of [[logic programming]].<ref name=\"AI at Edinburgh and France in the 60s\"/>\n\n==== Anti-logic or scruffy ====\nResearchers at [[MIT]] (such as [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]])<ref name=\"AI at MIT in the 60s\"/> found that solving difficult problems in [[computer vision|vision]] and [[natural language processing]] required ad-hoc solutions \u2013 they argued that there was no simple and general principle (like [[logic]]) that would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior. [[Roger Schank]] described their \"anti-logic\" approaches as \"[[Neats vs. scruffies|scruffy]]\" (as opposed to the \"[[neats vs. scruffies|neat]]\" paradigms at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] and Stanford).<ref name=\"Neats vs. scruffies\"/> [[Commonsense knowledge bases]] (such as [[Doug Lenat]]'s [[Cyc]]) are an example of \"scruffy\" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated concept at a time.<ref name=\"Cyc\"/>\n\n====Knowledge-based====\nWhen computers with large memories became available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to build [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] into AI applications.<ref name=\"Knowledge revolution\"/> This \"knowledge revolution\" led to the development and deployment of [[expert system]]s (introduced by [[Edward Feigenbaum]]), the first truly successful form of AI software.<ref name=\"Expert systems\"/> Key component on system arhitecute for all expert systems is Knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrates AI.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1036/1097-8542.248550|title=Expert systems|last=Frederick|first=Hayes-Roth,|last2=William|first2=Murray,|website=AccessScience|language=en|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.248550|access-date=2018-10-20|last3=Leonard|first3=Adelman,}}</ref> The knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.\n\n=== Sub-symbolic ===\nBy the 1980s, progress in symbolic AI seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially [[machine perception|perception]], [[robotics]], [[machine learning|learning]] and [[pattern recognition]]. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.<ref name=\"Symbolic vs. sub-symbolic\"/> Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without specific representations of knowledge.\n\n==== Embodied intelligence ====\nThis includes [[embodied agent|embodied]], [[situated]], [[behavior-based AI|behavior-based]], and [[nouvelle AI]]. Researchers from the related field of [[robotics]], such as [[Rodney Brooks]], rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.<ref name=\"Embodied AI\"/> Their work revived the non-symbolic viewpoint of the early [[cybernetic]]s researchers of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of [[control theory]] in AI. This coincided with the development of the [[embodied mind thesis]] in the related field of [[cognitive science]]: the idea that aspects of the body (such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher intelligence.\n\nWithin [[developmental robotics]], developmental learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).{{sfn|Weng|McClelland|Pentland|Sporns|2001}}{{sfn|Lungarella|Metta|Pfeifer|Sandini|2003}}{{sfn|Asada|Hosoda|Kuniyoshi|Ishiguro|2009}}{{sfn|Oudeyer|2010}}\n\n====Computational intelligence and soft computing====\nInterest in [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and \"[[connectionism]]\" was revived by [[David Rumelhart]] and others in the middle of the 1980s.<ref name=\"Revival of connectionism\"/> [[Artificial neural network]]s are an example of [[soft computing]] --- they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often sufficient. Other [[soft computing]] approaches to AI include [[fuzzy system]]s, [[evolutionary computation]] and many statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied collectively by the emerging discipline of [[computational intelligence]].<ref name=\"Computational intelligence\"/>\n\n=== Statistical learning ===\nMuch of traditional GOFAI got bogged down on ''ad hoc'' patches to symbolic computation that worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results. However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical tools, such as [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMM), [[information theory]], and normative Bayesian [[decision theory]] to compare or to unify competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high level of collaboration with more established fields (like [[mathematics]], economics or [[operations research]]).{{efn|While such a \"victory of the neats\" may be a consequence of the field becoming more mature, [[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|AIMA]] states that in practice both [[neats and scruffies|neat and scruffy]] approaches continue to be necessary in AI research.}} Compared with GOFAI, new \"statistical learning\" techniques such as HMM and neural networks were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as [[data mining]], without necessarily acquiring semantic understanding of the datasets. The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy models; AI research was becoming more [[scientific method|scientific]]. Nowadays results of experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with difficulty) reproducible.<ref name=\"Formal methods in AI\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hutson|first1=Matthew|title=Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725|accessdate=28 April 2018|work=[[Science Magazine|Science]]|date=16 February 2018|pages=725\u2013726|language=en|doi=10.1126/science.359.6377.725|bibcode=2018Sci...359..725H}}</ref> Different statistical learning techniques have different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite possible combinations of natural language.{{sfn|Norvig|2012}} Critics note that the shift from GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from [[Explainable AI]]. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence.{{sfn|Langley|2011}}{{sfn|Katz|2012}}\n\n=== Integrating the approaches ===\n;Intelligent agent paradigm: An [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and organizations of human beings (such as [[firm]]s). The paradigm allows researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any approach that works \u2013 some agents are symbolic and logical, some are sub-symbolic [[artificial neural network]]s and others may use new approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to communicate with other fields\u2014such as [[decision theory]] and economics\u2014that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example, because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment, planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.<ref name=\"Intelligent agents\"/>\n\n;[[Agent architecture]]s and [[cognitive architecture]]s: Researchers have designed systems to build intelligent systems out of interacting [[intelligent agents]] in a [[multi-agent system]].<ref name=\"Agent architectures\"/> A [[hierarchical control system]] provides a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit planning and world modelling.<ref name=\"Hierarchical control system\"/> Some cognitive architectures are custom-built to solve a narrow problem; others, such as [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]], are designed to mimic human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern extensions of Soar are [[hybrid intelligent system]]s that include both symbolic and sub-symbolic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laird|first1=John|title=Extending the Soar cognitive architecture|journal=Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications|date=2008|volume=171|page=224|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.77.2473&rep=rep1&type=pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lieto|first1=Antonio|last2=Bhatt|first2=Mehul|last3=Oltramari|first3=Alessandro|last4=Vernon|first4=David|title=The role of cognitive architectures in general artificial intelligence|journal=Cognitive Systems Research|date=May 2018|volume=48|pages=1\u20133|doi=10.1016/j.cogsys.2017.08.003}}</ref>\n\n== Tools ==\nAI has developed a large number of tools to solve the most difficult problems in [[computer science]]. A few of the most general of these methods are discussed below.\n\n=== Search and optimization ===\n\n{{Main|Search algorithm|Mathematical optimization|Evolutionary computation}}\n\nMany problems in AI can be solved in theory by intelligently searching through many possible solutions:<ref name=\"Search\"/> [[#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|Reasoning]] can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from [[premise]]s to [[Logical consequence|conclusions]], where each step is the application of an [[inference rule]].<ref name=\"Logic as search\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|Planning]] algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called [[means-ends analysis]].<ref name=\"Planning as search\"/> [[Robotics]] algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use [[local search (optimization)|local searches]] in [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]].<ref name=\"Configuration space\"/> Many [[machine learning|learning]] algorithms use search algorithms based on [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]].\n\nSimple exhaustive searches<ref name=\"Uninformed search\"/> are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the [[search algorithm|search space]] (the number of places to search) quickly grows to [[Astronomically large|astronomical numbers]]. The result is a search that is [[Computation time|too slow]] or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"[[heuristics]]\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those that are more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies heuristics can also serve to entirely eliminate some choices that are unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"[[pruning (algorithm)|pruning]] the [[search tree]]\"). [[Heuristics]] supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.<ref name=\"Informed search\"/> Heuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.{{sfn|Tecuci|2012}}\n\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind [[hill climbing]]: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are [[simulated annealing]], [[beam search]] and [[random optimization]].<ref name=\"Optimization search\"/>\n\n[[File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif|thumb|A [[particle swarm optimization|particle swarm]] seeking the [[global minimum]]]]\n[[Evolutionary computation]] uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, [[artificial selection|selecting]] only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic [[evolutionary algorithms]] include [[genetic algorithms]], [[gene expression programming]], and [[genetic programming]].<ref name=\"Genetic programming\"/> Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via [[swarm intelligence]] algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are [[particle swarm optimization]] (inspired by bird [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]) and [[ant colony optimization]] (inspired by [[ant trail]]s).<ref name=\"Society based learning\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Daniel Merkle|author2=Martin Middendorf|editor1-last=Burke|editor1-first=Edmund K.|editor2-last=Kendall|editor2-first=Graham|title=Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9781461469407|language=en|chapter=Swarm Intelligence}}</ref>\n\n=== Logic ===\n\n{{Main|Logic programming|Automated reasoning}}\n\n[[Logic]]<ref name=\"Logic\"/> is used for knowledge representation and problem solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the [[satplan]] algorithm uses logic for [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]]<ref name=\"Satplan\"/> and [[inductive logic programming]] is a method for [[machine learning|learning]].<ref name=\"Symbolic learning techniques\"/>\n\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. [[Propositional logic]]<ref name=\"Propositional logic\"/> involves [[truth function]]s such as \"or\" and \"not\". [[First-order logic]]<ref name=\"First-order logic\"/> adds [[quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. [[Fuzzy set theory]] assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry) that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false. [[Fuzzy logic]] is successfully used in [[control system]]s to allow experts to contribute vague rules such as \"if you are close to the destination station and moving fast, increase the train's brake pressure\"; these vague rules can then be numerically refined within the system. Fuzzy logic fails to scale well in knowledge bases; many AI researchers question the validity of chaining fuzzy-logic inferences.{{efn|\"There exist many different types of uncertainty, vagueness, and ignorance... [We] independently confirm the inadequacy of systems for reasoning about uncertainty that propagates numerical factors according to only to which connectives appear in assertions.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Elkin|first1=Charles|title=The paradoxical success of fuzzy logic|journal=IEEE expert|date=1994|volume=9|issue=4|pages=3\u201349}}</ref>}}<ref name=\"Fuzzy logic\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=What is 'fuzzy logic'?

Several extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of [[knowledge representation|knowledge]], such as: [[description logic]]s;<ref name=\"Representing categories and relations\"/> [[situation calculus]], [[event calculus]] and [[fluent calculus]] (for representing events and time);<ref name=\"Representing time\"/> [[Causality#Causal calculus|causal calculus]];<ref name=\"Representing causation\"/> belief calculus;<ref>\"The Belief Calculus and Uncertain Reasoning\", Yen-Teh Hsia</ref> and [[modal logic]]s.<ref name=\"Representing knowledge about knowledge\"/>\n\nOverall, qualitiative symbolic logic is brittle and scales poorly in the presence of [[noise (signal processing)|noise]] or other uncertainty. Exceptions to rules are numerous, and it is difficult for logical systems to function in the presence of contradictory rules.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Logic and Probability|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/logic-probability/|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=5 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===\n\n{{Main|Bayesian network|Hidden Markov model|Kalman filter|Particle filter|Decision theory|Utility theory}}\n[[File:EM Clustering of Old Faithful data.gif|right|frame|[[Expectation-maximization]] clustering of [[Old Faithful]] eruption data starts from a random guess but then successfully converges on an accurate clustering of the two physically distinct modes of eruption.]]\n\nMany problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from [[probability]] theory and economics.<ref name=\"Stochastic methods for uncertain reasoning\"/>\n\n[[Bayesian network]]s<ref name=\"Bayesian networks\"/> are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the [[Bayesian inference]] algorithm),<ref name=\"Bayesian inference\"/> [[Machine learning|learning]] (using the [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]),{{efn|Expectation-maximization, one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning, allows clustering in the presence of unknown [[latent variables]]{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=210}}}}<ref name=\"Bayesian learning\"/> [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]] (using [[decision network]]s)<ref name=\"Bayesian decision networks\"/> and [[machine perception|perception]] (using [[dynamic Bayesian network]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping [[machine perception|perception]] systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., [[hidden Markov model]]s or [[Kalman filter]]s).<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> Compared with symbolic logic, formal Bayesian inference is computationally expensive. For inference to be tractable, most observations must be [[conditionally independent]] of one another. Complicated graphs with diamonds or other \"loops\" (undirected [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]s) can require a sophisticated method such as [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]], which spreads an ensemble of [[random walk]]ers throughout the Bayesian network and attempts to converge to an assessment of the conditional probabilities. Bayesian networks are used on [[Xbox Live]] to rate and match players; wins and losses are \"evidence\" of how good a player is. [[AdSense]] uses a Bayesian network with over 300 million edges to learn which ads to serve.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=chapter 6}}\n\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"[[utility]]\": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using [[decision theory]], [[decision analysis]],<ref name=\"Decisions theory and analysis\"/> and [[applied information economics|information value theory]].<ref name=\"Information value theory\"/> These tools include models such as [[Markov decision process]]es,<ref name=\"Markov decision process\"/> dynamic [[decision network]]s,<ref name=\"Stochastic temporal models\"/> [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]].<ref name=\"Game theory and mechanism design\"/>\n\n=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===\n\n{{Main|Classifier (mathematics)|Statistical classification|Machine learning}}\n\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if shiny then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]] are functions that use [[pattern matching]] to determine a closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class can be seen as a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name=\"Classifiers\"/>\n\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and [[machine learning]] approaches. The [[decision tree learning|decision tree]]<ref name=\"Decision tree\"/> is perhaps the most widely used machine learning algorithm.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=88}} Other widely used classifiers are the [[Artificial neural network|neural network]],<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/>\n[[k-nearest neighbor algorithm]],{{efn|The most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=187}}}}<ref name=\"K-nearest neighbor algorithm\"/>\n[[kernel methods]] such as the [[support vector machine]] (SVM),{{efn|SVM displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=188}}}}<ref name=\"Kernel methods\"/>\n[[Gaussian mixture model]],<ref name=\"Gaussian mixture model\"/> and the extremely popular [[naive Bayes classifier]].{{efn|Naive Bayes is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\" at Google, due in part to its scalability.{{sfn|Domingos|2015|p=152}}}}<ref name=\"Naive Bayes classifier\"/> Classifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, the dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.<ref name=\"Classifier performance\"/>{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2009|loc=18.12: Learning from Examples: Summary}}\n\n=== Artificial neural networks ===\n\n{{Main|Artificial neural network|Connectionism}}\n[[File:Artificial neural network.svg|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]\n\nNeural networks, or neural nets, were inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" ''N'' accepts input from multiple other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), cast a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron ''N'' should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"[[Hebbian learning|fire together, wire together]]\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. The net forms \"concepts\" that are distributed among a subnetwork of shared{{efn|Each individual neuron is likely to participate in more than one concept.}} neurons that tend to fire together; a concept meaning \"leg\" might be coupled with a subnetwork meaning \"foot\" that includes the sound for \"foot\". Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes. Modern neural nets can learn both continuous functions and, surprisingly, digital logical operations. Neural networks' early successes included predicting the stock market and (in 1995) a mostly self-driving car.{{efn|Steering for the 1995 \"[[History of autonomous cars#1990s|No Hands Across America]]\" required \"only a few human assists\".}}{{sfn|Domingos|2015|loc=Chapter 4}} In the 2010s, advances in neural networks using deep learning thrust AI into widespread public consciousness and contributed to an enormous upshift in corporate AI spending; for example, AI-related [[mergers and acquisitions|M&A]] in 2017 was over 25 times as large as in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Deep Learning Is Suddenly Changing Your Life|url=http://fortune.com/ai-artificial-intelligence-deep-machine-learning/|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=Fortune|date=2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Google leads in the race to dominate artificial intelligence|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21732125-tech-giants-are-investing-billions-transformative-technology-google-leads-race|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=The Economist|date=2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe study of non-learning [[artificial neural network]]s<ref name=\"Neural networks\"/> began in the decade before the field of AI research was founded, in the work of [[Walter Pitts]] and [[Warren McCullouch]].

In contrast to the standard Turing test, CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human as opposed to being administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed to be the result of a person taking the test.

A few companies involved with AI include [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]], [[Google]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref>\"33 Corporations Working On Autonomous Vehicles\". CB Insights. N.p., 11 August 2016. 12 November 2016.</ref>\n\nMany components contribute to the functioning of self-driving cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.<ref>West, Darrell M. \"Moving forward: Self-driving vehicles in China, Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States\".

In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with a map of the area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.<ref>McFarland, Matt. \"Google's artificial intelligence breakthrough may have a huge impact on self-driving cars and much more\".

To make a driver-less automobile, engineers must program it to handle high-risk situations. These situations could include a head-on collision with pedestrians.  The car's main goal should be to make a decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrians and saving the passengers in the car.  But there is a possibility the car would need to make a decision that would put someone in danger. In other words, the car would need to decide to save the pedestrians or the passengers.<ref>ArXiv, E. T. (26 October 2015). Why Self-Driving Cars Must Be Programmed to Kill.

Research in this area includes [[machine ethics]], [[artificial moral agents]], and [[friendly AI]].\n\n==== Artificial moral agents ====\nWendell Wallach introduced the concept of [[artificial moral agents]] (AMA) in his book ''Moral Machines''<ref>Wendell Wallach (2010). ''Moral Machines'', Oxford University Press.</ref> For Wallach, AMAs have become a part of the research landscape of artificial intelligence as guided by its two central questions which he identifies as \"Does Humanity Want Computers Making Moral Decisions\"<ref>Wallach, pp 37\u201354.</ref> and \"Can (Ro)bots Really Be Moral\".<ref>Wallach, pp 55\u201373.</ref> For Wallach the question is not centered on the issue of ''whether'' machines can demonstrate the equivalent of moral behavior in contrast to the ''constraints'' which society may place on the development of AMAs.<ref>Wallach, Introduction chapter.</ref>\n\n==== Machine ethics ====\n{{Main|Machine ethics}}\nThe field of machine ethics is concerned with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Michael Anderson and Susan Leigh Anderson (2011), Machine Ethics, Cambridge University Press.</ref> The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: \"Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The time has come for adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics is concerned with the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems\u2014it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension is at the root of all fear concerning machine intelligence.

Rubin]] believes that AI can be neither designed nor guaranteed to be benevolent.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles T. Rubin |date=Spring 2003 |title=Artificial Intelligence and Human Nature &#124;`The New Atlantis |volume=1 |pages=88\u2013100 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611115223/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/artificial-intelligence-and-human-nature |archivedate=11 June 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref> He argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no ''a priori'' reason to believe that they would be sympathetic to our system of morality, which has evolved along with our particular biology (which AIs would not share). Hyper-intelligent software may not necessarily decide to support the continued existence of humanity and would be extremely difficult to stop. This topic has also recently begun to be discussed in academic publications as a real source of risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth.\n\nOne proposal to deal with this is to ensure that the first generally intelligent AI is '[[Friendly AI]]', and will then be able to control subsequently developed AIs. Some question whether this kind of check could really remain in place.\n\nLeading AI researcher [[Rodney Brooks]] writes, \"I think it is a mistake to be worrying about us developing malevolent AI anytime in the next few hundred years. I think the worry stems from a fundamental error in not distinguishing the difference between the very real recent advances in a particular aspect of AI, and the enormity and complexity of building sentient volitional intelligence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks|first=Rodney|title=artificial intelligence is a tool, not a threat|date=10 November 2014|url=http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112130954/http://www.rethinkrobotics.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-threat/|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\nIf an AI system replicates all key aspects of human intelligence, will that system also be [[Sentience|sentient]] \u2013 will it have a [[mind]] which has [[consciousness|conscious experiences]]? This question is closely related to the philosophical problem as to the nature of human consciousness, generally referred to as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].\n\n==== Consciousness ====\n{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}\n[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.<ref name=Chalmers>{{cite journal |url=http://www.imprint.co.uk/chalmers.html |title=Facing up to the problem of consciousness |last=Chalmers |first=David |authorlink=David Chalmers |journal=[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]] |volume= 2 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=200\u2013219}} See also [http://consc.net/papers/facing.html this link]\n</ref> The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all. Human [[information processing]] is easy to explain, however human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. \n\nFor example, consider what happens when a person is shown a color swatch and identifies it, saying \"it's red\". The easy problem only requires understanding the machinery in the brain that makes it possible for a person to know that the color swatch is red. The hard problem is that people also know something else -- they also know ''what red looks like''. (Consider that a person born blind can know that something is red without knowing what red looks like.){{efn|This is based on [[Mary's Room]], a thought experiment first proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in 1982}} Everyone knows subjective experience exists, because they do it every day (e.g., all sighted people know what red looks like). The hard problem is explaining how the brain creates it, why it exists, and how it is different than knowledge and other aspects of the brain.\n\n==== Computationalism and functionalism ====\n{{Main|Computationalism|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)}}\nComputationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind or the human brain (or both) is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing.<ref>[[Steven Horst|Horst, Steven]], (2005) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/ \"The Computational Theory of Mind\"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind-body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].\n\n==== Strong AI hypothesis ====\n{{Main|Chinese room}}\nThe philosophical position that John Searle has named [[strong AI hypothesis|\"strong AI\"]] states: \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"<ref name=\"Searle's strong AI\"/> Searle counters this assertion with his [[Chinese room]] argument, which asks us to look ''inside'' the computer and try to find where the \"mind\" might be.<ref name=\"Chinese room\"/>\n\n==== Robot rights ====\n{{Main|Robot rights}}\nIf a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also ''[[sentience|feel]]''?

Emmerson's version of the band released the album ''The Source'' in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|work = The Guardian |title = Afro Celt Sound System \u2013 Review |url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/01/afro-celt-sound-system-the-source-review-daring-triumphant}}</ref>\n\nThe dispute ended on December 21, 2016, with an announcement on social media.\n\n==Formation==\nThe inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991, when Simon Emmerson, a [[Grammy Award]]-nominated British [[Record producer|producer]] and guitarist, collaborated with Afro-pop star [[Baaba Maal]]. While making an album with Maal in Senegal, Emmerson was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air. Back in London, Irish musician [[Davy Spillane]] told Emmerson about a belief that nomadic Celts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe. Whether or not the theory was true, Emmerson was intrigued by the two countries' musical affinities.\n\nIn an experiment that would prove successful, Emmerson brought two members of Baaba Maal's band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create. Adding a dash of modern sound, Emmerson also brought in English dance mixers for an electronic beat. \"People thought I was mad when I touted the idea,\" Emmerson told Jim Carroll of ''[[The Irish Times]]''. \"At the time, I was out of favour with the London club scene. I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary\".<ref name=\"Jim Carroll\">{{cite web|author = Jim Carroll |url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/celts-get-afro-beat-1.317903|title = Celts get Afro beat|publisher = The Irish Times|date = 14 July 2001|accessdate = 15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nJamming in the studios at Real World, musician Peter Gabriel's recording facilities in [[Wiltshire, England]], the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week. This album, ''[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]'', was released by Real World Records in 1996, and marked the debut of the Afro Celt Sound System.\n\n\"Prior to that first album being made, none of us knew if it would work,\" musician James McNally told Larry Katz of the Boston Herald. \"We were strangers who didn't even speak the same language. But we were bowled over by this communication that took place beyond language.\"{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} McNally, who grew up second-generation Irish in London, played whistles, keyboards, piano, [[bodhran]], and bamboo flute.\n\n''Sound Magic'' has now sold over 300,000 copies. The band performed at festivals, raves, and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians, Moussa Sissokho on talking drum and djembe and [[N'Faly Kouyate]] on vocals, [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] and [[balafon]].\n\nJust as the second album was getting off the ground, one of the group's core musicians, 27-year-old [[keyboardist]] [[Jo Bruce]] (son of [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bass player [[Jack Bruce]]), died suddenly of an [[asthma]] attack. The band was devastated, and the album was put on hold. Then Irish pop star [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] came to the rescue, collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss. \"[O'Connor] blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful,\" McNally told Katz. \"We had this track we didn't know what to do with. Sin\u00e9ad scribbled a few lyrics and bang! She left us completely choked up.\"{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} So taken was the band with O'Connor's song, \"Release,\" that they used the name for the title of their album. ''[[Volume 2: Release]]'' hit the music stores in 1999, and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide.\n\nIn 2000 the group was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the Best World Music category. The band, composed at the time of eight members from six countries (England, [[Senegal]], Guinea, Ireland, France and [[Kenya]]), took pride in its ability to bring people together through music. \"We can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we're at home,\" McNally told Patrick MacDonald of [[The Seattle Times]]''. \"We're breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music. We leave a door open to communicate with each other's traditions. And it's changed our lives\".{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn 2001 the group released ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]'', which climbed to number one on Billboard's Top World Music Albums chart. Featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and [[Robert Plant]], the album also incorporated a heightened African sound. \"On the first two records, the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic, London club side of the equation,\" Emmerson told the Irish Times's Carroll. \"For this one, we wanted to have more African vocals and input than we'd done before.\"<ref name=\"Jim Carroll\"/> Again the Afro Celt Sound System met with success. Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine praised the album as \"a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music.\"{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} The single \"[[When You're Falling]]\", with vocals by Gabriel, became a radio hit in the United States.\n\nIn 2003, for the ''[[Seed (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Seed]]'' album, they temporarily changed their name to the simpler '''Afrocelts'''; this was subsequently regarded as a mistake, and they reverted to the longer and more familiar band name for their subsequent albums, ''[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]'', a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums, ''[[Volume 5: Anatomic]]'' (their fifth studio album), and ''[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]\".\n\nThey played a number of shows to promote ''Volume 5: Anatomic'' in 2006 and summer 2007, ending with a gig in Korea,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrocelts.org/wst_page9.html |title=Afro Celt Sound System Fan Website - ACSS News |publisher=Afrocelts.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}</ref> before taking an extended break to work on side projects, amongst them ''[[The Imagined Village]]'' featuring Simon Emmerson and Johnny Kalsi. Starting in the summer of 2010, the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2-CD album, ''[[Capture - Afro Celt Sound System 1995-2010]]'', released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records. Further performances continue to the present day, and a new album-in-progress titled ''Born'' was announced on their website in 2014. Following the split (see below), Emmerson's version of the band released the album The Source in 2016.\n\n== Split ==\n\nDuring the year 2015, the band had split into two formations, one of them including [[Simon Emmerson]], [[N'Faly Kouyate]] and [[Johnny Kalsi]], the other one [[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]] and [[Martin Russell]]. The split was announced on the band's website in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=An open letter about what has been happening to Afro Celt Sound System|url=http://afroceltsoundsystem.com/Afro-Celt-Sound-System-open-letter|date = January 2016|accessdate = 15 February 2016}}</ref> The dispute officially ended with an announcement on social media on December 21, 2016. \"Simon Emmerson, James McNally and Martin Russell are pleased to announce that they have been able to set aside their differences and come to an amicable agreement to bring their dispute to an end. Going forward, McNally, Russell and Emmerson have agreed that Emmerson will continue to perform as Afro Celt Sound System and McNally and Russell will work under a new name to be announced in due course.\nWhile McNally, Russell and Emmerson will no longer be performing or working together they recognise, and are grateful for each other's contribution to Afro Celt Sound System over the past two decades and will be working with the extensive community of musicians that make up the long standing Afro Celt Sound System family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/officialafroceltsoundsystem/posts/1384670074878165|title=Afro Celt Sound System|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> Emmerson's version of the band released the album The Source in 2016.\n\n==Members==\nWhen Afro Celt Sound System began their musical journey in the mid-1990s during the [[Real World Records|Real World]] Recording Week, the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non-existent. However, over time, a combination of people became most often associated with the name Afro Celt Sound System (while ''Volume 5: Anatomic'' only lists Emmerson, McNally, \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird and Russell as regulars). The divided grouping of the band into two versions, both operating under the name Afro Celt Sound System, began in January 2016 and was resolved in December 2016 after McNally and Russell agreed to work under a different name from Emmerson.\n \n*[[Simon Emmerson]]\n*[[N'Faly Kouyate]]\n*[[Johnny Kalsi]]\n*Moussa Sissokho\n*[[Griogair Labhruidh]]\n*[[Ronan Browne]]\n*Emer Mayock\n*[[Davy Spillane]]\n\n'''Russell/McNally version'''\n*[[Martin Russell]]\n*[[James McNally (musician)|James McNally]]\n*Ian Markin\n*Tim Bradshaw\n*Babara Bangoura\n*Dorothee Munyaneza\n*Kadially Kouyat\u00e9\n*[[Dav Daheley]]\n\nOther musicians who have performed or recorded with Afro Celt Sound System include: [[Jimmy Mahon]], Demba Barry, [[Babara Bangoura]], [[Iarla \u00d3 Lion\u00e1ird]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Pete Lockett]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Pina Kollar]], [[Dorothee Munyaneza]], [[Sevara Nazarkhan]], [[Simon Massey]], [[Jesse Cook]], [[Martin Hayes (musician)|Martin Hayes]], [[Eileen Ivers]], [[Mundy]], [[Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh]] and [[Ciar\u00e1n Tourish]] of [[Altan (band)|Altan]], [[Ronan Browne]], [[Michael McGoldrick]], [[Myrdhin]], [[Shooglenifty]], [[Mairead Nesbitt]], [[Nigel Eaton]], [[Davy Spillane]], [[Jonas Bruce]], [[Heather Nova]], [[Julie Murphy (singer)|Julie Murphy]] and [[Ayub Ogada]], Ross Ainslie.<ref>{{cite web|work = The Barbican |title = Afro Celt Sound System   |url = http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=19669}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n* ''[[Volume 1: Sound Magic]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Volume 2: Release]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Volume 3: Further in Time]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Seed (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Seed]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Pod (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Pod]]'' (Remix album) (2004)\n* ''[[Volume 5: Anatomic]]'' (2005)\n* ''Capture (1995\u20132010)'' (2010) (compilation)\n* \"[[When You're Falling]]\" featuring Peter Gabriel (2012) (Single from Volume 3)\n* ''The Source'' (2016)\n\nThey also recorded the soundtrack for the PC game ''[[Magic and Mayhem]]'', released in 1998.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Afro Celt Soundsystem}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://realworldrecords.com/artist/340/afro-celt-sound-system/ Real World Records page]\n\n{{Afro Celt Sound System}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Afro Celt Sound System}}\n[[Category:Celtic fusion groups]]\n[[Category:Real World Records artists]]\n[[Category:British world music groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1995]]", "sha1": "77w1c42l52fhqx92nssytg4d30u96jz"}}, {"title": "Ancient philosophy", "ns": "0", "id": "1167", "revision": {"id": "859176573", "parentid": "858663296", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T07:37:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Omnipaedista", "id": "8524693"}, "comment": "/* Ancient Indian philosophy */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the journal|Ancient Philosophy (journal)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}\nThis page lists some links to '''ancient philosophy'''.

His epistemology can be regarded as primitive materialist [[empiricism]]; he believed that human cognition ought to be based on one's perceptions &ndash; one's sensory experiences, such as sight and hearing &ndash; instead of imagination or internal logic, elements founded on the human capacity for abstraction.

It is said to have parallels with that of the Ancient Greek [[sophists]] or [[dialectician]]s. The most notable Logician was [[Gongsun Longzi]].\n* The [[School of Diplomacy]] or School of Vertical and Horizontal [Alliances], which focused on practical matters instead of any moral principle, so it stressed political and diplomatic tactics, and debate and lobbying skill. Scholars from this school were good orators, debaters and tacticians.\n* The Miscellaneous School, which integrated teachings from different schools; for instance, [[L\u00fc Buwei]] found scholars from different schools to write a book called [[L\u00fcshi Chunqiu]] cooperatively. This school tried to integrate the merits of various schools and avoid their perceived flaws.\n* The School of \"Minor-talks\", which was not a unique school of thought, but a philosophy constructed of all the thoughts which were discussed by and originated from normal people on the street.\n* Another group is the School of the Military that studied strategy and the [[philosophy of war]]; [[Sunzi]] and [[Sun Bin]] were influential leaders. However, this school was not one of the \"Ten Schools\" defined by Hanshu.\n\n====Early Imperial China====\nThe founder of the [[Qin Dynasty]], who implemented Legalism as the official philosophy, [[To burn the classics and to bury the scholars|quashed Mohist and Confucianist schools]]. Legalism remained influential until the emperors of the [[Han Dynasty]] adopted Daoism and later Confucianism as official doctrine. These latter two became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of Buddhism.\n\nConfucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest [[Intellectual|thinker]] was [[Dong Zhongshu]], who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination ''Old Text'') that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the ''[[Xuanxue]]'' (mysterious learning), also called ''Neo-Taoism''. The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ''ming'' and ''wuming''). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of ''[[feng liu]]'' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\n[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Northern and Southern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect, and there was even a theory about [[Laozi]], founder of Taoism, who went to India and taught his philosophy to [[Buddha]]. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was far more successful in China than its rival [[Hinayana]], and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were [[Sengzhao]] and [[Daosheng]]. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the [[Zen]] sect.\n\n===Philosophers===\n* [[Taoism]]\n** [[Laozi]] (5th\u20134th century BCE)\n** [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] (4th century BCE)\n** [[Zhang Daoling]]\n** [[Zhang Jue]] (died 184 CE)\n** [[Ge Hong]] (283 \u2013 343 CE)\n* [[Confucianism]]\n** [[Confucius]]\n** [[Mencius]]\n** [[Xun Zi]] (c. 312 \u2013 230 BCE)\n* [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]]\n** [[Li Si]]\n** [[Li Kui (legalist)|Li Kui]]\n** [[Han Fei]]\n** Mi Su Yu\n** [[Shang Yang]]\n** [[Shen Buhai]]\n** [[Shen Dao]]\n* [[Mohism]]\n** [[Mozi]]\n** Song Xing\n* [[School of Names|Logicians]]\n** [[Deng Xi]]\n** [[Hui Shi]] (380\u2013305 BCE)\n** [[Gongsun Long]] (c. 325 \u2013 c. 250 BCE)\n* [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]]\n** Xu Xing\n* [[School of Naturalists|Naturalism]]\n** [[Zou Yan]] (305 \u2013 240 BCE)\n* [[Neotaoism]]\n** [[Wang Bi]]\n** [[Guo Xiang]]\n** [[Xiang Xiu]]\n* [[School of Diplomacy]]\n** [[Guiguzi]]\n** [[Su Qin]] (380 \u2013 284 BCE)\n** [[Zhang Yi (Warring States Period)|Zhang Yi]]  (bef. 329 \u2013 309 BCE)\n** [[Yue Yi]]\n** [[Li Yiji]] (268 \u2013 204 BCE)\n* Military strategy\n** [[Sunzi]] (c. 500 BCE)\n** [[Sun Bin]] (died 316 BCE)\n\n==Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy==\n{{Main article|Ancient Greek philosophy|Roman philosophy}}\n{{histphil}}\n[[File:Presocratic graph.svg|thumb|250px|right|Graphical relationship among the various pre-Socratic [[philosopher]]s and thinkers;

In the famous [[Rigveda|Rigvedic]] ''[[Hymn of Creation]]'' ([[Nasadiya Sukta]]) the poet says:\n[[File:Sanjayas's Foreknowledge.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Vyasa]], at middle of the picture]]\n: \"Whence all creation had its origin,\n: he, whether he fashioned it or whether he did not,\n: he, who surveys it all from highest heaven,\n: he knows\u2014or maybe even he does not know.\"\n\nIn the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] view, creation is ascribed to the self-consciousness of the primeval being (''Purusha''). This leads to the inquiry into ''the one being'' that underlies the diversity of empirical phenomena and the origin of all things.  Cosmic order is termed ''rta'' and causal law by ''karma''. Nature (''prakriti'') is taken to have three qualities (''[[sattva]]'', ''[[rajas]]'', and ''[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]'').\n* [[Vedas]]\n* [[Upanishads]]\n* [[Hindu philosophy]]\n\n===Sramana philosophy===\n{{main article|Jain philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Sramana}}\n[[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic worldview of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. [[C\u0101rv\u0101ka]] (Sanskrit: \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0915) (atheist) philosophy,  also known as Lok\u0101yata, it is a system of Hindu philosophy that assumes various forms of philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is named after its founder, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, author of the B\u0101rhaspatya-s\u016btras.\n\n===Classical Indian philosophy===\nIn classical times, these inquiries were systematized in six schools of philosophy.

He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] and, arguably, [[Pythagoras]] amongst his pupils.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.google.de/search?tbm=bks&hl=en&q=Porphyry%2C+Life+of+Pythagoras+Anaximander|title=Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras Anaximander}}</ref>\n\nLittle of his life and work is known today. According to available historical documents, he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies,<ref>[[Themistius]], ''Oratio'' 36, \u00a7317</ref> although only one fragment of his work remains. Fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man.\n\nHe was an early proponent of [[science]] and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe, with a particular [[cosmogony|interest in its origins]], claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long.<ref>Park, David (2005) ''The Grand Contraption'', Princeton University Press {{ISBN|0-691-12133-8}}</ref> Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's [[philosophy]] included contributions to many disciplines. In [[astronomy]], he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of [[geometry]] allowed him to introduce the [[gnomon]] in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of [[geography]]. He was also involved in the [[politics]] of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Anaximander.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Detail of [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[The School of Athens]]'', 1510\u20131511.

[[Themistius]], a 4th-century [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[rhetoric]]ian, mentions that he was the \"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\" Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in [[prose]], at least in the Western world. By the time of [[Plato]], his philosophy was almost forgotten, and [[Aristotle]], his successor [[Theophrastus]] and a few [[Doxography|doxographers]] provide us with the little information that remains. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. It is debatable whether Thales actually was the teacher of Anaximander, but there is no doubt that Anaximander was influenced by Thales' theory that everything is derived from water. One thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered Anaximander to be from the [[Monist]] school which began in Miletus, with Thales followed by Anaximander and finished with [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]].<ref>Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Ch 5, 32\u201334</ref>  3rd-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rhetorician [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] depicts him as leader of the Milesian colony to [[Sozopol|Apollonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Anaximander|page=944}}</ref> Indeed, ''Various History'' (III, 17) explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters. It is very likely that leaders of Miletus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony's allegiance.\n\nAnaximander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dandamaev|first1=M.

Mosse (1984) ''La Gr\u00e8ce archa\u00efque d' Homere \u00e0 Eschyle''. \u00c9dition du Seuil. p236</ref> All these were elaborated rationally. In his desire to find some universal principle, he assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality. This was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere, and therefore could fit their ideas into a tolerably elastic system.<ref>C. M. Bowra (1957) ''The Greek experience''. World publishing Company. Cleveland and New York. p168,169.</ref>\n\nSome scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new [[rationalism|rational]] way of thought which is the main characteristic of the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] (8th to 6th century BC) in the Greek [[city-state]]s.<ref>[[Herbert Ernest Cushman]] claims Anaximander has \"the first European philosophical conception of god\", ''A beginner's history of philosophy'', Volume 1 pg. 24</ref> This has given rise to the phrase \"Greek miracle\". But if we follow carefully the course of Anaximander's ideas, we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears. The basic elements of nature ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Air (classical element)|air]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]]) which the first Greek philosophers believed constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought. Their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony. In the old cosmogonies&nbsp;\u2013 [[Hesiod]] (8th&nbsp;\u2013 7th century&nbsp;BC) and [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] (6th century BC)&nbsp;\u2013 [[Zeus]] establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony (the [[Titans (mythology)|Titans]]). Anaximander claimed that the cosmic order is not [[monarchic]] but [[geometric]], and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth, which is lying in the centre of the universe. This is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature.<ref>C. Mosse (1984) ''La Grece archaique d'Homere a Eschyle''. Edition du Seuil. p 235</ref> In this space there is ''isonomy'' (equal rights) and all the forces are symmetrical and transferrable. The decisions are now taken by the assembly of ''[[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]'' in the ''[[agora]]'' which is lying in the middle of the city.<ref>J. P. Vernart (1982) ''Les origins de la pensee grecque''. PUF Pariw. p 128, J. P. Vernart (1982) ''The origins of the Greek thought''. Cornell University Press.</ref>\n\nThe same ''rational'' way of thought led him to introduce the abstract ''[[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29pei%2Frwn2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd], \nHenry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref>) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical [[Greece|Greek]] [[cosmogony]] from which everything else appeared.<ref>''The Theogony of Hesiod'', Transl. H. G. Evelyn White, 736\u2013740</ref> It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must be something else unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.<ref>Aetios, I 3,3 [ [[Pseudo-Plutarch]]; DK 12 A 14.]; Aristotle, ''Phys.'' \u03935,204b 23sq.

He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term ''[[Arche|arch\u0113]]'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae}}), which until then had meant beginning or origin. For him, it became no longer a mere point in time, but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in [[Homer]] (indefinite sea) and as in [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BC) who said that the earth went down indefinitely (to ''apeiron'') i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kirk |first=G.

While each pre-Socratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element ([[water (classical element)|water]] for Thales and [[air (classical element)|air]] for Anaximenes), Anaximander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless, unlimited primordial mass (''apeiron''), subject to neither old age nor decay, that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived.<ref>[[Pseudo-Plutarch]], ''The Doctrines of the Philosophers'' (I, 3).</ref> He proposed the theory of the ''apeiron'' in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher, Thales, who had claimed that the primary substance was water. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality, and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This ''arch\u0113'' is called \"eternal and ageless\". (Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'', I,6,I;DK B2)<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William Keith Chambers |title=A History of Greek Philosophy| date=2000| publisher=Cambridge University Press| url= https://books.google.com/?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&pg| isbn=978-0-521-29420-1 |page=83}}</ref>\n\nFor Anaximander, the [[Principle (chemistry)|principle]] of things, the constituent of all substances, is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thales' view. Neither is it something halfway between air and water, or between air and fire, thicker than air and fire, or more subtle than water and earth.<ref>[[Aristotle]], ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' (II, 5)</ref> Anaximander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature \u2014 for example, water can only be wet, never dry \u2014 and therefore cannot be the one primary substance; nor could any of the other candidates. He postulated the ''apeiron'' as a substance that, although not directly perceptible to us, could explain the opposites he saw around him.\n\nAnaximander explains how the [[Classical element|four elements]] of ancient physics ([[air (classical element)|air]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]] and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) are formed, and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions. Unlike other Pre-Socratics, he never defines this principle precisely, and it has generally been understood (e.g., by Aristotle and by [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]) as a sort of primal [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. According to him, the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in \"all the worlds\" (for he believed there were many).<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\nAnaximander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came (''apeiron''). The one surviving fragment of Anaximander's writing deals with this matter.

Consequently, deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult. However, it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simplicius' own interpretation, {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  but Anaximander's writing, in \"somewhat poetic terms\" as it is mentioned by Simplicius.</ref><ref>Curd, Patricia, ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), p. 12.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nWhence things have their origin,<br />\nThence also their destruction happens,<br />\nAccording to necessity;<br />\nFor they give to each other justice and recompense<br />\nFor their injustice<br />\nIn conformity with the ordinance of Time.\n</blockquote>\n\nSimplicius mentions that Anaximander said all these \"in poetic terms\", meaning that he used the old mythical language. The goddess Justice ([[Dike (mythology)|Dike]]) keeps the cosmic order.\nThis concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards, notably by Aristotle,<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'', I, 3, 983 ''b'' 8\u201311; ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', III, 5, 204 ''b'' 33\u201334</ref> and by the Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]]: \"what comes from earth must return to earth.\"<ref>Euripides''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|Supplices]]'', v. 532</ref>  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in his ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', stated that Anaximander viewed \"... all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance.\"<ref>[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'' (1873) \u00a7 4.</ref> Physicist [[Max Born]], in commenting upon [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of [[quantum mechanics]] are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \u201cprimordial substance,\u201d' proposed that this primordial substance be called ''apeiron''.<ref>{{cite web \n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bmcpsgp-Ml4C&pg=PA546 \n|title= A Cultural History of Physics\n|last= K\u00e1roly \n|first= Simonyi|authorlink= Simonyi K\u00e1roly\n|date= April 7, 2012\n|work=  Chapter 5.5.10 ''Back to the Apeiron?''\n|publisher= googlebooks\n|accessdate=  July 9, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cosmology===\n[[Image:Anaximander cosmology-en.svg|thumb|left|280px|Map of Anaximander's universe]]\n\nAnaximander's bold use of non-[[Greek mythology|mythological]] explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosmology writers such as [[Hesiod]]. It confirms that pre-Socratic philosophers were making an early effort to demystify physical processes. His major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the [[Universe]] and the origins of [[life]]; for this he is often called the \"Father of [[Cosmology]]\" and founder of astronomy. However, [[pseudo-Plutarch]] states that he still viewed celestial bodies as deities.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Doctrines of the Philosophers'', i. 7</ref>\n\nAnaximander was the first to conceive a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] model of the [[world]]. In his model, the [[Earth]] floats very still in the centre of the infinite, not supported by anything. It remains \"in the same place because of its indifference\", a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious, but false, in ''[[On the Heavens]]''.<ref>Aristotle, ''On the Heavens'', ii, 13</ref> Its curious shape is that of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]<ref>\"A column of stone\", [[A\u00ebtius (theologian)|Aetius]] reports in ''De Fide'' (III, 7, 1), or \"similar to a pillar-shaped stone\", pseudo-Plutarch (III, 10).</ref> with a height one-third of its diameter. The flat top forms the inhabited world, which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass.\n\nAnaximander's realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosmological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking.<ref>Carlo Rovelli, \"The First Scientist, Anaximander and his Legacy\" (Yardley: Westholme, 2011).</ref><ref>Daniel W. Graham, \"Explaining the Cosmos: The Ionian Tradition of Scientific Philosophy\" (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2006).</ref> Karl Popper calls this idea \"one of the boldest, most revolutionary, and most portentous ideas in the whole history of human thinking.\"<ref>Karl Popper, \"Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge\" (New York: Routledge, 1998), pg 186.</ref>  Such a model allowed the concept that [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] could pass under the Earth, opening the way to Greek astronomy.\n\n[[Image:Persectives of Anaximander's universe.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of Anaximander's models of the universe. On the left, daytime in summer; on the right, nighttime in winter. However, Anaximander pictured the earth as a truncated cylinder, not as a sphere as shown.]]\n\nAt the origin, after the separation of [[Temperature|hot and cold]], a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the [[Sun]] was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the [[Occultation|occlusion]] of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources)<ref>In ''Refutation'', it is reported that the circle of the Sun is twenty-seven times bigger than the Moon.</ref> and the [[Moon|lunar]] wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining [[lunar phase]]s. The [[star]]s and the [[planet]]s, located closer,<ref>Aetius, ''De Fide'' (II, 15, 6)</ref> followed the same model.<ref>Most of Anaximander's model of the Universe comes from pseudo-Plutarch (II, 20\u201328):\n\n: \"[The Sun] is a circle twenty-eight times as big as the Earth, with the outline similar to that of a fire-filled chariot wheel, on which appears a mouth in certain places and through which it exposes its fire, as through the hole on a flute. [...] the Sun is equal to the Earth, but the circle on which it breathes and on which it's borne is twenty-seven times as big as the whole earth. [...] [The eclipse] is when the mouth from which comes the fire heat is closed. [...] [The Moon] is a circle nineteen times as big as the whole earth, all filled with fire, like that of the Sun\".</ref>\n\nAnaximander was the first astronomer to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, and the first to present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[Zodiac]] as the Roman philosopher [[Pliny the Elder]] reports in ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (II, 8). It is a little early to use the term [[ecliptic]], but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The [[doxography|doxographer]] and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.\n\n===Multiple worlds===\nAccording to Simplicius, Anaximander already speculated on the [[Cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], similar to [[atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later philosopher [[Epicurus]]. These thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while, and that some were born when others perished. They claimed that this movement was eternal, \"for without movement, there can be no generation, no destruction\".<ref>Simplicius, ''Commentary on Aristotle's Physics'', 1121, 5\u20139</ref>\n\nIn addition to Simplicius, Hippolytus<ref>Hippolytus (?), ''Refutation'' I, 6</ref> reports Anaximander's claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings, which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds (several doxographers use the plural when this philosopher is referring to the worlds within,<ref>Notably pseudo-Plutarch (III, 2) and Aetius, (I, 3, 3; I, 7, 12; II, 1, 3; II, 1, 8).</ref> which are often infinite in quantity). [[Cicero]] writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds.<ref>''On the Nature of the Gods'' (I, 10, 25):\n\n: ''\"Anaximandri autem opinio est nativos esse deos longis intervallis orientis occidentisque, eosque innumerabiles esse mundos.\"''\n: \"For Anaximander, gods were born, but the time is long between their birth and their death; and the worlds are countless.\"</ref>\n\nThis theory places Anaximander close to the Atomists and the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] who, more than a century later, also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared. In the [[Timeline of Western philosophers#Classical philosophers|timeline of the Greek history of thought]], some thinkers conceptualized a single world (Plato, Aristotle, [[Anaxagoras]] and [[Archelaus (philosopher)|Archelaus]]), while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds, continuous or non-continuous ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]] and [[Diogenes Apolloniates|Diogenes]]).\n\n===Meteorological phenomena===\nAnaximander attributed some phenomena, such as [[thunder]] and [[lightning]], to the intervention of elements, rather than to divine causes.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 3):\n\n: \"Anaximander claims that all this is done by the wind, for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud, then by its subtlety and lightness, the rupture produces the sound; and the scattering, because of the darkness of the cloud, creates the light.\"</ref> In his system, thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other; the loudness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock. Thunder without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.<ref>According to [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Naturales quaestiones'' (II, 18).</ref>\n\nHe saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (III, 16)</ref> A part of that mass [[Evaporation|evaporated]] under the sun's action, thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies, which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant.<ref>It is then very likely that by observing the moon and the tides, Anaximander thought the latter were the cause, and not the effect of the satellite's movement.</ref> He explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun.<ref name=\"Refutation\" /> For him, the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions, which someday would go dry as well. According to Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'' (II, 3), Democritus also shared this opinion.\n\n===Origin of humankind===\nAnaximander speculated about the beginnings and [[Evolution|origin]] of animal life. Taking into account the existence of fossils {{Dubious|date=December 2015}}, he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago. The first animals were born trapped in a spiny bark, but as they got older, the bark would dry up and break.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch (V, 19)</ref> As the early humidity evaporated, dry land emerged and, in time, humankind had to adapt. The 3rd century Roman writer [[Censorinus]] reports:\n\n{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.<ref>Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nAnaximander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth's climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales.<ref>[[Plutarch]] also mentions Anaximander's theory that humans were born inside fish, feeding like sharks, and that when they could defend themselves, they were thrown ashore to live on dry land.</ref> He thought that, considering humans' extended infancy, we could not have survived in the primeval world in the same manner we do presently.\n\n==Other accomplishments==\n\n===Cartography===\n[[Image:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Possible rendering of Anaximander's world map<ref>According to John Mansley Robinson, ''An Introduction to Early Greek Philosophy'', Houghton and Mifflin, 1968.</ref>]]\n\nBoth [[Strabo]] and [[Agathemerus]] (later Greek geographers) claim that, according to the geographer [[Eratosthenes]], Anaximander was the first to publish a map of the world. The map probably inspired the Greek historian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] to draw a more accurate version. Strabo viewed both as the first geographers after [[Homer]].\n\nMaps were produced in ancient times, also notably in [[Egypt]], [[Lydia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Babylon]]. Only some small examples survived until today. The unique example of a world map comes from late Babylonian tablet [[Babylonian Map of the World|BM 92687]] later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map. These maps indicated directions, roads, towns, borders, and geological features. Anaximander's innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks.\n\nSuch an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.<ref>As established by Marcel Conche, ''Anaximandre. Fragments et t\u00e9moignages'', introduction (p.&nbsp;43\u201347).</ref> First, it could be used to improve navigation and trade between [[Miletus]]'s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea. Second, [[Thales]] would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian [[Polis|city-states]] to join in a federation in order to push the [[Medes|Median]] threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.\n\nSurely aware of the sea's convexity, he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface. The centre or \u201cnavel\u201d of the world ({{lang|grc|\u1f40\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2}} ''omphal\u00f3s g\u1ebds'') could have been [[Delphi]], but is more likely in Anaximander's time to have been located near Miletus. The [[Aegean Sea]] was near the map's centre and enclosed by three continents, themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers. [[Europe]] was bordered on the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and was separated from [[Asia]] by the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov|Lake Maeotis]], and, further east, either by the [[Rioni River|Phasis River]] (now called the Rioni) or the [[Tanais]]. The [[Nile]] flowed south into the ocean, separating [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (which was the name for the part of the then-known [[Africa]]n continent) from Asia.\n\n===Gnomon===\nThe ''[[Suda]]'' relates that Anaximander explained some basic notions of geometry. It also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in [[Greece]] of the gnomon. In [[Lacedaemon]], he participated in the construction, or at least in the adjustment, of [[sundial]]s to indicate [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es.<ref>These accomplishments are often attributed to him, notably by Diogenes Laertius (II, 1) and by the Roman historian [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' (X, 14, 11).</ref> Indeed, a gnomon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude.\n\nIn his time, the gnomon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane. The position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day. As it moves through its apparent course, the sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow, which is shortest at noon, when pointing due south. The variation in the tip's position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons; the shadow is longest on the winter solstice and shortest on the summer solstice.\n\nThe invention of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, as well as the division of days into twelve parts, came from the [[Babylonia]]ns. It is they, according to [[Herodotus]]' [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement. It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the ''Suda'' seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.\n\n===Prediction of an earthquake===\nIn his philosophical work [[De Divinatione]] (I, 50, 112), Cicero states that Anaximander convinced the inhabitants of [[Lacedaemon]] to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near.<ref>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml ''Da Divinatione'' (in Latin)]</ref> The city collapsed when the top of the [[Taygetus]] split like the stern of a ship. Pliny the Elder also mentions this anecdote (II, 81), suggesting that it came from an \"admirable inspiration\", as opposed to Cicero, who did not associate the prediction with divination.\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[Bertrand Russell]] in the ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'' interprets Anaximander's theories as <!-- the above quote as | CLARIFY: probably due to editing, the quote referenced here is unclear. --> an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth, fire, and water, all of which may be independently seeking to aggrandize their proportions relative to the others. Anaximander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements, that where there was fire, ashes (earth) now exist.<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy and Its Connection with Political and Social Circumstances from the Earliest Times to the Present Day'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1946).</ref> His Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate.\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of indefiniteness. In accordance with this, anything definite has to eventually pass back into indefiniteness. In other words, Anaximander viewed \"...all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance\". (''Ibid.'', \u00a7 4) The world of individual objects, in this way of thinking, has no worth and should perish.<ref>Friedrich Nietzsche, ''Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks'' (Washington, D.C.: Regnery Gateway, 1962).</ref>\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]] lectured extensively on Anaximander, and delivered a lecture entitled \"Anaximander's Saying\" which was subsequently included in ''Off the Beaten Track''. The lecture examines the ontological difference and the oblivion of Being or ''[[Dasein]]'' in the context of the Anaximander fragment.<ref>Martin Heidegger, ''Off the Beaten Track'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002).</ref> Heidegger's lecture is, in turn, an important influence on the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]].<ref>Cf. Jacques Derrida, ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), pp. 66\u20137; Derrida, \"''Geschlecht'' II: Heidegger's Hand,\" in [[John Sallis]] (ed.), ''Deconstruction and Philosophy'' (Chicago & London: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 181\u20132; Derrida, ''Given Time: I.

Practical, technical, and academic requirements for becoming an architect vary by jurisdiction.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Main article|History of Architecture}}\nThroughout ancient and medieval history, most of the architectural design and construction was carried out by [[artisan]]s\u2014such as stone [[masonry|mason]]s and [[carpenter]]s, rising to the role of master builder. Until modern times, there was no clear distinction between architect and [[Civil engineering|engineer]]. In Europe, the titles ''architect'' and ''engineer'' were primarily geographical variations that referred to the same person, often used interchangeably.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VQYeHMGp2gwC&q=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&dq=The+Architecture+of+the+Italian+Renaissance&pgis=1 ''The Architecture of the Italian Renaissance''] Jacob Burckhardt {{ISBN|0-8052-1082-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smweng.com/civil-engineering-definitions-and-history/civil-engineering-defined|title=Civil Engineering Defined - Civil Engineering Definitions and History - smweng.com|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.smweng.com}}</ref>[[File:Masaccio, cappella brancacci, san pietro in cattedra. ritratto di filippo brunelleschi.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi]] is revered as one of the most inventive and gifted architects in history.<ref>[http://totallyhistory.com/filippo-brunelleschi Filippo Brunelleschi], Totally History</ref>]]It is suggested that various developments in technology and mathematics allowed the development of the professional 'gentleman' architect, separate from the hands-on craftsman. Paper was not used in Europe for drawing until the 15th century but became increasingly available after 1500. Pencils were used more often for drawing by 1600. The availability of both allowed pre-construction drawings to be made by professionals.<ref name=\"MAD 225\">{{cite book|last=Pacey|first=Arnold|title=Medieval Architectural Drawing|year=2007|publisher=Tempus Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7524-4404-8|pages=225\u2013227}}</ref> Concurrently, the introduction of linear perspective and innovations such as the use of different projections to describe a three-dimensional building in two dimensions, together with an increased understanding of dimensional accuracy, helped building designers communicate their ideas.<ref name=\"MAD 225\" /> However, the development was gradual.

Such licensure usually requires an accredited university degree, successful completion of exams, and a training period. The use of terms and titles and the representation of oneself as an architect is restricted to licensed individuals by law, although in general, derivatives such as ''[[architectural designer]]'' are often not legally protected.\n\nTo practice architecture implies the ability to practice independently of supervision. The term ''[[building design]] professional'' (or ''Design professional)'', by contrast, is a much broader term that includes professionals who practice independently under an alternate profession, such as [[engineering]] professionals, or those who assist in the practice architecture under the supervision of a licensed architect, such as ''[[architectural technologist]]s'' and ''[[intern architect]]s''. In many places, independent, non-licensed individuals may perform design services outside the professional restrictions, such design houses and other smaller structures.\n\n==Practice==\nIn the architectural profession, technical and environmental knowledge, design and construction management, and an understanding of business are as important as design. However, the design is the driving force throughout the project and beyond. An architect accepts a commission from a client. The commission might involve preparing feasibility reports, building audits, the design of a building or of several buildings, structures, and the spaces among them. The architect participates in developing the requirements the client wants in the building. Throughout the project (planning to occupancy), the architect co-ordinates a design team. [[Structural engineer|Structural]], [[mechanical engineer|mechanical]], and [[electrical engineer]]s and other specialists, are hired by the client or the architect, who must ensure that the work is co-ordinated to construct the design.\n\n===Design role===\nThe architect hired by a client is responsible for creating a design concept that meets the requirements of that client and provides a facility suitable to the required use. In that, the architect must meet with and question the client to ascertain all the requirements and nuances of the planned project. Often the full brief is not entirely clear at the beginning, entailing a degree of risk in the design undertaking. The architect may make early proposals to the client which may rework the terms of the brief. The program or brief is essential to producing a project that meets all the needs of the owner \u2014 it is a guide for the architect in creating the design concept.\n\nIt is generally expected that the design proposal(s)is both imaginative as well as pragmatic, but the precise extent and nature of these expectations will vary, depending on the place, time, finance, culture, and available crafts and technology in which the design takes place.\n\nDesigning buildings is a very complex and demanding undertaking, no matter what the scale of the project might be. A strong degree of foresight is a prerequisite. Any design concept must at a very early stage in its generation take into account a great number of issues and variables which include qualities of space(s),<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/2061334/Space_The_undefinable_space_of_architecture|title=Space: The undefinable space of architecture|first=Erdem|last=\u00dcng\u00fcr|publisher=}}</ref> the end-use and life-cycle of these proposed spaces, connections, relations, and aspects between spaces including how they are put together as well as the impact of proposals on the immediate and wider locality. Selection of appropriate materials and technology must be considered, tested and reviewed at an early stage in the design to ensure there are no setbacks (such as higher-than-expected costs) which may occur later. The site and its environs, as well as the culture and history of the place, will also influence the design. The design must also countenance increasing concerns with environmental sustainability. The architect may introduce (intentionally or not), to greater or lesser degrees, aspects of [[mathematics and architecture]], new or current [[architectural theory]], or references to [[architectural history]].\n\nA key part of the design is that the architect often consults with engineers, surveyors and other specialists throughout the design, ensuring that aspects such as the structural supports and air conditioning elements are coordinated in the scheme as a whole. The control and planning of construction costs are also a part of these consultations. Coordination of the different aspects involves a high degree of specialized communication, including advanced computer technology such as BIM (Building Information Management), CAD, and cloud-based technologies.\n\nAt all times in the design, the architect reports back to the client who may have reservations or recommendations, introducing a further variable into the design.\n\nArchitects deal with local and federal jurisdictions about regulations and [[building code]]s. The architect might need to comply with local [[Urban planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] laws, such as required setbacks, height limitations, parking requirements, transparency requirements (windows), and [[land use]]. Some established jurisdictions require adherence to design and [[historic preservation]] guidelines. Health and safety risks form a vital part of the current design, and in many jurisdictions, design reports and records are required which include ongoing considerations such as materials and contaminants, waste management and recycling, traffic control and fire safety.\n\n====Means of design====\n\nPreviously, architects employed drawings<ref name=\"MAD 225\"/> to illustrate and generate design proposals. While conceptual sketches are still widely used by architects,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/639533/17-napkin-sketches-by-famous-architects|title=17 Napkin Sketches by Famous Architects|date=5 June 2015|publisher=}}</ref> computer technology has now become the industry standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/architecture/2011/03/think_before_you_build.html|title=Think Before You Build|first=Witold|last=Rybczynski|date=30 March 2011|publisher=|via=Slate}}</ref> However, design may include the use of photos, collages, prints, linocuts, and other media in design production. \nIncreasingly, computer software such as [[BIM]] is shaping how architects work. BIM technology allows for the creation of a virtual building that serves as an information database for the sharing of design and building information throughout the life-cycle of the building's design, construction and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States |publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Environmental role===\nAs current buildings are now known to be high emitters of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing controls are being placed on buildings and associated technology to reduce emissions, increase energy efficiency, and make use of renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources may be developed within the proposed building or via local or national renewable energy providers. As a result, the architect is required to remain abreast of current regulations which are continually tightening. Some new developments exhibit extremely low energy use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://passipedia.org/basics/what_is_a_passive_house|title=What is a Passive House? [  ]|website=passipedia.org}}</ref>\nHowever, the architect is also increasingly required to provide initiatives in a wider environmental sense, such as making provision for low-energy transport, natural daylighting instead of artificial lighting, natural ventilation instead of air conditioning, pollution, and waste management, use of recycled materials and employment of materials which can be easily recycled in the future.\n\n===Construction role===\nAs the design becomes more advanced and detailed, specifications and detail designs are made of all the elements and components of the building. Techniques in the production of a building are continually advancing which places a demand on the architect to ensure that he or she remains up to date with these advances.\n\nDepending on the client's needs and the jurisdiction's requirements, the spectrum of the architect's services during construction stages may be extensive (detailed document preparation and construction review) or less involved (such as allowing a contractor to exercise considerable [[design-build]] functions).\n\nArchitects typically put projects to [[Call for bids|tender]] on behalf of their clients, advise on the award of the project to a [[general contractor]], facilitate and then administer a contract of agreement which is often between the client and the contractor. This contract is legally binding and covers a very wide range of aspects including the insurances and commitments of all stakeholders, the status of the design documents, provisions for the architect's access, and procedures for the control of the works as they proceed. Depending on the type of contract utilized, provisions for further sub-contract tenders may be required. The architect may require that some elements are covered by a warranty which specifies the expected life and other aspects of the material, product or work.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, prior notification to the relevant local authority must be given before commencement on site, thus giving the local authority notice to carry out independent inspections. The architect will then review and inspect the progress of the work in coordination with the local authority.\n\nThe architect will typically review contractor [[shop drawings]] and other [[Submittals (construction)|submittals]], prepare and issue site instructions, and provide Certificates for Payment to the contractor (see also [[Design-bid-build]]) which is based on the work done to date as well as any materials and other goods purchased or hired. In the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries, a [[quantity surveyor]] is often part of the team to provide cost consulting. With very large, complex projects, an independent [[Construction management|construction manager]] is sometimes hired to assist in the design and to manage construction.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory certification or assurance of the completed work or part of works is required. This demand for certification entails a high degree of risk - therefore, regular inspections of the work as it progresses on site is required to ensure that is in compliance with the design itself as well as with all relevant statutes and permissions.\n\n===Alternate practice and specializations===\nRecent decades have seen the rise of specializations within the profession. Many architects and architectural firms focus on certain project types (for example, healthcare, retail, public housing, event management), technological expertise or project delivery methods. Some architects specialize as building code, [[building envelope]], [[Sustainable architecture|sustainable design]], [[technical writing]], historic preservation(US) or conservation (UK), [[accessibility]] and other forms of specialist consultants.\n\nMany architects elect to move into [[real estate development|real estate (property) development]], corporate facilities planning, [[project management]], construction management, [[interior design]], city planning, or other related fields.\n\n==Professional requirements==\n{{Main article|Professional requirements for architects}}\n{{See also|Architectural engineering#Architect}}\n\nAlthough there are variations from place to place, most of the world's architects are required to register with the appropriate jurisdiction. To do so, architects are typically required to meet three common requirements: education, experience, and examination.\n\nEducational requirements generally consist of a [[university degree]] in architecture. The experience requirement for degree candidates is usually satisfied by a practicum or internship (usually two to three years, depending on jurisdiction). Finally, a Registration Examination or a series of exams is required prior to licensure.\n\nProfessionals engaged in the design and supervision of construction projects prior to the late 19th century were not necessarily trained in a separate architecture program in an academic setting. Instead, they often trained under established architects. Prior to modern times, there was no distinction between architects, [[engineer]]s and often [[artist]]s,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} and the title used varied depending on geographical location. They often carried the title of [[master builder (occupation)|master builder]] or [[wikt:surveyor|surveyor]]{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} after serving a number of years as an apprentice (such as Sir [[Christopher Wren]]). The formal study of architecture in academic institutions played a pivotal role in the development of the profession as a whole, serving as a focal point for advances in architectural technology and theory.\n\n==Fees==\nArchitects' fee structures are typically based on a percentage of construction value, as a rate per unit area of the proposed construction, hourly rates or a fixed lump sum fee. Combinations of these structures are also common. Fixed fees are usually based on a project's allocated construction cost and can range between 4 and 12% of new construction cost, for commercial and institutional projects, depending on a project's size and complexity. Residential projects range from 12 to 20%. Renovation projects typically command higher percentages, as high as 15-20%.\n\nOverall billings for [[architectural firm]]s range widely, depending on location and economic climate. Billings have traditionally been dependent on the local economic conditions but, with rapid globalization, this is becoming less of a factor for larger international firms. Salaries also vary, depending on experience, position within the firm (staff architect, partner, or shareholder, etc.), and the size and location of the firm.\n\n==Professional organizations==\n{{main article|List of professional architecture organizations}}\nA number of national professional organizations exist to promote career and business development in architecture.\n\nThe American Institute of Architects (AIA) USA\n\nRoyal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) UK\n\nArchitects Registration Board (ARB) UK\n\nThe Australian Institute of Architects (AIA)   Australia\n\nAssociation of Licensed Architects \n(ALA)    USA\n\n==Prizes, awards, and titles==\n{{main article|List of architecture prizes}}\n[[File:Zaha Hadid in Heydar Aliyev Cultural center in Baku nov 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Zaha Hadid]], winner of the 2004 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].]]\nA wide variety of [[List of architecture prizes|prizes]] is awarded by national professional associations and other bodies, recognizing accomplished architects, their buildings, structures, and professional careers.\n\nThe most lucrative award an architect can receive is the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes termed the \"[[Nobel Prize]] for architecture.\" Other prestigious architectural awards are the [[Royal Gold Medal]], the [[AIA Gold Medal]] (USA), AIA Gold Medal (Australia), and the [[Praemium Imperiale]].\n\nArchitects in the UK, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, might until 1971 be elected Fellows of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and can write [[FRIBA]] after their name if they feel so inclined. Those elected to chartered membership of the RIBA after 1971 may use the initials RIBA but cannot use the old ARIBA and FRIBA. An Honorary Fellow may use the initials Hon. FRIBA. and an International Fellow may use the initials Int. FRIBA.  Architects in the US, who have made contributions to the profession through design excellence or architectural education, or have in some other way advanced the profession, are elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects and can write [[FAIA]] after their name. Architects in Canada, who have made outstanding contributions to the profession through contribution to research, scholarship, public service, or professional standing to the good of architecture in Canada, or elsewhere, may be recognized as a Fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and can write FRAIC after their name. In Hong Kong, those elected to chartered membership may use the initial HKIA, and those who have made a special contribution after nomination and election by The Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA), may be elected as fellow members of HKIA and may use FHKIA after their name.\n\nArchitects in the [[Philippines]] and [[Overseas Filipinos|Filipino communities overseas]] (whether they are Filipinos or not), especially those who also profess other jobs at the same time, are addressed and introduced as ''Architect'', rather than ''Sir/Madam'' in speech or ''Mr./Mrs./Ms.'' (''G./Gng./Bb.'' in Filipino) before surnames. That word is used either in itself or before the given name or surname.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Architecture}}\n<!-- New links inalphabetical order please -->\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Architectural designer]]\n*[[Architectural drawing]]\n*[[Architectural engineering]]\n*[[Architectural technologist]]\n*[[Building officials]]\n*[[Chartered architect]]\n*[[Civil engineer]]\n*[[Construction engineering]]\n*[[Construction management|Construction manager]]\n*[[Drafter]]\n*[[Expression (architecture)]]\n*[[Landscape architect]]\n*[[List of architects]]\n*[[Starchitect]]\n*[[State architect]]\n*[[Structural engineering]]\n*[[Urban design]]er\n*[[Urban planner]]\n*[[Women in architecture]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Wikiquote|Architects}}\n{{Wikidata property|P84}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Architects]]\n[[Category:Architecture occupations]]\n[[Category:Professional certification in architecture]]", "sha1": "2l6i4e0o3ga5q66lplh05dv7kmlvipz"}}, {"title": "Abbreviation", "ns": "0", "id": "1171", "revision": {"id": "859220658", "parentid": "855076118", "timestamp": "2018-09-12T15:35:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nbarth", "id": "570614"}, "comment": "/* Periods (full stops) and spaces */ Added Penna. sign", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Abbr|the &lt;abbr&gt; HTML tag|HTML element#abbr}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2008}}\n[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]\n\nAn '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'' <ref>{{cite web|title=brevis/breve, brevis M \u2013 Latin is Simple Online Dictionary|url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/adjective/91/|website=www.latin-is-simple.com|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'', or ''abbrev.''\n\nIn strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[crasis]], [[acronym]]s, or [[initialism]]s, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connected by the term \"abbreviation\" in loose parlance.<ref name=harts>{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}</ref>{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}\n\nAbbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA5&dq=abbreviations+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=abbreviations%20history&f=false ''The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography'', Wm.

(For example, ''A'' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as ''ager'', ''amicus'', ''annus'', ''as'', ''Aulus'', ''Aurelius'', ''aurum'' and ''avus''.)\"<ref>Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&dq=abbreviations++fashionable&q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&f=false ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome''], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.</ref>\n\nAbbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' used many abbreviations, for example ''7'' or ''&'' for ''and'', and ''y'' for ''since'', so that \"not much space is wasted\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&dq=abbreviations+history&q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&q=abbreviations%20beowulf&f=false Gelderen, E. v, ''A History of the English Language: Revised edition'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]</ref> The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.<ref>[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483\u20131660<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015214606/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php |date=October 15, 2007 }} Doesn't work.</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like \u2039er\u203a were replaced with \u2039\u0254\u203a, as in \u2039mast\u0254\u203a for ''master'' and \u2039exac\u0254bate\u203a for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n{{quote|Mast\u0254 subwarden\u0254 y \u0254m\u0113de me to you.

The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185657/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does \"OK\" stand for? |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the \"[[Special Operations, Executive]]\"\u2014\"S.O., E\"\u2014which is not found in histories written after about 1960.\n\nBut before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  \"M.\" is the abbreviation for \"monsieur\" while \"Mme\" is that for \"madame\". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOver the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.\n\nMinimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.\n\nWidespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.<ref>Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}</ref> More recently Twitter, a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.\n\n== Style conventions in English ==\n\nIn modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.\n\n=== Lowercase letters ===\n\nIf the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for ''Leviticus''. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for ''year-to-date'', PCB for ''printed circuit board'' and FYI for ''for your information''. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.\n\n=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===\n[[File:\u201cTo Penna. R.R. Station\u201d.jpg|thumb|Sign in New York City subway, reading \u201cPenna.\u201d for Penn''sylvani''a, showing American style of including the period even for contractions.]]\nA period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.\n\nAccording to [[Hart's Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.<ref name=\"harts\"/>{{rp|p167\u2013170}} [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Example\n!Category\n!Short form\n!Source\n|-\n|[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]\n|Contraction\n|Dr\n|D\u2014\u2014r\n|-\n|[[Professor]]\n|Abbreviation\n|Prof.\n|Prof...\n|-\n|The [[Reverend]]\n|Abbreviation\n|Rev.\n|Rev...\n|-\n|The [[Reverend]]\n|Contraction\n|Revd\n|Rev\u2014\u2014d\n|-\n|[[The Right Honourable]]\n|Contraction and Abbreviation\n|Rt Hon.\n|R\u2014\u2014t Hon...\n|}\n\nIn [[American English]], the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. ''Dr.'' or ''Mrs.''. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either ''US'' or ''U.S.'' for  ''United States'', ''EU'' or ''E.U.'' for ''European Union'', and ''UN'' or ''U.N.'' for ''United Nations''. There are some house styles, however\u2014American ones included\u2014that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:\n* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, ''\"Northwest Blvd\"'', ''\"W. Jefferson\"'', and ''\"PED XING\"'' all follow this recommendation.) \n* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are \"[[Num\u00e9ro sign|No.]]\" (to avoid the appearance of \"[[yes and no|No]]\"); initials within persons' names (such as \"George R. Smith\"); and \"St.\" within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as \"Emily R. St. Clair\") (but not in city names such as ''St Louis''  or ''St Paul''). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)\n\nAcronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].\n\nToday, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters \"U.&nbsp;S.\"\n\nWhen an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: ''The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C''.\n\n=== Plural forms ===\n\nThere is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in \"PC's\". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,<ref name=\"Chicago\">Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2</ref> allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms \"only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters\". Turabian would therefore prefer \"DVDs\" and \"URLs\" and \"Ph.D.'s\", while the [[Modern Language Association]]<ref name=\"MLA\">Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g</ref> explicitly says, \"do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation\".

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\nMany British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:\n* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:\n** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops\u2014see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''\n** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''\"US\"'', not ''\"U.S.\"'');\n** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});\n** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''\"PR\"'', instead of ''\"p.r.\"'', or ''\"pr\"'')\n** Names (''\"FW de Klerk\"'', ''\"GB Whiteley\"'', ''\"Park JS\"'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''\"Mr F. W. de Klerk\"''.\n** Scientific units (see Measurement below).\n* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''\"Nato\"'' or ''\"NATO\"'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''\"Sars\"'' or ''\"SARS\"'' (compare with ''\"[[laser]]\"'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).\n* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the ''\"British Broadcasting Corporation\"'' is abbreviated to ''\"BBC\"'', never ''\"Bbc\"''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.\n* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (<nowiki>100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10\u00b0C</nowiki>). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)\n\n==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====\n\n* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double \"l\" is a separate sound: \"Ll. George\" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].\n* Some titles, such as \"Reverend\" and \"Honourable\", are spelt out when preceded by \"the\", rather than as \"Rev.\" or \"Hon.\" respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.\n* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.<ref>[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 53. New York City: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}</ref> Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.\n\n== Measurement shorthand\u2014symbol or abbreviation ==\n[[File:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China\u2014\"km\" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]\n\nWriters often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as \"in\" for \"[[inch]]\" or can be a symbol such as \"km\" for \"[[kilometre]]/kilometer\".\n\nThe shorthand \"in\" applies to English only\u2014in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand \"dm\" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word \"duim\".<ref>{{cite book\n| title = Woordeboek/Dictionary; Afrikaans-English / Engels-Afrikaans\n| editor = Abel Coetzee\n| publisher = Collins\n| year = 1969\n| oclc = 29232187\n| location = Glasgow and Johannesburg}}</ref> Since both \"in\" and \"dm\" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as \"Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process\"<ref>{{cite book\n|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary\n|publisher = Oxford University Press\n|year = 1964}}</ref> applies the appropriate shorthand by ''substitution'' rather than by ''contraction''. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (''[[:pt:Quil\u00f4metro|quil\u00f4metro]]'' in Portuguese or ''[[:el:\u03a7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf|\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf]]'' in Greek) is \"km\" in both languages and the letter \"k\" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, \"km\" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual<ref>{{SIbrochure8th}}</ref> the word \"symbol\" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:\n*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed\u2014for example 1&nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&nbsp;mW (milliwatts).\n*No periods should be inserted between letters\u2014for example \"m.s\" (which is an approximation of \"m\u00b7s\", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for \"metres multiplied by seconds\", but \"ms\" is the symbol for milliseconds.\n*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).\n*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical\u2014not all languages use the letter \"s\" to denote a plural.\n\n== Syllabic abbreviation ==\n<!--irony is this is linked from the MOS on how not to do it like this! - see [[MOS:CAPSACRS]]-->\nA syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.\n\n=== Usage ===\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Com'''munications'') and [[Oftel]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Tel'''ecommunications'') use this style.\n\nNew York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as [[Tribeca]] ('''''Tri'''angle '''be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street'') and [[SoHo]] ('''''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street''). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]], San Francisco ('''''So'''uth of '''Ma'''rket'') and [[LoDo, Denver]] ('''''Lo'''wer '''Do'''wntown''), among others.\n\n==== Languages other than English====\n\nOn the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or \"secret state police\". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the ''[[Comintern]]'' (''Communist International'') and ''[[Komsomol]]'' ('''''Kom'''munisticheskii '''So'''yuz '''Mol'''odyozhi'', or \"Communist youth union\") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell's [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei'', and are still used, e.g. ''[[:de:Kripo|Kripo]]'' for ''[[:de:Kriminalpolizei|Kriminalpolizei]]''.\n\nIn the modern Russian language words like ''Minoborony'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''oborony''' \u2014 Ministry of Defence) and ''Minobrnauki'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''obr'''azovaniya i '''nauki''' \u2014 Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for '''''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit'' (\"state security\", the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' (\"people's policeman\"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], from the name of the founder, Theo '''Al'''brecht, and the German word '''''Di'''skont'' (discount) or [[Haribo]], from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, '''Ha'''ns '''Ri'''egl '''Bo'''nn.\n\nSyllabic abbreviations are ''de rigueur'' in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as [[Pemex]] for '''''Pe'''tr\u00f3leos '''Mex'''icanos'' (\"Mexican Petroleums\") or Fonafifo for '''''Fo'''ndo '''Na'''cional de '''Fi'''nancimiento '''Fo'''restal'' (National Forestry Financing Fund).\n\nEast Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in Japanese the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai reng\u014d'' (\u56fd\u969b\u9023\u5408) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (\u56fd\u9023). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:\u7565\u8a9e|ryakugo]] (\u7565\u8a9e) in Japanese; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''B\u011bid\u00e0'' (\u5317\u5927) for ''B\u011bij\u012bng D\u00e0xu\u00e9'' (\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66, [[Peking University]]) and ''T\u014ddai'' (\u6771\u5927) for ''T\u014dky\u014d daigaku'' (\u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5b66, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase \"[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]\" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.\n\n==== Organizations ====\n{{See also|Neologism}}\n\nPartially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean \"Destroyer Squadron 6\", while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be \"Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic.\"\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Clipping (morphology)]]\n* [[List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions]]\n* [[List of abbreviations in photography]]\n* [[List of acronyms]]\n* [[List of classical abbreviations]]\n* [[List of medieval abbreviations]]\n* [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary:Abbreviations in Webster|The abbreviations used in the 1913 edition of Webster's dictionary]]\n* [[Abbreviation (music)]]\n* [[Numeronym]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|abbreviation}}\n{{Wikisource1911Enc|Abbreviation}}\n\n*{{dmoz|Reference/Dictionaries/Acronyms/|Acronyms}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Abbreviations| ]]", "sha1": "s9k9rwpj22pw3dmstdsvfp7untaqawp"}}, {"title": "Aphrodite", "ns": "0", "id": "1174", "revision": {"id": "866154781", "parentid": "866148336", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T16:57:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Katolophyromai", "id": "29934571"}, "comment": "The original wording was more clear, I think.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{good article}}\n{{short description|ancient Greek goddess of love}}\n{{About|the Greek goddess}}\n{{Redirect|Cypris}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{Infobox deity\n| type = Greek\n| name = Aphrodite\n| image = NAMA Aphrodite Syracuse.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = ''Aphrodite Pudica'' (Roman copy of 2nd century AD), [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]\n| god_of = Goddess of love, beauty and sexuality\n| abode = [[Mount Olympus]]\n| symbol = [[Dolphin]], [[Rose]], [[Scallop|Scallop Shell]], [[Myrtle (plant)|Myrtle]], [[Dove]], [[Sparrow]], [[Girdle]], [[Mirror]], [[Pearl]] and [[Swan]]\n| consort = [[Hephaestus]], [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Hermes]], [[Dionysus]], [[Adonis]], and [[Anchises]]\n| parents = In the ''[[Iliad]]'': [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'' 5.370.</ref><br/>In ''[[Theogony]]'': [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'s severed genitals<ref>Hesiod, ''Theogony'', 188</ref>\n| siblings = [[Aeacus]], [[Angelos (Greek mythology)|Angelos]], [[Apollo]], [[Ares]], [[Artemis]], [[Athena]], [[Dionysus]], [[Eileithyia]], [[Enyo]], [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], [[Ersa]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], [[Helen of Troy]], [[Hephaestus]], [[Heracles]], [[Hermes]], [[Minos]], [[Pandia]], [[Persephone]], [[Perseus]], [[Rhadamanthus]], the [[Graces]], the [[Horae]], the [[Litae]], the [[Muse]]s, the [[Moirai]], ''or'' the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]], the [[Meliae]], the [[Erinyes]] (Furies), the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giants]], the [[Hekatonkheires]]\n| children = With Ares: [[Eros]],<ref name=\"eros\">Eros is usually mentioned as the son of Aphrodite but in other versions he is born out of Chaos</ref> [[Phobos (mythology)|Phobos]], [[Deimos (mythology)|Deimos]], [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], [[Pothos (mythology)|Pothos]], [[Anteros]], [[Himeros]],<br/>With Hermes: [[Hermaphroditus]],<br/>With Poseidon: [[Rhodos]], [[Eryx]],<br/>With Dionysus: [[Peitho]], [[Charites|The Graces]], [[Priapus]],<br/>With Anchises: [[Aeneas]]\n| mount = \n| Roman_equivalent = [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]\n| equivalent1_type = Mesopotamian\n| equivalent1 = [[Inanna]]/Ishtar\n| equivalent2_type = Canaanite\n| equivalent2 = [[Astarte]]\n}}\n\n'''Aphrodite'''{{efn|{{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Aphrodite.ogg|\u00e6|f|r|\u0259|\u02c8|d|a\u026a|t|i}} {{respell|af-r\u0259|DY|tee}}; {{lang-grc-gre|\u1f08\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03c4\u03b7}} ''Aphrod\u00edt\u0113''}} is an [[ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek goddess]] associated with [[love]], [[beauty]], [[pleasure]], and [[procreation]]. She is identified with the planet [[Venus]], which is named after the Roman goddess {{lang|la|[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]}}, [[Interpretatio graeca|with whom Aphrodite was extensively syncretized]]. Aphrodite's major symbols include [[Myrtle (plant)|myrtle]]s, [[rose]]s, [[dove]]s, [[sparrow]]s, and [[swan]]s.\n\nThe cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Phoenician goddess]] [[Astarte]], a [[cognate]] of the [[East Semitic]] goddess [[Ishtar]], whose cult was based on the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian cult]] of [[Inanna]]. Aphrodite's main cult centers were [[Kythira|Cythera]], [[Cyprus]], [[Corinth]], and [[Athens]]. Her main festival was the [[Aphrodisia]], which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In [[Laconia]], Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitutes]], an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of \"[[sacred prostitution]]\", an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.\n\nIn [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (''aphros'') produced by [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]'s genitals, which his son [[Cronus]] has [[castration|severed]] and thrown into the sea. In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', however, she is the daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]]. [[Plato]], in his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 180e, asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: [[Aphrodite Urania|Aphrodite Ourania]] (a transcendent, \"Heavenly\" Aphrodite) and [[Aphrodite Pandemos]] (Aphrodite common to \"all the people\"). Aphrodite had many other [[epithet]]s, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as '''Cytherea''' (''Lady of Cythera'') and '''Cypris''' (''Lady of Cyprus''), due to the fact that both locations claimed to be the place of her birth.\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Aphrodite was married to [[Hephaestus]], the god of blacksmiths and metalworking. Despite this, Aphrodite was frequently [[adultery|unfaithful]] to him and had many lovers; in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is caught in the act of adultery with [[Ares]], the god of war. In the ''[[Homeric Hymns|First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]]'', she seduces the mortal shepherd [[Anchises]]. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd [[Adonis]], who was killed by a [[wild boar]]. Along with [[Athena]] and [[Hera]], Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]] and she plays a major role throughout the ''[[Iliad]]''. Aphrodite has been featured in [[Art of Europe|western art]] as a symbol of [[Physical attractiveness#Female physical attractiveness|female beauty]] and has appeared in numerous works of [[western literature]]. She is a major deity in modern [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan religions]], including the [[Church of Aphrodite]], [[Wicca]], and [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenismos]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[Hesiod]] derives ''Aphrodite'' from ''aphr\u00f3s'' (\u1f00\u03c6\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2) \"sea-foam\",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} interpreting the name as \"risen from the foam\",<ref>Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+173 190-197].</ref>{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}} but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious [[folk etymology]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=14}}{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} Early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that Aphrodite's name was of Greek or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} Aphrodite's name is generally accepted to be of non-Greek, probably [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], origin,{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}} but its exact derivation cannot be determined.{{sfn|West|2000|pages=134\u2013138}}\n\nScholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accepting Hesiod's \"foam\" etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite's name as *''-od\u00edt\u0113'' \"wanderer\"<ref>[[Paul Kretschmer]], \u201cZum pamphylischen Dialekt\u201d, ''[[Historische Sprachforschung|Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiet der Indogermanischen Sprachen]]'' 33 (1895): 267.</ref> or *''-d\u00edt\u0113'' \"bright\".<ref>Ernst Maa\u00df, \u201cAphrodite und die hl.

''Aphrodite Pandemos'', by contrast, is the younger of the two goddesses: the common Aphrodite, born from the union of Zeus and Dione, and the inspiration of [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual desire]], the \"lesser\" of the two loves.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 181a-d.</ref><ref>Richard L.

details:{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=95}} [[Adonis]] was the son of [[Myrrha]], who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King [[Cinyras]] of [[Cyprus]],{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=75}} after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=75}} Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a [[myrrh]] tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|pages=75\u201376}}\n\nAphrodite found the baby,{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} and took him to the underworld to be fostered by [[Persephone]].{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} She returned for him once he was grown{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} and discovered him to be strikingly handsome.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} Persephone wanted to keep Adonis,{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess Adonis.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} Adonis chose to spend that time with Aphrodite.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} Then, one day, while Adonis was hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}}\n\nIn different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} or by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} The story also provides an [[etiology]] for Aphrodite's associations with certain flowers.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis's death, she caused [[anemone]]s to grow wherever his blood fell,{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}}{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}} In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]] from a [[rose]] bush{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=96}} According to [[Lucian]]'s ''[[On the Syrian Goddess]]'',{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=279}} each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in [[Lebanon]] (now known as the [[Abraham River]]) ran red with blood.{{sfn|Ker\u00e9nyi|1951|page=76}}\n\nThe myth of Adonis is associated with the festival of the [[Adonia]], which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho's time,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} At the start of the festival, the women would plant a \"garden of Adonis\",{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as [[lettuce]] and [[fennel]], or even quick-sprouting grains such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} The plants would sprout in the sunlight,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=97}} but wither quickly in the heat.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=97\u201398}} Then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=98}} tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=98}}\n\n===Divine

''Metamorphoses''.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=90\u201391}} According to Ovid, Pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of Cyprus, who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=215}} He fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of Aphrodite and longed to marry it.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|pages=215\u2013217}} Because Pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to Aphrodite,{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=217}} the goddess brought the statue to life.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=91}}{{sfn|Powell|2012|page=217}} Pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named Paphos, after whom the [[Paphos|capital of

brutally.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=98\u201399}} A myth described in Apollonius of Rhodes's ''Argonautica'' and later summarized in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus tells how, when the women of the island of [[Lemnos]] refused to sacrifice to Aphrodite, the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} Instead, their husbands started having sex with their [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Sexual slavery|slave-girls]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} In anger, the women of Lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island, as well as all the Thracian slaves.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} When [[Jason]] and his crew of [[Argonauts]] arrived on Lemnos, they mated with the sex-starved women under Aphrodite's approval and repopulated the island.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} From then on, the women of Lemnos never disrespected Aphrodite again.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}}\n\nIn [[Euripides]]'s tragedy ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', which was first performed at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] in 428 BC, Theseus's son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]] worships only [[Artemis]], the goddess of virginity, and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=99}} Aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=100}} and, in the prologue to the play, she declares that, by honoring only Artemis and refusing to venerate her, Hippolytus has directly challenged her authority.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=100\u2013101}} Aphrodite therefore causes Hippolytus's stepmother, [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]], to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus will reject her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=101}} After being rejected, Phaedra commits suicide and leaves a [[suicide note]] to Theseus telling him that she killed herself because Hippolytus attempted to rape her.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=101}} Theseus prays to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus for his transgression.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=102}} Poseidon sends a [[wild bull]] to scare Hippolytus's horses as he is

poem of the [[Epic Cycle]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31\u201332}} which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]] (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]).{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=31}} Only [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], goddess of discord, was not invited.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=31\u201332}} She was annoyed at this, so she

goddesses.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}}\n\nThe goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346\u2013347}} Since the [[Renaissance]], however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.{{sfn|Bull|2005|pages=346\u2013347}}\n\nAll three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all [[Asia]] and [[Europe]],{{sfn|Walcot|1977|page=32}} and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in

earth.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32\u201333}} This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]].{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32\u201333}} Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple.{{sfn|Walcot|1977|pages=32\u201333}} The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the [[Trojan

Menelaus after he foolishly challenges him to a one-on-one [[duel]].{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=85\u201386}} She then appears to Helen in the form of an old woman and attempts to persuade her to have sex with Paris,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=35\u201336, 86\u201387}} reminding her of his physical beauty and athletic prowess.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=36, 86\u201387}} Helen immediately recognizes Aphrodite by her beautiful neck, perfect breasts, and flashing eyes{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=87}} and chides the goddess, addressing her as her equal.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=87\u201388}} Aphrodite sharply rebukes Helen, reminding her that, if she vexes her, she will punish her just as much as she has favored her already.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=88}} Helen demurely obeys Aphrodite's

\"[http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/thematic-views/image-gallery/RA49?set so-called Venus in a bikini].\" ''Cir.campania.beniculturali.it''.\n<blockquote>The statuette portrays Aphrodite on the point of untying the laces of the sandal on her left foot, under which a small Eros squats, touching the sole of her shoe with his right hand. The Goddess is leaning with her left arm (the hand is missing) against a figure of Priapus standing, naked and bearded, positioned on a small cylindrical altar while, next to her left thigh, there is a tree trunk over which the garment of the Goddess is folded. Aphrodite, almost completely naked, wears only a sort of costume, consisting of a corset held up by two pairs of straps and two short sleeves on the upper part of her arm, from which a long chain leads to her hips and forms a star-shaped motif at the level of her navel. The 'bikini', for which the statuette is famous, is obtained by the masterly use of the technique of gilding, also employed on her groin, in the pendant necklace and in the armilla on Aphrodite\u2019s right wrist, as well as on Priapus\u2019 phallus. Traces of the red paint are evident on the tree trunk, on the short curly hair gathered back in a bun and on the lips of the Goddess, as well as on the heads of Priapus and the Eros. Aphrodite\u2019s eyes are made of glass paste, while the presence of holes at the level of the ear-lobes suggest the existence of precious metal ear-rings which have since been lost. An interesting insight into the female ornaments of Roman times, the statuette, probably imported from the area of Alexandria, reproduces with a few modifications the statuary type of Aphrodite untying her sandal, known from copies in bronze and terracotta.</blockquote>\n\nFor extensive research and a bibliography on the subject, see: de Franciscis 1963, p. 78, tav.

was shown naked because \"the sin of lust is never cloaked\"{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} and that she was often shown \"swimming\" because \"all lust suffers shipwreck of its affairs.\"{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} He also argued that she was associated with doves and conchs because these are symbols of copulation,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}} and that she was associated with roses because \"as the rose gives pleasure, but is swept away by the swift movement of the seasons, so lust is pleasant for a moment, but is swept away forever.\"{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=81}}\n\nWhile Fulgentius had appropriated Aphrodite as a symbol of Lust,{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} [[Isidore of Seville]] ({{circa}} 560\u2013636) interpreted her as a symbol of marital procreative sex{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} and declared that the moral of the story of Aphrodite's birth is that sex can only be holy in the presence of semen, blood, and heat, which he regarded as all being necessary for procreation.{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} Meanwhile, Isidore denigrated Aphrodite/Venus's son Eros/Cupid as a \"demon of fornication\" (''daemon fornicationis'').{{sfn|Tinkle|1996|page=82}} Aphrodite/Venus was best known to Western European scholars through her appearances in Virgil's ''Aeneid'' and Ovid's

''[[ekphrasis]]'' of it preserved by [[Cicero]] and Pliny the Elder.{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Artists also drew inspiration from [[Ovid]]'s description of the birth of Venus in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''.{{sfn|Ames-Lewis|2000|page=193}} Sandro Botticelli's ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' ({{circa}} 1485) was also partially inspired by a description by [[Poliziano]] of a relief on the

S. Lewis]] described an attempted reading of it as \"suffocating\".{{sfn|L\u00e1kta|2017|page=58}}\n\nAphrodite appears in [[Richard Garnett (writer)|Richard Garnett]]'s short story collection ''[[The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales]]'' (1888),{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=354\u2013355}} in which the gods' temples have been destroyed by Christians.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=355}} Stories revolving around sculptures of Aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=364}} Examples of such works of literature include the novel ''The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance'' (1885) by [[Thomas Anstey Guthrie]] and the short story ''[[La V\u00e9nus d'Ille|The Venus of Ille]]'' (1887) by [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]],{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=361\u2013362}} both of which are about statues of Aphrodite that come to life.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=361\u2013362}} Another noteworthy example is ''Aphrodite in Aulis'' by the Anglo-Irish writer [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]],{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=363}} which revolves around an ancient Greek family who moves to [[Aulis (ancient Greece)|Aulis]].{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=363\u2013364}} The French writer [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]] titled his erotic historical novel ''[[Aphrodite: m\u0153urs antiques]]'' (1896) after the Greek goddess.{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836\u2013844}} The novel enjoyed widespread commercial success,{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836\u2013844}} but scandalized French audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of Greek society.{{sfn|Brooks|Alden|1980|pages=836\u2013844}}\n\nIn the early twentieth century, stories of Aphrodite were used by [[Feminism|feminist]] poets,{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=369}} such as [[Amy Lowell]] and [[Alicia Ostriker]].{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=369\u2013371}} Many of these poems dealt with Aphrodite's legendary birth from the foam of the sea.{{sfn|Clark|2015|page=369}} Other feminist writers, including [[Claude Cahun]], [[Thit Jensen]], and [[Ana\u00efs Nin]] also made use of the myth of Aphrodite in their writings.{{sfn|Clark|2015|pages=372\u2013374}} Ever since the publication of [[Isabel Allende]]'s book ''Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses'' in 1998, the name \"Aphrodite\" has been used as a title for dozens of books dealing with all topics even superficially connected to her domain.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=134\u2013135}} Frequently these books do not even mention Aphrodite,{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|pages=134\u2013135}} or mention her only briefly, but make use of her name as a selling point.{{sfn|Cyrino|2010|page=135}}\n\n===Modern worship===\nIn 1938, [[Gleb Botkin]], a Russian immigrant to the United States, founded the [[Church of Aphrodite]], a [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] religion centered around the worship of a [[Mother Goddess]], whom its practitioners identified as Aphrodite.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=139}}{{sfn|Pizza|Lewis|2009|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rwzttsI9\u2013NwC&pg=PA327 327&ndash;328]}} The Church of Aphrodite's theology was laid out in the book ''In Search of Reality'', published in 1969, two years before Botkin's death.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} The book portrayed Aphrodite in a drastically different light than the one in which the Greeks envisioned her,{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} instead casting her as \"the sole Goddess of a somewhat Neoplatonic Pagan monotheism\".{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} It claimed that the worship of Aphrodite had been brought to Greece by the [[Mysticism|mystic teacher]] [[Orpheus]],{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}} but that the Greeks had misunderstood Orpheus's teachings and had not realized the importance of worshipping Aphrodite alone.{{sfn|Clifton|2006|page=141}}\n\nAphrodite is a major deity in [[Wicca]],{{sfn|Gallaher|2005|pages=109\u2013110}}{{sfn|Sabin|2010|page=125}} a contemporary

More formally, ''R'' is anti-symmetric precisely if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X''\n:if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') with ''a''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''b'', then ''R''(''b'', ''a'') must not hold,\nor, equivalently,\n:if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') and ''R''(''b'', ''a''), then ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b''.\n(The definition of anti-symmetry says nothing about whether ''R''(''a'', ''a'') actually holds or not for any ''a''.)\n\nThe [[divisibility]] relation on the [[natural number]]s is an important example of an anti-symmetric relation. In this context, anti-symmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if ''n'' and ''m'' are distinct and ''n'' is a factor of ''m'', then ''m'' cannot be a factor of ''n''.  For example,  12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12.\n\nThe usual [[order relation]] \u2264 on the [[real number]]s is anti-symmetric: if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] \u2286 on the subsets of any given set is anti-symmetric: given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in ''A'' also is in ''B'' and every element in ''B'' is also in ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:\n:<math>A \\subseteq B \\and B \\subseteq A \\Rightarrow A = B</math>\n\n[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are anti-symmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and anti-symmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor anti-symmetric (e.g., the \"preys on\" relation on biological [[species]]).\n\nAnti-symmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]], which requires both anti-symmetry and [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].  Thus, every asymmetric relation is anti-symmetric, but the reverse is false.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Symmetric relation]]\n* [[Asymmetric relation]]\n* [[Symmetry in mathematics]]\n\n==References==\n*{{MathWorld | urlname=AntisymmetricRelation | title=Antisymmetric Relation}}\n*{{cite book |title=Theory and Problems of Discrete Mathematics |first=Seymour |last=Lipschutz |authorlink=Seymour Lipschutz |author2=Marc Lars Lipson |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-038045-7 |page=33}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Antisymmetric Relation}}\n[[Category:Binary relations]]", "sha1": "24djf1e6f9wz9vdu6cncpwzartuhvko"}}, {"title": "Aleister Crowley", "ns": "0", "id": "1177", "revision": {"id": "866219393", "parentid": "865993747", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T01:26:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Iamthecheese44", "id": "15183719"}, "comment": "Added marriage templates", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{good article}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name        = Aleister Crowley\n| image       = Aleister Crowley.jpg\n| caption     = Aleister Crowley, c.&nbsp;1912\n| birth_name  = Edward Alexander Crowley\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|df=yes|1875|10|12}}\n| birth_place = [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], England\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|df=yes|1947|12|1|1875|10|12}}\n| death_place = [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]], England\n| occupation  = Occultist, poet, novelist, mountaineer\n| signature   = Signature_of_Aleister_Crowley.svg\n| spouse      = {{marriage|[[Rose Edith Kelly]]|1903|1909|end=div}}<br/> {{marriage|Maria Teresa Sanchez<br>|1929}}\n| children    = 5\n| education   = [[Malvern College]] <br> [[Tonbridge School]] <br> [[Eastbourne College]] \n| alma_mater  = [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]\n}}\n\n'''Aleister Crowley''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|l|e\u026a|s|t|\u0259r|_|\u02c8|k|r|o\u028a|l|i}}; born '''Edward Alexander Crowley'''; 12 October 1875 \u2013 1 December 1947) was an English [[Occult#Occultism|occultist]], [[ceremonial magic]]ian, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He founded the religion of [[Thelema]], identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the [[Aeon (Thelema)|\u00c6on of Horus]] in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.\n\nBorn to a wealthy family in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], [[Warwickshire]], Crowley rejected his parent's [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christian]] [[Plymouth Brethren]] faith to pursue an interest in [[Western esotericism]]. He was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. Some biographers allege that here he was recruited into a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence agency]], further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life. In 1898 he joined the esoteric [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where he was trained in ceremonial magic by [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]] and [[Charles Henry Allan Bennett|Allan Bennett]]. Moving to [[Boleskine House]] by [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland, he went mountaineering in Mexico with [[Oscar Eckenstein]], before studying [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practices in India. He married [[Rose Edith Kelly]] and in 1904 they honeymooned in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where Crowley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named [[Aiwass]], who provided him with ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', a sacred text that served as the basis for Thelema. Announcing the start of the \u00c6on of Horus, ''The Book'' declared that its followers should \"Do what thou wilt\" and seek to align themselves with their [[True Will]] through the practice of [[Magick (Thelema)|magick]].\n\nAfter [[1905 Kanchenjunga expedition|an unsuccessful attempt to climb Kanchenjunga]] and a visit to India and China, Crowley returned to Britain, where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry, novels, and occult literature. In 1907, he and [[George Cecil Jones]] co-founded an esoteric order, the [[A\u2234A\u2234]], through which they propagated Thelema. After spending time in Algeria, in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order, the German-based [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.), rising to become the leader of its British branch, which he reformulated in accordance with his Thelemite beliefs. Through the O.T.O., Thelemite groups were established in Britain, Australia, and North America. Crowley spent the [[First World War]] in the United States, where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain, later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro-German movement to assist the British intelligence services. In 1920 he established the [[Abbey of Thelema]], a religious commune in [[Cefal\u00f9]], Sicily where he lived with various followers. His [[libertine]] lifestyle led to denunciations in the British press, and the Italian government evicted him in 1923. He divided the following two decades between France, Germany, and England, and continued to promote Thelema until his death.\n\nCrowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug experimenter]], [[bisexual]] and an [[Individualism|individualist]] [[social criticism|social critic]]. He was denounced in the popular press as \"the wickedest man in the world\" and a [[Satanist]]. Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western esotericism and the [[counterculture]], and continues to be considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various biographies and academic studies.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Youth: 1875\u201394===\n[[File:Aleister Crowley birthplace.jpg|thumb|Aleister Crowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.]]\n\nCrowley was born as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in [[Royal Leamington Spa]], Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=15|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=14}} His father, Edward Crowley (1829\u201387), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had allowed him to retire before his son was born.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=31\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=4\u20138|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=14\u201315}} His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848\u20131917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a strained relationship with her son; she described him as \"the Beast\", a name that he revelled in.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=18\u201321|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=13\u201316|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=17\u201321}} The couple had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=3|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=13\u201314|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=17}} and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a [[Quaker]], but had converted to the [[Exclusive Brethren]], a faction of a [[Christian fundamentalist]] group known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]], with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=3\u20134, 6, 9\u201310|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=17\u201323|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=11\u201312, 16}} Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Kaczynski|2y=2010|2p=16|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=24}} At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in [[Hastings]], and then to Ebor preparatory school in [[Cambridge]], run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=12\u201314|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=25\u201329|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=17\u201318|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=24}}\n\nIn March 1887, when Crowley was 11, his father died of [[oral cancer|tongue cancer]].

Heading on a honeymoon to Paris, Cairo, and then Ceylon, Crowley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections.

It stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this Aeon, \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law,\" and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will.

Often resenting it, he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform, which included taking the Stele of Revealing from the museum, fortifying his own island, and translating the book into all the world's languages. According to his account, he instead sent typescripts of the work to several occultists he knew, putting the manuscript away and ignoring it.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=188|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=139|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=129}}\n\n===Kanchenjunga and China: 1905\u201306===\nReturning to Boleskine, Crowley came to believe that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the relationship between the two broke down.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=189, 194\u201395|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=140\u2013141|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=130|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic ''Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden'' to entertain his recuperating wife.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=195\u201396|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=142|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=132|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=108}} He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]].

In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of \u00a3100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was [[J. F. C. Fuller]], a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, ''The Star in the West'' (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=241\u201342|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=177\u201379|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=136\u201337, 139, 168\u201369}}\n\n[[File:Kanchenjunga India.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kanchenjunga]], as seen from [[Darjeeling]]]]\n\nCrowley decided to climb [[Kangchenjunga|Kanchenjunga]] in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely recognised as the world's most treacherous mountain.

They subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks, where Crowley had a sadomasochistic relationship with the Hungarian Anny Ringler.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=308\u201309|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=232\u201334|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=261\u201365}} In Moscow, Crowley continued to write plays and poetry, including \"Hymn to [[Pan (god)|Pan]]\", and the [[Gnostic Mass]], a Thelemic ritual that became a key part of O.T.O. liturgy.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=309\u201310|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=234\u2013235|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=264}} Churton suggested that Crowley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city.{{sfn|Churton|2011|pp=178\u201382}} In January 1914 Crowley and Neuburg settled into an apartment in Paris, where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding [[Jacob Epstein]]'s new monument to [[Oscar Wilde]].{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=307|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=218|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=266\u201367}} Together Crowley and Neuburg performed the six-week \"Paris Working\", a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. As part of the ritual, the couple performed acts of sex magic together, at times being joined by journalist [[Walter Duranty]]. Inspired by the results of the Working, Crowley wrote ''Liber Agap\u00e9'', a treatise on sex magic.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=313\u201316|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=235\u201340|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=269\u201374}} Following the Paris Working, Neuburg began to distance himself from Crowley, resulting in an argument in which Crowley [[curse]]d him.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=317\u201319|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=240\u201341|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=275\u201376}}\n\n===United States: 1914\u201319===\nBy 1914 Crowley was living a hand-to-mouth existence, relying largely on donations from A\u2234A\u2234 members and dues payments made to O.T.O.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=321}} In May he transferred ownership of Boleskine House to the MMM for financial reasons,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=321\u201322|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=240|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3p=277|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4p=186}} and in July he went mountaineering in the Swiss Alps.

He became involved in New York's pro-German movement, and in January 1915 German spy [[George Sylvester Viereck]] employed him as a writer for his propagandist paper, ''[[The Fatherland]]'', which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=326\u201330|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=245\u201347|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=283\u201384}} In later years, detractors denounced Crowley as a traitor to Britain for this action.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=247|3a1=Churton|3y=2011|3p=186}} In reality, Crowley was a double agent, working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany's operation in New York. Many of his articles in ''The Fatherland'' were hyperbolic, for instance comparing [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to Jesus Christ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt&nbsp;\u2013 reported on by ''[[The New York Times]]''&nbsp;\u2013 in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the [[Statue of Liberty]]; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1pp=247\u201348|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201376|4a1=Kaczynski|4y=2010|4pp=284\u201387, 292\u201392|5a1=Churton|5y=2011|5pp=190\u201393}} It has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the ''Lusitania'', informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war, while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain's side.{{sfnm|1a1=Spence|1y=2008|1pp=82\u201389|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2pp=195\u201397}}\n\nCrowley entered into a relationship with [[Jeanne Robert Foster]], with whom he toured the West Coast. In [[Vancouver]], headquarters of the North American O.T.O., he met with [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Wilfred Talbot Smith]] to discuss the propagation of Thelema on the continent. In Detroit he experimented with [[anhalonium]] at [[Parke-Davis]], then visited Seattle, San Francisco, [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], Los Angeles, San Diego, [[Tijuana]], and the [[Grand Canyon]], before returning to New York.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1pp=330\u201333|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=251\u201355|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=288\u201391, 295\u201397|4a1=Churton|4y=2011|4pp=198\u2013203}} There he befriended [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and his wife Alice Richardson; Crowley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916, following which she became pregnant and then miscarried.{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=333|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2pp=255\u201357|3a1=Kaczynski|3y=2010|3pp=298\u2013301}} Later that year he took a \"magical retirement\" to a cabin by [[Newfound Lake|Lake Pasquaney]] owned by Evangeline Adams. There, he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself \"Master Therion\". He also wrote several short stories based on [[James George Frazer|J.G.

Through their rituals, which Crowley called \"The Amalantrah Workings\", he believed that they were contacted by a preternatural entity named Lam.

He believed that this Aeon follows on from the Aeon of Osiris, in which paternalistic religions like Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism dominated the world, and that this in turn had followed the Aeon of Isis, which had been maternalistic and dominated by goddess worship.{{sfnm|1a1=Drury|1y=2012|1p=210|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=3}} He believed that Thelema was the proper religion of the Aeon of Horus,{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=88}} and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new Aeon.{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=51}} Thelema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue, and that this exists in harmony with the Cosmic Will that pervades the universe.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Drury|2y=2012|2p=209}} Crowley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one's True Will to be \"the Great Work\" or the attaining of the \"knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|pp=88\u201389}} His favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abramelin operation, a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th-century grimoire.{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=89}} The moral code of \"Do What Thou Wilt\" is believed by Thelemites to be the religion's ethical law, although the historian of religion Marco Pasi noted that this was not [[anarchism|anarchistic]] or [[libertarianism|libertarian]] in structure, as Crowley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}}\n\n===Magick and theology===\n\nCrowley believed in the objective existence of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], which he chose to spell \"Magick\", an older archaic spelling of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Asprem|2y=2013|2p=89|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He provided various different definitions of this term over his career.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In his book ''Magick in Theory and Practice'', Crowley defined Magick as \"the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=DuQuette|2y=2003|2p=11|3a1=Doyle White|3y=2016|3p=4}} He also told his disciple Karl Germer that \"Magick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours.

Crowley stated he did not consider himself a Satanist, nor did he worship [[Satan]], as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=175|2a1=Dyrendal|2y=2012|2pp=369\u201370}} He nevertheless used Satanic imagery, for instance by describing himself as \"the Beast 666\" and referring to the [[Whore of Babylon]] in his work, while in later life he sent \"[[Christmas cards|Antichristmas cards]]\" to his friends.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} In his writings, Crowley occasionally identified Aiwass as Satan and designated him as \"Our Lord God the Devil\" at one occasion.{{sfn|van Luijk|2016|p=309}} The scholar of religion Gordan Djurdjevic stated that Crowley \"was emphatically not\" a Satanist, \"if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|p=58}} Crowley nevertheless expressed anti-Christian sentiment, stating that he hated Christianity \"as Socialists hate soap\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=176}} an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Brethren.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=175}} He was also accused of advocating [[human sacrifice]], largely because of a passage in ''Book 4'' in which he stated that \"A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim\" and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year. This was a tongue-in-cheek reference to [[ejaculation]], something not realised by his critics, thus reflecting their own \"ignorance and prejudice\" toward Crowley.{{sfn|Medway|2001|pp=120\u201321}}\n\n==Personal life==\nCrowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that in Crowley's youth, he was \"a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man\" who \"set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms\", while being shielded from an \"outraged public opinion\" by his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}} Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\" with those who challenged him.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=172}}  Crowley biographer [[Martin Booth]] asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=125}} Similarly, Richard Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\".{{sfn|Spence|2008|p=10}} Biographer [[Lawrence Sutin]] noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=148}} The Thelemite [[Lon Milo DuQuette]] noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\"{{sfn|DuQuette|2003|p=9}}\n===Political views===\nCrowley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality,{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=33}} with [[John Symonds]] noting that he \"was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time\".{{sfn|Symonds|1997|p=vii}} Crowley's political thought was studied by academic Marco Pasi, who noted that for Crowley, socio-political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones.{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=23}} He was neither on the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] nor [[Right-wing politics|right]] but perhaps best categorised as a \"conservative revolutionary\" despite not being affiliated with the German-based [[conservative revolutionary movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=49\u201350}} Pasi described Crowley's affinity to the extreme ideologies of [[Nazism]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], which aimed to violently overturn society: \"What Crowley liked about Nazism and communism, or at least what made him curious about them, was the anti-Christian position and the revolutionary and socially subversive implications of these two movements. In their subversive powers, he saw the possibility of an annihilation of old religious traditions, and the creation of a void that Thelema, subsequently, would be able to fill.\"{{sfn|Pasi|2014|pp=52\u201353}} Crowley described democracy as an \"imbecile and nauseating cult of weakness\",{{sfn|Morgan|2011|p=166}} and commented that ''The Book of the Law'' proclaimed that \"there is the master and there is the slave; the noble and the serf; the 'lone wolf' and the herd\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=49}} In this attitude he was influenced by the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and by [[Social Darwinism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Sutin|1y=2000|1p=129|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=401|3a1=Pasi|3y=2014|3p=48}} Although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy, he regarded himself as an aristocrat and styled himself as Laird Boleskine,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=109}} once describing his ideology as \"aristocratic communism\".{{sfn|Pasi|2014|p=50}}\n\n===Views on race and gender===\nCrowley was bisexual, and exhibited a sexual preference for women,{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=174|2a1=Booth|2y=2000|2p=67|3a1=Spence|3y=2008|3p=19}} with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} In particular he had an attraction toward \"exotic women\",{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=130}} and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions; Kaczynski stated that \"when he loved, he did so with his whole being, but the passion was typically short-lived\".{{sfn|Kaczynski|2010|p=91}} Even in later life, Crowley was able to attract young bohemian women to be his lovers, largely due to his charisma.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=350}} During homosexual [[anal sex|anal intercourse]], he usually played the passive role,{{sfnm|1a1=Booth|1y=2000|1p=63|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=159}} which Booth believed \"appealed to his masochistic side\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=63}} Crowley argued that homosexual and bisexual people should not suppress their sexual orientation,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=174}} commenting that a person \"must not be ashamed or afraid of being homosexual if he happens to be so at heart; he must not attempt to violate his own true nature because of public opinion, or medieval morality, or religious prejudice which would wish he were otherwise.\"{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=128}} On other issues he adopted a more conservative attitude; he opposed abortion on moral grounds, believing that no woman following her True Will would ever desire one.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=176|2a1=Sutin|2y=2000|2p=145}}\n\nBiographer Lawrence Sutin stated that \"blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crowley's writings\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=223\u201324}} Sutin thought Crowley \"a spoiled scion of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst [[John Bull]] racial and social prejudices of his upper-class contemporaries\", noting that he \"embodied the contradiction that writhed within many Western intellectuals of the time: deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society, coupled with a fascination with people of colour\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|pp=2, 336}} Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their \"sublime\" poetry and stated that they exhibited \"imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity\", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit \"avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest\".{{sfn|Booth|2000|pp=268\u201369}} He was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups, for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a \"spiritual superiority\" to the English,{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=137}} and praised Muslims for exhibiting \"manliness, straightforwardness, subtlety, and self-respect\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=180}}\n\nCrowley also exhibited a \"general misogyny\" that Booth believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother.{{sfn|Booth|2000|p=61}} Sutin noted that Crowley \"largely accepted the notion, implicitly embodied in Victorian sexology, of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=28}} Crowley described women as \"moral inferiors\" who had to be treated with \"firmness, kindness and justice\".{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=114}}\n\n==Legacy and influence==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"[H]e is today looked upon as a source of inspiration by many people in search of spiritual enlightenment and/\nor instructions in magical practice.

In other fields, such as poetry, alpinism and painting, he may have been a minor figure, but it is only fair to admit that, in the limited context of occultism, he has played and still plays a major role.\" |source=Marco Pasi, 2003.{{sfn|Pasi|2003|p=225}}}}\n\nCrowley has remained an influential figure, both amongst occultists and in popular culture, particularly that of Britain, but also of other parts of the world. In 2002, a BBC poll placed Crowley seventy-third in a list of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].{{sfnm|1a1=Pasi|1y=2003|1p=225|2a1=Churton|2y=2011|2p=3}}  [[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Richard Cavendish]] has written of him that \"In native talent, penetrating intelligence and determination, Aleister Crowley was the best-equipped magician to emerge since the seventeenth century.\"{{sfn|Cavendish|1978|p=167}} The scholar of esotericism Egil Asprem described him as \"one of the most well-known figures in modern occultism\".{{sfn|Asprem|2013|p=85}} The scholar of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] asserted that Crowley was an extreme representation of \"the dark side of the occult\",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2012|p=ix}} adding that he was \"the most notorious occultist magician of the twentieth century\".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|p=41}} The philosopher John Moore opined that Crowley stood out as a \"Modern Master\" when compared with other prominent occult figures like [[George Gurdjieff]], [[P.D. Ouspensky]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], or [[Helena Blavatsky]],{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=5}} also describing him as a \"living embodiment\" of [[Oswald Spengler]]'s \"[[The Decline of the West|Faustian Man]]\".{{sfn|Moore|2009|p=40}}\nBiographer [[Tobias Churton]] considered Crowley \"a pioneer of consciousness research\".{{sfn|Churton|2011|p=88}} Hutton noted that Crowley had \"an important place in the history of modern Western responses to Oriental spiritual traditions\",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=171}} while Sutin thought that he had made \"distinctly original contributions\" to the study of yoga in the West.{{sfn|Sutin|2000|p=93}}\n\nThelema continued to develop and spread following Crowley's death. In 1969, the O.T.O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Grady Louis McMurtry;{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}} in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group, the Society Ordo Templi Orientis, led by Brazilian Thelemite [[Marcelo Ramos Motta]].{{sfn|Bogdan|Starr|2012|p=7}}\nAnother American Thelemite was the filmmaker [[Kenneth Anger]], who had been influenced by Crowley's writings from a young age.{{sfnm|1a1=Landis|1y=1995|1pp=26\u201334|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=1\u20133}} In the United Kingdom, [[Kenneth Grant]] propagated a tradition known as Typhonian Thelema through his organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., later renamed the [[Typhonian Order]].{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=284\u2013350}}\nAlso in Britain, an occultist known as [[Amado Crowley]] claimed to be Crowley's son; this has been refuted by academic investigation. Amado argued that Thelema was a false religion created by Crowley to hide his true esoteric teachings, which Amado claimed to be propagating.{{sfn|Evans|2007|pp=229\u201383}}\n\nSeveral Western esoteric traditions other than Thelema were also influenced by Crowley, with Djurdjevic observing that \"Crowley's influence on twentieth-century and contemporary esotericism has been enormous\".{{sfn|Djurdjevic|2014|pp=35\u201336}} Gerald Gardner, founder of [[Gardnerian Wicca]], made use of much of Crowley's published material when composing the Gardnerian ritual liturgy,{{sfn|Hutton|2012|pp=285\u2013306}} and the Australian witch [[Rosaleen Norton]] was also heavily influenced by Crowley's ideas.{{sfn|Richmond|2012|pp=307\u201334}} More widely, Crowley became \"a dominant figure\" in the modern Pagan community.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=180}} [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the American founder of [[Scientology]], was involved in Thelema in the early 1940s (with [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]]), and it has been argued that [[Scientology and the occult|Crowley's ideas influenced some of Hubbard's work]].{{sfn|Urban|2012|pp=335\u201368}} The scholars of religion Asbj\u00f8rn Dyrendel, James R. Lewis, and Jesper Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crowley was not a Satanist, he \"in many ways embodies the pre-Satanist esoteric discourse on Satan and Satanism through his lifestyle and his philosophy\", with his \"image and ought\" becoming an \"important influence\" on the later development of religious Satanism.{{sfn|Dyrendal|Lewis|Petersen|2016|p=39}} For instance, two prominent figures in religious Satanism, [[Anton LaVey]] and [[Temple of Set|Michael Aquino]], were influenced by Crowley's work.{{sfn|Dyrendal|2012|pp=369\u201394}}\n\nCrowley also had a wider influence in [[British popular culture]]. After his time in Cefalu which had brought him to public attention in Britain, various \"literary Crowleys\" appeared; characters in fiction based upon him.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} One of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Arabin in [[John Buchan]]'s 1926 novel ''[[The Dancing Floor]]''.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=103}} In his novel ''[[The Devil Rides Out]]'', the writer [[Dennis Wheatley]] used Crowley as a partial basis for the character of Damien Morcata, a portly bald defrocked priest who engages in black magic.{{sfn|Freeman|2018|pp=106\u2013107}} The occultist [[Dion Fortune]] used Crowley as a basis for characters in her books ''The Secrets of Doctor Taverner'' (1926) and ''The Winged Bull'' (1935).{{sfn|Freeman|2018|p=105}} He was included as one of the figures on the cover art of [[The Beatles]]' album ''[[Sgt.

According to various ideas about the afterlife, the essential aspect of the individual that lives on after death may be some partial element, or the entire [[soul]] or [[spirit]], of an individual, which carries with it and may confer personal identity or, on the contrary, may not, as in Indian [[nirvana]]. Belief in an afterlife, which may be [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] or [[supernatural]], is in contrast to the belief in [[eternal oblivion|oblivion after death]].\n\nIn some views, this continued existence often takes place in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] realm, and in other popular views, the individual may be [[#Reincarnation|reborn]] into [[World (theology)|this world]] and begin the life cycle over again, likely with no memory of what they have done in the past. In this latter view, such rebirths and deaths may take place over and over again continuously until the individual gains entry to a spiritual realm or [[Otherworld]]. Major views on the afterlife derive from [[religion]], [[esotericism]] and [[metaphysics]].\n\nSome belief systems, such as those in the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic tradition]], hold that the dead go to a specific [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] after death, as determined by [[God]], or other [[divine judgment]], based on their [[orthopraxy|actions]] or [[orthodoxy|beliefs]] during life. In contrast, in systems of [[#Reincarnation|reincarnation]], such as those in the [[Indian religions]], the nature of the continued existence is determined directly by the actions of the individual in the ended life, rather than through the decision of a different being.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Different metaphysical models==\n[[Theists]] generally believe some type of afterlife awaits people when they die. Members of some generally non-theistic religions tend to believe in an afterlife, but without reference to a deity. The [[Sadducees]] were an ancient Jewish sect that generally believed that there was a God but no afterlife.\n\nMany religions, whether they believe in the soul's existence in another world like Christianity, Islam and many [[Paganism|pagan]] belief systems, or in reincarnation like many forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, believe that one's status in the afterlife is a reward or punishment for their conduct during life.\n\n===Reincarnation===\n{{main|Reincarnation}}\nReincarnation is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C.

According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases [[Entering Heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].\n\nHeaven is often described as a \"higher place\", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[underworld]] or the \"low places\", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]] or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[world to come]].\n\nIn [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''. There are seven positive regions the soul can go to after death and seven negative regions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life after death - Where do we go after we die?|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-GB}}</ref> After completing its stay in the respective region, the soul is subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as [[otherworld]].\n\n[[Hell]], in many religious and [[folklore|folkloric]] traditions, is a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]] in the afterlife. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hell as an [[eternal damnation|eternal destination]],<!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--> while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.<!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--> Typically, these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[purgatory]] and [[limbo]].\n\nTraditions that do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward merely describe hell as an [[Bosom of Abraham|abode of the dead]], the [[grave]], a neutral place (for example, [[sheol]] or [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]) located under the surface of earth.\n\n==Ancient religions==\n\n===Ancient Egyptian religion===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian religion#Afterlife}}\nThe afterlife played an important role in [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and its belief system is one of the earliest known in recorded history. When the body died, parts of its soul known as ''ka'' (body double) and the ''ba'' (personality) would go to the Kingdom of the Dead. While the soul dwelt in the [[Aaru|Fields of Aaru]], [[Osiris]] demanded work as restitution for the protection he provided. Statues were placed in the tombs to serve as substitutes for the deceased.<ref>Richard P. Taylor, ''Death and the afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87436-939-8}}</ref>\n\nArriving at one's reward in afterlife was a demanding ordeal, requiring a sin-free heart and the ability to recite the spells, passwords and formulae of the [[Book of the Dead]]. In the Hall of Two Truths, the deceased's heart was weighed against the ''Shu'' feather of truth and justice taken from the headdress of the goddess [[Ma'at]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Bard| first = Katheryn | title = Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999| isbn = }}</ref> If the heart was lighter than the feather, they could pass on, but if it were heavier they would be devoured by the demon [[Ammit]].<ref>Kathryn Demeritt, ''Ptah's Travels: Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt'', 2005, p. 82</ref>\n\nEgyptians also believed that being mummified and put in a sarcophagus (an ancient Egyptian \"coffin\" carved with complex symbols and designs, as well as pictures and hieroglyphs) was the only way to have an afterlife. Only if the corpse had been properly [[Embalming|embalmed]] and entombed in a [[mastaba]], could the [[Resurrection of the Dead|dead live again]] in the Fields of Yalu and accompany the Sun on its daily ride. Due to the dangers the afterlife posed, the Book of the Dead was placed in the tomb with the body as well as food, jewellery, and 'curses'. They also used the \"opening of the mouth\".<ref>Glennys Howarth, Oliver Leaman, ''Encyclopedia of death and dying'', 2001, p. 238</ref><ref>Natalie Lunis, ''Tut's Deadly Tomb'', 2010, p. 11</ref>\n\nAncient Egyptian civilization was based on religion; their belief in the rebirth after death became the driving force behind their funeral practices. Death was simply a temporary interruption, rather than complete cessation, of life, and that eternal life could be ensured by means like piety to the gods, preservation of the physical form through [[mummification]], and the provision of statuary and other funerary equipment. Each human consisted of the physical body, the ''ka'', the ''ba'', and the ''akh''. The Name and Shadow were also living entities. To enjoy the afterlife, all these elements had to be sustained and protected from harm.<ref>Fergus Fleming, Alan Lothian, ''Ancient Egypt's Myths and Beliefs'', 2011, p. 96</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 2010, a spokesman for the Egyptian Culture Ministry claimed it had unearthed a large red granite door in Luxor with inscriptions by [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb|title=Door to Afterlife found in Egyptian tomb |publisher=www.meeja.com.au |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2008-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110016/http://www.meeja.com.au/articles/door-to-afterlife-found-in-egyptian-tomb |archivedate=2011-07-06}}</ref> a powerful adviser to the [[18th dynasty]] Queen [[Hatshepsut]] who ruled between 1479 BC and 1458 BC, the longest of any woman. It believes the false door is a 'door to the Afterlife'. According to the archaeologists, the door was reused in a structure in [[Roman Egypt]].\n\n===Ancient Greek and Roman religions===\n{{main|Greek underworld}}\nThe Greek god [[Hades]] is known in [[Greek mythology]] as the king of the [[underworld]], a place where souls live after death.<ref>F. P. Retief and L. Cilliers, \"Burial customs, the afterlife and the pollution of death in ancient Greece\", ''Acta Theologica'' '''26'''(2), 2006, p. 45 ([http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52560/41166 PDF]).</ref> The Greek god [[Hermes]], the messenger of the gods, would take the dead soul of a person to the underworld (sometimes called Hades or the House of Hades). Hermes would leave the soul on the banks of the River [[Styx]], the river between life and death.<ref>Social Studies School Service, ''Ancient Greece'', 2003, pp.&nbsp;49\u201351</ref>\n\n[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], also known as the ferry-man, would take the soul across the river to Hades, if the soul had gold: Upon burial, the family of the dead soul would put coins under the deceased's tongue. Once crossed, the soul would be judged by [[Aeacus]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and King [[Minos]]. The soul would be sent to [[Elysium]], [[Tartarus]], [[Asphodel Fields]], or the Fields of Punishment. The Elysian Fields were for the ones that lived pure lives. It consisted of green fields, valleys and mountains, everyone there was peaceful and contented, and the Sun always shone there. Tartarus was for the people that blasphemed against the gods, or were simply rebellious and consciously evil.<ref>Perry L. Westmoreland, ''Ancient Greek Beliefs'', 2007, pp.&nbsp;68\u201370</ref>\n\nThe Asphodel Fields were for a varied selection of human souls: Those whose sins equalled their goodness, were indecisive in their lives, or were not judged. The Fields of Punishment were for people that had sinned often, but not so much as to be deserving of Tartarus. In Tartarus, the soul would be punished by being burned in lava, or stretched on racks. Some heroes of Greek legend are allowed to visit the underworld. The Romans had a similar belief system about the afterlife, with Hades becoming known as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. In the ancient Greek myth about the [[Labours of Heracles]], the hero [[Heracles]] had to travel to the underworld to capture [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guard dog, as one of his tasks.\n\nIn ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'', [[Cicero]] describes what seems to be an [[out of body experience]], of the [[soul]] traveling high above the Earth, looking down at the small planet, from far away.<ref>N. Sabir, ''Heaven Hell Or'', 2010, p. 147</ref>\n\nIn Book VI of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the hero, [[Aeneas]], travels to the underworld to see his father. By the River Styx, he sees the souls of those not given a proper burial, forced to wait by the river until someone buries them. While down there, along with the dead, he is shown the place where the wrongly convicted reside, the fields of sorrow where those who committed suicide and now regret it reside, including Aeneas' former lover, the warriors and shades, Tartarus (where the titans and powerful non-mortal enemies of the Olympians reside) where he can hear the groans of the imprisoned, the palace of [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], and the fields of Elysium where the descendants of the divine and bravest heroes reside. He sees the river of forgetfulness, [[Lethe]], which the dead must drink to forget their life and begin anew. Lastly, his father shows him all of the future heroes of Rome who will live if Aeneas fulfills his destiny in founding the city.\n\n===Norse religion===\n{{main|Norse religion#Afterlife|Death in Norse paganism}}\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\nThe [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and [[Prose Edda]]s, the oldest sources for information on the Norse concept of the afterlife, vary in their description of the several realms that are described as falling under this topic. The most well-known are:\n* [[Valhalla]]: (lit. \"Hall of the Slain\" i.e. \"the Chosen Ones\") Half the warriors who die in battle join the god [[Odin]] who rules over a majestic hall called Valhalla in [[Asgard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viking-mythology.com/theNineWorlds.php|title=Norse Mythology {{!}} The Nine Worlds|website=www.viking-mythology.com|access-date=2016-05-11}}</ref>\n* [[F\u00f3lkvangr]]: (lit. \"Field of the Host\") The other half join the goddess [[Freyja]] in a great meadow known as F\u00f3lkvangr.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://spangenhelm.com/folkvangr-freyjas-field-warriors/|title=F\u00f3lkvangr, Freyja welcomes you to the Field of the Host|date=2016-05-20|work=Spangenhelm|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n* [[Hel (realm)|Hel]]: (lit. \"The Covered Hall\") This abode is somewhat like [[Hades]] from Ancient Greek religion: there, something not unlike the [[Asphodel Meadows]] can be found, and people who have neither excelled in that which is good nor excelled in that which is bad can expect to go there after they die and be reunited with their loved ones.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* [[Niflhel]]: (lit. \"The Dark\" or \"Misty Hel\") This realm is roughly analogous to Greek [[Tartarus]]. It is the deeper level beneath Hel, and those who break oaths and commit other vile things will be sent there to be among their kind to suffer harsh punishments.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Judaism===\n{{main|Jewish eschatology}}\n\n====She'ol====\n[[She'ol]], in the [[Hebrew Bible]], is a place of darkness to which all the dead go, both the righteous and the unrighteous, regardless of the moral choices made in life, a place of stillness and darkness cut off from life and from God.<ref>{{harvnb|Rainwater|1996|p=819}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe inhabitants of Sheol are the \"shades\" (''[[rephaim]]''), entities without personality or strength.<ref>{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=188}}</ref> Under some circumstances they are thought to be able to be contacted by the living, as the [[Witch of Endor]] contacts the shade of [[Samuel]] for [[Saul]], but such practices are forbidden (Deuteronomy 18:10).<ref>{{harvnb|Knobel|2011|pp=205\u201306}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Hebrew Bible appears to describe Sheol as the permanent place of the dead, in the [[Second Temple period]] (roughly 500 BC\u201370 AD) a more diverse set of ideas developed. In some texts, Sheol is considered to be the home of both the righteous and the wicked, separated into respective compartments; in others, it was considered a place of punishment, meant for the wicked dead alone.<ref name=\"Longenecker 2003 189\">{{harvnb|Longenecker|2003|p=189}}</ref> When the Hebrew scriptures were translated into [[Septuagint|Greek]] in ancient [[Alexandria]] around 200 BC, the word \"[[Hades]]\" (the [[Greek underworld]]) was substituted for Sheol. This is reflected in the [[New Testament]] where Hades is both the underworld of the dead and the personification of the [[evil]] it represents.<ref name=\"Longenecker 2003 189\"/>\n\n====World to Come====\nThe [[Talmud]] offers a number of thoughts relating to the afterlife. After death, the soul is brought for judgment. Those who have led pristine lives enter immediately into the ''Olam Haba'' or [[world to come]]. Most do not enter the world to come immediately, but now experience a period of review of their earthly actions and they are made aware of what they have done wrong. Some view this period as being a \"re-schooling\", with the soul gaining wisdom as one's errors are reviewed. Others view this period to include spiritual discomfort for past wrongs. At the end of this period, not longer than one year, the soul then takes its place in the world to come. Although discomforts are made part of certain Jewish conceptions of the afterlife, the concept of \"eternal [[damnation]]\", so prevalent in other religions, is not a tenet of the Jewish afterlife. According to the Talmud, extinction of the soul is reserved for a far smaller group of malicious and evil leaders, either whose very evil deeds go way beyond norms, or who lead large groups of people to utmost evil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/tsa/tsa37.htm |title=Tractate Sanhedrin: Interpolated Section: Those Who have no Share in the World to Come |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10049.html |title=Jehoiakim |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] describes the ''Olam Haba'' in spiritual terms, relegating the prophesied physical resurrection to the status of a future miracle, unrelated to the afterlife or the [[Messianic era]]. According to Maimonides, an afterlife continues for the soul of every human being, a soul now separated from the body in which it was \"housed\" during its earthly existence.\n\nThe [[Zohar]] describes [[Gehenna]] not as a place of punishment for the wicked but as a place of spiritual purification for souls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/judaism/FAQ/06-Jewish-Thought/section-9.html |title=soc.culture.jewish FAQ: Jewish Thought (6/12)Section - Question 12.8: What do Jews say happens when a person dies?

Trugman explains that it is through oral tradition that the meanings of the Torah, its commandments and stories, are known and understood. The classic work of Jewish mysticism,<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{YouTube|mM8dn68vgD8|Reincarnation in the Jewish Tradition}}</ref> the Zohar, is quoted liberally in all Jewish learning; in the Zohar the idea of reincarnation is mentioned repeatedly. Trugman states that in the last five centuries the concept of reincarnation, which until then had been a much hidden tradition within Judaism, was given open exposure.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\n[[Shraga Simmons]] commented that within the Bible itself, the idea [of reincarnation] is intimated in Deut. 25:5-10, Deut. 33:6 and Isaiah 22:14, 65:6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_askrabbi_o/bl_simmons_reincarnation.htm |title=Ask the Rabbi - Reincarnation |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nYirmiyahu Ullman wrote that reincarnation is an \"ancient, mainstream belief in Judaism\". The Zohar makes frequent and lengthy references to reincarnation. [[Onkelos]], a righteous convert and authoritative commentator of the same period, explained the verse, \"Let Reuben live and not die&nbsp;...\" (Deuteronomy 33:6) to mean that Reuben should merit the World to Come directly, and not have to die again as a result of being reincarnated. Torah scholar, commentator and kabbalist, [[Nachmanides]] (Ramban 1195\u20131270), attributed Job's suffering to reincarnation, as hinted in Job's saying \"God does all these things twice or three times with a man, to bring back his soul from the pit to&nbsp;... the light of the living' (Job 33:29,30).\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Yirmiyahu |first=Rabbi |url=http://ohr.edu/yhiy/article.php/1077 |title=Reincarnation \u00ab Ask! \u00ab Ohr Somayach |publisher=Ohr.edu |date=2003-07-12 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nReincarnation, called ''[[gilgul]]'', became popular in [[folk belief]], and is found in much [[Yiddish]] literature among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. Among a few kabbalists, it was posited that some human souls could end up being reincarnated into non-human bodies. These ideas were found in a number of Kabbalistic works from the 13th century, and also among many mystics in the late 16th century. [[Martin Buber]]'s early collection of stories of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]'s life includes several that refer to people reincarnating in successive lives.<ref>Martin Buber, \"Legende des Baalschem\" in ''Die Chassidischen B\u00fccher'', Hellerau 1928, especially ''Die niedergestiegene Seele''</ref>\n\nAmong well known (generally non-kabbalist or anti-kabbalist) rabbis who rejected the idea of reincarnation are [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], Yedayah Bedershi (early 14th century), [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], the [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] and [[Leon de Modena]]. Saadia Gaon, in [[Emunoth ve-Deoth]] (Hebrew: \"beliefs and opinions\") concludes Section VI with a refutation of the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]] (reincarnation). While rebutting reincarnation, Saadia Gaon further states that Jews who hold to reincarnation have adopted non-Jewish beliefs. By no means do all Jews today believe in reincarnation, but belief in reincarnation is not uncommon among many Jews, including Orthodox.\n\nOther well-known rabbis who are reincarnationists include Yonassan Gershom, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], Talmud scholar Adin Steinsaltz, DovBer Pinson, David M. Wexelman, Zalman Schachter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716181413/http://www.sytekcom.com/rooster/bta-faq1.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |title=Reincarnation and the Holocaust FAQ}}</ref> and many others. Reincarnation is cited by authoritative biblical commentators, including Ramban (Nachmanides), Menachem Recanti and Rabbenu Bachya.\n\nAmong the many volumes of Yitzchak Luria, most of which come down from the pen of his primary disciple, Chaim Vital, are insights explaining issues related to reincarnation. His ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'', \"The Gates of Reincarnation\", is a book devoted exclusively to the subject of reincarnation in Judaism.\n\nRabbi Naftali Silberberg of The [[Rohr Jewish Learning Institute]] notes that \"Many ideas that originate in other religions and belief systems have been popularized in the media and are taken for granted by unassuming Jews.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Where does the soul go?

The same word in adjectival form (''purgatorius -a -um'', cleansing), which appears also in non-religious writing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2339625 |title=Charlton T.

A notable example is [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] who wrote some 18 theological works which describe in detail the nature of the afterlife according to his claimed spiritual experiences, the most famous of which is ''[[Heaven and Hell (Swedenborg)|Heaven and Hell]]''.<ref name=\"swedenborgdigitallibrary.org\">{{cite web|url=https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/translation/heaven-and-hell-dole/contents/10|title=Swedenborg, E.

However, those who die in unrepented [[mortal sin]] go to hell. In the 1990s, the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] defined hell not as punishment imposed on the sinner but rather as the sinner's self-exclusion from God. Unlike other Christian groups, the Catholic Church teaches that those who die in a state of grace, but still carry [[venial sin]] go to a place called [[Purgatory]] where they undergo purification to enter Heaven.\n\n=====Limbo=====\n{{main|Limbo}}\nDespite popular opinion, Limbo, which was elaborated upon by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, was never recognized as a [[dogma]] of the [[Catholic Church]], yet, at times, it has been a very popular theological theory within the Church. Limbo is a theory that unbaptized but innocent souls, such as those of infants, [[Virtue#Christianity|virtuous]] individuals who lived before [[Nativity of Jesus|Jesus Christ was born on earth]], or those that die before [[baptism]] exist in neither Heaven or Hell proper. Therefore, these souls neither merit the [[beatific vision]], nor are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal [[sin]] although they have not received baptism, so still bear [[original sin]]. So they are generally seen as existing in a state of natural, but not supernatural, happiness, until the end of time.\n\nIn other [[Christian denominations]] it has been described as an [[intermediate state|intermediate place]] or state of confinement in oblivion and neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/limbo |title=limbo - definition of limbo by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\n=====Purgatory=====\n{{main|Purgatory}}\nThe notion of [[purgatory]] is associated particularly with the [[Catholic Church]]. In the Catholic Church, all those who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven or the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned. The tradition of the church, by reference to certain texts of scripture, speaks of a \"cleansing fire\" although it is not always called purgatory.\n\n[[Anglican]]s of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] tradition generally also hold to the belief. [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], believed in an [[intermediate state]] between death and the [[resurrection of the dead]] and in the possibility of \"continuing to grow in holiness there\", but Methodism does not officially affirm this belief and denies the possibility of [[Prayer for the dead|helping by prayer]] any who may be in that state.<ref>Ted Campbell, Methodist Doctrine: The Essentials (Abingdon 1999), quoted in [http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 Feature article by ''United Methodist Reporter'' Managing Editor Robin Russell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154244/http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=5101 |date=2011-07-22 }} and in [http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&b=4746355&content_id=%7B94F6F768-0EA6-4C1B-B6B6-0C88EC04E8A2%7D&notoc=1 FAQ Belief: What happens immediately after a person dies?]</ref>\n\n====Orthodox Christianity====\nThe Orthodox Church is intentionally reticent on the afterlife, as it acknowledges the mystery especially of things that have not yet occurred.  Beyond the second coming of Jesus, bodily resurrection, and final judgment, all of which is affirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] (325 CE), Orthodoxy does not teach much else in any definitive manner.  Unlike Western forms of Christianity, however, Orthodoxy is traditionally non-dualist and does not teach that there are two separate literal locations of heaven and hell, but instead acknowledges that \"the 'location' of one\u2019s final destiny\u2014heaven or hell\u2014as being figurative.\"<ref name=\"Andrew P. Klager 2011\">[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=19 Andrew P. Klager, \"Orthodox Eschatology and St. Gregory of Nyssa's ''De vita Moysis'': Transfiguration, Cosmic Unity, and Compassion,\" In ''Compassionate Eschatology: The Future as Friend'', eds. Ted Grimsrud & Michael Hardin, 230-252 (Eugene, OR: Wipf & Stock, 2011), 245.]</ref> Instead, Orthodoxy teaches that the final judgment is simply one's uniform encounter with divine love and mercy, but this encounter is experienced multifariously depending on the extent to which one has been transformed, partaken of divinity, and is therefore compatible or incompatible with God. \"The monadic, immutable, and ceaseless object of eschatological encounter is therefore the love and mercy of God, his glory which infuses the heavenly temple, and it is the subjective human reaction which engenders multiplicity or any division of experience.\"<ref name=\"Andrew P. Klager 2011\"/> For instance, [[St. Isaac the Syrian]] observes that \"those who are punished in Gehenna, are scourged by the scourge of love. ... The power of love works in two ways: it torments sinners . . . [as] bitter regret. But love inebriates the souls of the sons of Heaven by its delectability.\"<ref>St. Isaac the Syrian, \"Homily 28,\" In ''The Ascetical Homilies of Saint Isaac the Syrian,'' trans. Dana Miller (Brookline, MA: Holy Transfiguration Monastery Press, 1984), 141.</ref> In this sense, the divine action is always, immutably, and uniformly love and if one experiences this love negatively, the experience is then one of self-condemnation because of free will rather than condemnation by God.  Orthodoxy therefore uses the description of Jesus' judgment in John 3:19-21 as their model: \"19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. 20 For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.\" As a characteristically Orthodox understanding, then, Fr. [[Thomas Hopko]] writes, \"[I]t is precisely the presence of God\u2019s mercy and love which cause the torment of the wicked. God does not punish; he forgives. . . . In a word, God has mercy on all, whether all like it or not. If we like it, it is paradise; if we do not, it is hell. Every knee will bend before the Lord. Everything will be subject to Him. God in Christ will indeed be \"all and in all,\" with boundless mercy and unconditional pardon. But not all will rejoice in God's gift of forgiveness, and that choice will be judgment, the self-inflicted source of their sorrow and pain.\"<ref>Fr. Thomas Hopko, \"Foreword,\" in ''The Orthodox Church'', Sergius Bulgakov (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1988), xiii.</ref>\n\nMoreover, Orthodoxy includes a prevalent tradition of ''[[apokatastasis]]'', or the restoration of all things in the end. This has been taught most notably by [[Origen]], but also many other Church fathers and Saints, including [[Gregory of Nyssa]]. The [[Second Council of Constantinople]] (553 C.E.) affirmed the orthodoxy of Gregory of Nyssa while simultaneously condemning Origen's brand of universalism because it taught the restoration back to our pre-existent state, which Orthodoxy doesn't teach.  It is also a teaching of such eminent Orthodox theologians as [[Olivier Cl\u00e9ment]], Metropolitan [[Kallistos Ware]], and Bishop [[Hilarion Alfeyev]].<ref>[http://www.clarion-journal.com/files/new-klager-compassionate-eschatology-with-biblioklager-1.pdf#page=25 Andrew P.

As Met. Kallistos Ware explains, \"It is heretical to say that all must be saved, for this is to deny free will; but, it is legitimate to hope that all may be saved,\"<ref>Kallistos Ware, The Orthodox Church (New York: Penguin, 1997), 262.</ref> as insisting on torment without end also denies free will.\n\n====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints====\n{{main|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|Exaltation (Mormonism)|Degrees of glory}}\n[[File:000 preach-my-gospel 1207575 tmb.jpg|framed|Plan of Salvation in LDS Religion]]\n\n[[Joseph F. Smith]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] presents an elaborate vision of the afterlife. It is revealed as the scene of an extensive missionary effort by righteous spirits in paradise to redeem those still in darkness\u2014a spirit prison or \"hell\" where the spirits of the dead remain until judgment. It is divided into two parts: Spirit Prison and Paradise. Together these are also known as the Spirit World (also Abraham's Bosom; see Luke 16:19-25). They believe that Christ visited spirit prison [https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.18-20?lang=eng (1 Peter 3:18-20)] and opened the gate for those who repent to cross over to Paradise. This is similar to the [[Harrowing of Hell]] doctrine of some mainstream Christian faiths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Both Spirit Prison and Paradise are temporary according to Latter-day Saint beliefs. After the resurrection, spirits are assigned \"permanently\" to three degrees of heavenly glory, determined by how they lived\u2013 Celestial, Terrestrial, and Telestial.(1 Cor 15:44-42; Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76) Sons of Perdition, or those who have known and seen God and deny it, will be sent to the realm of Satan, which is called Outer Darkness, where they shall live in misery and agony forever.<ref>[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng Doctrine and Covenants, Section 76.]</ref>\n\nThe Celestial Kingdom is believed to be a place where we can live eternally with our families. Progression does not end once one has entered the Celestial Kingdom, but it extends eternally. According to \"True to the Faith\" (a handbook on doctrines in the LDS faith), \"The celestial kingdom is the place prepared for those who have \"received the testimony of Jesus\" and been \"made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, who wrought out this perfect atonement through the shedding of his own blood\" (D&C 76:51, 69). To inherit this gift, we must receive the ordinances of salvation, keep the commandments, and repent of our sins.\"<ref>https://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/kingdoms-of-glory.p1?lang=eng</ref>\n\n====Jehovah's Witnesses====\n[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] occasionally use terms such as \"afterlife\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=Is Gehenna a Place of Fiery Torment?|date=April 1, 2011|page=31|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011252}}</ref> to refer to any hope for the dead, but they understand [[Ecclesiastes]] 9:5 to preclude belief in an immortal soul.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reasoning From the Scriptures|pages=168\u2013175}}</ref> Individuals judged by God to be wicked, such as in the [[Great Flood]] or at [[Armageddon]], are given no hope of an afterlife.

Adventists believe that the body + the breath of God = a living soul. Like Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists use key phrases from the Bible, such as \"For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.\" (Eccl. 9:5 KJV). Adventists also point to the fact that the wage of sin is death and God alone is [[immortality|immortal]]. Adventists believe God will grant eternal life to the redeemed who are resurrected at Jesus' second coming. Until then, all those who have died are \"asleep\". When Jesus the Christ, who is the Word and the Bread of Life, comes a second time, the righteous will be raised incorruptible and will be taken in the clouds to meet their Lord. The righteous will live in heaven for a thousand years (the millennium) where they will sit with God in judgment over the unredeemed and the fallen angels. During the time the redeemed are in heaven, the Earth will be devoid of human and animal inhabitation. Only the fallen angels will be left alive. The second resurrection is of the unrighteous, when Jesus brings the New Jerusalem down from heaven to relocate to Earth. Jesus will call to life all those who are unrighteous. Satan and his angels will convince the unrighteous to surround the city, but hell fire and brimstone will fall from heaven and consume them, thus cleansing Earth of all sin. The universe will be then free from sin forever. This is called the second death. On the new earth God will provide an eternal home for all the redeemed and a perfect environment for everlasting life, where Eden will be restored. The great controversy will be ended and sin will be no more. God will reign in perfect harmony forever.

In hell, the inmates are tormented by a [[Shaitan|demon]].]]\n{{Main|Islamic view of death|Barzakh|Akhirah}}\nThe Islamic belief in the afterlife as stated in the [[Quran]] is descriptive. The [[Arabic]] word for Paradise is ''[[Jannah]]'' and Hell is ''[[Jahannam]]''. Their level of comfort while in the grave (according to some commentators) depends wholly on their level of ''[[Iman (concept)|iman]]'' or faith in the one almighty creator or supreme being ([[God]] or [[Allah]]). In order for one to achieve proper, firm and healthy ''iman'' one must practice righteous deeds or else his level of ''iman'' chokes and shrinks and eventually can wither away if one does not practice [[Islam]] long enough, hence the depth of practicing Islam is good deeds. One may also acquire ''[[tasbih]]'' and recite the names of Allah in such manner as ''Subahann Allah'' or \"[[Glory (religion)|Glory]] be to Allah\" over and over again to acquire good deeds.\n\nIn the Quran, God gives warning about grievous punishment to those who do not believe in the afterlife (''[[Akhirah]]''),<ref>{{cite quran|17|10|s=ns}}</ref> and admonishes mankind that Hell is prepared for those who deny the meeting with him.<ref>{{cite quran|18|103|e=106|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nIslam teaches that the purpose of Man's entire creation is to worship Allah alone, which includes being kind to other human beings and life including bugs, and to trees, by not oppressing them. Islam teaches that the life we live on Earth is nothing but a test for us and to determine each individual's ultimate abode, be it punishment or ''Jannat'' in the afterlife, which is eternal and everlasting.\n\n''Jannah'' and ''Jahannam'' both have different levels. ''Jannah'' has eight gates and seven levels. The higher the level the better it is and the happier you are. ''Jahannam'' possess 7 deep terrible layers. The lower the layer the worse it is. Individuals will arrive at both everlasting homes during [[Judgment Day]], which commences after the Angel [[Israfil]] blows the trumpet the second time. Islam teaches the continued existence of the soul and a transformed physical existence after death. Muslims believe there will be a day of judgment when all humans will be divided between the eternal destinations of Paradise and Hell.\n\nIn the 20th century, discussions about the afterlife address the interconnection between human action and divine judgment, the need for moral rectitude, and the eternal consequences of human action in this life and world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e61?_hi=2&_pos=1 |title=Afterlife - Oxford Islamic Studies Online |doi=10.1093/0195156498.001.0001 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-03-08}}</ref>\n\nA central doctrine of the Quran is the Last Day, on which the world will be destroyed and Allah will raise all people and jinn from the dead to be judged. The Last Day is also called the Day of Standing Up, Day of Separation, Day of Reckoning, Day of Awakening, Day of Judgment, The Encompassing Day or The Hour.\n\nUntil the Day of Judgment, deceased souls remain in their graves awaiting the resurrection. However, they begin to feel immediately a taste of their destiny to come. Those bound for hell will suffer in their graves, while those bound for heaven will be in peace until that time.\n\nThe resurrection that will take place on the Last Day is physical, and is explained by suggesting that God will re-create the decayed body (17:100: \"Could they not see that God who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them?\").\n\nOn the Last Day, resurrected humans and jinn will be judged by Allah according to their deeds. One's eternal destination depends on balance of good to bad deeds in life. They are either granted admission to Paradise, where they will enjoy spiritual and physical pleasures forever, or condemned to Hell to suffer spiritual and physical torment for eternity. The day of judgment is described as passing over Hell on a narrow bridge (as thin as human hair and sharper than a razor) in order to enter Paradise. Those who fall, weighted by their bad deeds, will remain in Hell forever.\n\n====Ahmadiyya====\n[[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]] Muslims believe that the afterlife is not material but of a spiritual nature. According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an \"embryonic soul\" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own rights over that of others becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=elementary+study+of+islam&q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=1-85372-562-5| year=1997 }}</ref>\n\n====Sufi====\nThe Sufi scholar [[Ibn 'Arabi]] defined [[Barzakh#Sufism|Barzakh]] as the intermediate realm or \"isthmus.\" It is between the world of corporeal bodies and the world of spirits, and is a means of contact between the two worlds.

He described it as simple and luminous, like the world of spirits, but also able to take on many different forms just like the world of corporeal bodies can.

Also, in the Baha'i view, souls will be able to recognize the accomplishments of the souls that have reached the same level as themselves, but not those that have achieved a rank higher than them.<ref name=\"PSmith\"/>\n\n==Indian religions==\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{main|Hindu eschatology}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\nThe [[Upanishads]] describe reincarnation (''punarjanma'') (see also: [[samsara]]). The [[Bhagavad Gita]], an important Hindu script, talks extensively about the afterlife. Here, [[Krishna]] says that just as a man discards his old clothes and wears new ones; similarly the soul discards the old body and takes on a new one. In Hinduism, the belief is that the body is nothing but a shell, the soul inside is immutable and indestructible and takes on different lives in a cycle of birth and death. The end of this cycle is called ''mukti'' (Sanskrit: \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f) and staying finally with supreme God forever; is ''[[moksha]]'' (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0937) or salvation.\n\nThe [[Garuda Purana]] deals solely with what happens to a person after death. The God of Death [[Yama]] sends his representatives to collect the soul from a person's body whenever he is due for death and they take the soul to Yama. A record of each person's timings & deeds performed by him is kept in a ledger by Yama's assistant, Chitragupta.\n\nAccording to the Garuda Purana, a soul after leaving the body travels through a very long and dark tunnel towards the South. This is why an oil lamp is lit and kept beside the head of the corpse, to light the dark tunnel and allow the soul to travel comfortably.\n\nThe soul, called ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'' leaves the body and reincarnates itself according to the deeds or ''[[karma]]'' performed by one in last birth. Rebirth would be in form of animals or other lower creatures if one performed bad karmas and in human form in a good family with joyous lifetime if the person was good in last birth. In between the two births a human is also required to either face punishments for bad karmas in \"[[Naraka (Hinduism)|naraka]]\" or hell or enjoy for the good karmas in ''[[swarga]]'' or heaven for good deeds. Whenever his or her punishments or rewards are over he or she is sent back to earth, also known as ''Mrutyulok'' or human world. A person stays with the God or ultimate power when he discharges only & only ''yajna karma'' (means work done for satisfaction of supreme lord only) in last birth and the same is called as ''moksha'' or ''[[nirvana]]'', which is the ultimate goal of a self realised soul. ''Atma'' moves with ''[[Parmatma]]'' or the greatest soul. According to Bhagavad Gita an ''Atma'' or soul never dies, what dies is the body only made of five elements\u2014Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Sky. Soul is believed to be indestructible. None of the five elements can harm or influence it. Hinduism through Garuda Purana also describes in detail various types of ''narkas'' or Hells where a person after death is punished for his bad ''karmas'' and dealt with accordingly.\n\nHindus also believe in ''karma''. ''Karma'' is the accumulated sums of one's good or bad deeds. ''Satkarma'' means good deeds, ''vikarma'' means bad deeds. According to [[Hinduism]] the basic concept of karma is 'As you sow, you shall reap'. So, if a person has lived a good life, they will be rewarded in the afterlife. Similarly their sum of bad deeds will be mirrored in their next life. Good karma brings good rewards and bad karmas lead to bad results. There is no judgment here. People accumulate karma through their actions and even thoughts. In Bhagavad Gita when [[Arjuna]] hesitates to kill his kith and kin the lord reprimands him saying thus \"Do you believe that you are the doer of the action. No. You are merely an instrument in MY hands. Do you believe that the people in front of you are living? Dear Arjuna, they are already dead. As a ''[[kshatriya]]'' (warrior) it is your duty to protect your people and land. If you fail to do your duty, then you are not adhering to dharmic principles.\"{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{main|Buddhist eschatology}}\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\nBuddhists maintain that [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] takes place without an unchanging [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] or soul passing from one form to another.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Becker |first1=Carl B. |title=Breaking the circle: death and the afterlife in Buddhism |date=1993 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location=Carbondale |isbn=0-585-03949-6 |page=viii |quote=Buddhists believe in karma and rebirth, and yet they deny the existence of permanent souls.}}</ref> The type of rebirth will be conditioned by the moral tone of the person's actions ([[Karma in Buddhism|kamma or karma]]). For example, if a person has committed harmful actions of body, speech and mind based on greed, hatred and delusion, rebirth in a lower realm, i.e. an animal, a [[Preta|hungry ghost]] or a hell realm, is to be expected. On the other hand, where a person has performed skillful actions based on generosity, loving-kindness ([[metta]]), compassion and wisdom, rebirth in a happy realm, i.e. human or one of the many heavenly realms, can be expected.\n\nYet the mechanism of rebirth with kamma is not deterministic. It depends on various levels of kamma. The most important moment that determines where a person is reborn into is the last thought moment. At that moment, heavy kamma would ripen if there were performed, if not then near death kamma, if not then habitual kamma, finally if none of the above happened, then residual kamma from previous actions can ripen. According to [[Theravada]] Buddhism, there are 31 realms of existence that one can be reborn into.\n\n[[Pure Land Buddhism]] of [[Mahayana]] believes in a special place apart from the 31 planes of existence called [[Pure Land]]. It is believed that each Buddha has their own pure land, created out of their merits for the sake of sentient beings who recall them mindfully to be able to be reborn in their pure land and train to become a Buddha there. Thus the main practice of pure land Buddhism is to chant a Buddha's name.\n\nIn [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]] explains the intermediate state of humans between death and reincarnation. The deceased will find the bright light of wisdom, which shows a straightforward path to move upward and leave the cycle of reincarnation. There are various reasons why the deceased do not follow that light. Some had no briefing about the intermediate state in the former life. Others only used to follow their basic instincts like animals. And some have fear, which results from foul deeds in the former life or from insistent haughtiness. In the intermediate state the awareness is very flexible, so it is important to be virtuous, adopt a positive attitude, and avoid negative ideas. Ideas which are rising from subconsciousness can cause extreme tempers and cowing visions. In this situation they have to understand, that these manifestations are just reflections of the inner thoughts. No one can really hurt them, because they have no more material body. The deceased get help from different [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]s who show them the path to the bright light. The ones who do not follow the path after all will get hints for a better reincarnation. They have to release the things and beings on which or whom they still hang from the life before. It is recommended to choose a family where the parents trust in the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and to reincarnate with the will to care for the welfare of all beings.\n\n\"Life is cosmic energy of the universe and after death it merges in universe again and as the time comes to find the suitable place for the entity died in the life condition it gets born. There are 10 life states of any life: Hell, hunger, anger, animality, rapture, humanity, learning, realization, bodhisatva and buddhahood. The life dies in which life condition it reborn in the same life condition.\"{{cite quote|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}\n[[Sikhism]] may have a belief in the afterlife. They believe that the soul belongs to the spiritual universe which has its origins in God. However it's been a matter of great debate amongst the Sikhs about Sikhism's belief in afterlife. Many believe that Sikhism endorses the afterlife and the concept of reward and punishment as there are verses given in ''[[Guru Granth Sahib]]'', but a large number of Sikhs believe otherwise and treat those verses as metaphorical or poetic.\n\nAlso it has been noted by many scholars that the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] includes poetic renditions from multiple saints and religious traditions like that of [[Kabir]], [[Baba Farid|Farid]] and [[Ramananda]]. The essential doctrine is to experience the divine through simple living, meditation and contemplation while being alive. Sikhism also has the belief of being in union with God while living. Accounts of afterlife are considered to be aimed at the popular prevailing views of the time so as to provide a referential framework without necessarily establishing a belief in the afterlife. Thus while it is also acknowledged that living the life of a householder is above the metaphysical truth, Sikhism can be considered agnostic to the question of an afterlife. Some scholars also interpret the mention of reincarnation to be naturalistic akin to the biogeochemical cycles.<ref>http://www.iuscanada.com/journal/archives/2011/j1312p52.pdf</ref>\n\nBut if one analyses the Sikh Scriptures carefully, one may find that on many occasions the afterlife and the existence of heaven and hell are mentioned in ''Guru Granth Sahib'' and in ''[[Dasam granth]]'', so from that it can be concluded that Sikhism does believe in the existence of heaven and hell; however, heaven and hell are created to temporarily reward and punish, and one will then take birth again until one merges in God. According to the Sikh scriptures, the human form is the closet form to God and the best opportunity for a human being to attain salvation and merge back with God. Sikh Gurus said that nothing dies, nothing is born, everything is ever present, and it just changes forms. Like standing in front of a wardrobe, you pick up a dress and wear it and then you discard it. You wear another one. Thus, in the view of Sikhism, your soul is never born and never dies. Your soul is a part of God and hence lives forever.<ref>http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&id=1248308791&ucat=7</ref>\n\n===Jainism===\n[[Jainism]] also believes in the after life. They believe that the soul takes on a body form based on previous karmas or actions performed by that soul through eternity. Jains believe the soul is eternal and that the freedom from the cycle of reincarnation is the means to attain eternal bliss.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jhaveri|first1=Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai|title=Death the Awakener|url=http://www.shrimadrajchandramission.org/pujya-gurudevshri/pearls-of-wisdom/death-the-awakener-2110.htm|website=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|publisher=Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur|accessdate=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Others==\n===Traditional African religions===\n[[Traditional African religion]]s are diverse in their beliefs in an afterlife.

In old Japanese legends, it is often claimed that the dead go to a place called ''[[yomi]]'' (\u9ec4\u6cc9), a gloomy underground realm with a river separating the living from the dead mentioned in the legend of Izanami and Izanagi. This ''yomi'' very closely resembles the Greek [[Greek underworld|Hades]]; however, later myths include notions of resurrection and even [[Elysium]]-like descriptions such as in the legend of [[Okuninushi]] and [[Susanoo]]. Shinto tends to hold negative views on death and corpses as a source of pollution called ''kegare''. However, death is also viewed as a path towards [[apotheosis]] in Shintoism as can be evidenced by how legendary individuals become enshrined after death. Perhaps the most famous would be Emperor [[Ojin]] who was enshrined as [[Hachiman]] the God of War after his death.\n\n===Unitarian Universalism===\nSome [[Unitarian Universalist]]s believe in [[universalism]]: that all souls will ultimately be saved and that there are no torments of hell.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Jon |url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |title=Unitarians: unitarian view of afterlife, unitarian universalist association uua, unitarian universalist association |publisher=En.allexperts.com |date=2004-06-13 |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106125811/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Unitarians-945/unitarian-view-afterlife.htm |archivedate=2015-11-06 |df= }}</ref> Unitarian Universalists differ widely in their theology hence there is no exact same stance on the issue.<ref>The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism - Page 147, Mark W.

Most Unitarian Universalists believe that heaven and hell are symbolic places of consciousness and the faith is largely focused on the worldly life rather than any possible afterlife.<ref>Searching for Spiritual Unity&nbsp;... Can There Be Common Ground? - Page 582, Robyn E. Lebron - 2012</ref>\n\n===Spiritualism===\nAccording to [[Edgar Cayce]], the afterlife consisted of nine realms equated with the nine planets of astrology. The first, symbolized by Saturn, was a level for the purification of the souls. The second, Mercury's realm, gives us the ability to consider problems as a whole. The third of the nine soul realms is ruled by Earth and is associated with the Earthly pleasures. The fourth realm is where we find out about love and is ruled by Venus. The fifth realm is where we meet our limitations and is ruled by Mars. The sixth realm is ruled by Neptune, and is where we begin to use our creative powers and free ourselves from the material world. The seventh realm is symbolized by Jupiter, which strengthens the soul's ability to depict situations, to analyze people and places, things, and conditions. The eighth afterlife realm is ruled by Uranus and develops psychic ability. The ninth afterlife realm is symbolized by Pluto, the astrological realm of the unconscious. This afterlife realm is a transient place where souls can choose to travel to other realms or other solar systems, it is the souls liberation into eternity, and is the realm that opens the doorway from our solar system into the cosmos.<ref name=\"Afterlife\">{{cite book|first=Sarah|last=Bartlett|date=2015|title=The Afterlife Bible: The Complete Guide to Otherworldly Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9781841814490|publisher=Octopus Publishing Group|isbn=9781841814490}}</ref>\n\nMainstream [[Spiritualist]]s postulate a series of seven realms that are not unlike Edgar Cayce's nine realms ruled by the planets. As it evolves, the soul moves higher and higher until it reaches the ultimate realm of spiritual oneness. The first realm, equated with hell, is the place where troubled souls spend a long time before they are compelled to move up to the next level. The second realm, where most souls move directly, is thought of as an intermediate transition between the lower planes of life and hell and the higher perfect realms of the universe. The third level is for those who have worked with their karmic inheritance. The fourth level is that from which evolved souls teach and direct those on Earth. The fifth level is where the soul leaves human consciousness behind. At the sixth plane, the soul is finally aligned with the cosmic consciousness and has no sense of separateness or individuality. Finally, the seventh level, the goal of each soul, is where the soul transcends its own sense of \"soulfulness\" and reunites with the World Soul and the universe.<ref name=\"Afterlife\"/>\n\n===Wicca===\nThe Wiccan afterlife is most commonly described as [[The Summerland]]. Here, souls rest, recuperate from life, and reflect on the experiences they had during their lives. After a period of rest, the souls are reincarnated, and the memory of their previous lives is erased. Many Wiccans see The Summerland as a place to reflect on their life actions. It is not a place of reward, but rather the end of a life journey at an end point of incarnations.<ref>Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on Your Own - Page 162, Arin Murphy-Hiscock - 2005</ref>\n\n===Zoroastrianism===\n{{main|Frashokereti}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\nZoroastrianism states that the ''urvan'', the disembodied spirit, lingers on earth for three days before departing downward to the kingdom of the dead that is ruled by Yima. For the three days that it rests on Earth, righteous souls sit at the head of their body, chanting the [[Gathas|Ustavaiti Gathas]] with joy, while a wicked person sits at the feet of the corpse, wails and recites the [[Yasna]]. Zoroastrianism states that for the righteous souls, a beautiful maiden, which is the personification of the soul's good thoughts, words and deeds, appears. For a wicked person, a very old, ugly, naked hag appears. After three nights, the soul of the wicked is taken by the demon [[Vizaresa]] (V\u012bzar\u0259\u0161a), to Chinvat bridge, and is made to go to darkness ([[hell]]).\n\n[[Jamshid|Yima]] is believed to have been the first [[king]] on earth to rule, as well as the first man to die. Inside of Yima's realm, the [[spirits]] live a shadowy existence, and are dependent on their own descendants which are still living on Earth. Their descendants are to satisfy their hunger and clothe them, through rituals done on earth.\n\nRituals which are done on the first three days are vital and important, as they protect the soul from evil powers and give it strength to reach the underworld. After three days, the soul crosses [[Chinvat bridge]] which is the [[Final Judgment]] of the soul. Rashnu and [[Sraosha]] are present at the final judgment. The list is expanded sometimes, and include [[Bahman|Vahman]] and [[Ahura Mazda|Ormazd]]. [[Rashnu]] is the [[yazata]] who holds the scales of justice. If the good deeds of the person outweigh the bad, the soul is worthy of paradise. If the bad deeds outweigh the good, the bridge narrows down to the width of a blade-edge, and a horrid hag pulls the soul in her arms, and takes it down to hell with her.\n\n[[Misvan Gatu]] is the \"place of the mixed ones\" where the souls lead a gray existence, lacking both joy and sorrow. A soul goes here if his/her good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and Rashnu's scale is equal.\n\n==Parapsychology==\n{{Main|Parapsychology}}\n{{See also|Near-death studies|Near death experience}}\n\nThe [[Society for Psychical Research]] was founded in 1882 with the express intention of investigating phenomena relating to Spiritualism and the afterlife. Its members continue to conduct scientific research on the paranormal to this day. Some of the earliest attempts to apply [[scientific method]]s to the study of phenomena relating to an afterlife were conducted by this organization. Its earliest members included noted scientists like [[William Crookes]], and philosophers such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[William James]].\n\nParapsychological investigation of the afterlife includes the study of [[haunting]], [[apparitional experience|apparitions]] of the deceased, instrumental trans-communication, [[electronic voice phenomenon|electronic voice phenomena]], and [[mediumship]].<ref>David Fontana (2005): Is there an afterlife.

The information obtained by astrometric measurements provides information on the [[kinematics]] and physical origin of the [[Solar System]] and our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thousandau1 space probe.jpg|thumb|Concept art for the [[TAU (spacecraft)|TAU spacecraft]], a 1980s era study which would have used an interstellar precursor probe to expand the baseline for calculating stellar parallax in support of Astrometry]]\nThe history of astrometry is linked to the history of [[star catalogue]]s, which gave astronomers reference points for objects in the sky so they could track their movements. This can be dated back to [[Hipparchus]], who around 190 BC used the catalogue of his predecessors [[Timocharis]] and [[Aristillus]] to discover Earth's [[precession]]. In doing so, he also developed the brightness scale still in use today.<ref>Walter, Hans G. (2000).</ref> Hipparchus compiled a catalogue with at least 850 stars and their positions.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star maps: history, artistry, and cartography |first=Nick |last=Kanas |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=109 |isbn=0-387-71668-8}}</ref> Hipparchus's successor, [[Ptolemy]], included a catalogue of 1,022 stars in his work the ''[[Almagest]]'', giving their location, coordinates, and brightness.<ref>p. 110, Kanas 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]] carried out observations on the stars and described their positions, [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]s and [[star color]], and gave drawings for each constellation, in his ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''. [[Ibn Yunus]] observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large [[astrolabe]] with a diameter of nearly 1.4 metres. His observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later in [[Simon Newcomb]]'s investigations on the motion of the Moon, while his other observations inspired [[Laplace]]'s ''Obliquity of the Ecliptic'' and ''Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn''.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1895AJ.....15..113L Great Inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn]</ref> In the 15th century, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] astronomer [[Ulugh Beg]] compiled the ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'', in which he catalogued 1,019 stars. Like the earlier catalogs of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, Ulugh Beg's catalogue is estimated to have been precise to within approximately 20 [[minutes of arc]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Astrometry |title=History of astronomy: an encyclopedia |first=John |last=Lankford |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |date=1997 |page=49 |isbn=0-8153-0322-X}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Tycho Brahe]] used improved instruments, including large [[mural instrument]]s, to measure star positions more accurately than previously, with a precision of 15\u201335 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Astrometry |first1=Jean |last1=Kovalevsky |first2=P.

The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his [[telescope]], but he instead discovered the [[aberration of light]] and the [[astronomical nutation|nutation]] of the Earth's axis. His cataloguing of 3222 stars was refined in 1807 by [[Friedrich Bessel]], the father of modern astrometry. He made the first measurement of stellar parallax: 0.3 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|arcsec]] for the [[binary star]] [[61 Cygni]].\n\nBeing very difficult to measure, only about 60 stellar parallaxes had been obtained by the end of the 19th century, mostly by use of the [[filar micrometer]]. [[Astrograph]]s using astronomical [[photographic plate]]s sped the process in the early 20th century.  Automated plate-measuring machines<ref>[http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1107461 CERN paper on plate measuring machine] USNO StarScan</ref> and more sophisticated computer technology of the 1960s allowed more efficient compilation of [[star catalogue]]s. In the 1980s, [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCDs) replaced photographic plates and reduced optical uncertainties to one milliarcsecond. This technology made astrometry less expensive, opening the field to an amateur audience.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 1989, the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Hipparcos]] satellite took astrometry into orbit, where it could be less affected by mechanical forces of the Earth and optical distortions from its atmosphere. Operated from 1989 to 1993, Hipparcos measured large and small angles on the sky with much greater precision than any previous optical telescopes. During its 4-year run, the positions, parallaxes, and [[proper motions]] of 118,218 stars were determined with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. A new \"[[Hipparcos Catalogue|Tycho catalog]]\" drew together a database of 1,058,332 to within 20-30 [[Minute of arc#Symbols and abbreviations|mas]] (milliarcseconds). Additional catalogues were compiled for the 23,882 double/multiple stars and 11,597 [[variable star]]s also analyzed during the Hipparcos mission.<ref>{{cite web\n | author=Staff | date=1 June 2007\n | url=http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS\n | title=The Hipparcos Space Astrometry Mission\n | publisher=[[European Space Agency]]\n | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nToday, the catalogue most often used is [[Star catalogue#USNO-B1.0|USNO-B1.0]], an all-sky catalogue that tracks proper motions, positions, magnitudes and other characteristics for over one billion stellar objects. During the past 50 years, 7,435 [[Schmidt camera]] plates were used to complete several sky surveys that make the data in USNO-B1.0 accurate to within 0.2 arcsec.<ref>Kovalevsky, Jean (1995).</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[Image:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|Diagram showing how a smaller object (such as an [[extrasolar planet]]) orbiting a larger object (such as a [[star]]) could produce changes in position and velocity of the latter as they orbit their common [[center of mass]] (red cross).]]\n[[Image:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|right|200px|Motion of [[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]] of solar system relative to the Sun.]]\nApart from the fundamental function of providing [[astronomer]]s with a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] to report their observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like [[celestial mechanics]], [[stellar dynamics]] and [[galactic astronomy]]. In [[observational astronomy]], astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is basically the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time]] synchronized to [[Earth]]'s rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry is an important step in the [[cosmic distance ladder]] because it establishes [[parallax]] distance estimates for stars in the [[Milky Way]].\n\nAstrometry has also been used to support claims of [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Astrometry|extrasolar planet detection]] by measuring the displacement the proposed planets cause in their parent star's apparent position on the sky, due to their mutual orbit around the center of mass of the system. Astrometry is more accurate in space missions that are not affected by the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere.<ref>Nature  462, 705 (2009) 8 December 2009 {{doi|10.1038/462705a}}</ref> NASA's planned [[Space Interferometry Mission]] ([[SIM PlanetQuest]]) (now cancelled) was to utilize astrometric techniques to detect [[terrestrial planet]]s orbiting 200 or so of the nearest [[Solar analog|solar-type stars]]. The European Space Agency's [[Gaia Mission]], launched in 2013, applies astrometric techniques in its stellar census. In addition to the detection of exoplanets,<ref>[http://www.esa.int/esaSC/120377_index_0_m.html ESA - Space Science - Gaia overview]</ref> it can also be used to determine their mass.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Gaia/Infant_exoplanet_weighed_by_Hipparcos_and_Gaia |title=Infant exoplanet weighed by Hipparcos and Gaia|date=20 August 2018|accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAstrometric measurements are used by [[astrophysicist]]s to constrain certain models in [[celestial mechanics]]. By measuring the velocities of [[pulsar]]s, it is possible to put a limit on the [[asymmetry]] of [[supernova]] explosions. Also, astrometric results are used to determine the distribution of [[dark matter]] in the galaxy.\n\nAstronomers use astrometric techniques for the tracking of [[near-Earth objects]]. Astrometry is responsible for the detection of many record-breaking Solar System objects. To find such objects astrometrically, astronomers use telescopes to survey the sky and large-area cameras to take pictures at various determined intervals. By studying these images, they can detect Solar System objects by their movements relative to the background stars, which remain fixed. Once a movement per unit time is observed, astronomers compensate for the parallax caused by Earth's motion during this time and the heliocentric distance to this object is calculated. Using this distance and other photographs, more information about the object, including its [[orbital elements]], can be obtained.<ref>{{cite web\n | first=Chadwick | last=Trujillo | author2=Rabinowitz, David\n | date=1 June 2007\n | url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/%7Embrown/papers/ps/sedna.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Discovery of a candidate inner Oort cloud planetoid\n | publisher=European Space Agency\n | accessdate=2007-12-06 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071026202421/http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/sedna.pdf| archivedate= 26 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n[[50000 Quaoar]] and [[90377 Sedna]] are two Solar System objects discovered in this way by [[Michael E.

Walter Burkert, a major authority on ancient Greek religion, states, \"Since -ene is a typical place-name suffix - Mykene, Pallene, Troizen(e), Messene, and Cyrene - the goddess most probably takes her name from the city; she is the Pallas of Athens, just as Hera of Argos is Here Argeie.\" Thank you.-->{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=139}} She is usually shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include [[Owl of Minerva|owls]], olive trees, [[snake]]s, and the [[Gorgoneion]].\n\nFrom her origin as an Aegean [[tutelary deity|palace goddess]], Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as ''Polias'' and ''Poliouchos'' (both derived from ''[[polis]]'', meaning \"city-state\"), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified [[Acropolis]] in the central part of the city. The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Athenian Acropolis]] is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena was known as ''Ergane''. She was also a [[Women in ancient warfare|warrior goddess]], and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as ''[[Athena Promachos]]''. Her main festival in Athens was the [[Panathenaic Games|Panathenaia]], which was celebrated during the month of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]] in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father [[Zeus]]. In the [[founding myth]] of Athens, Athena bested [[Poseidon]] in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first [[olive tree]]. She was known as ''[[Athena Parthenos]]'' (\"Athena the Virgin\"), but, in one archaic [[Attica|Attic]] myth, the god [[Hephaestus]] tried and failed to rape her, resulting in [[Gaia]] giving birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]], an important Athenian founding hero. Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she was believed to have also aided the heroes [[Perseus]], [[Heracles]], [[Bellerophon]], and [[Jason]]. Along with [[Aphrodite]] and [[Hera]], Athena was one of the three goddesses [[Judgement of Paris|whose feud]] resulted in the beginning of the [[Trojan War]]. She plays an active role in the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which she assists the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] and, in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is the divine counselor to [[Odysseus]].\n\nIn the later writings of the Roman poet [[Ovid]], Athena was said to have competed against the mortal [[Arachne]] in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed [[Medusa]] into a [[Gorgon]] after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the [[Renaissance]], Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and [[Classics|classical learning]]. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of [[freedom]] and [[democracy]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Acropolis at Athens'' (1846) by [[Leo von Klenze]].

This often means that the only individuals who are capable of opposing a character are from his or her family, a fact that leads to much suspicion and intrigue.\n\n==History==\nThe original 256-page game book<ref name=\"amberdrpg\">Erick Wujcik ''Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game'' ([[Phage Press]], 1991) {{ISBN|1-880494-00-0}}</ref> was published in 1991 by [[Phage Press]], covering material from the first five novels (the \"[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Corwin cycle|Corwin Cycle]]\") and some details \u2013 sorcery and the [[Logrus]] \u2013 from the remaining five novels (the \"[[The Chronicles of Amber#The Merlin Cycle|Merlin Cycle]]\"), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos. Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice \u2013 for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which [[Merlin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Merlin]] says is impossible; and players' [[psychic]] abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.\n\n[[Image:Shadow Knight.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cover of ''Shadow Knight'']]\nA 256-page companion volume, ''Shadow Knight'',<ref name=\"shadowknight\">Erick Wujcik ''Shadow Knight'' (Phage Press, 1993) {{ISBN|1-880494-01-9}}</ref> was published in 1993. This supplemental [[wikt:rulebook|rule book]] includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin's Ghostwheel. The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series' [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] but as an example of a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|roleplaying campaign]] with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books. The book includes some material from the short story [[Amber Short Stories|\"The Salesman's Tale,\"]] and some unpublished material cut from ''[[Prince of Chaos]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} notably Coral's pregnancy by Merlin.\n\nBoth books were translated into French and published by [[Jeux Descartes]] in 1994 and 1995.\n\nA third book, ''Rebma'', was promised. Cover art was commissioned<ref>Stephen Hickman's [http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=14836 ''Rebma'' cover art]</ref> and pre-orders were taken, but it never arrived.

However, no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006. The two existing books are now [[out-of-print]], but they have been made available as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] downloads.<ref name=\"pdf\">[http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/2222/Diceless-by-Design ''Amber DRPG'' books] at DriveThruRPG</ref>\n\nIn June 2007 a new publishing company, headed by Edwin Voskamp and Eric Todd, was formed with the express purpose of bringing ''Amber DRPG'' back into print. The new company is named ''Diceless by Design''.<ref name=\"dicelessbydesign\">[http://www.dicelessbydesign.com Diceless By Design]</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, ''Rite Publishing'' secured a license from Diceless by Design to use the rules system with a new setting in the creation of a new product to be written by industry and system veteran Jason Durall.  The project '''Lords of Gossamer & Shadow (Diceless)''' was funded via [[Kickstarter]] in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lords of Gossamer & Shadow|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/937759598/lords-of-gossamer-and-shadow-diceless-role-playing|work=Kickstarter|accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> In Sept 2013 the project was completed, and on in Nov 2013 Lords of Gossamer and Shadow (Diceless) <ref>{{cite web|title=Lords of Gossamer & Shadow|url=http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/119779|work=DrivethruRpg|accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> was released publicly in full-color Print and PDF, along with additional supplements and continued support.\n\n==Setting==\n{{main|The Chronicles of Amber}}\nThe game is set in the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] described in Zelazny's ''Chronicles of Amber''. The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, ''[[The Courts of Chaos]]'', but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny's cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The ''Amber'' multiverse consists of '''Amber''', a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found [[The Pattern (The Chronicles of Amber)|the Pattern]], the symbol of [[:wikt:order|Order]]; The '''Courts of Chaos''', an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found [[the Logrus]], the manifestation of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and '''Shadow''', the collection of all possible [[universe]]s (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.\n\nIt is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books \u2013 the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites \u2013 or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon's death ''before'' the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an \"[[Amethyst]]\" game. A third option is to have the players portray [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]]'s children, in an Amber-like city built around Corwin's pattern; this is sometimes called an \"[[Argent]]\" game, since one of Corwin's [[Heraldry|heraldic]] colours is [[Silver]].\n\n==System==\n\n===Attributes===\nCharacters in ''Amber DRPG'' are represented by four [[attribute (role-playing games)|attributes]]: ''Psyche'', ''Strength'', ''Endurance'' and ''Warfare''.\n*'''Psyche''' is used for feats of willpower or magic\n*'''Strength''' is used for feats of strength or [[Hand to hand combat|unarmed combat]]\n*'''Endurance''' is used for feats of endurance\n*'''Warfare''' is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies\nThe attributes run from \u221225 (normal human level), through \u221210 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are \"ranked\", with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered \"superior\" in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.  All else being equal, a character with a higher rank in an attribute will always win a contest based on that attribute.\n\n====The Attribute Auction====\nA character's ability scores are purchased during [[character creation]] in an [[auction]]; players get 100 [[character point]]s, and bid on each attribute in turn. The character who bids the most for an attribute is \"ranked\" first and is considered superior to all other characters in that attribute. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is \"superior\" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. Instead, lower bidding characters are ranked in ascending order according to how much they have bid, the characters becoming progressively weaker in that attribute as they pay less for it. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.\n\nThe Auction simulates a 'history' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for [[player character]]s who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings. The auction serves to introduce some unpredictability into character creation without the need to resort to dice, cards, or other randomizing devices. A player may intend, for example, to create a character who is a strong, mighty warrior, but being \"outplayed\" in the auction may result in lower attribute scores than anticipated, therefore necessitating a change of character concept. Since a player cannot control another player's bids, and since all bids are non-refundable, the auction involves a considerable amount of strategizing and prioritization by players. A willingness to spend as many points as possible on an attribute may improve your chances of a high ranking, but too reckless a spending strategy could leave a player with few points to spend on powers and objects. In a hotly contested auction, such as for the important attribute of warfare, the most valuable skill is the ability to force one's opponents to back down. With two or more equally determined players, this can result in a \"bidding war\" where the attribute is driven up by increments to large sums. An alternative strategy is to try to cow other players into submission with a high opening bid. Most players bid low amounts between one and ten points in an initial bid in order to feel out the competition and to save points for other uses. A high enough opening bid could signal a player's determination to be first ranked in that attribute, thereby dissuading others from competing.\n\n====Psyche in ''Amber DRPG'' compared to the ''Chronicles''====\nCharacters with high psyche are presented as having strong [[telepathic]] abilities, being able to [[hypnotise]] and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the ''Chronicles'': first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trump and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when [[Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)|Corwin]] faces the demon Strygalldwir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.<ref name=\"greatbookofamber\">Roger Zelazny ''The Great Book of Amber'' ([[Eos Press]], 1999) {{ISBN|0-380-80906-0}}</ref> However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; the combination of Brand's \"living trump\" powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. ''Shadow Knight'' does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the \"living trump\" abilities as somewhat limited.\n\n===Powers===\nCharacters in ''Amber DRPG'' have access to the powers seen in the ''Chronicles of Amber'': ''Pattern'', ''Logrus'', ''Shape-shifting'', ''Trump'', and ''magic''.\n\n*'''Pattern:''' A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability.\n*'''Logrus:''' A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themselves or objects through shadow.\n*'''Shape-shifting:''' Shape-shifters can alter their physical form and abilities.\n*'''Trump:''' Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of [[tarot]] card which allows mental communication and travel. The book features Trump portraits of each of the elder Amberites. The trump picture of Corwin is executed in a subtly different style \u2013 and has features very similar to Roger Zelazny's.\n*'''Magic:''' Three types of magic are detailed: '''Power Words''', with a quick, small effect; '''Sorcery''', with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and '''Conjuration''', the creation of small objects.\n\nEach of the first four powers is available in an advanced form.\n\n===Artifacts, Personal shadows and Constructs===\nWhile a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues \u2013 unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character's legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) \"real\" and therefore useful. The expansion, ''Shadow Knight'', adds Constructs \u2013 artifacts with connections to shadows.\n\n===Stuff===\nUnspent character points become '''good stuff''' \u2013 a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming '''bad stuff''' \u2013 bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. Stuff governs how non-player characters perceive and respond to the character: characters with good stuff will often receive friendly or helpful reactions, while characters with bad stuff are often treated with suspicion or hostility.\n\nAs well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's [[alignment (role-playing games)|outlook on the universe]]: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.\n\n===Conflict resolution===\nIn any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key words here are ''fair'' and ''eventually'' \u2013 if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. Close ranks result in longer contests while greater difference between ranks result in fast resolution. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.\n\n===The 'Golden Rule'===\n''Amber DRPG'' advises gamemasters to change rules as they see fit \u2013 even to the point of adding or removing powers or attributes.\n\n==Community==\nDespite the game's [[out-of-print]] status, a thriving [[fan convention|convention]] scene exists supporting the game.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Amber conventions, known as ''Ambercons'', are held yearly in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] (United States), [[Milton Keynes]] (England), [[Belfast]] (Northern Ireland) and [[Modena, Italy]]. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated ''Amber DRPG'' magazine called ''Amberzine''.

Alloys are defined by a [[metallic bonding]] character.<ref>Callister, W. D. \"Materials Science and Engineering: An Introduction\" 2007, 7th edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. New York, Section 4.3 and Chapter 9.</ref> An alloy may be a [[solid solution]] of metal elements (a single phase) or a [[mixture]] of metallic phases (two or more solutions). [[Intermetallic]] compounds are alloys with a defined [[stoichiometry]] and crystal structure. [[Zintl phase]]s are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types (see also: [[Van Arkel\u2013Ketelaar triangle]] for information on classifying bonding in binary compounds).\n\nAlloys are used in a wide variety of applications. In some cases, a combination of metals may reduce the overall cost of the material while preserving important properties. In other cases, the combination of metals imparts synergistic properties to the constituent metal elements such as corrosion resistance or mechanical strength. Examples of alloys are [[steel]], [[solder]], [[brass]], [[pewter]], [[duralumin]], [[bronze]] and [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s.\n\nThe alloy constituents are usually measured by mass percentage for practical applications, and in [[Atomic ratio|atomic fraction]] for basic science studies. Alloys are usually classified as substitutional or [[interstitial alloy]]s, depending on the atomic arrangement that forms the alloy. They can be further classified as homogeneous (consisting of a single phase), or heterogeneous (consisting of two or more phases) or [[intermetallic]].\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Born bronze - Bronze casts.jpg|thumb|Liquid [[bronze]], being poured into molds during casting.]]\n[[File:A brass light.JPG|thumb|A [[brass]] lamp.]]\n\nAn alloy is a mixture of [[chemical element]]s, which forms an impure substance (admixture) that retains the characteristics of a [[metal]]. An alloy is distinct from an impure metal in that, with an alloy, the added elements are well controlled to produce desirable properties, while impure metals such as [[wrought iron]] are less controlled, but are often considered useful. Alloys are made by mixing two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal. This is usually called the primary metal or the base metal, and the name of this metal may also be the name of the alloy. The other constituents may or may not be metals but, when mixed with the molten base, they will be [[solubility|soluble]] and dissolve into the mixture.\nThe mechanical properties of alloys will often be quite different from those of its individual constituents. A metal that is normally very soft ([[malleability|malleable]]), such as [[aluminium]], can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, such as [[copper]]. Although both metals are very soft and [[ductility|ductile]], the resulting [[aluminium alloy]] will have much greater [[strength of materials|strength]]. Adding a small amount of non-metallic [[carbon]] to [[iron]] trades its great ductility for the greater strength of an alloy called [[steel]]. Due to its very-high strength, but still substantial [[toughness]], and its ability to be greatly altered by [[heat treatment]], steel is one of the most useful and common alloys in modern use. By adding [[chromium]] to steel, its resistance to [[corrosion]] can be enhanced, creating [[stainless steel]], while adding [[silicon]] will alter its electrical characteristics, producing [[silicon steel]].\n\nLike oil and water, a molten metal may not always mix with another element. For example, pure iron is almost completely [[insoluble]] with copper. Even when the constituents are soluble, each will usually have a [[Saturation (chemistry)#Solutions|saturation point]], beyond which no more of the constituent can be added. Iron, for example, can hold a maximum of 6.67% carbon. Although the elements of an alloy usually must be soluble in the [[liquid]] state, they may not always be soluble in the [[solid]] state. If the metals remain soluble when solid, the alloy forms a [[solid solution]], becoming a homogeneous structure consisting of identical crystals, called a [[phase (matter)|phase]]. If as the mixture cools the constituents become insoluble, they may separate to form two or more different types of crystals, creating a heterogeneous [[microstructure]] of different phases, some with more of one constituent than the other phase has. However, in other alloys, the insoluble elements may not separate until after crystallization occurs. If cooled very quickly, they first crystallize as a homogeneous phase, but they are [[supersaturation|supersaturated]] with the secondary constituents. As time passes, the atoms of these supersaturated alloys can separate from the crystal lattice, becoming more stable, and form a second phase that serve to reinforce the crystals internally.\n\nSome alloys, such as [[electrum]] which is an alloy consisting of [[silver]] and [[gold]], occur naturally. Meteorites are sometimes made of naturally occurring alloys of iron and [[nickel]], but are not native to the Earth. One of the first alloys made by humans was [[bronze]], which is a mixture of the metals [[tin]] and [[copper]]. Bronze was an extremely useful alloy to the ancients, because it is much stronger and harder than either of its components. Steel was another common alloy. However, in ancient times, it could only be created as an accidental byproduct from the heating of iron ore in fires ([[smelting]]) during the manufacture of iron. Other ancient alloys include [[pewter]], [[brass]] and [[pig iron]]. In the modern age, steel can be created in many forms. [[Carbon steel]] can be made by varying only the carbon content, producing soft alloys like [[mild steel]] or hard alloys like [[spring steel]]. [[Alloy steel]]s can be made by adding other elements, such as [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[vanadium]] or [[nickel]], resulting in alloys such as [[high-speed steel]] or [[tool steel]]. Small amounts of [[manganese]] are usually alloyed with most modern steels because of its ability to remove unwanted impurities, like [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]], which can have detrimental effects on the alloy. However, most alloys were not created until the 1900s, such as various aluminium, [[titanium alloy|titanium]], [[nickel alloys|nickel]], and [[magnesium alloy]]s. Some modern [[superalloy]]s, such as [[incoloy]], [[inconel]], and [[hastelloy]], may consist of a multitude of different elements.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Inconel gate valve--The-Alloy-Valve-Stockist.JPG|thumb|A gate valve, made from [[Inconel]].]]\n\nAs a noun, the term alloy is used to describe a mixture of atoms in which the primary constituent is a metal. When used as a verb, the term refers to the act of mixing a metal with other elements. The primary metal is called the ''base'', the ''matrix'', or the ''[[solvent]]''. The secondary constituents are often called ''solutes''. If there is a mixture of only two types of atoms (not counting impurities) such as a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, then it is called a ''binary alloy.'' If there are three types of atoms forming the mixture, such as iron, nickel and chromium, then it is called a ''ternary alloy.'' An alloy with four constituents is a ''quaternary alloy,'' while a five-part alloy is termed a ''quinary alloy.'' Because the percentage of each constituent can be varied, with any mixture the entire range of possible variations is called a ''system''. In this respect, all of the various forms of an alloy containing only two constituents, like iron and carbon, is called a ''binary system,'' while all of the alloy combinations possible with a ternary alloy, such as alloys of iron, carbon and chromium, is called a ''ternary system''.<ref>Bauccio, Michael (1003) ''ASM metals reference book''. ASM International. {{ISBN|0-87170-478-1}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough an alloy is technically an impure metal, when referring to alloys, the term \"impurities\" usually denotes those elements which are not desired. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form [[iron sulfide]], which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Verhoeven, John D.|title=Steel Metallurgy for the Non-metallurgist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=ASM International|isbn=978-1-61503-056-9|page=56|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505065853/https://books.google.com/books?id=brpx-LtdCLYC&pg=PA56|archivedate=2016-05-05|df=}}</ref> [[Lithium]], [[sodium]] and [[calcium]] are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the [[structural integrity]] of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called \"impure metals\" and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form [[metal oxide]]s; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the alloying process to remove excess impurities, using [[flux (metallurgy)|fluxes]], chemical additives, or other methods of [[extractive metallurgy]].<ref>Davis, Joseph R. (1993) ''ASM Specialty Handbook: Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys''. ASM International. p. 211. {{ISBN|978-0-87170-496-2}}.</ref>\n\nIn practice, some alloys are used so predominantly with respect to their base metals that the name of the primary constituent is also used as the name of the alloy. For example, 14 [[Karat (purity)|karat]] [[gold]] is an alloy of gold with other elements. Similarly, the [[silver]] used in [[jewelry]] and the [[aluminium]] used as a structural building material are also alloys.\n\nThe term \"alloy\" is sometimes used in everyday speech as a synonym for a particular alloy. For example, automobile wheels made of an [[aluminium alloy]] are commonly referred to as simply \"[[alloy wheel]]s\", although in point of fact steels and most other metals in practical use are also alloys. Steel is such a common alloy that many items made from it, like [[wheel]]s, [[barrel]]s, or [[girder]]s, are simply referred to by the name of the item, assuming it is made of steel. When made from other materials, they are typically specified as such, (i.e.: \"bronze wheel\", \"plastic barrel\", or \"wood girder\").\n\n==Theory==\nAlloying a metal is done by combining it with one or more other elements. The most common and oldest alloying process is performed by heating the base metal beyond its [[melting point]] and then dissolving the solutes into the molten liquid, which may be possible even if the melting point of the solute is far greater than that of the base. However, some metals and solutes, such as iron and carbon, have very high melting-points and were impossible for ancient people to melt. Thus, alloying may also be performed with one or more constituents in a gaseous state, such as found in a [[blast furnace]] to make pig iron, [[nitriding]], [[carbonitriding]] or other forms of [[case hardening]], or the [[cementation process]] used to make [[blister steel]]. It may also be done with one, more, or all of the constituents in the solid state, such as found in ancient methods of [[pattern welding]], [[shear steel]], or [[crucible steel]] production, mixing the elements via solid-state [[diffusion]]. \n\nBy adding another element to a metal, differences in the size of the atoms create internal stresses in the lattice of the metallic crystals; stresses that often enhance its properties. For example, the combination of carbon with iron produces [[steel]], which is stronger than [[iron]], its primary element. The [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of alloys is usually lower than that of the pure metals. The physical properties, such as [[density]], [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], [[Young's modulus]] of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its base element, but engineering properties such as [[tensile strength]],<ref>Mills, Adelbert Phillo (1922) ''Materials of Construction: Their Manufacture and Properties'', John Wiley & sons, inc, originally published by the University of Wisconsin, Madison</ref> ductility, and [[shear strength]] may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes a result of the sizes of the [[atom]]s in the alloy, because larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Sometimes alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element are present. For example, impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=C.|title=Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|journal=Physical Review|volume=188|issue=2|pages=870|year=1969|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|bibcode=1969PhRv..188..870H}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=X.|last2=Suhl|first2=H.|title=Spin-wave-related period doublings and chaos under transverse pumping|journal=Physical Review A|volume=32|pages=2530\u20132533|year=1985|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.32.2530|pmid=9896377|issue=4|bibcode=1985PhRvA..32.2530Z}}</ref>\nSome alloys are made by melting and mixing two or more metals. [[Bronze]], an alloy of [[copper]] and [[tin]], was the first alloy discovered, during the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] period now known as the [[Bronze Age]]. It was harder than pure copper and originally used to make tools and weapons, but was later superseded by metals and alloys with better properties. In later times bronze has been used for [[ornament (architecture)|ornaments]], [[bell]]s, [[statue]]s, and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]]. [[Brass]] is an alloy made from [[copper]] and [[zinc]].\n\nUnlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single [[melting point]], but a melting range during which the material is a mixture of [[solid]] and [[liquid]] phases (a slush). The temperature at which melting begins is called the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]], and the temperature when melting is just complete is called the [[liquidus]]. For many alloys there is a particular alloy proportion (in some cases more than one), called either a [[eutectic]] mixture or a peritectic composition, which gives the alloy a unique and low melting point, and no liquid/solid slush transition.\n\n==Heat-treatable alloys==\n[[File:IronAlfa&IronGamma.svg|thumb|left|[[Allotropes of iron]], ([[alpha iron]] and [[gamma iron]]) showing the differences in atomic arrangement.]]\n[[File:Photomicrograph of annealed and quenched steel, from 1911 Britannica plates 11 and 14.jpg|thumb|Photomicrographs of [[steel]].

Bottom photo: [[Quenched]] (quickly cooled) steel forms a single phase called [[martensite]], in which the carbon remains trapped within the crystals, creating internal stresses.]]\n\nAlloying elements are added to a base metal, to induce [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[ductility]], or other desired properties. Most metals and alloys can be [[work hardening|work hardened]] by creating defects in their crystal structure. These defects are created during [[plastic deformation]] by hammering, bending, extruding, etcetera, and are permanent unless the metal is [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallized]]. Otherwise, some alloys can also have their properties altered by [[heat treatment]]. Nearly all metals can be softened by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], which recrystallizes the alloy and repairs the defects, but not as many can be hardened by controlled heating and cooling. Many alloys of [[aluminium]], [[copper]], [[magnesium]], [[titanium]], and [[nickel]] can be strengthened to some degree by some method of heat treatment, but few respond to this to the same degree as does [[steel]].<ref name=\"Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14\"/>\n\nThe base metal iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, undergoes a change in the arrangement ([[allotropy]]) of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between {{convert|1500|F|C}} and {{convert|1600|F|C}}, depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this [[diffusion]] happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in ''[[solid solution|solution]]'' in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called [[austenite]]. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as [[solubility|soluble]] with the iron, and will be forced to [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, [[nucleating]] into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called [[cementite]] (or [[carbide]]), and pure iron [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]]. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a [[diffusionless transformation|diffusionless (martensite) transformation]] occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).\n\nWhile the high strength of steel results when diffusion and precipitation is prevented (forming martinsite), most heat-treatable alloys are [[precipitation hardening]] alloys, that depend on the diffusion of alloying elements to achieve their strength. When heated to form a solution and then cooled quickly, these alloys become much softer than normal, during the diffusionless transformation, but then harden as they age. The solutes in these alloys will precipitate over time, forming [[intermetallic]] phases, which are difficult to discern from the base metal. Unlike steel, in which the solid solution separates into different crystal phases (carbide and ferrite), precipitation hardening alloys form different phases within the same crystal. These intermetallic alloys appear homogeneous in crystal structure, but tend to behave heterogeneously, becoming hard and somewhat brittle.<ref name=\"Jon L. Dossett Page 1-14\"/>\n\n==Substitutional and interstitial alloys==\n[[File:Alloy atomic arrangements showing the different types.jpg|thumb|Different atomic mechanisms of alloy formation, showing pure metal, substitutional, interstitial, and a combination of the two.]]\nWhen a molten metal is mixed with another substance, there are two mechanisms that can cause an alloy to form, called ''atom exchange'' and the ''interstitial mechanism''. The relative size of each element in the mix plays a primary role in determining which mechanism will occur. When the atoms are relatively similar in size, the atom exchange method usually happens, where some of the atoms composing the metallic crystals are substituted with atoms of the other constituent. This is called a ''substitutional alloy''. Examples of substitutional alloys include bronze and brass, in which some of the copper atoms are substituted with either tin or zinc atoms respectively. In the case of the interstitial mechanism, one atom is usually much smaller than the other and  can not successfully substitute for the other type of atom in the crystals of the base metal. Instead, the smaller atoms become trapped in the spaces between the atoms of the crystal matrix, called the ''interstices''. This is referred to as an ''interstitial alloy''. Steel is an example of an interstitial alloy, because the very small carbon atoms fit into interstices of the iron matrix. [[Stainless steel]] is an example of a combination of interstitial and substitutional alloys, because the carbon atoms fit into the interstices, but some of the iron atoms are substituted by nickel and chromium atoms.<ref name=\"Jon L.

Eventually, humans learned to [[smelting|smelt]] metals such as copper and [[tin]] from [[ore]], and, around 2500 BC, began alloying the two metals to form [[bronze]], which was much harder than its ingredients. Tin was rare, however, being found mostly in Great Britain.

Gold was often found alloyed with silver or other metals to produce various types of [[colored gold]]. These metals were also used to strengthen each other, for more practical purposes.

As a pure metal, tin is much too soft to be used for any practical purpose. However, during the [[Bronze Age]], tin was a rare metal in many parts of Europe and the Mediterranean; due to this it was often valued higher than gold. To make jewellery, cutlery, or other objects from tin, it was usually alloyed with other metals to increase its strength and hardness. These metals were typically [[lead]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] or copper. These solutes were sometimes added individually in varying amounts, or added together, making a wide variety of objects, ranging from practical items such as dishes, surgical tools, candlesticks or funnels, to decorative items like ear rings and hair clips.\n\nThe earliest examples of pewter come from ancient Egypt, around 1450 BC. The use of pewter was widespread across Europe, from France to Norway and Britain (where most of the ancient tin was mined) to the Near East.<ref>Hull, Charles (1992) ''Pewter''. Shire Publications. pp. 3\u20134; {{ISBN|0-7478-0152-5}}</ref> The alloy was also used in China and the Far East, arriving in Japan around 800 AD, where it was used for making objects like ceremonial vessels, tea canisters, or chalices used in [[shinto]] shrines.<ref>Brinkley, Frank (1904) ''Japan and China: Japan, its history, arts, and literature''.

Opposite to most alloying processes, liquid pig-iron is poured from a blast furnace into a container and stirred to remove carbon, which diffuses into the air forming carbon dioxide, leaving behind a [[mild steel]] to wrought iron.]]\n\nThe first known smelting of iron began in [[Anatolia]], around 1800 BC. Called the [[bloomery|bloomery process]], it produced very soft but [[ductile]] [[wrought iron]]. By 800 BC, iron-making technology had spread to Europe, arriving in Japan around 700 AD. [[Pig iron]], a very hard but brittle alloy of iron and [[carbon]], was being produced in [[History of China#Shang Dynasty (c. 1700\u20131046 BC)|China]] as early as 1200 BC, but did not arrive in Europe until the Middle Ages. Pig iron has a lower melting point than iron, and was used for making [[cast-iron]]. However, these metals found little practical use until the introduction of [[crucible steel]] around 300 BC. These steels were of poor quality, and the introduction of [[pattern welding]], around the 1st century AD, sought to balance the extreme properties of the alloys by laminating them, to create a tougher metal. Around 700 AD, the Japanese began folding bloomery-steel and cast-iron in alternating layers to increase the strength of their swords, using clay fluxes to remove [[slag]] and impurities. This method of [[Japanese swordsmithing]] produced one of the purest steel-alloys of the early Middle Ages.<ref name=r1>Smith, Cyril (1960) ''History of metallography''. MIT Press. pp. 2\u20134. {{ISBN|0-262-69120-5}}.</ref>\n\nWhile the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal was much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of [[steel]], (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by [[heat treatment]] had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of [[blister steel]] during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, [[Benjamin Huntsman]] began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of [[tool steel]]. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\">Roberts, George Adam; Krauss, George; Kennedy, Richard and Kennedy, Richard L.

Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the [[liquid]] pig iron to create steel. [[Puddling (metallurgy)|Puddling]] had been used in China since the first century, and was introduced in Europe during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by [[oxidation]]. In 1858, [[Sir Henry Bessemer]] developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The [[Bessemer process]] was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel.<ref name=\"George Adam Roberts Page 2-3\"/>\n\n====Alloy steels====\nAlthough steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, the term \"[[alloy steel]]\" usually only refers to those steels which contain other elements like [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], or [[cobalt]] in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the [[Age of reason]], the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of [[Sheffield]], a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter [[industrial espionage]]. Thus, almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until 1860. Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like [[William Chandler Roberts-Austen]], Adolph Martens, and [[Edgar Bain]]), so \"alloy steel\" became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.<ref>''Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence'' By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 57\u201462</ref><ref>''Experimental Techniques in Materials and Mechanics'' By C.

Krauss \u2013 ASM International 1998 Page 4</ref> Afterward, many people began experimenting with various alloys of steel without much success. However, in 1882, [[Robert Hadfield]], being a pioneer in steel metallurgy, took an interest and produced a steel alloy containing around 12% manganese. Called [[mangalloy]], it exhibited extreme hardness and toughness, becoming the first commercially viable alloy-steel.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bramfitt, B.

After quenching a ternary alloy of aluminium, copper, and [[magnesium]], Wilm discovered that the alloy increased in hardness when left to age at room temperature. Although an explanation for the phenomenon was not provided until 1919, [[duralumin]] was one of the first \"age hardening\" alloys to be used, and was soon followed by many others. Because they often exhibit a combination of high strength and low weight, these alloys became widely used in many forms of industry, including the construction of modern [[aircraft]].<ref>Jacobs, M.

Movements have come to an end to be replaced by a new movement markedly different in striking ways.  See also [[cultural movement]]s.\n\n== Artistic revolution and political revolutions ==\n\nThe role of [[fine art]] has been to simultaneously express values of the current culture while also offering criticism, balance, or alternatives to any such values that are proving no longer useful. So as times change, art changes. If changes were abrupt they were deemed revolutions. The best artists have predated society's changes due not to any prescience, but because sensitive perceptivity is part of their talent of seeing.\n\nArtists who succeeded enough to portray visions that future generations could live to see, often had to navigate an often treacherous path between their own capacity to see and execute what lesser artists could not, while still appealing to powerful patrons who could finance their visions. For example, paintings glorified aristocracy in the early 17th century when leadership was needed to nationalize small political groupings, but later as leadership became oppressive, satirization increased and subjects were less concerned with leaders and more with more common plights of mankind.<ref>citation needed</ref>\n\nNo art owes quite as much to state power as French painting does. It was in the age of absolute monarchy launched by Louix XIV in the 17th century that the likes of Poussin and Le Brun put France in the forefront of European art. Versailles found its stately mirror in the powerful idea of classicism \u2013 a painting style, enduring in later artists like Ingres, whose austerity and grandeur express the authority of a world where Jove is very much in his throne.<ref>jonathanjonesblog</ref>\n\nExamples of revolutionary art in conjunction with cultural and political movements:\n\n*[[Trotskyist]] & [[Diego Rivera]]\n*[[Black Panther Party]] & [[Emory Douglas]]\n*Cuban [[Poster art]]\n*[[Social realism]] & [[Ben Shahn]]\n*[[Feminist art]] & the [[Guerrilla Girls]]\n*[[Industrial Workers of the World]] & [[Woody Guthrie]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724182247/http://revolutionarytides.stanford.edu/main.html Revolutionary Tides]\n\n== Artistic revolution of style ==\n\n[http://www.art-head-start.com/3d/squid/revolution300.jpg Here] is an example of an Artistic Revolution Pieces\n\n== Scientific and Technological ==\n\nNot all artistic revolutions were political. Sometimes, science and technological innovations have brought about unforeseen transformations in the works of artists.  The stylistic revolution known as [[Impressionism]],  by painters eager to more accurately capture the changing colors of light and shadow, is inseparable from discoveries and inventions in the mid-19th century in which the style was born.\n\n[[Eugene Chevreul]], a French chemist hired as director of dyes at a French tapestry works,  began to investigate the optical nature of color in order to improve color in fabrics.  Chevreul realized It was the eye, and not the dye, that had the greatest influence on color, and from this, he revolutionized color theory by grasping what came to be called the law of simultaneous contrast: that colors mutually influence one another when juxtaposed, each imposing its own complementary color on the other.  The French painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, who had been experimenting with what he called broken tones,  embraced Chevreul's book, \"The Law of Contrast of Color (1839) with its explanations of how juxtaposed colors can enhance or diminish each other, and his exploration of all the visible colors of the spectrum.  Inspired by Chevreul\u2019s 1839 treatise, Delacroix passed his enthusiasm on to the young artists who were inspired by him. It was Chevreul who led the Impressionists to grasp that they should apply separate brushstrokes of pure color to a canvas and allow the viewer\u2019s eye to combine them optically.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Eugene-Chevreul</ref>\n\nThey were aided greatly in this by innovations in oil paint itself. Since the Renaissance,  painters had to grind pigment, add oil and thus create their own paints; these time-consuming paints also quickly dried out, making studio painting a necessity for large works, and limiting painters to mix one or two colors at a time and fill in an entire area using just that one color before it dried out.  in 1841, a little-known American painter named John G. Rand invented a simple improvement without which the Impressionist movement could not have occurred: the small, flexible tin tube with removable cap in which oil paints could be stored.<ref>http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/?no-ist, May 2013, by Perry Hurt</ref>   Oil paints kept in such tubes stayed moist and usable -- and quite portable. For the first time since the Renaissance, painters were not trapped by the time frame of how quickly oil paint dried.\n\nPaints in tubes could be easily loaded up and carried out into the real world,  to directly observe the play of color and natural light, in shadow and movement, to paint in the moment.  Selling the oil paint in tubes also brought about the arrival of dazzling new pigments -  chrome yellow, cadmium blue - invented by 19th century industrial chemists. The tubes freed the Impressionists to paint quickly, and across an entire canvas, rather than carefully delineated single-color sections at a time; in short, to sketch directly in oil - racing across the canvas in every color that came to hand and thus inspiring their name of \"impressionists\" - since such speedy, bold brushwork and dabs of separate colors made contemporary critics think their paintings were mere impressions, not finished paintings, which were to have no visible brush marks at all, seamless under layers of varnish.\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir said, \u201cWithout colors in tubes, there would be no C\u00e9zanne, no Monet, no Pissarro, and no Impressionism.\u201d<ref>http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/never-underestimate-the-power-of-a-paint-tube-36637764/#P4ovFKfbRLyMIhQT.99</ref>\n\nFinally, the careful, hyper-realistic techniques of French neo-classicism were seen as stiff and lifeless when compared to the remarkable new vision of the world as seen through the new invention of photography by the mid-1850s.  It was not merely that the increasing ability of this new invention, particularly by the French inventor Daguerre, made the realism of the painted image redundant as he deliberately competed in the Paris diorama with large-scale historical paintings.<ref>\"Speculating Daguerre: Art and Enterprise in the Work of L. J. M. Daguerre\" by Stephen C. Pinson, Chicago, (2012) p. 1-12</ref>  The neo-classical subject matter,  limited by Academic tradition to Greek and Roman legends, historical battles and Biblical stories, seemed oppressively cliched and limited to artists eager to explore the actual world in front of their own eyes revealed by the camera - daily life, candid groupings of everyday people doing simple things, Paris itself, rural landscapes and most particularly the play of captured light -  not the imaginary lionizing of unseen past events.<ref>Review of \"The Lens of Impressionism,\" at University of Michigan Museum of Art, October- Dec. 2009 by Simon Kelly, Volume 9, Issue 1 Spring 2010, http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring10/the-lens-of-impressionism</ref> Early photographs influenced Impressionist style by its use of asymmetry, cropping and most obviously the blurring of motion, as inadvertently captured in the very slow speeds of early photography.\n\n [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]  - in their framing, use of color, light and shadow, subject matter  - put these innovations to work to create a new language of visual beauty and meaning.\n\n== Faking revolution: the C.I.A. and Abstract Expressionism ==\n\nTheir initial break with realism into an exploration of light, color and the nature of paint was brought to an ultimate conclusion by the  [[Abstract Expressionists]] who broke away from recognizable content of any kind into works of pure shape, color and painterliness which emerged at the end of the second world war.  At first thought of as primitive, inept works - as in \"my four year old could do that\"\u2014these works were misunderstood and neglected until given critical and support by the rise of art journalists and critics who championed their work in the 1940s and 50's,  expressing the power of such work in aesthetic terms the artists themselves seldom used, or even understood.  [[Jackson Pollock]] who pioneered splatter painting, dispensing with a paint brush altogether, soon became lionized as the angry young man in a large spread in Life Magazine.\n\nIn fact, in a deliberate, secret and successful effort to separate artistic revolutions from political ones,  abstract expressionists like Pollack, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko, while seemingly difficult, pathbreaking artists, were in fact secretly supported for twenty years by the C.I.A. in a Cold War policy begun in 1947 to prove that the United States could foster more artistic freedom than the Soviet bloc.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html</ref>  \"It was recognized that Abstract Expressionism was the kind of art that made Socialist Realism look even more stylized and rigid and confined than it was, \" said former C.I.A. case worker Donald Jameson, who finally broke the silence on this program in 1995.  Ironically, the covert C.I.A. support for these radical works was required because an attempt to use government funds for a European tour of these works during the Truman administration led to a public uproar in conservative McCarthy-era America, with Truman famously remarking, \"If that's art, I'm a Hottentot.\"  Thus the program was hidden under the guise of fabricated foundations and the support of wealthy patrons who were actually using C.I.A. funds, not their own, to sponsor traveling exhibitions of American abstract expressionists all over the world, publish books and articles praising them and to purchase and exhibit Abstract Expressionist works in major American and British museums. Thomas Braden, in charge of these cultural programs for the C.I.A.. in the early years of the Cold War, had formerly been executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art, America's leading institution for 20th Century art and the charges of collusion between the two echoed for many years after this program was revealed, though most of the artists involved had no idea they were being used in this way and were furious when they found out.<ref>http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/17/unpopular-front</ref>\n\n== Artistic Movements ==\n\n=== [[Art in ancient Greece|Ancient & Classical Art]] ===\nKey dates: 15000 BCE / 400 BCE-200CE / 350 CE-450CE<br />\nAncient - There are few remaining examples with early art often favouring drawing over colour. Work has been found recently in tombs, Egyptian frescoes, pottery and metalwork.<br />\nClassical - Relating to or from ancient Roman or Greek architecture and art. Mainly concerned with geometry and symmetry rather than individual expression.<br />\nByzantine - A religious art characterised by large domes, rounded arches and mosaics from the eastern Roman Empire in the 4th Century.<ref name=artmovements>http://www.artmovements.co.uk</ref>\n\n===[[Gothic architecture|Medieval & Gothic]]===\nKey dates: 400CE<br />\nMedieval - A highly religious art beginning in the 5th Century in Western Europe. It was characterised by iconographic paintings illustrating scenes from the bible.<br />\nGothic - This style prevailed between the 12th century and the 16th century in Europe. Mainly an architectural movement, Gothic was characterised by its detailed ornamentation most noticeably the pointed archways and elaborate rib vaulting.<br />\nFirst developed in France, Gothic was intended as a solution to the inadequacies of Romanesque architecture. It allowed for cathedrals to be built with thinner walls and it became possible to introduce stained glass windows instead of traditional mosaic decorations. Some of the finest examples of the style include the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims and Amiens. The term was also used to describe sculpture and painting that demonstrated a greater degree of naturalism.<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Renaissance]]===\nKey dates: 14th century<br />\nThis movement began in Italy in the 14th century and the term, literally meaning rebirth, describes the revival of interest in the artistic achievements of the Classical world. Initially in a literary revival Renaissance was determined to move away from the religion-dominated Middle Ages and to turn its attention to the plight of the individual man in society. It was a time when individual expression and worldly experience became two of the main themes of Renaissance art. The movement owed a lot to the increasing sophistication of society, characterised by political stability, economic growth and cosmopolitanism. Education blossomed at this time, with libraries and academies allowing more thorough research to be conducted into the culture of the antique world. In addition, the arts benefited from the patronage of such influential groups as the Medici family of Florence, the Sforza family of Milan and Popes Julius II and Leo X. The works of Petrarch first displayed the new interest in the intellectual values of the Classical world in the early 14th century and the romance of this era as rediscovered in the Renaissance period can be seen expressed by Boccaccio. Leonardo da Vinci was the archetypal Renaissance man representing the humanistic values of the period in his art, science and writing. Michelangelo and Raphael were also vital figures in this movement, producing works regarded for centuries as embodying the classical notion of perfection. Renaissance architects included Alberti, Brunelleschi and Bramante. Many of these artists came from Florence and it remained an important centre for the Renaissance into the 16th century eventually to be overtaken by Rome and Venice. Some of the ideas of the Italian Renaissance did spread to other parts of Europe, for example to the German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer of the 'Northern Renaissance'. But by the 16th century Mannerism had overtaken the Renaissance and it was this style that caught on in Europe. <br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nLeonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, Filippo Brunelleschi, Raphael da Urbino, Titian, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Donatello Bardi.<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Mannerism]]===\nKey dates: 1520-1600<br />\nArtists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance developed their characteristic styles from the observation of nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an elastic elongation of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones. <br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nAndrea del Sarto, Jacopo da Pontormo, Correggio<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Baroque]]===\nKey dates: 17th century<br />\nBaroque Art emerged in Europe around 1600, as a reaction against the intricate and formulaic Mannerist style which dominated the Late Renaissance. Baroque Art is less complex, more realistic and more emotionally affecting than Mannerism.<br />\nThis movement was encouraged by the Catholic Church, the most important patron of the arts at that time, as a return to tradition and spirituality.<br />\nOne of the great periods of art history, Baroque Art was developed by Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, and Gianlorenzo Bernini, among others. This was also the age of Rubens, Rembrandt, Vel\u00e1zquez, and Vermeer.<br />\nIn the 18th century, Baroque Art was replaced by the more elegant and elaborate Rococo style.<br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nCaravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Gianlorenzo Bernini, Rubens, Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Rococo]]===\nKey dates: 18th century<br />\nThroughout the 18th century in France, a new wealthy and influential middle-class was beginning to rise, even though the royalty and nobility continued to be patrons of the arts. Upon the death of Louis XIV and the abandonment of Versailles, the Paris high society became the purveyors of style. This style, primarily used in interior decoration, came to be called Rococo. The term Rococo was derived from the French word \"rocaille\", which means pebbles and refers to the stones and shells used to decorate the interiors of caves. Therefore, shell forms became the principal motif in Rococo. The society women competed for the best and most elaborate decorations for their houses. Hence the Rococo style was highly dominated by the feminine taste and influence.<br />\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher was the 18th century painter and engraver whose works are regarded as the perfect expression of French taste in the Rococo period. Trained by his father who was a lace designer, Boucher won fame with his sensuous and light-hearted mythological paintings and landscapes. He executed important works for both the Queen of France and Mme. de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, who was considered the most powerful woman in France at the time. Boucher was Mme. de Pompadour's favorite artist and was commissioned by her for numerous paintings and decorations. Boucher also became the principal designer for the royal porcelain factory and the director of the Gobelins tapestry factory. The Vulcan Presenting Venus with Arms for Aeneas is a template for a tapestry made by this factory. <br />\nCharacterized by elegant and refined yet playful subject matters, Boucher's style became the epitome of the court of Louis XV. His style consisted of delicate colors and gentle forms painted within a frivolous subject matter. His works typically utilized delightful and decorative designs to illustrate graceful stories with Arcadian shepherds, goddesses and cupids playing against a pink and blue sky. These works mirrored the frolicsome, artificial and ornamented decadence of the French aristocracy of the time.<br />\nThe Rococo is sometimes considered a final phase of the Baroque period.<br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nFran\u00e7ois Boucher, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Angelica Kauffman, Giovanni Antonio Canaletto, Vel\u00e1zquez Vermeer<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]]===\nKey dates: 1750-1880<br />\nA nineteenth-century French art style and movement that originated as a reaction to the Baroque. It sought to revive the ideals of ancient Greek and Roman art. Neoclassic artists used classical forms to express their ideas about courage, sacrifice, and love of country. David and Canova are examples of neo-classicists.<br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nJacques-Louis David, Sir Henry Raeburn, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Thomas Gainsborough, Antonio Canova, Arnold Bocklin<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n===[[Romanticism]]===\nKey dates: 1800-1880<br />\nRomanticism was basically a reaction against Neoclassicism, it is a deeply felt style which is individualistic, beautiful, exotic, and emotionally wrought.<br />\nAlthough Romanticism and Neoclassicism were philosophically opposed, they were the dominant European styles for generations, and many artists were affected to a greater or lesser degree by both. Artists might work in both styles at different times or even mix the styles, creating an intellectually Romantic work using a Neoclassical visual style, for example.<br />\nGreat artists closely associated with Romanticism include J.M.W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich, John Constable, and William Blake.<br />\nIn the United States, the leading Romantic movement was the Hudson River School of dramatic landscape painting.<br />\nObvious successors of Romanticism include the Pre-Raphaelite movement and the Symbolists. But Impressionism, and through it almost all of 20th-century art, is also firmly rooted in the Romantic tradition. <br />\nRepresentative artists:<br />\nGeorge Stubbs, William Blake, John Martin, Francisco Goya, Sir Thomas Lawrence, John Constable, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Sir Edwin landseer, Caspar David Friedrich, JMW Turner<ref name=artmovements/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Artistic Revolution}}\n[[Category:Art history]]\n[[Category:Articles lacking sources from June 2009]]\n[[Category:All articles lacking sources]]\n[[Category:Revolutions by type]]", "sha1": "tm4p24n5bv5ec7rfduhpr651kwfgcn5"}}, {"title": "Agrarianism", "ns": "0", "id": "1193", "revision": {"id": "865101230", "parentid": "862491061", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T18:50:01Z", "contributor": {"username": "Slusho815", "id": "9244940"}, "comment": "Removed gender bias.

They have \"a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.\" The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.\n*Cultivation of the soil \"has within it a positive spiritual good\" and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of \"honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.\" They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of agrarianism}}\nThe philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon.<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> That influenced European intellectuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of [[physiocracy]].<ref>L.A.

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted village cooperatives to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[Tunisian parliamentary election, 2014|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters.The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4,23% in the [[French presidential election, 2002]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') were founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[Polish parliamentary election, 1993|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.\n\n====Ukraine====\nIn Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] \"with a [[pitchfork]]\".<ref name=BBCUE14RPst>[http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014)</ref> The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village\n<ref name=radppUW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014)</ref>), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|format= |work= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nHistorian F.K. Crowley finds that:\n: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.<ref>F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901 \u2013 1939'' (1973) pp 77-78.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Party of Australia]] (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called \"[[countrymindedness]]\".  The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n== Back-to-the-land movement ==\nAgrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the \"progressive\" character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.<ref>Jeffrey Carl Jacob, ''New Pioneers: The Back-to-the-Land Movement and the Search for a Sustainable Future'' (Penn State University Press. 1997)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Agropedia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Agrarian Justice]]\n*[[Agrarian socialism]]\n*[[Agrarian society]]\n*[[Agrarian system]]\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Physiocrats]], 18th-century French thinkers\n*[[International Agrarian Bureau]]\n*[[Nordic agrarian parties]]\n*[[Yeoman]], English farmers\n*[[Permaculture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Agrarian values ===\n* Brass, Tom.

Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in [[Euclidean space|Euclidean and other spaces]]. These are called [[dihedral angle]]s. Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection. Similar statements hold in space, for example, the [[spherical angle]] formed by two [[great circle]]s on a [[sphere]] is the dihedral angle between the planes determined by the great circles.\n\n''Angle'' is also used to designate the [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] of an angle or of a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]. This measure is the ratio of the length of a [[arc (geometry)|circular arc]] to its [[radius]]. In the case of a geometric angle, the arc is centered at the vertex and delimited by the sides. In the case of a rotation, the arc is centered at the center of the rotation and delimited by any other point and its image by the rotation.\n\nThe word ''angle'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''angulus'', meaning \"corner\"; [[cognate]] words are the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}} ''(ankyl\u03bfs)'', meaning \"crooked, curved,\" and the [[English language|English]] word \"[[ankle]]\". Both are connected with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*ank-'', meaning \"to bend\" or \"bow\".<ref>{{harvnb|Slocum|2007}}</ref>\n<!--Note: \u1f00\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 rather than \u1f00\u03bd\u03ba\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 is correct, the \u03b3\u03ba is a digraph pronounced [\u014bk].-->\n\n[[Euclid]] defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet each other, and do not lie straight with respect to each other. According to [[Proclus]] an angle must be either a quality or a quantity, or a relationship. The first concept was used by [[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]], who regarded an angle as a deviation from a [[straight line]]; the second by [[Carpus of Antioch]], who regarded it as the interval or space between the intersecting lines; Euclid adopted the third concept, although his definitions of right, acute, and obtuse angles are certainly quantitative.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|pp=177\u2013178}}</ref><!-- This paragraph is quoted from EB1911, but its source seems to be Heath.-->\n\n==Identifying angles==\nIn mathematical expressions, it is common to use [[Greek letter]]s (<var>\u03b1</var>, <var>\u03b2</var>, <var>\u03b3</var>, <var>\u03b8</var>, <var>\u03c6</var>,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) to serve as [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] standing for the size of some angle. (To avoid confusion with its other meaning, the symbol [[Pi|{{math|\u03c0}}]] is typically not used for this purpose.) Lower case Roman letters (''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c'',&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) are also used, as are upper case Roman letters in the context of [[polygon]]s. See the figures in this article for examples.\n\nIn geometric figures, angles may also be identified by the labels attached to the three points that define them. For example, the angle at vertex A enclosed by the rays AB and AC (i.e. the lines from point A to point B and point A to point C) is denoted \u2220BAC (in Unicode {{unichar|2220|ANGLE|HTML=}}) or <math>\\widehat{\\rm BAC}</math>. Sometimes, where there is no risk of confusion, the angle may be referred to simply by its vertex (\"angle A\").\n\nPotentially, an angle denoted, say, \u2220BAC might refer to any of four angles: the clockwise angle from B to C, the anticlockwise angle from B to C, the clockwise angle from C to B, or the anticlockwise angle from C to B, where the direction in which the angle is measured determines its sign (see [[#Positive and negative angles|Positive and negative angles]]). However, in many geometrical situations it is obvious from context that the positive angle less than or equal to 180 degrees is meant, and no ambiguity arises. Otherwise, a convention may be adopted so that \u2220BAC always refers to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from B to C, and \u2220CAB to the anticlockwise (positive) angle from C to B.\n\n==Types of angles==\n{{Redirect|Oblique angle|the cinematographic technique|Dutch angle}}\n===Individual angles===\n*An angle equal to 0\u00b0 is called a zero angle.\n*Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90\u00b0) are called ''acute angles'' (\"acute\" meaning \"sharp\").\n*An angle equal to {{sfrac|4}} turn (90\u00b0 or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians) is called a ''[[right angle]]''. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be ''[[normal (geometry)|normal]]'', ''[[orthogonality|orthogonal]]'', or ''[[perpendicular]]''.\n*Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) are called ''obtuse angles'' (\"obtuse\" meaning \"blunt\").\n*An angle equal to {{sfrac|2}} turn (180\u00b0 or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) is called a ''straight angle''.\n*Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0) are called ''reflex angles''.\n*An angle equal to 1 turn (360\u00b0 or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) is called a ''full angle'', ''complete angle'', or a ''perigon''.\n*Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called ''oblique angles''.\n\nThe names, intervals, and measured units are shown in a table below:\n\n{{Multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Right angle.svg\n|width1=140\n|caption1=[[Right angle]]\n\n|image2=Angle obtuse acute straight.svg\n|width2=250\n|caption2=Acute (<var>a</var>), obtuse (<var>b</var>), and straight (<var>c</var>) angles.

An angle is defined by its measure and is not dependent upon the lengths of the sides of the angle (e.g. all ''right angles'' are equal in measure).\n*Two angles which share terminal sides, but differ in size by an integer multiple of a turn, are called ''coterminal angles''.\n*A ''reference angle'' is the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians), to the results as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and {{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180\u2013150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750\u2013720).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|title=Mathwords: Reference Angle|author=|date=|website=www.mathwords.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023035017/http://www.mathwords.com/r/reference_angle.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|adjacent}} Vertical and adjacent angle pairs===\n[[File:Vertical Angles.svg|thumb|150px|left|Angles A and B are a pair of vertical angles; angles C and D are a pair of vertical angles.]]\n\nWhen two straight lines intersect at a point, four angles are formed. Pairwise these angles are named according to their location relative to each other.\n*A pair of angles opposite each other, formed by two intersecting straight lines that form an \"X\"-like shape, are called ''vertical angles'' or ''opposite angles'' or ''vertically opposite angles''. They are abbreviated as ''vert. opp. \u2220s''.<ref name=\"tb\">{{harvnb|Wong|Wong|2009|pp=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n:The equality of vertically opposite angles is called the ''vertical angle theorem''. [[Eudemus of Rhodes]] attributed the proof to [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]].<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Euclid]]|title=[[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]]|year=c. 300 BC}} Proposition I:13.</ref>{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} The proposition showed that since both of a pair of vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note,{{sfn|Shute| Shirk|Porter|1960|pp=25\u201327}} when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles to make sure that they were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.\n\n:In the figure, assume the measure of Angle ''A'' = ''x''. When two adjacent angles form a straight line, they are supplementary. Therefore, the measure of Angle ''C'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Similarly, the measure of Angle ''D'' = 180 \u2212 ''x''. Both Angle ''C'' and Angle ''D'' have measures equal to 180 \u2212 ''x'' and are congruent. Since Angle ''B'' is supplementary to both Angles ''C'' and ''D'', either of these angle measures may be used to determine the measure of Angle ''B''. Using the measure of either Angle ''C'' or Angle ''D'' we find the measure of Angle ''B'' = 180 \u2212 (180 \u2212 ''x'') = 180 \u2212 180 + ''x'' = ''x''. Therefore, both Angle ''A'' and Angle ''B'' have measures equal to ''x'' and are equal in measure.\n\n[[File:Adjacentangles.svg|right|thumb|225px|Angles ''A'' and ''B'' are adjacent.]]\n\n*''Adjacent angles'', often abbreviated as ''adj. \u2220s'', are angles that share a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an \"arm\". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, straight angle or full angle are special and are respectively called ''complementary'', ''supplementary'' and ''explementary'' angles (see \"Combine angle pairs\" below).\n\nA [[Transversal (geometry)|transversal]] is a line that intersects a pair of (often parallel) lines and is associated with ''alternate interior angles'', ''corresponding angles'', ''interior angles'', and ''exterior angles''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=255}}\n\n===Combining angle pairs===\n\nThere are three special angle pairs which involve the summation of angles:\n{{anchor|complementary angle}}\n[[File:Complement angle.svg|thumb|150px|The ''complementary'' angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> (<var>b<var> is the ''complement'' of <var>a</var>, and <var>a</var> is the complement of <var>b</var>).]]\n\n*'''Complementary angles''' are angle pairs whose measures sum to one right angle ({{sfrac|4}} turn, 90\u00b0, or {{sfrac|{{math|\u03c0}}|2}} radians). If the two complementary angles are adjacent their non-shared sides form a right angle. In Euclidean geometry, the two acute angles in a right triangle are complementary, because the sum of internal angles of a [[triangle]] is 180 degrees, and the right angle itself accounts for ninety degrees.\n:The adjective complementary is from Latin ''complementum'', associated with the verb ''complere'', \"to fill up\". An acute angle is \"filled up\" by its complement to form a right angle.\n:The difference between an angle and a right angle is termed the ''complement'' of the angle.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911\">{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}</ref>\n:If angles ''A'' and ''B'' are complementary, the following relationships hold:\n:: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\sin^2A + \\sin^2B = 1 & & \\cos^2A + \\cos^2B = 1 \\\\[3pt]\n& \\tan A = \\cot B  & & \\sec A = \\csc B\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n:(The [[tangent]] of an angle equals the [[cotangent]] of its complement and its secant equals the [[cosecant]] of its complement.)\n:The [[prefix]] \"[[co (function prefix)|co-]]\" in the names of some trigonometric ratios refers to the word \"complementary\".\n{{clear|right}}\n[[File:Angle obtuse acute straight.svg|thumb|right|300px|The angles <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> are ''supplementary'' angles.]]\n*{{anchor|Linear pair of angles|Supplementary angle}}Two angles that sum to a straight angle ({{sfrac|2}} turn, 180\u00b0, or {{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called '''supplementary angles'''.\n:If the two supplementary angles are [[#adjacent|adjacent]] (i.e. have a common [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a [[line (geometry)|straight line]]. Such angles are called a '''linear pair of angles'''.{{sfn|Jacobs|1974|p=97}} However, supplementary angles do not have to be on the same line, and can be separated in space.  For example, adjacent angles of a [[parallelogram]] are supplementary, and opposite angles of a [[cyclic quadrilateral]] (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.\n:If a point P is exterior to a circle with center O, and if the [[tangent lines to circles|tangent lines]] from P touch the circle at points T and Q, then \u2220TPQ and \u2220TOQ are supplementary.\n:The sines of supplementary angles are equal. Their cosines and tangents (unless undefined) are equal in magnitude but have opposite signs.\n:In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a triangle is supplementary to the third, because the sum of internal angles of a triangle is a straight angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n{{anchor|explementary angle}}\n[[File:Reflex angle.svg|thumb|right|150px|Sum of two ''explementary'' angles is a ''complete'' angle.]]\n*Two angles that sum to a complete angle (1 turn, 360\u00b0, or 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians) are called '''explementary angles''' or '''conjugate angles'''.\n*:The difference between an angle and a complete angle is termed the ''explement'' of the angle or ''conjugate'' of an angle.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Polygon-related angles===\n[[File:ExternalAngles.svg|thumb|300px|right|Internal and external angles.]]\n*An angle that is part of a [[simple polygon]] is called an ''[[interior angle]]'' if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple [[concave polygon]] has at least one interior angle that is a reflex angle.\n*:In [[Euclidean geometry]], the measures of the interior angles of a [[triangle]] add up to {{math|\u03c0}} radians, 180\u00b0, or {{sfrac|2}} turn; the measures of the interior angles of a simple [[convex polygon|convex]] [[quadrilateral]] add up to 2{{math|\u03c0}} radians, 360\u00b0, or 1 turn. In general, the measures of the interior angles of a simple convex [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides add up to (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2){{math|\u03c0}} radians, or 180(''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2) degrees, (2''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;4) right angles, or ({{sfrac|''n''|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) turn.\n*The supplement of an interior angle is called an ''[[exterior angle]]'', that is, an interior angle and an exterior angle form a [[#Linear pair of angles|linear pair of angles]]. There are two exterior angles at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending one of the two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An exterior angle measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon.{{sfn|Henderson|Taimina|2005|p=104}} If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex angle, the exterior angle should be considered [[Negative number|negative]]. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the exterior angle, but one will have to pick an [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (or [[surface (mathematics)|surface]]) to decide the sign of the exterior angle measure.\n*:In Euclidean geometry, the sum of the exterior angles of a simple convex polygon will be one full turn (360\u00b0). The exterior angle here could be called a ''supplementary exterior angle''. Exterior angles are commonly used in [[Logo (programming language)|Logo Turtle Geometry]] when drawing regular polygons.\n*In a [[triangle]], the [[bisection|bisectors]] of two exterior angles and the bisector of the other interior angle are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]] (meet at a single point).<ref name=Johnson>Johnson, Roger A.

Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.\n\nIn some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.\n\n[[File:Angle measure.svg|right|thumb|The measure of angle <var>\u03b8</var> (in radians) is the quotient of <var>s</var> and <var>r</var>.]]\n\nIn order to measure an angle <var>[[theta|\u03b8]]</var>, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length <var>s</var> of the arc by the radius <var>r</var> of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):\n\n:<math> \\theta = k \\frac{s}{2\\pi r}. </math>\n\nThe value of <var>\u03b8</var> thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered.

The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''\u03b8r''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''\u03b8'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''\u03b8'' and 2{{math|\u03c0}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|\u03c0}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|\u03c0}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=Note|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius <var>r</var>, in addition to the issue of \"measurement units chosen.\" A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc.

In this postulate it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.\n\n===Units===\n{{see also|Angular unit}}\n<!-- the less remarkable units may be removed from this section, add them to angular unit (if they are not there yet) -->\n\nUnits used to represent angles are listed below in descending magnitude order. Of these units, the ''[[degree (angle)|degree]]'' and the ''[[radian]]'' are by far the most commonly used.  Angles expressed in radians are dimensionless for the purposes of [[dimensional analysis]].\n\nMost units of angular measurement are defined such that one ''[[Turn (geometry)|turn]]''  (i.e. one full circle) is equal to ''n'' units, for some whole number ''n''.  The two exceptions are the radian and the diameter part.\n\n;[[turn (geometry)|Turn]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1): The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{tau}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application, but in the acronym ''[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]'' (revolutions per minute), just ''r'' is used. A ''turn'' of ''n'' units is obtained by setting {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}}}}} in the formula above. The equivalence of 1 ''turn'' is 360\u00b0, 2{{pi}} rad, 400 grad, and 4 right angles. The symbol {{tau}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians. Used in this way ({{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|{{tau}}|2{{pi}}}}}}) allows for radians to be expressed as a fraction of a turn. For example, half a turn is {{nowrap|1 = {{sfrac|{{tau}}|2}} = {{pi}}}}.\n\n;[[Quadrant (circle)|Quadrant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4): The ''quadrant'' is {{sfrac|4}} of a turn, i.e. a ''[[right angle]]''. It is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. 1 quad. = 90\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|4}} turn = 100&nbsp;grad. In German the symbol <sup>\u221f</sup> has been used to denote a quadrant.\n\n;[[Sextant (circle)|Sextant]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6): The ''sextant'' (''angle of the [[equilateral triangle]]'') is {{sfrac|6}} of a turn. It was the unit used by the [[Babylonians]],<ref>[[J.H. Jeans]] (1947), ''The Growth of Physical Science'', [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JX49AAAAIAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7 p. 7]; [[Francis Dominic Murnaghan (mathematician)|Francis Dominic Murnaghan]] (1946), ''Analytic Geometry'', p. 2</ref> and is especially easy to construct with ruler and compasses. The degree, minute of arc and second of arc are [[sexagesimal]] subunits of the Babylonian unit. 1 Babylonian unit = 60\u00b0 = {{pi}}/3&nbsp;rad \u2248 1.047197551&nbsp;rad.\n[[File:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|<var>\u03b8</var> = <var>s</var>/<var>r</var> rad = 1 rad.]]\n\n;[[Radian]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2{{pi}}&nbsp;=&nbsp; 6.283&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The case of radian for the formula given earlier, a ''radian'' of ''n'' = 2{{pi}} units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|2{{pi}}|2{{pi}}}} = 1. One turn is 2{{pi}} radians, and one radian is {{sfrac|180|{{pi}}}} degrees, or about 57.2958 degrees. The radian is abbreviated ''rad'', though this symbol is often omitted in mathematical texts, where radians are assumed unless specified otherwise. When radians are used angles are considered as dimensionless. The radian is used in virtually all mathematical work beyond simple practical geometry, due, for example, to the pleasing and \"natural\" properties that the [[trigonometric function]]s display when their arguments are in radians. The radian is the (derived) unit of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system.\n\n;[[Clock position]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;12): A clock position is the [[relative direction]] of an object described using the analogy of a [[12-hour clock]]. One imagines a clock face lying either upright or flat in front of oneself, and identifies the twelve hour markings with the directions in which they point.\n\n;[[Hour angle]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;24): The astronomical ''hour angle'' is {{sfrac|24}} of a turn. As this system is amenable to measuring objects that cycle once per day (such as the relative position of stars), the sexagesimal subunits are called ''minute of time'' and ''second of time''.  These are distinct from, and 15 times larger than, minutes and seconds of arc. 1&nbsp;hour = 15\u00b0 = {{sfrac|{{pi}}|12}}&nbsp;rad = {{sfrac|6}}&nbsp;quad. = {{sfrac|24}} ''turn'' = {{sfrac|16|2|3}}&nbsp;grad.\n\n;[[compass point|(Compass) point or wind]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;32): The ''point'', used in [[navigation]], is {{sfrac|32}} of a turn. 1&nbsp;point = {{sfrac|8}} of a right angle = 11.25\u00b0 = 12.5&nbsp;grad. Each point is subdivided in four quarter-points so that 1 turn equals 128 quarter-points.\n\n;[[Hexacontade]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;60): The ''hexacontade'' is a unit of 6\u00b0 that [[Eratosthenes]] used, so that a whole turn was divided into 60 units.\n\n;[[Pechus]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;144\u2013180): \u2013The ''pechus'' was a [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] unit equal to about 2\u00b0 or {{sfrac|2|1|2}}\u00b0.\n\n;[[Binary degree]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;256): The ''binary degree'', also known as the ''[[binary radian]]'' (or ''brad''), is {{sfrac|256}} of a turn.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080628051746/http://www.oopic.com/pgchap15.htm ooPIC Programmer's Guide (archived)] ''oopic.com''</ref> The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be efficiently represented in a single [[byte]] (albeit to limited precision).

The case of degrees for the formula given earlier, a ''degree'' of ''n'' = 360\u00b0 units is obtained by setting ''k'' = {{sfrac|360\u00b0|2{{pi}}}}. One advantage of this old [[sexagesimal]] subunit is that many angles common in simple geometry are measured as a whole number of degrees. Fractions of a degree may be written in normal decimal notation (e.g. 3.5\u00b0 for three and a half degrees), but the \"minute\" and \"second\" sexagesimal subunits of the \"degree-minute-second\" system are also in use, especially for [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical coordinates]] and in [[astronomy]] and [[ballistics]].\n\n;[[Diameter part]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;376.99&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One \"diameter part\" is approximately 0.95493\u00b0. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.\n\n;[[Grad (angle)|Grad]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;400): The ''grad'', also called ''grade'', ''gradian'', or ''gon'', is {{sfrac|400}} of a turn, so a right angle is 100 grads. It is a decimal subunit of the quadrant. A [[kilometre]] was historically defined as a [[centi]]-grad of arc along a great circle of the Earth, so the kilometer is the decimal analog to the [[sexagesimal]] nautical mile. The grad is used mostly in [[triangulation]].\n\n;[[Milliradian]]: The milliradian (mil or mrad) is defined as a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] consists of 2000\u03c0 mil (or approximately 6283.185... mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578... degrees (3.43775... minutes). One \"[[NATO]] mil\" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817... \u2248 {{sfrac|1000}}).\n\n;[[Minute of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;21,600):  The ''minute of arc'' (or ''MOA'', ''arcminute'', or just ''minute'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a degree = {{sfrac|21,600}} turn. It is denoted by a single prime (&nbsp;\u2032&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;30\u2032 is equal to 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;60&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;=&nbsp;210 minutes or 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|30|60}} = 3.5 degrees. A mixed format with decimal fractions is also sometimes used, e.g. 3\u00b0&nbsp;5.72\u2032 = 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|5.72|60}} degrees. A [[nautical mile]] was historically defined as a minute of arc along a [[great circle]] of the Earth.\n\n;[[Second of arc]] (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,296,000): The ''second of arc'' (or ''arcsecond'', or just ''second'') is {{sfrac|60}} of a minute of arc and {{sfrac|3600}} of a degree. It is denoted by a double prime (&nbsp;\u2033&nbsp;). For example, 3\u00b0&nbsp;7\u2032&nbsp;30\u2033 is equal to 3 + {{sfrac|7|60}} + {{sfrac|30|3600}} degrees, or 3.125&nbsp;degrees.\n\n===Positive and negative angles===\nAlthough the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent [[Orientation (geometry)|orientations]] and/or [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in opposite directions relative to some reference.\n\nIn a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative ''y''-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the ''x''-axis rightward and the ''y''-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].\n\nIn many contexts, an angle of \u2212''\u03b8'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of \"one full turn minus ''\u03b8''\". For example, an orientation represented as &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360\u00b0&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;45\u00b0 or 315\u00b0.  Although the final position is the same, a physical rotation (movement) of &nbsp;\u221245\u00b0 is not the same as a rotation of 315\u00b0 (for example, the rotation of a person holding a broom resting on a dusty floor would leave visually different traces of swept regions on the floor).\n\nIn three-dimensional geometry, \"clockwise\" and \"anticlockwise\" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.\n\nIn [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] or [[Azimuth|azimuth]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angles are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45\u00b0 corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315\u00b0.\n\n===Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle===\nThere are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the angle of rotation.\nThe ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. A gradient is often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of the angle in radians.\n\nIn [[rational geometry]] the ''[[spread (rational trigonometry)|spread]]'' between two lines is defined as the square of the sine of the angle between the lines. As the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same, any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value for the spread between the lines.\n\n===Astronomical approximations===\nAstronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.\n* 0.5\u00b0 is approximately the width of the sun or moon.\n* 1\u00b0 is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.\n* 10\u00b0 is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.\n* 20\u00b0 is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.\n\nThese measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.\n\n==Angles between curves==\n[[File:Curve angles.svg|thumb|right|The angle between the two curves at ''P'' is defined as the angle between the tangents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> at <var>P</var>.]]\nThe angle between a line and a [[curve]] (mixed angle) or between two intersecting curves (curvilinear angle) is defined to be the angle between the [[tangent]]s at the point of intersection. Various names (now rarely, if ever, used) have been given to particular cases:\u2014''amphicyrtic'' (Gr. {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af}}, on both sides, \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, convex) or ''cissoidal'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2, ivy), biconvex; ''xystroidal'' or ''sistroidal'' (Gr. \u03be\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, a tool for scraping), concavo-convex; ''amphicoelic'' (Gr. \u03ba\u03bf\u03af\u03bb\u03b7, a hollow) or ''angulus lunularis'', biconcave.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911}}; {{harvnb|Heiberg|1908|p=178}}</ref><!-- Again, most of this paragraph is from EB1911 with Heath used as its source. -->\n\n==Bisecting and trisecting angles==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle trisection}}\n\nThe [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greek mathematicians]] knew how to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a [[compass and straightedge]], but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 [[Pierre Wantzel]] showed that for most angles this construction cannot be performed.\n\n==Dot product and generalisations==\nIn the [[Euclidean space]], the angle ''\u03b8'' between two [[Euclidean vector]]s '''u''' and '''v''' is related to their [[dot product]] and their lengths by the formula\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\cos(\\theta) \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThis formula supplies an easy method to find the angle between two planes (or curved surfaces) from their [[normal vector]]s and between [[skew lines]] from their vector equations.\n\n===Inner product===\nTo define angles in an abstract real [[inner product space]], we replace the Euclidean dot product ( '''\u00b7''' ) by the inner product <math> \\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle </math>, i.e.\n\n:<math> \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\|\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nIn a complex [[inner product space]], the expression for the cosine above may give non-real values, so it is replaced with\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Re} \\left( \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right) = \\cos(\\theta)\\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nor, more commonly, using the absolute value, with\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = | \\cos(\\theta) | \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| .</math>\n\nThe latter definition ignores the direction of the vectors and thus describes the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> spanned by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> correspondingly.\n\n===Angles between subspaces===\nThe definition of the angle between one-dimensional subspaces <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{u})</math> and  <math>\\operatorname{span}(\\mathbf{v})</math> given by\n\n:<math> \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{u} , \\mathbf{v} \\rangle \\right| = |\\cos(\\theta)| \\left\\| \\mathbf{u} \\right\\| \\ \\left\\| \\mathbf{v} \\right\\| </math>\n\nin a [[Hilbert space]] can be extended to subspaces of any finite dimensions. Given two subspaces <math> \\mathcal{U} </math>, <math> \\mathcal{W} </math> with <math> \\dim ( \\mathcal{U}) := k \\leq \\dim ( \\mathcal{W}) := l </math>, this leads to a definition of <math>k</math> angles called canonical or [[principal angles]] between subspaces.\n\n===Angles in Riemannian geometry===\nIn [[Riemannian geometry]], the [[metric tensor]] is used to define the angle between two [[tangent]]s. Where ''U'' and ''V'' are tangent vectors and ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub> are the components of the metric tensor ''G'',\n\n:<math>\n\\cos \\theta = \\frac{g_{ij}U^iV^j}{\\sqrt{ \\left| g_{ij}U^iU^j \\right| \\left| g_{ij}V^iV^j \\right|}}.\n</math>\n\n===Hyperbolic angle===\nA [[hyperbolic angle]] is an [[argument of a function|argument]] of a [[hyperbolic function]] just as the '''circular angle''' is the argument of a [[circular function]]. The comparison can be visualized as the size of the openings of a [[hyperbolic sector]] and a [[circular sector]] since the [[area]]s of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as [[infinite series]] in their angle argument, the circular ones are just [[alternating series]] forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by [[Leonhard Euler]] in ''[[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]]''.\n\n==Angles in geography and astronomy==\nIn [[geography]], the location of any point on the Earth can be identified using a ''[[geographic coordinate system]]''. This system specifies the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of any location in terms of angles subtended at the centre of the Earth, using the [[equator]] and (usually) the [[Greenwich meridian]] as references.\n\nIn [[astronomy]], a given point on the [[celestial sphere]] (that is, the apparent position of an astronomical object) can be identified using any of several ''[[astronomical coordinate systems]]'', where the references vary according to the particular system. Astronomers measure the ''[[angular separation]]'' of two [[star]]s by imagining two lines through the centre of the [[Earth]], each intersecting one of the stars. The angle between those lines can be measured, and is the angular separation between the two stars.\n\nIn both geography and astronomy, a sighting direction can be specified in terms of a [[vertical angle]] such as [[altitude angle|altitude]] /[[elevation angle|elevation]] with respect to the [[horizon]] as well as the [[azimuth]] with respect to [[north]].\n\nAstronomers also measure the ''apparent size'' of objects as an [[angular diameter]]. For example, the [[full moon]] has an angular diameter of approximately 0.5\u00b0, when viewed from Earth. One could say, \"The Moon's diameter subtends an angle of half a degree.\" The [[small-angle formula]] can be used to convert such an angular measurement into a distance/size ratio.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bisection#Angle bisector|Angle bisector]]\n*[[Angular velocity]]\n*[[Argument (complex analysis)]]\n*[[Astrological aspect]]\n*[[Central angle]]\n*[[Clock angle problem]]\n*[[Dihedral angle]]\n*[[Exterior angle theorem]]\n*[[Great circle distance]]\n*[[Inscribed angle]]\n*[[Irrational angle]]\n*[[Phase angle]]\n*[[Protractor]]\n*[[Solid angle]] for a concept of angle in three dimensions.\n*[[Spherical angle]]\n*[[Transcendent angle]]\n*[[Trisection]]\n*[[Zenith angle]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |last1=Henderson |first1=David W. |last2=Taimina |first2=Daina |year=2005 |title=Experiencing Geometry / Euclidean and Non-Euclidean with History |edition=3rd |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=9780131437487|page=104}}\n*{{citation |last=Heiberg |first=Johan Ludvig |year=1908 |title=Euclid |editor-first=T.

A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is an '''acoustician''' while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may be called an [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineer]]. The application of acoustics is present in almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and [[noise control]] industries.\n\n[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world, and [[speech]] is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of human society\u2014music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare and more. Likewise, animal species such as songbirds and frogs use sound and hearing as a key element of mating rituals or marking territories. Art, craft, science and technology have provoked one another to advance the whole, as in many other fields of knowledge. [[Robert Bruce Lindsay]]'s 'Wheel of Acoustics' is a well accepted overview of the various fields in acoustics.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.physics.byu.edu/research/acoustics/what_is_acoustics.aspx |title=What is acoustics? |accessdate=2010-07-29}}</ref>\n\nThe word \"acoustic\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''akoustikos''), meaning \"of or for hearing, ready to hear\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233396 Akoustikos] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref> and that from \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (''akoustos''), \"heard, audible\",<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233397 Akoustos] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref> which in turn derives from the verb [[Wikt:\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c9|\u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c9]] (''akouo''), \"I hear\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%233399 Akouo] Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus</ref>\n\nThe Latin synonym is \"sonic\", after which the term '''sonics''' used to be a synonym for acoustics<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth Neville Westerman|title=Emergent Voice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNQrAAAAMAAJ|year=1947|publisher=C.

He is reputed to have observed that when the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of integers (e.g. 2 to 3, 3 to 4), the tones produced will be harmonious, and the smaller the integers the more harmonious the sounds.  If, for example, a string of a certain length would sound particularly harmonious with a string of twice the length (other factors being equal). In modern parlance, if a string sounds the note C when plucked, a string twice as long will sound a C an octave lower.  In one system of [[musical tuning]], the tones in between are then given by 16:9 for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in ascending order.<ref>C.

Mainly [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) but also [[Marin Mersenne]] (1588\u20131648), independently, discovered the complete [[Mersenne's laws|laws of vibrating strings]] (completing what Pythagoras and Pythagoreans had started 2000 years earlier).  Galileo wrote \"Waves are produced by the [[vibration]]s of a sonorous body, which spread through the air, bringing to the tympanum of the [[ear]] a stimulus which the mind interprets as sound\", a remarkable statement that points to the beginnings of physiological and psychological acoustics.  Experimental measurements of the [[speed of sound]] in air were carried out successfully between 1630 and 1680 by a number of investigators, prominently Mersenne.  Meanwhile, Newton (1642\u20131727) derived the relationship for wave velocity in solids, a cornerstone of [[physical acoustics]] ([[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]], 1687).\n\n=== Age of Enlightenment and onward ===\nThe eighteenth century saw major advances in acoustics as mathematicians applied the new techniques of calculus to elaborate theories of sound wave propagation. In the nineteenth century the major figures of mathematical acoustics were [[Helmholtz]] in Germany, who consolidated the field of physiological acoustics, and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]] in England, who combined the previous knowledge with his own copious contributions to the field in his monumental work ''The Theory of Sound'' (1877).  Also in the 19th century, Wheatstone, Ohm, and Henry developed the analogy between electricity and acoustics.\n\nThe twentieth century saw a burgeoning of technological applications of the large body of scientific knowledge that was by then in place. The first such application was [[Wallace Clement Sabine|Sabine]]\u2019s groundbreaking work in architectural acoustics, and many others followed. Underwater acoustics was used for detecting submarines in the first World War.  [[Sound recording]] and the telephone played important roles in a global transformation of society.  Sound measurement and analysis reached new levels of accuracy and sophistication through the use of electronics and computing.  The ultrasonic frequency range enabled wholly new kinds of application in medicine and industry.  New kinds of transducers (generators and receivers of acoustic energy) were invented and put to use.\n\n== Fundamental concepts of acoustics ==\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]]\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    = At [[Jay Pritzker Pavilion]], a [[LARES]] system is combined with a zoned [[sound reinforcement system]], both suspended on an overhead steel trellis, to synthesize an indoor acoustic environment outdoors.\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | image1    = 20070919 Pritzker Pavilion from stage.JPG\n | width1    = 178\n | image2    = 20070919 Pritzker Pavilion speakers.JPG\n | width2    = 100\n}}\n\n=== Definition ===\nAcoustics is defined by [[ANSI/ASA S1.1-2013]] as \"(a) Science of [[sound]], including its production, transmission, and effects, including biological and psychological effects. (b) Those qualities of a room that, together, determine its character with respect to auditory effects.\"\n\nThe study of acoustics revolves around the generation, propagation and reception of mechanical waves and vibrations.\n\n::'''[[File:Cause-effect diagram for acoustics.svg|med|The fundamental acoustical process]]'''\n\nThe steps shown in the above diagram can be found in any acoustical event or process. There are many kinds of cause, both natural and volitional. There are many kinds of transduction process that convert energy from some other form into sonic energy, producing a sound wave. There is one fundamental equation that describes sound wave propagation, the [[acoustic wave equation]], but the phenomena that emerge from it are varied and often complex. The wave carries energy throughout the propagating medium. Eventually this energy is transduced again into other forms, in ways that again may be natural and/or volitionally contrived. The final effect may be purely physical or it may reach far into the biological or volitional domains. The five basic steps are found equally well whether we are talking about an [[earthquake]], a submarine using sonar to locate its foe, or a band playing in a rock concert.\n\nThe central stage in the acoustical process is wave propagation. This falls within the domain of physical acoustics. In [[fluid]]s, sound propagates primarily as a [[pressure wave]]. In solids, mechanical waves can take many forms including [[longitudinal waves]], [[transverse waves]] and [[surface waves]].\n\nAcoustics looks first at the pressure levels and frequencies in the sound wave and how the wave interacts with the environment. This interaction can be described as either a [[diffraction]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] or a [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] or a mix of the three. If several [[Transmission medium|media]] are present, a [[refraction]] can also occur. Transduction processes are also of special importance to acoustics.\n\n=== Wave propagation: pressure levels ===\n{{Main|Sound pressure}}\n\n[[Image:Oh No Girl Spectrogram 2.jpg|thumb|[[Spectrogram]] of a young girl saying \"oh, no\"]]\nIn fluids such as air and water, sound waves propagate as disturbances in the ambient pressure level.  While this disturbance is usually small, it is still noticeable to the human ear.  The smallest sound that a person can hear, known as the [[Absolute threshold of hearing|threshold of hearing]], is nine orders of magnitude smaller than the ambient pressure.  The [[loudness]] of these disturbances is related to the [[sound pressure level]] (SPL) which is measured on a logarithmic scale in decibels.\n\n=== Wave propagation: frequency ===\nPhysicists and acoustic engineers tend to discuss sound pressure levels in terms of frequencies, partly because this is how our [[ears]] interpret sound. What we experience as \"higher pitched\" or \"lower pitched\" sounds are pressure vibrations having a higher or lower number of cycles per second. In a common technique of acoustic measurement, acoustic signals are sampled in time, and then presented in more meaningful forms such as octave bands or time frequency plots. Both of these popular methods are used to analyze sound and better understand the acoustic phenomenon.\n\nThe entire spectrum can be divided into three sections:  audio, ultrasonic, and infrasonic.  The audio range falls between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] and 20,000&nbsp;Hz.  This range is important because its frequencies can be detected by the human ear.  This range has a number of applications, including speech communication and music.  The ultrasonic range refers to the very high frequencies: 20,000&nbsp;Hz and higher.  This range has shorter wavelengths which allow better resolution in imaging technologies.  Medical applications such as [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonography]] and elastography rely on the ultrasonic frequency range.  On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest frequencies are known as the infrasonic range.  These frequencies can be used to study geological phenomena such as earthquakes.\n\nAnalytic instruments such as the [[spectrum analyzer]] facilitate visualization and measurement of acoustic signals and their properties.  The [[spectrogram]] produced by such an instrument is a graphical display of the time varying pressure level and frequency profiles which give a specific acoustic signal its defining character.\n\n=== Transduction in acoustics ===\n[[Image:3.5 Inch Speaker.jpg|thumb|An inexpensive low fidelity 3.5&nbsp;inch '''driver''', typically found in small radios]]\nA [[transducer]] is a device for converting one form of energy into another.  In an electroacoustic context, this means converting sound energy into electrical energy (or vice versa). Electroacoustic transducers include [[loudspeaker]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[hydrophone]]s and [[sonar]] projectors. These devices convert a sound pressure wave to or from an electric signal. The most widely used transduction principles are [[electromagnetism]], [[electrostatics]] and [[piezoelectricity]].\n\nThe transducers in most common [[loudspeaker]]s (e.g. [[woofer]]s and [[tweeter]]s), are electromagnetic  devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm driven by an electromagnetic [[voice coil]], sending off pressure waves. [[Electret microphone]]s and [[condenser microphone]]s employ electrostatics\u2014as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.\n\n==Acoustician==\n\nAn acoustician is an expert in the science of sound.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schwarz|first=C|title=Chambers concise dictionary|year=1991}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nThere are many types of acoustician, but they usually have a [[Bachelor's degree]] or higher qualification. Some possess a degree in acoustics, while others enter the discipline via studies in fields such as [[physics]] or [[engineering]]. Much work in acoustics requires a good grounding in [[Mathematics]] and [[science]]. Many acoustic scientists work in research and development. Some conduct basic research to advance our knowledge of the perception (e.g. [[hearing]], [[psychoacoustics]] or [[neurophysiology]]) of [[speech]], [[music]] and [[noise]]. Other acoustic scientists advance understanding of how sound is affected as it moves through environments, e.g. [[Underwater acoustics]], [[Architectural acoustics]] or [[Structural acoustics]]. Others areas of work are listed under subdisciplines below. Acoustic scientists work in government, university and private industry laboratories. Many go on to work in [[Acoustical Engineering]]. Some positions, such as [[Faculty (academic staff)]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]].\n\n== Subdisciplines ==\nThese subdisciplines are a slightly modified list from the PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition\u2014Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Archaeoacoustics===\n{{main|Archaeoacoustics}}\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|The [[Divje Babe flute]]]]\n[[Archaeoacoustics]] is the study of sound within archaeology.

It is primarily concerned with the [[Electron configuration|arrangement of electrons around the nucleus]] and\nthe processes by which these arrangements change. This comprises [[ion]]s, neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, it can be assumed that the term ''atom'' includes ions.[citation needed]\n\nThe term ''atomic physics'' can be associated with [[nuclear power]] and [[nuclear weapon]]s, due to the [[synonym]]ous use of ''atomic'' and ''nuclear'' in [[standard English]]. Physicists distinguish between atomic physics \u2014 which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons \u2014 and [[nuclear physics]], which considers [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] alone.\n\nAs with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of ''[[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]''. Physics research groups are usually so classified.\n\n==Isolated atoms==\nAtomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is not concerned with the formation of [[molecule]]s (although much of the physics is identical), nor does it examine atoms in a [[solid state physics|solid state]] as [[condensed matter]]. It is concerned with processes such as [[ionization]] and [[excited state|excitation]] by photons or collisions with atomic particles.\n\nWhile modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a [[gas]] or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation, as the vast majority of the time they are.  By this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in [[plasma (physics)|plasma physics]] and [[atmospheric physics]], even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms.\n\n==Electronic configuration==\nElectrons form notional [[Electron shells|shells]] around the nucleus. These are normally in a [[ground state]] but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ([[photon]]s), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically ions or other electrons).\n\n[[File:Bohr atom model.svg|thumb|In the Bohr model, the transition of an electron with n=3 to the shell n=2 is shown, where a photon is emitted. An electron from shell (n=2) must have been removed beforehand by ionization]] Electrons that populate a shell are said to be in a [[bound state]].  The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the [[binding energy]].  Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to [[kinetic energy]] according to the [[conservation of energy]].  The atom is said to have undergone the process of [[ionization]].\n\nIf the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will be transferred to an [[excited state]]. After a certain time, the electron in an excited state will \"jump\" (undergo a transition) to a lower state. In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy, since energy is conserved.\n\nIf an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy (so that the atom ionizes), then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital. In this case, a visible photon or a [[characteristic x-ray]] is emitted, or a phenomenon known as the [[Auger effect]] may take place, where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron, causing it to go into the continuum.  The Auger effect allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.\n\nThere are rather strict [[selection rule]]s as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light \u2014 however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.\n\n==History and developments==\n{{Main|Atomic theory}}\nOne of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed\nof ''atoms''. It forms a part of the texts written in 6th century BC to 2nd century BC such as those of [[Democritus]] or [[Vaisheshika Sutra]] written by [[Kanad]]. This theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a [[chemical element]] by the British chemist and physicist [[John Dalton]] in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties (in bulk). The invention of the [[periodic system of elements]] by [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]] was another great step forward.\n\nThe true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of [[spectral line]]s and attempts to describe the phenomenon, most notably by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]. The study of these lines led to the [[Bohr atom model]] and to the birth of [[quantum mechanics]]. In seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed. As far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned, not only did this yield a better overall description, i.e. the [[atomic orbital model]], but it also provided a new theoretical basis for [[chemistry]]\n([[quantum chemistry]]) and [[spectroscopy]].\n\nSince the [[World War II|Second World War]], both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace. This can be attributed to progress in computing technology, which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes.  Similar technological advances in accelerators, detectors, magnetic field generation and [[laser]]s have greatly assisted experimental work.\n<!-- Perhaps create to a category list instead and embed names in history/theory section later -->\n\n==Significant atomic physicists==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n; Pre quantum mechanics\n* [[John Dalton]]\n* [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]]\n* [[Johannes Rydberg]]\n* [[J.

Nakamura]]</ref> that serves as the predominant [[sign language]] of [[Deaf communities]] in the United States and most of [[Anglophone Canadians|Anglophone Canada]]. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based [[creole language|creoles]] are used in many countries around the world, including much of [[West Africa]] and parts of [[Southeast Asia]]. ASL is also widely learned as a [[second language]], serving as a [[lingua franca]]. ASL is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]] (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a [[creole language]] of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as [[agglutination|agglutinative morphology]].\n\nASL originated in the early 19th century in the [[American School for the Deaf]] (ASD) in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], from a situation of [[language contact]]. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of [[child of deaf adult|children of deaf adults]]. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of [[oral language]] to sign language, compounded by the fact that ASL is often [[interlinear gloss|glossed]] in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.\n\nASL signs have a number of [[phoneme|phonemic]] components, including movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of [[mime|pantomime]], but [[iconicity]] does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English [[loan word]]s are often borrowed through [[fingerspelling]], although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]]. Many linguists believe ASL to be a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:American Sign Language demo - Travis Dougherty.ogv|thumb|Travis Dougherty explains and demonstrates the ASL alphabet. Voice-over interpretation by Gilbert G. Lensbower.]]\n\nASL emerged as a language in the [[American School for the Deaf]] (ASD), founded in 1817.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|7}} This school brought together [[Old French Sign Language]], various [[village sign language]]s, and [[home sign]] systems; ASL was created in this situation of [[language contact]].<ref name=\"padden\" />{{rp|11}}<ref group=\"nb\">In particular, [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]], [[Henniker Sign Language]], and [[Sandy River Valley Sign Language]] were brought to the school by students. These in turn appear to have been influenced by early [[British Sign Language]], and did not involve input from indigenous Native American sign systems. See {{Harvcoltxt|Padden|2010|p=11}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Lane|Pillard|French|2000|p=17}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Johnson|Schembri|2007|p=68}}.</ref> ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|7}}\n\nThe influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are [[cognate]] to [[Old French Sign Language]] signs.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|7}}<ref name=\"padden\">{{Harvcoltxt|Padden|2010}}</ref>{{rp|14}} However, this is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually [[dialect]]s.<ref name=\"padden\" />{{rp|14}} This suggests that nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students, despite the fact that the school's original director [[Laurent Clerc]] taught in LSF.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|7}}<ref name=\"padden\" />{{rp|14}} In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students' signs rather than conveying LSF:<ref name=\"padden\"/>{{rp|14}}\n{{Quote | text=I see, however, and I say it with regret, that any efforts that we have made or may still be making, to do better than, we have inadvertently fallen somewhat back of Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e. Some of us have learned and still learn signs from uneducated pupils, instead of learning them from well instructed and experienced teachers.|sign=Clerc|source=1852, from Woodward 1978:336}}\n\nIt has been proposed that ASL is a [[creole language|creole]] with LSF as the [[superstrate]] language and with the native village sign languages as [[substrate (linguistics)|substrate]] languages.<ref name=\"kegl\">{{Harvcoltxt|Kegl|2008}}</ref>{{rp|493}} However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages.<ref name=\"kegl\"/>{{rp|501}} ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language.<ref name=\"kegl\" />{{rp|501}} There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards [[agglutination]], for example the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. This might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards [[isolating morphology]].<ref name=\"kegl\"/>{{rp|502}} Additionally, Clerc and [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] may have used an artificially constructed form of [[manually coded language]] in instruction rather than true LSF.<ref name=\"kegl\"/>{{rp|497}}\n\nAlthough the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) or [[Auslan]].<ref name=\"johnson\">{{Harvcoltxt|Johnson|Schembri|2007}}</ref>{{rp|68}} All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension.<ref name=\"johnson\" />{{rp|68}} It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37\u201344%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same [[language family]].<ref name=\"johnson\" />{{rp|69}} However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of [[iconicity]] in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.<ref name=\"johnson\" />{{rp|70}}\n\nAmerican Sign Language is growing in popularity among many states. Many people in high school and colleges desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective. The issue was that many didn't consider it a foreign language. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture and way they interact when talking. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which sets the language apart.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ASL as a Foreign Language Fact Sheet|url = http://www.unm.edu/~wilcox/UNM/facts.html|website = www.unm.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}</ref>\n\n{{cns|American sign language is now being accepted by many colleges as a foreign language credit;<ref>{{Cite web|\nurl=http://www.unm.edu/~wilcox/UNM/univlist.html|title=Universities That Accept ASL In Fulfillment Of Foreign Language Requirements.|last=Wilcox Phd|first=Sherman|date=May 2016|access-date=May 24, 2018}}\n</ref> many states are making it mandatory to accept it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2017-04-26/tennessee-passes-sign-language-bill|title=Bill Passes Requiring Sign Language Students Receive Credit|last=Burke|first=Sheila|date=April 26, 2017|website=US News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011051745/https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/tennessee/articles/2017-04-26/tennessee-passes-sign-language-bill|archive-date=2017-10-11|dead-url=yes|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref>|date=December 2017}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sign language interpreter.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=signing man sitting in the foreground, with a speaker standing at a podium in the background|A sign language interpreter at a presentation]]\nPrior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|5}} In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad-hoc [[home sign]], which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|5}} As early as 1541 at first contact by [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], there were reports that the [[Plains Indians]] had developed [[Plains Indian Sign Language|a sign language]] to communicate between tribes of different languages.<ref>Ceil Lucas, 1995, ''The Sociolinguistics of the Deaf Community'' p. 80.</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, a \"triangle\" of [[village sign language]]s developed in [[New England]]: one in [[Martha's Vineyard]], Massachusetts; one in [[Henniker, New Hampshire]], and one in [[Sandy River Valley, Maine]].<ref name=Lane_Pillard_French>{{Harvcoltxt|Lane|Pillard|French|2000|p=17}}</ref>  [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in [[Chilmark, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}} Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness.<ref name=\"bahan\"/>{{rp|5\u20136}}.

Signers from the South tend to sign with more flow and ease. Native signers from New York have been reported as signing comparatively more quickly and sharply. Sign production of native Californian signers has also been reported as being fast as well. Research on this phenomenon often concludes this fast-paced production for signers form the coast could be due to the fast-paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas. This conclusion also supports how the ease with which Southern sign could be due to the easy going environment of the South in comparison to that of the East and West coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/sociolinguisticvariationofasl.htm|title=Regional, Cultural, and Sociolinguistic Variation of ASL in the United States|last=Rogelio|first=Contreras|date=November 15, 2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSign production can also vary depending on age and native language. For example, sign production of letters may vary in older signers. Slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age. Additionally, signers who learned American Sign Language as a second language vary in production. For Deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning American Sign Language, qualities of their native language may show in their ASL production. Some examples of this varied production are finger spelling towards the body instead of away from, and signing certain movement from bottom to top instead of top to bottom.  Hearing people that learn American Sign Language also have noticeable differences in signing production. The most notable production difference of hearing people learning American Sign Language is their rhythm and arm posture.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gallaudet Department of Linguistics|title=Do sign languages have accents?|date=2017-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gli3akhYOSo|accessdate=2018-04-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Sign variants ===\nMost popularly there are variants of the signs for English words such as \"birthday\", \"pizza\", \"Halloween\", \"early\", and \"soon\". These are just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variant based on regional change. The sign for \"school\" is commonly varied between black and white signers. The variation between sign produced by black and white signers is sometimes referred to as [[Black American Sign Language]].<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\" />\n\n=== History and implications ===\nThe prevalence of residential Deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the United States. Deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides. This limited access to signers from other regions, combined with the residential quality of Deaf Schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants. Native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education. It is hypothesized that because of this seclusion, certain variants of a sign prevailed over others other due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school/signers in the community.\n\nHowever, American Sign Language does not appear to be vastly varied when compared to other signed languages. This is because when Deaf education was beginning in the United States, many educators flocked to the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. This central location for the first generation of educators in Deaf education to learn American Sign Language allows ASL to be more standardized than it is variant.<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\" />\n\n==Varieties==\n{{main|Varieties of American Sign Language}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Variants of ABOUT in Canadian ASL\n\n|image1     = About- General sign.ogv\n|caption1   = About \u2013 General sign (Canadian ASL)<ref name=\"about\">{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|Dolby|2002|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n|image2     = About- Atlantic Variation.ogv\n|caption2   = About \u2013 Atlantic Variation (Canadian ASL)<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n|image3     = About- Ontario Variation.ogv\n|caption3   = About \u2013 Ontario Variation (Canadian ASL)<ref name=\"about\" />}}\nVarieties of ASL are found throughout the world.

[[Bolivian Sign Language]] is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects.<ref name=\"beth\">{{ethnolink|bvl|Bolivian Sign Language}} at ''Ethnologue''</ref> On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages.

Conclusion}}</ref> For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.<ref name=\"nyst\"/>{{rp|411}}\n\nWhen communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called [[Pidgin Signed English]] (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL.<ref name=\"eth\" /><ref name=\"deaflib\">{{cite web|title=About ASL|last=Nakamura|first=Karen|publisher=Deaf Resource Library|year=2008|url=http://www.deaflibrary.org/asl.html|accessdate=December 3, 2012}}</ref>  Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically [[relexification|relexified]] English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar.<ref name=\"deaflib\" /> Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL.<ref name=\"cxxv\" /> There have been some [[constructed languages|constructed sign languages]], known as [[Manually Coded English]] (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; these systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.<ref name=\"eth\" /><ref name=\"deaflib\" />\n\n[[Tactile ASL]] (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the [[deaf-blind]].<ref name=\"eth\" /> It is particularly common among those with [[Usher's syndrome]].<ref name=\"eth\" /> This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL.<ref name=\"usher\">{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|2004|p=33}}</ref> TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of non-manual signing.<ref name=\"eth\" />\n\n==Stigma==\nIn 2013 the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to ''officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools''. The response is titled \"there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language\" and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v5/n1/abs/nn775.html|title=A critical period for right hemisphere recruitment in American Sign Language processing | volume=5|doi=10.1038/nn775|pages=76\u201380|journal=Nature Neuroscience}}</ref> Scholars such as [[Beth S.

Most linguists agree that ASL is a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO) language with various phenomena affecting this basic word order.<ref name=\"Neidle 2000 59\">{{cite book|last=Neidle|first=Carol|title=The Syntax of American Sign Language: Functional Categories and Hierarchical Structures|year=2000|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=0-262-14067-5|page=59}}</ref> Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\">{{cite book|title=Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction|last=Valli|first=Clayton|publisher=Clerc Books|year=2005|isbn=1-56368-283-4|location=Washington, D.C.|page=169|pages=}}</ref>\n{{quotation|FATHER \u2013 LOVE \u2013 CHILD<br /><br />\"The father loves the child.\"<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\"/>}}\nHowever, other word orders may also occur, as ASL allows the [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as [[topicalization]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Valli|first=Clayton|title=Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Clerc Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-56368-283-4|page=85}}</ref> In [[object-subject-verb]] (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:<ref name=\"Valli 2005 86\">{{cite book|last=Valli|first=Clayton|title=Linguistics of American Sign Language: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Clerc Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1-56368-283-4|page=86}}</ref>\n{{quotation|CHILD<sup>topic</sup>, FATHER \u2013 LOVE<br /><br />\"The father loves the child.\"<ref name=\"Valli 2005 86\"/>}}\n\nEven more, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy. In subject copy, the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding, either for clarification or emphasis:<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\"/>\n{{quotation|FATHER \u2013 LOVE \u2013 CHILD \u2013 FATHER<sup>copy</sup><br /><br />\"The father loves the child.\"<ref name=\"Valli 2005 84\"/>}}\nASL also allows [[null subject]] sentences, where the subject is implied rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, in which the subject is omitted from its original position, yielding a [[verb\u2013object\u2013subject]] (VOS) construction:<ref name=\"Valli 2005 86\"/>\n{{quotation|LOVE \u2013 CHILD \u2013 FATHER<sup>copy</sup><br /><br />\"The father loves the child.\"<ref name=\"Valli 2005 86\"/>}}\nTopicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS).\n{{quotation|CHILD<sup>topic</sup>, LOVE \u2013 FATHER<sup>copy</sup><br /><br />\"The father loves the child.\"<ref name=\"Valli 2005 86\"/>}}\nThese properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, \"basic\" order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a [[topic\u2013comment]] structure, where words are ordered by their importance in the sentence rather than by their syntactic properties.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lillo-Martin|first=Diane|title=Two Kinds of Null Arguments in American Sign Language|journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory|date=November 1986|volume=4|issue=4|page=415|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF00134469.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2013|doi=10.1007/bf00134469}}</ref> Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits [[free word order]], in which syntax is not encoded in word order whatsoever, but can be encoded by other means (e.g. head nods, eyebrow movement, body position).<ref name=\"Neidle 2000 59\"/>\n\n==Iconicity==\n\nA common misconception is that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are [[pantomime]].<ref name=\"cxxiii\">{{Harvcoltxt|Costello|2008|p=xxiii}}</ref> In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time.<ref name=\"cxxiii\" /> Even so, in ASL [[iconicity]] plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way.<ref name=\"l60\" /> This may be due to the fact that the medium of sign\u2014three-dimensional space\u2014naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.<ref name=\"cxxiii\" />\n\nIn the era of the influential linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary.<ref name=\"l60\">{{Harvcoltxt|Liddell|2002|p=60}}</ref> Although [[onomatopoeia]] is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Liddell|2002|p=61}}</ref> ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.<ref name=\"l62\">{{Harvcoltxt|Liddell|2002|p=62}}</ref>\n\nResearch on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when interpreting their meaning.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun \"you\", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name.<ref name=\"petitto\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90034-5 |title=On the autonomy of language and gesture: Evidence from the acquisition of personal pronouns in American sign language |year=1987 |last1=Petitto |first1=Laura A. |journal=Cognition |volume=27 |pages=1\u201352 |pmid=3691016 |issue=1}}</ref> This is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition.

Applets are typical examples of [[Application posture|transient and auxiliary applications]] that don't monopolize the user's attention. Applets are not full-featured application programs, and are intended to be easily accessible.\n\n==History==\nThe word ''applet'' was first used in 1990 in PC Magazine.<ref name=\"Origin\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.oed.com\n|title=Oxford English Dictionary\n|year=2011\n|accessdate=2011-08-23\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720020117/http://www.oed.com//| archivedate= 20 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> However, the concept of an applet, or more broadly a small interpreted program downloaded and executed by the user, dates at least to RFC 5 (1969) by [[Jeff Rulifson]], which described the [[Decode-Encode Language]] (DEL), which was designed to allow remote use of the [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS) over [[ARPANET]], by downloading small programs to enhance the interaction.<ref>{{citation |title= DEL |author= Jeff Rulifson |work= RFC 5 |date= June 2, 1969 |publisher= Network Working Group |accessdate= April 15, 2011 }}</ref> This has been specifically credited as a forerunner of Java's downloadable programs in RFC 2555.<ref>{{citation |title= 30 Years of RFCs |author= RFC Editor, et a. |work= RFC 2555 |date= April 7, 1999 |publisher= Network Working Group |accessdate= April 15, 2011 }}</ref>\nApplet is an event driven program .\n\n==Applet as an extension of other software==\nIn some cases, an applet does not run independently. These applets must run either in a [[Container (data structure)|container]] provided by a host program, through a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]], or a variety of other applications including mobile devices that support the applet programming model.\n\n=== Web-based Applets ===\nApplets were used to provide interactive features to web applications that historically could be provided by [[HTML]] alone. They could capture [[Mouse (computing)|mouse input]] and also had controls like [[Button (computing)|buttons]] or [[check box]]es. In response to the user action an applet could change the provided graphic content. This made applets well suitable for demonstration, visualization, and teaching. There were online applet collections for studying various subjects, from physics to heart physiology. Applets were also used to create online game collections that allowed players to compete against live opponents in real-time.\n\nAn applet could also be a text area only, providing, for instance, a cross platform [[command-line interface]] to some remote system. If needed, an applet could leave the dedicated area and run as a separate window. However, applets had very little control over web page content outside the applet dedicated area, so they were less useful for improving the site appearance in general (while applets like [[news ticker]]s or [[WYSIWYG]] editors are also known). Applets could also play media in formats that are not natively supported by the browser.\n\nHTML pages could embed parameters that were passed to the applet. Hence the same applet could appear differently depending on the parameters that were passed.\n\nExamples of Web-based Applets include:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n* [[QuickTime|QuickTime movies]]\n* [[SWF|Flash movies]]\n* [[Windows Media Player]] applets, used to display embedded video files in [[Internet Explorer]] (and other [[Web browser|browsers]] that supported the plugin)\n* [[3D modeling]] display applets, used to rotate and zoom a model\n* [[Browser game]]s that were applet-based, though some developed into fully functional applications that required installation.\n\n===Applet Vs. Subroutine===\nA larger application distinguishes its applets through several features:{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n* Applets execute only on the \"client\" platform environment of a system, as contrasted from \"[[Java Servlet|servlet]]\". As such, an applet provides functionality or performance beyond the default capabilities of its container (the browser).\n* The container restricts applets' capabilities.\n* Applets are written in a language different from the scripting or [[HTML]] language that invokes it. The applet is written in a compiled language, whereas the scripting language of the container is an interpreted language, hence the greater performance or functionality of the applet. Unlike a subroutine, a complete web component can be implemented as an applet.\n\n==Java Applet==\n{{Main|Java Applet}}\n\nA Java Applet is a java program that is launched from HTML and run in a web browser. It can provide web applications with interactive features that cannot be provided by [[HTML]]. Since Java's [[bytecode]] is platform-independent, Java applets can be executed by browsers running under many platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Unix]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]]. When a Java technology-enabled [[web browser]] processes a page that contains an applet, the applet's [[code]] is transferred to the client's system and executed by the browser's [[Java Virtual Machine]] (JVM).<ref>[http://java.sun.com/applets/ \"Applets\"], Sun Developer Network. Accessed on July 21, 2009</ref> An HTML page references an applet either via the [[Deprecation|deprecated]] [[HTML element#applet|<applet> tag]] or via its replacement, the [[HTML element#object|<object> tag]].<ref>[https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_applet.asp \"HTML applet tag\"], W3Schools. Access on July 21, 2009\n</ref>\n\n==Security==\nRecent developments in the coding of applications including mobile and [[embedded system]]s have led to the awareness  of the security of applets.\n\n===Open Platform Applets===\nApplets in an [[open platform]] environment should provide secure interactions between different applications. A compositional approach can be used to provide security for [[open platform]] applets.<ref name=\"Compositional\">{{cite web\n|title=Compositional Verification of Secure Applet Interactions\n|url=http://www.springerlink.com/index/bmfqlufe1mfekdbp.pdf\n|last1=Barthe\n|first1=Gilles\n|last2=Gurov\n|first2=Dilian\n|last3=Huisman\n|first3=Marieke\n|year=2002\n|accessdate=2010-04-10\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.16.1254\n}}</ref>  Advanced compositional verification methods have been developed for secure applet interactions.<ref name=\"Compositional\"/>\n\n===Java Applets===\nA [[Java applet]] contains different security models:  [[Java applet#Unsigned|unsigned Java applet security]], [[Java applet#Signed|signed Java applet security]], and [[Java applet#Self-signed|self signed Java applet security]].\n\n===Web-based Applets===\nIn an applet-enabled [[web browser]], many methods can be used to provide applet security for malicious applets.

These stories usually contain \"what if\" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. The stories are conjectural but are sometimes based on fact. Alternate history has been seen as a subgenre of [[literary fiction]], [[science fiction]], or [[historical fiction]]; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. Another term occasionally used for the genre is \"allohistory\" (literally \"other history\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/turnsofphrase/tp-all1.htm |title=Allohistory |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2002-05-04 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1950s, this type of fiction has, to a large extent, merged with science fiction [[trope (literature)|trope]]s involving time travel between alternate histories, psychic awareness of the existence of one universe by the people in another, or time travel that results in history splitting into two or more [[timestream|timelines]]. Cross-time, time-splitting, and alternate history themes have become so closely interwoven that it is impossible to discuss them fully apart from one another.\n\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]],  [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], the genre of alternate history is sometimes called ''uchronie / ucronia / ucron\u00eda / Uchronie'', which has given rise to the term ''[[Uchronia]]'' in English. This [[neologism]] is based on the prefix {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u03c5-}} (which in [[Ancient Greek]] means \"not/not any/no\") and the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|chronos}}), meaning \"time.\" A ''uchronia'' means literally \"(in) no time.\" This term apparently also inspired the name of the alternate history book list, ''[[Uchronia: The Alternate History List|uchronia.net]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uchronia.net/intro.html |title=Introduction |publisher=Uchronia |date=1991-04-11 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines alternative history as \"a genre of fiction in which the author speculates on how the course of history might have been altered if a particular historical event had had a different outcome.\"<ref name=Collins>{{cite web|title = Definition of \"alternative history\" {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/alternative-history|website = www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate = 2016-01-15}}</ref> According to [[Steven H Silver]], an American science fiction editor, alternate history requires three things: a [[point of divergence]] from the history of our world prior to the time at which the author is writing, a change that would alter history as it is known, and an examination of the ramifications of that change.<ref name=SHS>{{cite web|author=[[Steven H Silver]] |title=Uchronicle |url=http://www.helixsf.com/uchronicle/uchronicle0706.htm |work= |publisher=''Helix'' |accessdate=2009-05-26 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[genre fiction|genres of fiction]] have been misidentified as alternate history.

It tells the story of the knight Tirant the White from Brittany who travels to the embattled remnants of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. He becomes a [[Megas doux|Megaduke]] and commander of its armies and manages to fight off the invading Ottoman armies of {{nowrap|[[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmet II]]}}. He saves the city from [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic conquest]], and even chases the Turks deeper into lands they had previously conquered.\n\n===19th century===\n\nOne of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a large audience may be [[Louis Geoffroy]]'s ''Histoire de la Monarchie universelle: Napol\u00e9on et la conqu\u00eate du monde (1812\u20131832)'' (History of the Universal Monarchy: Napoleon And The Conquest Of The World) (1836), which imagines [[Napoleon]]'s [[First French Empire]] emerging victorious in the [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1811 and in an invasion of England in 1814, later unifying the world under Bonaparte's rule.<ref name=\"roads\" />\n\nIn the English language, the first known complete alternate history is [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s [[short story]] \"[[P.'s Correspondence]]\", published in 1845. It recounts the tale of a man who is considered \"a madman\" due to his perceptions of a different 1845, a reality in which long-dead famous people, such as the poets [[Robert Burns]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] and [[John Keats]], the actor [[Edmund Kean]], the British politician [[George Canning]], and even [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], are still alive.\n\nThe first novel-length alternate history in English would seem to be [[Castello Holford]]'s ''[[Aristopia]]'' (1895). While not as nationalistic as [[Louis Geoffroy]]'s ''Napol\u00e9on et la conqu\u00eate du monde, 1812\u20131823'', ''Aristopia'' is another attempt to portray a Utopian society. In ''Aristopia'', the earliest settlers in [[Virginia]] discover a reef made of solid [[gold]] and are able to build a [[Utopia]]n society in [[North America]].\n\n===Early 20th century and the era of the pulps===\nA number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (see, for example, [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Charles Petrie's]] ''If: A Jacobite Fantasy'' [1926]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacobite.ca/essays/if.htm |title=If: A Jacobite Fantasy |publisher=Jacobite.ca |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> In 1931, British historian [[Sir John Squire]] collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period for his anthology ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]''. In this work, scholars from major universities (as well as important non-university-based authors) turned their attention to such questions as \"If the Moors in Spain Had Won\" and \"If [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] Had Had an Atom of Firmness\". The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]]'s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent 20th century Dutch city state on the island of [[Manhattan]]. Among the authors included were [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Andr\u00e9 Maurois]], and [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n[[File:Bring the Jubilee Map.PNG|thumb|A 1952 world map from the universe of [[Ward Moore]]'s ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'', where the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] wins the \"War of Southern Independence\"\u2014the counterfactual [[American Civil War]]]]\nOne of the entries in Squire's volume was Churchill's \"If Lee Had Not {{sic|Won}} the Battle of Gettysburg\", written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world where the [[Confederate States of America]] had won the [[American Civil War]]. The entry considers what would have happened if the North had been victorious (in other words, a character from an alternate world imagines a world more like the real one we live in, although not identical in every detail). Speculative work that narrates from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as \"[[recursive alternate history]]\", a \"double-blind what-if\", or an \"alternate-alternate history\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |title=If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg - The Churchill Centre |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206031128/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=674 |archivedate=December 6, 2006 }}</ref> Churchill's essay was one of the influences behind [[Ward Moore]]'s alternate history novel ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'',{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in which General [[Robert E. Lee]] won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], paving the way for the eventual victory of the Confederacy in the American Civil War (named the \"War of Southron Independence\" in this timeline).<!--Southron, with two \"o\"s is the word used in the novel and is not a misspelling.--> The protagonist, autodidact Hodgins Backmaker, travels back to the aforementioned battle and inadvertently changes history, resulting in the emergence of our own timeline and the consequent victory of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] instead.\n\nAmerican humorist author [[James Thurber]] parodied alternate history stories about the American Civil War in his 1930 story \"If Grant had been drinking at Appomattox\", which he accompanied with this very brief introduction: \"''Scribner's'' magazine is publishing a series of three articles: 'If Booth Had Missed Lincoln', 'If Lee Had Won the Battle of Gettysburg', and 'If Napoleon Had Escaped to America'. This is the fourth.\".\n\nAnother example of alternate history from this period (and arguably the first to explicitly posit [[Time travel in fiction|cross-time travel]] from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience) is [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923), in which several Englishmen are transferred via an accidental encounter with a cross-time machine into an alternate universe featuring a seemingly pacifistic and utopian Britain. When the Englishmen, led by a satiric figure based on Winston Churchill, try to seize power, the utopians simply point a ray gun at them and send them on to someone else's universe. Wells describes a [[multiverse]] of alternative worlds, complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with U.S. pulp writers. However, since his hero experiences only a single alternate world, this story is not very different from conventional alternate history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200221.txt |title=Project Gutenberg; Australia |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, alternate history moved into a new arena. The December 1933 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding]]'' published [[Nat Schachner]]'s \"Ancestral Voices\", which was quickly followed by [[Murray Leinster]]'s \"[[Sidewise in Time]]\". While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences, Leinster attempted something completely different. In his \"World gone mad\", pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines. The story follows Professor Minott and his students from a fictitious Robinson College as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history.\n\n[[File:Fatherland.png|thumb |right | 300px|The world in 1964 in the novel ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' where the Nazis won [[World War II]].]]\n\nA somewhat similar approach was taken by [[Robert A. Heinlein]] in his 1941 novelette ''[[Elsewhen]]'', in which a professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines. He then hypnotizes his students so they can explore more of them. Eventually each settles into the reality most suitable for him or her. Some of the worlds they visit are mundane, some very odd; others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions.\n\n[[World War II]] produced alternate history for [[propaganda]]: both British and American<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rosenfeld|first1=Gavriel D.|title=The World Hitler Never Made: Alternate History and the Memory of Nazism|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-84706-0|pages=39, 97\u201399|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> authors wrote works depicting Nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales.\n\n====Time travel as a means of creating historical divergences====\nThe period around World War II also saw the publication of the [[time travel]] novel ''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'' by [[L. Sprague de Camp]], in which an American academic travels to [[Italy]] at the time of the Byzantine invasion of the [[Ostrogoths]]. De Camp's time traveler, Martin Padway, is depicted as making permanent historical changes and implicitly forming a new time branch, thereby making the work an alternate history.\n\nTime travel as the cause of a [[point of divergence]] (POD), which can denote either the bifurcation of a historical timeline or a simple replacement of the future that existed before the time traveling event, has continued to be a popular theme. In Ward Moore's ''Bring the Jubilee'', the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the Confederacy has won the American Civil War; he travels backward through time, and brings about a Union victory in the Battle of Gettysburg.\n\nWhen a story's assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time's future rather than just the creation of an additional time line, the device of a \"time patrol\" is often used, most notably in [[Poul Anderson]]'s [[Poul Anderson#Time Patrol|\"Time Patrol\"]] collection\u2014where guardians race uptime and downtime to preserve the \"correct\" history. In the most celebrated of this series, ''[[Delenda Est]]'', the interference of time traveling outlaws causes [[Carthage]] to win the [[Second Punic War]] and destroy [[Rome]] with massive consequences for the present day.\n\nA more recent example is ''[[Making History (novel)|Making History]]'' by [[Stephen Fry]], in which a time machine is used to alter history so that [[Adolf Hitler]] was never born. This ironically results in a more competent leader of the Third Reich, resulting in the country's ascendancy and longevity in this altered timeline.\n\n===Cross-time stories===\nH.G. Wells' \"cross-time\" or \"many universes\" variant (see above) was fully developed by Murray Leinster in his 1934 short story \"Sidewise in Time\", in which sections of the Earth's surface begin changing places with their counterparts in alternate timelines.\n\n[[Fredric Brown]] employed this subgenre to satirize the science fiction pulps and their adolescent readers\u2014and fears of foreign invasion\u2014in the classic ''[[What Mad Universe]]'' (1949). In [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[Ring Around the Sun (novel)|Ring Around the Sun]]'' (1953), the hero ends up in an alternate earth of thick forests in which humanity never developed but a band of mutants is establishing a colony; the story line appears to frame the author's anxieties regarding [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Cold War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n====Paratime themes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Schroedingers cat film.svg|thumb|An illustration of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]], showing the branching of [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel]] universes according to a [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]]]\nIn the late 1940s and the 1950s, however, writers such as [[H. Beam Piper]], [[Sam Merwin, Jr.]] and [[Andre Norton]] wrote thrillers set in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] in which all alternate histories are co-existent and travel between them occurs via a technology involving portals and/or paratime capsules. These authors established the convention of a secret paratime trading empire that exploits and/or protects worlds lacking the paratime technology via a network of [[James Bond]]-style secret agents (Piper called them the \"[[paratime series|paratime police]]\").\n\nThis concept provided a convenient framing for packing a sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of historical alternatives (and even of timeline \"branches\") into a single novel, either via the hero chasing or being chased by the villain(s) through multiple worlds or (less artfully) via discussions between the paratime cops and their superiors (or between paratime agents and new recruits) regarding the histories of such worlds.\n\nThe paratime theme is sometimes used without the police; Poul Anderson dreamed up the Old Phoenix tavern as a nexus between alternate histories. A character from a modern American alternate history ''Operation Chaos'' can thus appear in the [[English Civil War]] setting of ''A Midsummer's Tempest''. In this context, the distinction between an alternate history and a parallel universe with some points in common but no common history may not be feasible, as the writer may not provide enough information to distinguish.\n\nParatime thrillers published in recent decades often cite the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] (first formulated by [[Hugh Everett III]] in 1957) to account for the differing worlds. Some science fiction writers interpret the splitting of worlds to depend on human decision-making and free will, while others rely on the [[butterfly effect]] from [[chaos theory]] to amplify random differences at the atomic or subatomic level into a [[macroscopic]] divergence at some specific point in history; either way, science fiction writers usually have all changes flow from a particular historical point of divergence (often abbreviated 'POD' by fans of the genre). Prior to Everett, science-fiction writers drew on higher dimensions and the speculations of [[P. D. Ouspensky]] to explain their characters' cross-time journeys.\n\n====Quantum theory of many worlds====\nWhile many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse, the \"many world\" theory would naturally involve many worlds, in fact a continually exploding array of universes. In quantum theory, new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event, and even if the writer uses human decisions, every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline. A writer's fictional multiverse may, in fact, preclude some decisions as humanly impossible, as when, in ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Night Watch]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]] depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen, has happened, nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife. When the writer explicitly maintains that ''all'' possible decisions are made in all possible ways, one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave, nor clever, nor skilled, but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route, take the stupid action, fumble the crucial activity, etc.; few writers focus on this idea, although it has been explored in stories such as [[Larry Niven]]'s story ''[[All the Myriad Ways#story|All the Myriad Ways]]'', where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import.\n\nIn any case, even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] to different infinite sets). The physicist [[David Deutsch]], a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that \"By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives. When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/taming-the-multiverse |title=Taming the Multiverse |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2015-11-14}}</ref> This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories, but a few writers have tried, such as [[Greg Egan]] in his short story ''The Infinite Assassin'', where an agent is trying to contain reality-scrambling \"whirlpools\" that form around users of a certain drug, and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves, attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences, he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves.\n\nMany writers\u2014perhaps the majority\u2014avoid the discussion entirely. In one novel of this type, H. Beam Piper's ''[[Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen]]'', a Pennsylvania State Police officer, who knows how to make gunpowder, is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors. The paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it, where the country ''will'' be overrun, but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed, remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved.\n\nThe cross-time theme was further developed in the 1960s by [[Keith Laumer]] in the first three volumes of his ''Imperium'' sequence, which would be completed in ''Zone Yellow'' (1990). Piper's politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by [[Michael Kurland]] and [[Jack Chalker]] in the 1980s; Chalker's ''[[G.O.D. Inc]]'' trilogy (1987\u201389), featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz, marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Kurland's ''[[Perchance (novel)|Perchance]]'' (1988), the first volume of the never-completed \"Chronicles of Elsewhen\", presents a multiverse of secretive cross-time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross-time travel, ranging from high-tech capsules to mutant powers. Harry Turtledove has launched the [[Crosstime Traffic]] series for teenagers featuring a variant of H. Beam Piper's paratime trading empire.\n\n====Rival paratime worlds====\nThe concept of a cross-time version of a world war, involving rival paratime empires, was developed in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s Change War series, starting with the [[Hugo Award]] winning ''[[The Big Time]]'' (1958); followed by [[Richard C. Meredith]]'s ''Timeliner'' trilogy in the 1970s, [[Michael McCollum]]'s ''A Greater Infinity'' (1982) and [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes']] ''Timeline Wars'' trilogy in the 1990s.\n\nSuch \"paratime\" stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next, providing a science fictional explanation\u2014or veneer\u2014for what is normally fantasy. [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''Doc Sidhe'' and ''Sidhe Devil'' take place between our world, the \"grim world\" and an alternate \"fair world\" where the Sidhe retreated to. Although technology is clearly present in both worlds, and the \"fair world\" parallels our history, about fifty years out of step, there is functional magic in the fair world. Even with such explanation, the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world, the more likely the story is to be labelled fantasy, as in Poul Anderson's \"House Rule\" and \"Loser's Night\". In both science fiction and fantasy, whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear. The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept, or may present the universe without explanation of its existence.\n\n=== Major writers explore alternate histories ===\nKeith Laumer's ''[[Worlds of the Imperium]]'' is one of the earliest alternate history novels: It was published by ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic Stories of the Imagination]]'' in 1961 in magazine form, and reprinted by [[Ace Books]] in 1962 as one half of an [[Ace Double]]. Besides our world. Laumer describes a world in which the [[American Revolution]] never happened, ruled by Britain; and a world ruled by a ruthless dictatorship.\n\n[[File:Man High Castle (TV Series) map.png|thumb|A map of the contiguous United States as depicted in [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|''The Man in the High Castle'']] TV series, based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'']]\n\nIn 1962, [[Philip K. Dick]] published ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'', an alternate history in which Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won World War II. This book contained an example of \"alternate-alternate\" history, in that one of its characters is the author of a book depicting a reality in which the Allies won the war, itself divergent from real-world history in several aspects.\n\nIt was followed by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'' (1969), a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]], and that borrows from Dick's idea of \"alternate-alternate\" history (the world of Nabokov's hero is wracked by rumors of a \"counter-earth\" that apparently is ours). Some critics believe that the references to a counter-earth suggest that the world portrayed in ''Ada'' is a delusion in the mind of the hero (another favorite theme of Dick's novels). Strikingly, the characters in ''Ada'' seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version, calling it \"Anti-Terra\" while its mythical twin is the real \"Terra.\" Not only history but science has followed a divergent path on Anti-Terra: it boasts all the same technology as our world, but all based on water instead of electricity, when a character in ''Ada'' makes a long-distance call, all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power.\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story ''[[What If\u2014]]'' is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television-like device. This idea can also be found in Asimov's 1955 novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''. In that novel, the \"Eternals\" can change the realities of the world, without people being aware of it.\n\n[[Guido Morselli]] described the defeat of Italy (and subsequently France) in World War I in his 1975 novel ''Past Conditional'' ({{lang|it|Contro-passato prossimo}}) where the static [[Italian Front (World War I)|Alpine front]] line which divided Italy from Austria during that war collapses when the Germans and the Austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance.\n\n[[Kingsley Amis]] set his 1976 novel ''[[The Alteration]]'' in the 20th century, but major events in the Reformation did not take place, and Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of New England. [[Martin Luther]] was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became Pope Germanian I.\n\n2002 saw [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] publish ''[[The Years of Rice and Salt]]'', starting at the [[point of divergence]] with [[Timur]] turning his army away from Europe, where the [[Black Death]] has killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of only a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 1405 (807 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]) to about AD 2045 (1467 AH). Rather than following the [[great man theory]] of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and major events, Robinson writes more about [[social history]], similar to the [[Annales School]] of history theory and [[Marxist historiography]], focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place.\n\n''[[The Plot Against America]]'' (2004) by [[Philip Roth]] looks at an America where [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is defeated in 1940 in his bid for a third term as President of the United States, and [[Charles Lindbergh]] is elected, leading to a U.S. that features increasing fascism and anti-Semitism.\n\n[[Michael Chabon]], occasionally an author of speculative fiction, contributed to the genre with his 2007 novel ''[[The Yiddish Policemen's Union]]''. This book explores a world in which the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world's Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement. The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the Yiddish-speaking semi-autonomous city state of [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. Stylistically, Chabon borrows heavily from the [[noir fiction|noir]] and detective fiction genres, while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture. Apart from the alternate history of the Jews and Israel, Chabon also plays with other common tropes of AH Fiction; in the book, Germany actually loses the war even ''harder'' than they did in reality, getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing a ground war (subverting the common \"what if Germany won WWII?\" trope).\n\n===Contemporary alternate history in popular literature===\n[[File:Draka42.png|thumb|The world of 1942, as depicted at the start of [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[The Domination]]'' series]]\n[[File:Timeline-191 WWI.png|thumb|World War I from [[Harry Turtledove]]'s [[Southern Victory]] (\"Timeline 191\") series]]\nThe late 1980s and the 1990s saw a boom in popular-fiction versions of alternate history, fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author [[Harry Turtledove]], as well as the development of the [[steampunk]] genre and two series of anthologies\u2014the ''What Might Have Been'' series edited by [[Gregory Benford]] and the ''Alternate ...'' series edited by [[Mike Resnick]]. This period also saw alternate history works by [[S. M. Stirling]], Kim Stanley Robinson, [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], [[Howard Waldrop]], and others.\n\nSince the late 1990s, [[Harry Turtledove]] has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title \"Master of Alternate History\" by some.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u00bb MORE |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6548135.html |title=Master of Alternate History - 4/7/2008 - Publishers Weekly |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518203009/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6548135.html |archivedate=May 18, 2008 }}</ref> His books include those of [[Southern Victory|Timeline 191]] (a.k.a. Southern Victory, also known as TL-191), in which, while the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[American Civil War]], the Union and [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] defeat the Entente Powers in the two \"Great War\"s of the 1910s and 1940s (with a Nazi-esque Confederate government attempting to exterminate its Black population), and the [[Worldwar series]], in which aliens invaded Earth during [[World War II]]. Other stories by Turtledove include ''[[A Different Flesh]]'', in which [[Americas|America]] was not colonized from [[Asia]] during the last [[ice age]]; ''[[In the Presence of Mine Enemies (2003 novel)|In the Presence of Mine Enemies]]'', in which the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] won World War II; and ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'', in which the [[Spanish Armada]] succeeded in conquering Britain in the [[Elizabethan era]], with [[William Shakespeare]] being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the Britons to rise up against their [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] conquerors. He also co-authored a book with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]], ''[[The Two Georges]]'', in which the United Kingdom retained the American colonies, with [[George Washington]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] making peace. He did a two-volume series in which the Japanese not only [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombed Pearl Harbor]] but also invaded and occupied the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nPerhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which [[Axis victory in World War II|the Nazis won World War Two]]. In some versions, the Nazis and/or [[Axis Powers]] conquer the entire world; in others, they conquer most of the world but a \"Fortress America\" exists under siege; while in others, there is a Nazi/Japanese [[Cold War]] comparable to the US/Soviet equivalent in 'our' timeline. ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' (1992), by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], is set in Europe following the Nazi victory. Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future or paratime travel, for instance [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]'s ''[[The Proteus Operation]]''. [[Norman Spinrad]] wrote ''[[The Iron Dream]]'' in 1972, which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by [[Adolf Hitler]] after fleeing from Europe to North America in the 1920s.\n\nIn [[Jo Walton]]'s \"Small Change\" series, the United Kingdom made peace with Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II, and fascism slowly strangled the UK. Former House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[William R. Forstchen]] have written a novel, ''[[1945 (Gingrich novel)|1945]]'', in which the U.S. defeated [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] but not [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in World War II, resulting in a Cold War with Germany rather than the Soviet Union. Gingrich and Forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel; instead, they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War, starting with ''[[Gettysburg: A Novel of the Civil War]]'', in which the Confederates win a victory at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] - however, after Lincoln responds by bringing Grant and his forces to the eastern theater, the Army of Northern Virginia is soon trapped and destroyed in Maryland, and the war ends within weeks. Also from that general era, [[Martin Cruz Smith]], in his first novel, posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in ''The Indians Won'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|first=Nicholas|last=Wroe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview15 |title=Profile: Martin Cruz Smith &#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-11-14}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' in 1980, [[L. Neil Smith]] wrote [[North American Confederacy|several novels]] that postulated the disintegration of the U.S. Federal Government after [[Albert Gallatin]] joins the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1794 and eventually leads to the creation of a [[libertarian utopia]].\n\nA recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches. These communities are transported from the present (or the near-future) to the past or to another time-line via a natural disaster, the action of technologically advanced aliens, or a human experiment gone wrong. [[S. M. Stirling]] wrote the ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'' trilogy, in which [[Nantucket]] Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to [[Bronze Age]] times to become the world's first superpower. In [[Eric Flint]]'s [[1632 series]], a small town in [[West Virginia]] is transported to 17th century central Europe and drastically changes the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which was then underway. [[John Birmingham]]'s ''[[Axis of Time]]'' trilogy deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from 2021 finds itself back in 1942 helping the Allies against the [[Empire of Japan]] and the Germans (and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons). Similarly, [[Robert Charles Wilson]]'s ''[[Mysterium (novel)|Mysterium]]'' depicts a failed U.S. government experiment which transports a small American town into an alternative version of the U.S. run by believers in a form of Christianity known as [[Gnosticism]], who are engaged in a bitter war with the \"Spanish\" in Mexico (the chief scientist at the laboratory where the experiment occurred is described as a Gnostic, and references to Christian Gnosticism appear repeatedly in the book).{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2013}}\n\n===In the contemporary fantasy genre===\n[[File:Henry II, Plantagenet Empire.png|thumb|The [[Angevin Empire]] in 1172, before the [[point of divergence]] of [[Randall Garrett]]'s \"[[Lord Darcy (character)|Lord Darcy]]\" series]]\nMany fantasies and science fantasies are set in a world that has a history somewhat similar to our own world, but with magic added. Some posit points of divergence, but some also feature magic altering history all along. One example of a universe that is in part historically recognizable but also obeys different physical laws is Poul Anderson's ''[[Three Hearts and Three Lions]]'' in which the [[Matter of France]] is history, and the fairy folk are real and powerful. A partly familiar European history for which the author provides a point of divergence is [[Randall Garrett]]'s \"[[Lord Darcy (character)|Lord Darcy]]\" series: a monk systemizing magic rather than science, so the use of [[digitalis|foxglove]] to treat heart disease is called superstition. The other great point of divergence in this timeline occurs in 1199, when [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] survives the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2lus-Chabrol|Siege of Chaluz]] and returns to England, making the [[Angevin Empire]] so strong it survives into the 20th century.\n\n''[[Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell]]'' takes place in an alternative version of England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed in Northumbria for over 300 years. In [[Patricia Wrede]]'s Regency fantasies, Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards, and in Poul Anderson's ''[[A Midsummer Tempest]]'' William Shakespeare is remembered as the Great Historian, with the novel itself taking place in the era of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with an alternate outcome for the [[English Civil War]] and an earlier [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' series by [[Orson Scott Card]] (a parallel to the life of [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]) takes place in an alternate America, beginning in the early 19th century. Prior to that time, a POD occurred: England, under the control of Oliver Cromwell, had banished \"makers\", or anyone else demonstrating \"knacks\" (an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats) to the North American continent. Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts, and counted on them as a part of their daily lives. The political division of the continent is considerably altered, with two large English colonies bookending a smaller \"American\" nation, one aligned with England, and the other governed by exiled [[Cavaliers]]. Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light: Ben Franklin is revered as the continent's finest \"maker\", George Washington was executed at the hands of an English army, and \"Tom\" Jefferson is the first president of \"Appalachia\", the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British.\n\nOn the other hand, when the \"Old Ones\" still manifest themselves in England in [[Keith Roberts]]'s ''[[Pavane (novel)|Pavane]]'', which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of [[Elizabeth I]] allowed the [[Spanish Armada]] to conquer England, the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible: the fairies really were present all along, in a secret history. Again, in the English Renaissance fantasy ''Armor of Light'' by [[Melissa Scott (writer)|Melissa Scott]] and Lisa A. Barnett, the magic used in the book, by Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and others, actually was practiced in the Renaissance; positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a POD, Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s surviving the [[Battle of Zutphen]] in 1586, and shortly thereafter saving the life of [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n\nMany works of fantasy posit a world in which known practitioners of magic were able to make it function, and where the consequences of such reality would not, in fact, disturb history to such an extent as to make it plainly alternate history. Many ambiguous alternate/secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre-Renaissance times, and may explicitly include a \"retreat\" from the world, which would explain the current absence of such phenomena.\n\nWhen the magical version of our world's history is set in contemporary times, the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and [[contemporary fantasy]], using in effect a form of secret history (as when [[Josepha Sherman]]'s ''Son of Darkness'' has an elf living in New York City, in disguise) on the other. In works such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''Magic, Incorporated'' where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and Poul Anderson's ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'' and its sequel ''[[Operation Luna]]'', where djinns are serious weapons of war\u2014with atomic bombs\u2014the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history\u2014although references in ''Operation Chaos'' to [[degaussing]] the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD. The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in 1901, resulting in the theory of \"rhea tics\". [[Henry Moseley]] applies this theory to \"degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces.\" This results in the suppression of [[ferromagnetism]] and the re-emergence of magic and magical creatures.\n\nAlternate history shades off into other [[fantasy subgenres]] when the use of actual, though altered, history and geography decreases, although a culture may still be clearly the original source; [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'' and its sequels take place in a [[fantasy world]], albeit one clearly based on China, and with allusions to actual Chinese history, such as [[Empress Wu of Zhou|the Empress Wu]]. [[Richard Garfinkle]]'s ''[[Celestial Matters]]'' incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek [[Aristotelian physics]], using them as if factual.\n\nA fantasy version of the paratime police was developed by children's writer [[Diana Wynne Jones]] in her ''[[Chrestomanci]]'' quartet (1977\u20131988), with wizards taking the place of high tech secret agents. Among the novels in this series, ''[[Witch Week]]'' stands out for its vivid depiction of a history alternate to that of Chrestomanci's own world rather than our own (and yet with a specific POD that turned it away from the \"normal\" history of most worlds visited by the wizard).\n\nTerry Pratchett's works include several references to alternate histories of [[Discworld]]. ''[[Men At Arms]]'' observes that in millions of universes, Edward d'Eath became an obsessive recluse rather than the instigator of the plot that he is in the novel. In ''[[Jingo (novel)|Jingo]]'', Vimes accidentally picks up a pocket organizer that should have gone down another leg of the Trousers of Time, and so can hear the organizer reporting on the deaths that would have occurred had his decision gone otherwise. Indeed, Discworld contains an equivalent of the Time Patrol in its [[History Monks]]. ''Night Watch'' revolves around a repair of history after a time traveller\u2019s murder of an important figure in Vimes's past. ''[[Thief of Time]]'' presents them functioning as a full-scale Time Patrol, ensuring that history occurs at all.\n\nAlternate history has long been a staple of Japanese speculative fiction with such authors as [[Futaro Yamada]] and [[Ry\u014d Hanmura]] writing novels set in recognizable historical settings with supernatural or science fiction elements present. In 1973, Ry\u014d Hanmura wrote ''[[Musubi no Yama Hiroku]]'' which recreated 400 years of Japan's history from the perspective of a secret magical family with psychic abilities. The novel has since come to be recognized as a masterpiece of Japanese speculative fiction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfwa.org/2011/09/top-ten-japan-all-time-best-sf-novels/ |title=Top Ten Japan All Time Best SF Novels |publisher=SFWA |date=2011-09-17 |accessdate=2015-11-14}}</ref> Twelve years later, author [[Hiroshi Aramata]] wrote the groundbreaking ''[[Teito Monogatari]]'' which reimagined the history of [[Tokyo]] across the 20th century in a world heavily influenced by the supernatural.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clute |first1=John |last2=Grant |first2=John |last3=Ashley |first3=Mike |last4=Hartwell |first4=David G. |last5=Westfahl |first5=Gary |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |date=1999 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0312198698 |page=515 }}</ref>\n\nThe TV show ''[[Sliders]]'' explores different possible alternate realities by having the protagonist \"slide\" into different parallel dimensions of the same planet Earth.\n\nThe two-part play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' contains alternate timelines set within the world of [[Harry Potter]].\n\nIn ''[[World of Winx]],'' the seven fairies- Bloom, Stella, Musa, Tecna, Flora, Aisha and Roxy- live on Earth, where humans are ignorant of the existence of fairies or belief in magic; much unlike the [[Winx Club (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''Winx Club'', where they had brought all magic back to Earth by releasing its terrestrial fairies.\n\n===Video games===\nFor the same reasons that this genre is explored by role-playing games, alternate history is also an intriguing backdrop for the storylines of many [[video game]]s. A famous example of an alternate history game is ''[[Command & Conquer: Red Alert]]''. Released in 1996, the game presents a point of divergence in 1946 where [[Albert Einstein]] goes back in time to prevent World War II from ever taking place by erasing [[Adolf Hitler]] from time after he is released from [[Landsberg Prison]] in 1924. He is successful in his mission, but in the process allows [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Soviet Union]] to become powerful enough to launch a massive campaign to conquer Europe.\n\nIn the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' series, the player guides a civilization from prehistory to the present day, creating radically altered versions of history on a long time-scale. Several scenarios recreate a particular period which becomes the \"point of divergence\" in an alternate history shaped by the player's actions. Popular examples in ''[[Civilization IV|Sid Meier's Civilization IV]]'' include ''Desert War'', set in the Mediterranean theatre of [[World War II]] and featuring scripted events tied to possible outcomes of battles; ''Broken Star'', set in a hypothetical Russian civil war in 2010; and ''[[Rhye's and Fall of Civilization]]'', an 'Earth simulator' designed to mirror a history as closely as possible but incorporating unpredictable elements to provide realistic alternate settings.\n\nIn some games such as the ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, events that were originally intended to represent the near future at the time the games were originally released later ended up becoming alternate histories in later entries in those franchises. For example, ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'' (1990), set in 1999, depicted a near future that ended up becoming an alternate history in ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' (1998). Likewise, ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (1996) and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' (1998), both set in 1998, depicted near-future events that had later become an alternative history by the time ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005) was released.\n\nIn the 2009 [[steampunk]] shooter, ''[[Damnation (video game)|Damnation]]'' is set on an alternate version of planet Earth, in the early part of the 20th century after the [[American Civil War]], which had spanned over several decades, where steam engines replace combustion engines. The game sees the protagonists fighting off a rich industrialist who wants to do away with both the Union and Confederacy in one swift movement and turn the United States of America into a country called the \"American Empire\" with a totalitarian dictatorship.\n\n[[File:Crimson skies map.png|thumb|A balkanized 1930s North America from the ''[[Crimson Skies]]'' franchise]]\n''[[Crimson Skies]]'' is one example of an alternate history spawning multiple interpretations in multiple genres. The stories and games in ''Crimson Skies'' take place in an alternate 1930s United States, where the nation crumbled into many hostile states following the effects of the [[Great Depression]], the [[World War I|Great War]], and [[Prohibition]]. With the road and railway system destroyed, commerce took to the skies, which led to the emergence of [[air pirate]] gangs who plunder the aerial commerce.\n\nThe game ''[[Freedom Fighters (video game)|Freedom Fighters]]'' portrays a situation similar to that of the movie ''[[Red Dawn]]'' and ''Red Alert 2'', though less comically than the latter. The point of divergence is during [[World War II]], where the [[Soviet Union]] develops an atomic bomb first and uses it on [[Berlin]]. With the balance of power and influence tipped in Russia's favor, history diverges; brief summaries at the beginning of the game inform the player of the Communist bloc's complete takeover of Europe by 1953, a different ending to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and the spread of Soviet influence into South America and Mexico.\n\nSimilarly, the 2007 video game ''[[World in Conflict]]'' is set in 1989, with the [[Soviet Union]] on the verge of collapse. The point of divergence is several months before the opening of the game, when [[Warsaw Pact]] forces staged a desperate invasion of Western Europe. As the game begins, a Soviet invasion force lands in [[Seattle]], taking advantage of the fact that most of the US military is in Europe.\n\nThe game ''[[Battlestations: Pacific]]'', released in 2008, offered in alternate history campaign for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], wherein Japan destroys all three carriers in the [[Battle of Midway]], which follows with a successful invasion of the island. Because of this, the United States lacked any sort of aerial power to fight the Japanese, and is continuously forced into the defense.\n\n''[[Turning Point: Fall of Liberty]]'', released in February 2008, is an alternate history [[first person shooter]] where [[Winston Churchill]] died in 1931 from being hit by a taxi cab. Because of this, [[Great Britain]] lacks the charismatic leader needed to keep the country together and [[Nazi Germany]] successfully conquers Great Britain via [[Operation Sea Lion]] in 1940. Germany later conquers the rest of Europe, North Africa and the [[Middle East]] while mass-producing their [[wunderwaffe]]. The [[Axis powers|Axis]] launch a surprise invasion of an isolationist United States' [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] in 1953, which forces the country to surrender and submit to a puppet government.\n\n[[File:Welcome To Fabulous NEW VEGAS.jpg|thumb|Promotional booth for ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' from [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX 2010]]]]\nAnother alternate history game involving Nazis is ''[[War Front: Turning Point]]'' in which Hitler died during the early days of World War II and thus, a much more effective leadership rose to power. Under the command of a new F\u00fchrer (who is referred to as \"Chancellor\", and his real name is never revealed), [[Operation Sealion]] succeeds and the Nazis successfully conquer Britain, sparking a cold war between the Allied Powers and Germany.\n\nThe [[Fallout (series)|''Fallout'' series]] of computer role-playing games is set in a divergent America, where history after World War II diverges from the real world to follow a [[retro-futuristic]] timeline. For example, [[fusion power]] was invented quite soon after the end of the war, but the [[transistor]] was never developed. The result was a future that has a 1950s 'World of Tomorrow' feel to it, with extremely high technology such as [[artificial intelligence]] implemented with [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves]] and other technologies now considered obsolete.\n\nMany game series by Swedish developer [[Paradox Interactive]] start off at a concise point in history, allowing the player to immerse in the role of a contemporary leader and alter the course of in-game history. The most prominent game with this setting is ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''.\n\n[[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

In this model the electron cloud of a multi-electron atom may be seen as being built up (in approximation) in an electron configuration that is a product of simpler [[hydrogen atom|hydrogen-like]] atomic orbitals. The repeating ''periodicity'' of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 [[Chemical element|elements]] within sections of the [[periodic table]] arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the quantum number {{mvar|n|size=120%}}, particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the [[Aufbau principle|order]] in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = [Ar]4''s''<sup>1</sup>3''d''<sup>5</sup> and Cr<sup>2+</sup> = [Ar]3''d''<sup>4</sup>) can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.\n\n[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Atomic orbitals of the [[electron]] in a hydrogen atom at different energy levels.  The probability of finding the electron is given by the color, as shown in the key at upper right.]]\n\n== Electron properties ==\nWith the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and experimental findings (such as the two slit diffraction of electrons), it was found that the orbiting electrons around a nucleus could not be fully described as particles, but needed to be explained by the [[Wave\u2013particle duality|wave-particle duality]]. In this sense, the electrons have the following properties:\n\n'''Wave-like properties:'''\n# The electrons do not orbit the nucleus in the manner of a planet orbiting the sun, but instead exist as  [[standing wave]]s. Thus the lowest possible energy an electron can take is similar to the  [[fundamental frequency]] of a wave on a string. Higher energy states are similar to [[harmonics]] of that fundamental frequency.\n# The electrons are never in a single point location, although the probability of interacting with the electron at a single point can be found from the wave function of the electron.  The charge on the electron acts like it is smeared out in space in a continuous distribution, proportional at any point to the squared magnitude of the electron's [[wave function]].\n\n'''Particle-like properties:'''\n# The number of electrons orbiting the nucleus can only be an integer.\n# Electrons jump between orbitals like particles. For example, if a single [[photon]] strikes the electrons, only a single electron changes states in response to the photon.\n# The electrons retain particle-like properties such as: each wave state has the same electrical charge as its electron particle. Each wave state has a single discrete spin (spin up or spin down) depending on its [[Quantum superposition|superposition]].\n\nThus, despite the popular analogy to planets revolving around the Sun, electrons cannot be described simply as solid particles. In addition, atomic orbitals do not closely resemble a planet's elliptical path in ordinary atoms. A more accurate analogy might be that of a large and often oddly shaped \"atmosphere\" (the electron), distributed around a relatively tiny planet (the atomic nucleus). Atomic orbitals exactly describe the shape of this \"atmosphere\" only when a single electron is present in an atom. When more electrons are added to a single atom, the additional electrons tend to more evenly fill in a volume of space around the nucleus so that the resulting collection (sometimes termed the atom's \"electron cloud\"<ref>{{cite book| title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics -The Definitive Edition, Vol 1 lect 6| page=11| year=2006| publisher= Pearson PLC, Addison Wesley|isbn =978-0-8053-9046-9|last1= Feynman|first1= Richard|last2= Leighton|first2=Robert B.|first3=Matthew|last3=Sands}}</ref>) tends toward a generally spherical zone of probability describing the electron's location, because of the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\n=== Formal quantum mechanical definition ===\nAtomic orbitals may be defined more precisely in formal [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] language. Specifically, in quantum mechanics, the state of an atom, i.e., an [[eigenstate]] of the atomic [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], is approximated by an expansion (see [[configuration interaction]] expansion and [[basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]) into [[linear combination]]s of anti-symmetrized products ([[Slater determinant]]s) of one-electron functions. The spatial components of these one-electron functions are called atomic orbitals. (When one considers also their [[spin (physics)|spin]] component, one speaks of '''atomic spin orbitals'''.) A state is actually a function of the coordinates of all the electrons, so that their motion is correlated, but this is often approximated by this [[Nuclear structure#The independent-particle model|independent-particle model]] of products of single electron wave functions.<ref>[[Roger Penrose]], ''[[The Road to Reality]]''</ref> (The [[London dispersion force]], for example, depends on the correlations of the motion of the electrons.)\n\nIn [[atomic physics]], the [[atomic spectral line]]s correspond to transitions ([[Atomic electron transition|quantum leaps]]) between [[quantum state]]s of an atom. These states are labeled by a set of [[quantum number]]s summarized in the [[term symbol]] and usually associated with particular electron configurations, i.e., by occupation schemes of atomic orbitals (for example, 1s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2s<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;2p<sup>6</sup> for the ground state of [[neon]]\u2014term symbol: <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>).\n\nThis notation means that the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the [[configuration interaction]] expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given [[Atomic electron transition|transition]]. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has to keep in mind that electrons are [[fermion]]s ruled by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes happens that the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when [[electron correlation]] is large.\n\nFundamentally, an atomic orbital is a one-electron wave function, even though most electrons do not exist in one-electron atoms, and so the one-electron view is an approximation. When thinking about orbitals, we are often given an orbital visualization heavily influenced by the [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] approximation, which is one way to reduce the complexities of [[molecular orbital theory]].\n\n=== Types of orbitals ===\n[[File:Atomic-orbital-clouds spdf m0.png|thumb|300px|3D views of some [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like]] atomic orbitals showing probability density and phase ('''g''' orbitals and higher are not shown)]]\nAtomic orbitals can be the hydrogen-like \"orbitals\" which are exact solutions to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for a [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like \"atom\"]] (i.e., an atom with one electron). Alternatively, atomic orbitals refer to functions that depend on the coordinates of one electron (i.e., orbitals) but are used as starting points for approximating wave functions that depend on the simultaneous coordinates of all the electrons in an atom or molecule. The [[coordinate system]]s chosen for atomic orbitals are usually [[spherical coordinates]] {{math|(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} in atoms and [[Cartesian coordinate system|cartesians]] {{math|(x,\u2009y,\u2009z)}} in polyatomic molecules. The advantage of spherical coordinates (for atoms) is that an orbital wave function is a product of three factors each dependent on a single coordinate: {{math|1=\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6) = ''R''(''r'')\u2009\u0398(\u03b8)\u2009\u03a6(\u03c6)}}. The angular factors of atomic orbitals {{math|1=\u0398(\u03b8)\u2009\u03a6(\u03c6)}} generate s, p, d, etc. functions as [[Spherical harmonics#Real form|real combinations]] of [[spherical harmonics]] {{math|''Y''<sub>''\u2113m''</sub>(\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} (where {{mvar|\u2113}} and {{mvar|m}} are quantum numbers). There are typically three mathematical forms for the radial functions&nbsp;{{math|''R''(''r'')}} which can be chosen as a starting point for the calculation of the properties of atoms and molecules with many electrons:\n\n# The ''hydrogen-like atomic orbitals'' are derived from the exact solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation for one electron and a nucleus, for a [[hydrogen-like atom]]. The part of the function that depends on the distance ''r'' from the nucleus has [[node (physics)|nodes]] (radial nodes) and decays as [[exponential function|{{math|''e''<sup>\u2212(constant \u00d7 distance)</sup>}}]].\n# The [[Slater-type orbital]] (STO) is a form without radial nodes but decays from the nucleus as does the hydrogen-like orbital.\n# The form of the [[Gaussian orbital|Gaussian type orbital]] (Gaussians) has no radial nodes and decays as <math> e^{-\\alpha r^2} </math>.\n\nAlthough hydrogen-like orbitals are still used as pedagogical tools, the advent of computers has made STOs preferable for atoms and diatomic molecules since combinations of STOs can replace the nodes in hydrogen-like atomic orbital. Gaussians are typically used in molecules with three or more atoms. Although not as accurate by themselves as STOs, combinations of many Gaussians can attain the accuracy of hydrogen-like orbitals.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Atomic theory}}\n\nThe term \"orbital\" was coined by [[Robert Mulliken]] in 1932 as an abbreviation for ''one-electron orbital wave function''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mulliken | first=Robert S. | title=Electronic Structures of Polyatomic Molecules and Valence.

The newly discovered structure within atoms tempted many to imagine how the atom's constituent parts might interact with each other. Thomson theorized that multiple electrons revolved in orbit-like rings within a positively charged jelly-like substance,<ref>{{cite journal|first=J.

Few people took notice of Nagaoka's work at the time,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rhodes| first = Richard| title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb| publisher = Simon & Schuster| year = 1995| pages = 50\u201351| url = https://books.google.com/?id=aSgFMMNQ6G4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=making+of+the+atomic+bomb#v=onepage&q&f=false| isbn = 978-0-684-81378-3}}</ref> and Nagaoka himself recognized a fundamental defect in the theory even at its conception, namely that a classical charged object cannot sustain orbital motion because it is accelerating and therefore loses energy due to electromagnetic radiation.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Hantaro |last=Nagaoka| title=Kinetics of a System of Particles illustrating the Line and the Band Spectrum and the Phenomena of Radioactivity| journal=Philosophical Magazine |date=May 1904|volume=7|issue=41|page=446|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Nagaoka-1904.html | doi=10.1080/14786440409463141}}</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Saturnian model]] turned out to have more in common with modern theory than any of its contemporaries.\n\n=== Bohr atom ===\nIn 1909, [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that the bulk of the atomic mass was tightly condensed into a nucleus, which was also found to be positively charged. It became clear from his analysis in 1911 that the plum pudding model could not explain atomic structure. In 1913 as Rutherford's post-doctoral student, [[Niels Bohr]] proposed a new model of the atom, wherein electrons orbited the nucleus with classical periods, but were only permitted to have discrete values of angular momentum, quantized in units [[reduced Planck constant|''h''/2\u03c0]].<ref name=\"Bohr 1913 476\" /> This constraint automatically permitted only certain values of electron energies. The [[Bohr model]] of the atom fixed the problem of energy loss from radiation from a ground state (by declaring that there was no state below this), and more importantly explained the origin of spectral lines.\n\n[[File:Bohr-atom-PAR.svg|thumb|The [[Bohr model|Rutherford\u2013Bohr model]] of the hydrogen atom.]]\nAfter Bohr's use of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] to relate energy levels in atoms with the wavelength of emitted light, the connection between the structure of electrons in atoms and the [[Emission spectra|emission]] and [[absorption spectra]] of atoms became an increasingly useful tool in the understanding of electrons in atoms. The most prominent feature of emission and absorption spectra (known experimentally since the middle of the 19th century), was that these atomic spectra contained discrete lines. The significance of the Bohr model was that it related the lines in emission and absorption spectra to the energy differences between the orbits that electrons could take around an atom. This was, however, ''not'' achieved by Bohr through giving the electrons some kind of wave-like properties, since the idea that electrons could behave as [[matter waves]] was not suggested until eleven years later. Still, the Bohr model's use of quantized angular momenta and therefore quantized energy levels was a significant step towards the understanding of electrons in atoms, and also a significant step towards the development of [[quantum mechanics]] in suggesting that quantized restraints must account for all discontinuous energy levels and spectra in atoms.\n\nWith [[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie]]'s suggestion of the existence of electron matter waves in 1924, and for a short time before the full 1926 [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] treatment of [[hydrogen-like atom]], a Bohr electron \"wavelength\" could be seen to be a function of its momentum, and thus a Bohr orbiting electron was seen to orbit in a circle at a multiple of its half-wavelength (this physically incorrect Bohr model is still often taught to beginning students). The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.\n\nThe Bohr model was able to explain the emission and absorption spectra of [[hydrogen]]. The energies of electrons in the ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, etc. states in the Bohr model match those of current physics. However, this did not explain similarities between different atoms, as expressed by the periodic table, such as the fact that [[helium]] (two electrons), neon (10 electrons), and [[argon]] (18 electrons) exhibit similar chemical inertness. Modern [[quantum mechanics]] explains this in terms of [[electron shell]]s and subshells which can each hold a number of electrons determined by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. Thus the ''n'' = 1 state can hold one or two electrons, while the ''n'' = 2 state can hold up to eight electrons in 2s and 2p subshells. In helium, all ''n'' = 1 states are fully occupied; the same for ''n'' = 1 and ''n'' = 2 in neon. In argon the 3s and 3p subshells are similarly fully occupied by eight electrons; quantum mechanics also allows a 3d subshell but this is at higher energy than the 3s and 3p in argon (contrary to the situation in the hydrogen atom) and remains empty.\n\n=== Modern conceptions and connections to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle ===\nImmediately after [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] discovered his [[uncertainty principle]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heisenberg| first=W.|title=\u00dcber den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik A]] |date=March 1927| volume=43 | pages=172\u2013198|doi=10.1007/BF01397280|bibcode = 1927ZPhy...43..172H| issue=3\u20134}}</ref> [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] noted that the existence of any sort of [[wave packet]] implies uncertainty in the wave frequency and wavelength, since a spread of frequencies is needed to create the packet itself.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bohr | first=Niels| title=The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory|journal=Nature |date=April 1928| volume=121 | pages=580\u2013590|doi=10.1038/121580a0 |bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B| issue=3050 }}</ref> In quantum mechanics, where all particle momenta are associated with waves, it is the formation of such a wave packet which localizes the wave, and thus the particle, in space. In states where a quantum mechanical particle is bound, it must be localized as a wave packet, and the existence of the packet and its minimum size implies a spread and minimal value in particle wavelength, and thus also momentum and energy. In quantum mechanics, as a particle is localized to a smaller region in space, the associated compressed wave packet requires a larger and larger range of momenta, and thus larger kinetic energy. Thus the binding energy to contain or trap a particle in a smaller region of space increases without bound as the region of space grows smaller. Particles cannot be restricted to a geometric point in space, since this would require an infinite particle momentum.\n\nIn chemistry, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]], [[Linus Pauling|Pauling]], [[Robert S. Mulliken|Mulliken]] and others noted that the consequence of Heisenberg's relation was that the electron, as a wave packet, could not be considered to have an exact location in its orbital. [[Max Born]] suggested that the electron's position needed to be described by a [[probability distribution]] which was connected with finding the electron at some point in the wave-function which described its associated wave packet. The new quantum mechanics did not give exact results, but only the probabilities for the occurrence of a variety of possible such results. Heisenberg held that the path of a moving particle has no meaning if we cannot observe it, as we cannot with electrons in an atom.\n\nIn the quantum picture of Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger and others, the Bohr atom number&nbsp;''n'' for each orbital became known as an ''n-sphere''{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} in a three dimensional atom and was pictured as the mean energy of the probability cloud of the electron's wave packet which surrounded the atom.\n\n== Orbital names ==\n===Orbital notation===\nOrbitals are given names are usually given in the form:\n:<math>X \\, \\mathrm{type}^y \\ </math>\nwhere ''X'' is the energy level corresponding to the [[principal quantum number]] {{mvar|n}}, '''type''' is a lower-case letter denoting the shape or [[Electron shell#Subshells|subshell]] of the orbital and it corresponds to the [[angular quantum number]]&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}}, and {{mvar|y}} is the number of electrons in that orbital.\n\nFor example, the orbital 1s<sup>2</sup> (pronounced as the individual numbers and letters: \"one ess two\") has two electrons and is the lowest energy level ({{math|1=''n'' = 1}}) and has an angular quantum number of {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, denoted as s.\n\n===X-ray notation===\n{{main|X-ray notation}}\nThere is also another, less common system still used in X-ray science known as [[X-ray notation]], which is a continuation of the notations used before orbital theory was well understood. In this system, the principal quantum number is given a letter associated with it. For {{math|1=''n'' = 1,\u20092,\u20093,\u20094,\u20095,\u2009\u2026}}, the letters associated with those numbers are K, L, M, N, O, \u2026 respectively.\n\n== Hydrogen-like orbitals ==\n{{Main|Hydrogen-like atom}}\n\nThe simplest atomic orbitals are those that are calculated for systems with a single electron, such as the [[hydrogen atom]]. An atom of any other element [[ion]]ized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the [[eigenstates]] of the [[Hamiltonian operator]] for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals are products of a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see [[hydrogen atom]]).\n\nFor atoms with two or more electrons, the governing equations can only be solved with the use of methods of iterative approximation. Orbitals of multi-electron atoms are ''qualitatively'' similar to those of hydrogen, and in the simplest models, they are taken to have the same form. For more rigorous and precise analysis, numerical approximations must be used.\n\nA given (hydrogen-like) atomic orbital is identified by unique values of three quantum numbers: [[Principal quantum number|{{mvar|n|size=120%}}]], [[Azimuthal quantum number|{{mvar|\u2113|size=120%}}]], and [[magnetic quantum number|{{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>|size=120%}}]]. The rules restricting the values of the quantum numbers, and their energies (see below), explain the electron configuration of the atoms and the [[periodic table]].\n\nThe stationary states ([[quantum state]]s) of the hydrogen-like atoms are its atomic orbitals.{{Clarify|date=November 2011|hydrogen-like atoms and orbitals}} However, in general, an electron's behavior is not fully described by a single orbital. Electron states are best represented by time-depending \"mixtures\" ([[linear combination]]s) of multiple orbitals. See [[Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method]].\n\nThe quantum number {{mvar|n}} first appeared in the [[Bohr model]] where it determines the radius of each circular electron orbit. In modern quantum mechanics however, {{mvar|n}} determines the mean distance of the electron from the nucleus; all electrons with the same value of ''n'' lie at the same average distance. For this reason, orbitals with the same value of ''n'' are said to comprise a \"[[electron shell|shell]]\". Orbitals with the same value of ''n'' and also the same value of&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}} are even more closely related, and are said to comprise a \"[[electron subshell|subshell]]\".\n\n== Quantum numbers ==\n{{Main|Quantum number}}\n\nBecause of the quantum mechanical nature of the electrons around a nucleus, atomic orbitals can be uniquely defined by a set of integers known as quantum numbers. These quantum numbers only occur in certain combinations of values, and their physical interpretation changes depending on whether real or complex versions of the atomic orbitals are employed.\n\n=== Complex orbitals ===\nIn physics, the most common orbital descriptions are based on the solutions to the hydrogen atom, where orbitals are given by the product between a radial function and a pure spherical harmonic. The quantum numbers, together with the rules governing their possible values, are as follows:\n\nThe [[principal quantum number]] {{mvar|n}} describes the energy of the electron and is always a [[positive integer]]. In fact, it can be any positive integer, but for reasons discussed below, large numbers are seldom encountered. Each atom has, in general, many orbitals associated with each value of ''n''; these orbitals together are sometimes called ''[[electron shells]]''.\n\nThe [[azimuthal quantum number]] {{mvar|\u2113}} describes the orbital angular momentum of each electron and is a non-negative integer. Within a shell where {{mvar|n}} is some integer {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}, {{mvar|\u2113}} ranges across all (integer) values satisfying the relation <math>0 \\le \\ell \\le n_0-1</math>. For instance, the {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and the {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}&nbsp;shell has only orbitals with <math>\\ell=0</math>, and <math>\\ell=1</math>. The set of orbitals associated with a particular value of&nbsp;{{mvar|\u2113}} are sometimes collectively called a ''subshell''.\n\nThe [[magnetic quantum number]], <math>m_\\ell</math>, describes the magnetic moment of an electron in an arbitrary direction, and is also always an integer. Within a subshell where <math>\\ell</math> is some integer <math>\\ell_0</math>, <math>m_\\ell</math> ranges thus: <math>-\\ell_0 \\le m_\\ell \\le \\ell_0</math>.\n\nThe above results may be summarized in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell, and lists the values of <math>m_\\ell</math> available in that subshell. Empty cells represent subshells that do not exist.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}\n! {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 1}}\n! {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 2}}\n! {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 3}}\n! {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 4}}\n! \u2026\n|-\n! {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}\n| <math>m_\\ell=0</math>\n| || || || ||\n|-\n! {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}\n| 0 || \u22121, 0, 1\n| || || ||\n|-\n! {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}\n| 0 || \u22121, 0, 1 || \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2\n| || ||\n|-\n! {{math|1=''n'' = 4}}\n| 0 || \u22121, 0, 1 || \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2 || \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3\n| ||\n|-\n! {{math|1=''n'' = 5}}\n| 0 || \u22121, 0, 1 || \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2 || \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3 || \u22124, \u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\n|\n|-\n! \u2026\n| \u2026 || \u2026 || \u2026 || \u2026 || \u2026 || \u2026\n|}\n\nSubshells are usually identified by their <math>n</math>- and <math>\\ell</math>-values. <math>n</math> is represented by its numerical value, but <math>\\ell</math> is represented by a letter as follows: 0 is represented by 's', 1 by 'p', 2 by 'd', 3 by 'f', and 4 by 'g'. For instance, one may speak of the subshell with <math>n=2</math> and <math>\\ell=0</math> as a '2s subshell'.\n\nEach electron also has a [[spin quantum number]], '''s''', which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number '''s''' can be +{{sfrac|1|2}} or \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nThe [[Pauli exclusion principle]] states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same values of all four quantum numbers. If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three quantum numbers, (n, l, m), these two electrons must differ in their spin.\n\nThe above conventions imply a preferred axis (for example, the ''z'' direction in Cartesian coordinates), and they also imply a preferred direction along this preferred axis. Otherwise there would be no sense in distinguishing {{math|1=''m'' = +1}} from {{math|1=''m'' = \u22121}}. As such, the model is most useful when applied to physical systems that share these symmetries. The [[Stern\u2013Gerlach experiment]] \u2014 where an atom is exposed to a magnetic field \u2014 provides one such example.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gerlach |first=W. |last2=Stern |first2=O. |title=Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms|journal=[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]|volume=9|pages=353\u2013355|year=1922|doi=10.1007/BF01326984|bibcode = 1922ZPhy....9..353G }}</ref>\n\n=== Real orbitals ===\n[[Image:Orbital p1-px animation.gif|thumb|220px|Animation of continuously varying superpositions between the <math>p_1</math> and the <math>p_x</math> orbitals.]]\nAn atom that is embedded in a crystalline solid feels multiple preferred axes, but often no preferred direction. Instead of building atomic orbitals out of the product of radial functions and a single [[spherical harmonic]], linear combinations of spherical harmonics are typically used, designed so that the imaginary part of the spherical harmonics cancel out. These '''real orbitals''' are the building blocks most commonly shown in orbital visualizations.\n\nIn the real hydrogen-like orbitals, for example, {{mvar|n}} and {{mvar|\u2113}} have the same interpretation and significance as their complex counterparts, but {{mvar|m}} is no longer a good quantum number (though its absolute value is).

The diagrams cannot show the entire region where an electron can be found, since according to quantum mechanics there is a non-zero probability of finding the electron (almost) anywhere in space. Instead the diagrams are approximate representations of boundary or [[contour line|contour surfaces]] where the probability density {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} has a constant value, chosen so that there is a certain probability (for example 90%) of finding the electron within the contour. Although {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} as the square of an [[absolute value]] is everywhere non-negative, the sign of the [[wave function]] {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} is often indicated in each subregion of the orbital picture.\n\nSometimes the {{math|\u03c8}} function will be graphed to show its phases, rather than the {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} which shows probability density but has no phases (which have been lost in the process of taking the absolute value, since {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} is a complex number). {{math|{{!}}\u2009\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)\u2009{{!}}<sup>2</sup>}} orbital graphs tend to have less spherical, thinner lobes than {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} graphs, but have the same number of lobes in the same places, and otherwise are recognizable. This article, in order to show wave function phases, shows mostly {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}} graphs.\n\nThe lobes can be viewed as [[standing wave]] [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] patterns between the two counter rotating, ring resonant [[travelling wave]] \"{{mvar|m}}\" and \"{{math|\u2212''m''}}\" modes, with the projection of the orbital onto the xy plane having a resonant \"{{mvar|m}}\" wavelengths around the circumference. Though rarely depicted the travelling wave solutions can be viewed as rotating banded tori, with the bands representing phase information. For each {{mvar|m}} there are two standing wave solutions {{math|\u27e8''m''\u27e9+\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9}} and {{math|\u27e8''m''\u27e9\u2212\u27e8\u2212''m''\u27e9}}. For the case where {{math|1=''m'' = 0}} the orbital is vertical, counter rotating information is unknown, and the orbital is z-axis symmetric. For the case where {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}} there are no counter rotating modes.  There are only radial modes and the shape is spherically symmetric.  For any given {{mvar|n}}, the smaller {{mvar|\u2113}} is, the more radial nodes there are.  Loosely speaking ''n'' is energy, {{mvar|\u2113}} is analogous to [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], and {{mvar|m}} is orientation.  In the classical case, a ring resonant travelling wave, for example in a circular transmission line, unless actively forced, will spontaneously decay into a ring resonant standing wave because reflections will build up over time at even the smallest imperfection or discontinuity.\n\nGenerally speaking, the number {{mvar|n}} determines the size and energy of the orbital for a given nucleus: as {{mvar|n}} increases, the size of the orbital increases. When comparing different elements, the higher nuclear charge {{mvar|Z}} of heavier elements causes their orbitals to contract by comparison to lighter ones, so that the overall size of the whole atom remains very roughly constant, even as the number of electrons in heavier elements (higher {{mvar|Z}}) increases.\n[[File:Sr core-electron orbitals for Wiki.jpg|thumb|Experimentally imaged 1''s'' and 2''p'' core-electron orbitals of Sr, including the effects of atomic thermal vibrations and excitation broadening, retrieved from energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).<ref name=\"Jeong 165140\">{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Jong Seok|last2=Odlyzko|first2=Michael L.|last3=Xu|first3=Peng|last4=Jalan|first4=Bharat|last5=Mkhoyan|first5=K.

However, since some orbitals are described by equations in [[complex number]]s, the shape sometimes depends on {{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>}} also. Together, the whole set of orbitals for a given {{mvar|\u2113}} and {{mvar|n}} fill space as symmetrically as possible, though with increasingly complex sets of lobes and nodes.\n\nThe single s-orbitals (<math>\\ell=0</math>) are shaped like spheres. For {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} it is roughly a [[ball (mathematics)|solid ball]] (it is most dense at the center and fades exponentially outwardly), but for {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the \"wave-structure\" is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all {{mvar|n}} numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) at the center of the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node ''at'' the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort to experimentally image the 1''s'' and 2''p'' orbitials in a SrTiO<sub>3</sub> crystal using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.<ref name=\"Jeong 165140\" /> Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).\n\nThe shapes of p, d and f-orbitals are described verbally here and shown graphically in the ''Orbitals table'' below. The three p-orbitals for {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} have the form of two [[ellipsoid]]s with a [[point of tangency]] at the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (the two-lobed shape is sometimes referred to as a \"[[dumbbell]]\"\u2014there are two lobes pointing in opposite directions from each other). The three p-orbitals in each [[Electron shell|shell]] are oriented at right angles to each other, as determined by their respective linear combination of values of&nbsp;{{mvar|m<sub>\u2113</sub>}}. The overall result is a lobe pointing along each direction of the primary axes.\n\nFour of the five d-orbitals for {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} look similar, each with four pear-shaped lobes, each lobe tangent at right angles to two others, and the centers of all four lying in one plane. Three of these planes are the xy-, xz-, and yz-planes\u2014the lobes are between the pairs of primary axes\u2014and the fourth has the centres along the x and y axes themselves. The fifth and final d-orbital consists of three regions of high probability density: a [[torus]] with two pear-shaped regions placed symmetrically on its z axis. The overall total of 18 directional lobes point in every primary axis direction and between every pair.\n\nThere are seven f-orbitals, each with shapes more complex than those of the d-orbitals.\n\nAdditionally, as is the case with the s orbitals, individual p, d, f and g orbitals with {{mvar|n}} values higher than the lowest possible value, exhibit an additional radial node structure which is reminiscent of harmonic waves of the same type, as compared with the lowest (or fundamental) mode of the wave. As with s orbitals, this phenomenon provides p, d, f, and g orbitals at the next higher possible value of {{mvar|n}} (for example, 3p orbitals vs. the fundamental 2p), an additional node in each lobe.

L.}}</ref> To see the analogy, the mean vibrational displacement of each bit of drum membrane from the equilibrium point over many cycles (a measure of average drum membrane velocity and momentum at that point) must be considered relative to that point's distance from the center of the drum head. If this displacement is taken as being analogous to the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus, then it will be seen that the many modes of the vibrating disk form patterns that trace the various shapes of atomic orbitals. The basic reason for this correspondence lies in the fact that the distribution of kinetic energy and momentum in a matter-wave is predictive of where the particle associated with the wave will be. That is, the probability of finding an electron at a given place is also a function of the electron's average momentum at that point, since high electron momentum at a given position tends to \"localize\" the electron in that position, via the properties of electron wave-packets (see the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for details of the mechanism).\n\nThis relationship means that certain key features can be observed in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), it can be seen that the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the [[antinode]] in all '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.\n\nA mental \"planetary orbit\" picture closest to the behavior of electrons in '''s'''&nbsp;orbitals, all of which have no angular momentum, might perhaps be that of a [[Keplerian orbit]] with the [[orbital eccentricity]] of 1 but a finite major axis, not physically possible (because [[particle]]s were to collide), but can be imagined as a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of orbits with equal major axes but increasing eccentricity.<!-- could somebody make an illustration? -->\n\nBelow, a number of drum membrane vibration modes and the respective wave functions of the hydrogen atom are shown. A correspondence can be considered where the wave functions of a vibrating drum head are for a two-coordinate system {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8)}} and the wave functions for a vibrating sphere are three-coordinate {{math|\u03c8(''r'',\u2009\u03b8,\u2009\u03c6)}}.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"s-type drum modes and wave functions\" widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode01.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{01}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode02.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{02}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode03.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{03}</math>\nFile:Phi 1s.gif|Wave function of 1s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=2 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 2s.gif|Wave function of 2s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3s.gif|Wave function of 3s orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\nNone of the other sets of modes in a drum membrane have a central antinode, and in all of them the center of the drum does not move. These correspond to a node at the nucleus for all non-'''s''' orbitals in an atom. These orbitals all have some angular momentum, and in the planetary model, they correspond to particles in orbit with eccentricity less than 1.0, so that they do not pass straight through the center of the primary body, but keep somewhat away from it.\n\nIn addition, the drum modes analogous to '''p''' and '''d''' modes in an atom show spatial irregularity along the different radial directions from the center of the drum, whereas all of the modes analogous to '''s'''&nbsp;modes are perfectly symmetrical in radial direction. The non radial-symmetry properties of non-'''s''' orbitals are necessary to localize a particle with angular momentum and a wave nature in an orbital where it must tend to stay away from the central attraction force, since any particle localized at the point of central attraction could have no angular momentum. For these modes, waves in the drum head tend to avoid the central point. Such features again emphasize that the shapes of atomic orbitals are a direct consequence of the wave nature of electrons.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" caption=\"p-type drum modes and wave functions\" widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode11.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{11}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode12.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{12}</math>\nFile:Drum vibration mode13.gif|Drum mode <math>u_{13}</math>\nFile:Phi 2p.gif|Wave function of 2p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=10 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 3p.gif|Wave function of 3p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=20 a_0</math>)\nFile:Phi 4p.gif|Wave function of 4p orbital (real part, 2D-cut, <math>r_{max}=25 a_0</math>)\n</gallery>\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\" perrow=\"3\" widths=\"200px\" caption=\"d-type drum modes\">\nFile:Drum vibration mode21.gif|Mode <math>u_{21}</math> (3d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode22.gif|Mode <math>u_{22}</math> (4d orbital)\nFile:Drum vibration mode23.gif|Mode <math>u_{23}</math> (5d orbital)\n</gallery>\n\n== Orbital energy ==\n{{Main|Electron shell}}\nIn atoms with a single electron ([[hydrogen-like atom]]s), the energy of an orbital (and, consequently, of any electrons in the orbital) is determined mainly by <math>n</math>. The <math>n=1</math> orbital has the lowest possible energy in the atom. Each successively higher value of <math>n</math> has a higher level of energy, but the difference decreases as <math>n</math> increases. For high <math>n</math>, the level of energy becomes so high that the electron can easily escape from the atom. In single electron atoms, all levels with different <math>\\ell</math> within a given <math>n</math> are degenerate in the Schr\u00f6dinger approximation, and have the same energy. This approximation is broken to a slight extent in the solution to the Dirac equation (where the energy depends on {{mvar|n}} and another quantum number {{mvar|j}}), and by the effect of the magnetic field of the nucleus and [[quantum electrodynamics]] effects. The latter induce tiny binding energy differences especially for '''s'''&nbsp;electrons that go nearer the nucleus, since these feel a very slightly different nuclear charge, even in one-electron atoms; see [[Lamb shift]].\n\nIn atoms with multiple electrons, the energy of an electron depends not only on the intrinsic properties of its orbital, but also on its interactions with the other electrons. These interactions depend on the detail of its spatial probability distribution, and so the [[energy level]]s of orbitals depend not only on <math>n</math> but also on <math>\\ell</math>. Higher values of <math>\\ell</math> are associated with higher values of energy; for instance, the 2p state is higher than the 2s state. When <math>\\ell = 2</math>, the increase in energy of the orbital becomes so large as to push the energy of orbital above the energy of the s-orbital in the next higher shell; when <math>\\ell = 3</math> the energy is pushed into the shell two steps higher. The filling of the 3d orbitals does not occur until the 4s orbitals have been filled.\n\nThe increase in energy for subshells of increasing angular momentum in larger atoms is due to electron\u2013electron interaction effects, and it is specifically related to the ability of low angular momentum electrons to penetrate more effectively toward the nucleus, where they are subject to less screening from the charge of intervening electrons. Thus, in atoms of higher atomic number, the <math>\\ell</math> of electrons becomes more and more of a determining factor in their energy, and the principal quantum numbers <math>n</math> of electrons becomes less and less important in their energy placement.\n\nThe energy sequence of the first 35&nbsp;subshells (e.g., 1s, 2p, 3d, etc.) is given in the following table. Each cell represents a subshell with <math>n</math> and <math>\\ell</math> given by its row and column indices, respectively. The number in the cell is the subshell's position in the sequence. For a linear listing of the subshells in terms of increasing energies in multielectron atoms, see the section below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! s\n! p\n! d\n! f\n! g\n! h\n|-\n! 1\n| 1 ||    ||    ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 2\n| 2 ||  3 ||    ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 3\n| 4 ||  5 ||  7 ||    ||    ||\n|-\n! 4\n| 6 ||  8 || 10 || 13 ||    ||\n|-\n! 5\n| 9 || 11 || 14 || 17 || ''21'' ||\n|-\n! 6\n|12 || 15 || 18 || ''22'' || ''26'' || ''31''\n|-\n! 7\n|16 || 19 || ''23'' || ''27'' || ''32'' || ''37''\n|-\n! 8\n|''20'' || ''24'' || ''28'' || ''33'' || ''38'' || ''44''\n|-\n! 9\n|''25'' || ''29'' || ''34'' || ''39'' || ''45'' || ''51''\n|-\n! 10\n|''30'' || ''35'' || ''40'' || ''46'' || ''52'' || ''59''\n|}\n\n''Note: empty cells indicate non-existent sublevels, while numbers in italics indicate sublevels that could (potentially) exist, but which do not hold electrons in any element currently known.''\n\n== Electron placement and the periodic table ==\n[[File:Electron orbitals.svg|right|thumb|350px| [[Electron]] atomic and [[molecular orbital|molecular]] orbitals. The chart of orbitals ('''left''') is arranged by increasing energy (see [[Madelung rule]]). ''Note that atomic orbits are functions of three variables (two angles, and the distance&nbsp;{{mvar|r}} from the nucleus). These images are faithful to the angular component of the orbital, but not entirely representative of the orbital as a whole.'']]\n\n[[File:Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction.ogv|thumb|Atomic orbitals and periodic table construction]]\n\n{{Main|electron configuration|electron shell}}\n\nSeveral rules govern the placement of electrons in orbitals (''[[electron configuration]]''). The first dictates that no two electrons in an atom may have the same set of values of quantum numbers (this is the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These quantum numbers include the three that define orbitals, as well as [[Spin quantum number|{{mvar|s}}]], or [[spin quantum number]]. Thus, two electrons may occupy a single orbital, so long as they have different values of&nbsp;{{mvar|s}}. However, ''only'' two electrons, because of their spin, can be associated with each orbital.\n\nAdditionally, an electron always tends to fall to the lowest possible energy state. It is possible for it to occupy any orbital so long as it does not violate the Pauli exclusion principle, but if lower-energy orbitals are available, this condition is unstable. The electron will eventually lose energy (by releasing a [[photon]]) and drop into the lower orbital. Thus, electrons fill orbitals in the order specified by the energy sequence given above.\n\nThis behavior is responsible for the structure of the [[periodic table]]. The table may be divided into several rows (called 'periods'), numbered starting with 1 at the top. The presently known elements occupy seven periods. If a certain period has number ''i'', it consists of elements whose outermost electrons fall in the ''i''th shell. [[Niels Bohr]] was the first to propose (1923) that the [[Periodic table|periodicity]] in the properties of the elements might be explained by the periodic filling of the electron energy levels, resulting in the electronic structure of the atom.<ref name=\"Bohr\">{{cite journal | last = Bohr | first = Niels | authorlink = Niels Bohr | title = \u00dcber die Anwendung der Quantumtheorie auf den Atombau. I | journal = [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]] | year = 1923 | volume = 13 | page = 117|bibcode = 1923ZPhy...13..117B |doi = 10.1007/BF01328209 }}</ref>\n\nThe periodic table may also be divided into several numbered rectangular '[[Periodic table block|blocks]]'. The elements belonging to a given block have this common feature: their highest-energy electrons all belong to the same {{mvar|\u2113}}-state (but the {{mvar|n}} associated with that {{mvar|\u2113}}-state depends upon the period). For instance, the leftmost two columns constitute the 's-block'. The outermost electrons of [[Lithium|Li]] and [[Beryllium|Be]] respectively belong to the 2s&nbsp;subshell, and those of [[sodium|Na]] and [[magnesium|Mg]] to the 3s&nbsp;subshell.\n\nThe following is the order for filling the \"subshell\" orbitals, which also gives the order of the \"blocks\" in the periodic table:\n\n:'''1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p'''\n\nThe \"periodic\" nature of the filling of orbitals, as well as emergence of the '''s''', '''p''', '''d''' and '''f''' \"blocks\", is more obvious if this order of filling is given in matrix form, with increasing principal quantum numbers starting the new rows (\"periods\") in the matrix. Then, each subshell (composed of the first two quantum numbers) is repeated as many times as required for each pair of electrons it may contain. The result is a compressed periodic table, with each entry representing two successive elements:\n\n{| style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n|-\n|<pre>\n1s\n2s                                                  2p  2p  2p\n3s                                                  3p  3p  3p\n4s                              3d  3d  3d  3d  3d  4p  4p  4p\n5s                              4d  4d  4d  4d  4d  5p  5p  5p\n6s  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  4f  5d  5d  5d  5d  5d  6p  6p  6p\n7s  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  5f  6d  6d  6d  6d  6d  7p  7p  7p\n</pre>\n|}\n\nAlthough this is the general order of orbital filling according to the Madelung rule, there are exceptions, and the actual electronic energies of each element are also dependent upon additional details of the atoms (see [[Electron configuration#Atoms: Aufbau principle and Madelung rule]]).\n\nThe number of electrons in an electrically neutral atom increases with the [[atomic number]]. The electrons in the outermost shell, or ''[[valence electron]]s'', tend to be responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of valence electrons can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.\n\n=== Relativistic effects ===\n{{Main|Relativistic quantum chemistry}}\n\nFor elements with high atomic number {{mvar|Z}}, the effects of relativity become more pronounced, and especially so for s&nbsp;electrons, which move at relativistic velocities as they penetrate the screening electrons near the core of high-{{mvar|Z}} atoms. This relativistic increase in momentum for high speed electrons causes a corresponding decrease in wavelength and contraction of 6s orbitals relative to 5d orbitals (by comparison to corresponding s and d electrons in lighter elements in the same column of the periodic table); this results in 6s valence electrons becoming lowered in energy.\n\nExamples of significant physical outcomes of this effect include the lowered melting temperature of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (which results from 6s electrons not being available for metal bonding) and the golden color of [[gold]] and [[caesium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtut/atomic/qprimer/#Q26|title= Primer on Quantum Theory of the Atom|first=Stephen |last=Lower}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Bohr Model]], an {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}&nbsp;electron has a velocity given by <math>v = Z \\alpha c</math>, where {{mvar|Z}} is the atomic number, <math>\\alpha</math> is the [[fine-structure constant]], and {{math|''c''}} is the speed of light. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, therefore, any atom with an atomic number greater than 137 would require its 1s electrons to be traveling faster than the speed of light. Even in the [[Dirac equation]], which accounts for relativistic effects, the wave function of the electron for atoms with {{math|'''''Z'' > 137'''}} is oscillatory and [[unbounded]]. The significance of element 137, also known as [[untriseptium]], was first pointed out by the physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Element 137 is sometimes informally called [[feynmanium]] (symbol Fy).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poliakoff|first1=Martyn|last2=Tang|first2=Samantha|title=The periodic table: icon and inspiration|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|date=9 February 2015|volume=373|issue=2037|page=20140211|doi=10.1098/rsta.2014.0211|pmid=25666072|bibcode = 2015RSPTA.37340211P }}</ref> However, Feynman's approximation fails to predict the exact critical value of&nbsp;{{mvar|Z}} due to the non-point-charge nature of the nucleus and very small orbital radius of inner electrons, resulting in a potential seen by inner electrons which is effectively less than {{mvar|Z}}. The critical {{mvar|Z}}&nbsp;value which makes the atom unstable with regard to high-field breakdown of the vacuum and production of electron-positron pairs, does not occur until {{mvar|Z}} is about 173. These conditions are not seen except transiently in collisions of very heavy nuclei such as lead or uranium in accelerators, where such electron-positron production from these effects has been claimed to be observed.

A transition between these states (i.e., an electron absorbing or emitting a photon) can thus only happen if the photon has an energy corresponding with the exact energy difference between said states.\n\nConsider two states of the hydrogen atom:\n\nState 1) {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0}} and {{math|1=''s'' = +}}{{sfrac|1|2}}\n\nState 2) {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, {{math|1=''\u2113'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''m''<sub>''\u2113''</sub> = 0}} and {{math|1=''s'' = +}}{{sfrac|1|2}}\n\nBy quantum theory, state&nbsp;1 has a fixed energy of {{math|''E''<sub>1</sub>}}, and state&nbsp;2 has a fixed energy of {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub>}}. Now, what would happen if an electron in state&nbsp;1 were to move to state&nbsp;2? For this to happen, the electron would need to gain an energy of exactly {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>}}. If the electron receives energy that is less than or greater than this value, it cannot jump from state&nbsp;1 to state&nbsp;2. Now, suppose we irradiate the atom with a broad-spectrum of light. Photons that reach the atom that have an energy of exactly {{math|''E''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 ''E''<sub>1</sub>}} will be absorbed by the electron in state&nbsp;1, and that electron will jump to state&nbsp;2. However, photons that are greater or lower in energy cannot be absorbed by the electron, because the electron can only jump to one of the orbitals, it cannot jump to a state between orbitals. The result is that only photons of a specific frequency will be absorbed by the atom. This creates a line in the spectrum, known as an absorption line, which corresponds to the energy difference between states 1 and 2.\n\nThe atomic orbital model thus predicts line spectra, which are observed experimentally. This is one of the main validations of the atomic orbital model.\n\nThe atomic orbital model is nevertheless an approximation to the full quantum theory, which only recognizes many electron states. The predictions of line spectra are qualitatively useful but are not quantitatively accurate for atoms and ions other than those containing only one electron.\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_orbitals_3D 3D hydrogen orbitals on Wikimedia Commons]\n* [[Atomic electron configuration table]]\n* [[Condensed matter physics]]\n* [[Electron configuration]]\n* [[Energy level]]\n* [[Hund's rules]]\n* [[Molecular orbital]]\n* [[Quantum chemistry]]\n* [[Quantum chemistry computer programs]]\n* [[Solid state physics]]\n* [[Wave function collapse]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{cite book| last1=Tipler | first1=Paul | first2=Ralph|last2= Llewellyn | year=2003 | title=Modern Physics | edition=4 | location=New York |publisher=W.

In other words, carboxylic acid groups (\u2212CO<sub>2</sub>H) can be [[deprotonated]] to become negative [[carboxylate]]s (\u2212CO<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> ).  The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the [[pKa]] of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above).  In a complementary fashion, the \u03b1-[[amine]] of amino acids is a [[weak base]], meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values.  In other words, \u03b1-amino groups (NH<sub>2</sub>\u2212) can be [[protonated]] to become positive \u03b1-ammonium groups (<sup>+</sup>NH<sub>3</sub>\u2212).  The positively charged \u03b1-ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the \u03b1-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common \u03b1-amino acids is about 9.4).\n\nBecause all amino acids contain amine and carboxylic acid functional groups, they share [[Amphoterism|amphiprotic]] properties.<ref name=\"Creighton\" />  Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive \u03b1-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral \u03b1-amino group (net charge \u22121).  But at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, an amino acid usually contains both a negative carboxylate and a positive \u03b1-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge.

The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = \u00bd(pKa<sub>1</sub> + pKa<sub>R</sub>), where pKa<sub>R</sub> is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKa<sub>R</sub> = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = \u00bd(pKa<sub>R</sub> + pKa<sub>2</sub>). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.\n\n==Occurrence and functions in biochemistry==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | total_width       = 380\n<!-- Header -->\n | header_align      = <!-- center (default), left, right -->\n | header            =\n\n<!--image 5-->\n | image5            = Protein primary structure.svg\n | alt5              = A protein depicted as a long unbranched string of linked circles each representing amino acids\n | width5            = \n | height5           = \n | caption5          = A [[polypeptide]] is an unbranched chain of amino acids\n\n<!--image 6-->\n | image6            = Beta alanine comparison.svg\n | alt6              = Diagrammatic comparison of the structures of \u03b2-alanine and \u03b1-alanine\n | width6            = \n | height6           = \n | caption6          = \u03b2-alanine and its \u03b1-alanine isomer\n\n<!--image 7-->\n | image7            = Selenocysteine skeletal 3D.svg\n | alt7              = A diagram showing the structure of selenocysteine\n | width7            = \n | height7           = \n | caption7          = The amino acid [[selenocysteine]]\n}}\n\n===Proteinogenic amino acids===\n{{main|Proteinogenic amino acids}} {{See also|Protein primary structure|Posttranslational modification}}\n\nAmino acids are the structural units (monomers) that make up proteins.

The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in [[biochemistry]], a residue refers to a specific [[monomer]] within the [[polymer|polymeric chain]] of a [[polysaccharide]], [[protein]] or [[nucleic acid]].) The [[integral membrane protein]]s tend to have outer rings of exposed [[hydrophobic]] amino acids that anchor them into the [[lipid bilayer]]. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some [[peripheral membrane protein]]s have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like [[glutamate]] and [[aspartate]], while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like [[lysine]] and [[arginine]].

For a time he led [[Hut 8]], the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bombe]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]].

He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:<blockquote>I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&nbsp;...

In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: <blockquote>Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82\u201383}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===University and work on computability===\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]],<ref name=whoswho/> where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.

The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\n\n[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]\nAlthough [[Turing's proof]] was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof using his [[lambda calculus]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}</ref> Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}</ref> It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing\u2014insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p.&nbsp;22.</ref> To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].\n\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]], in the second year as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}</ref> In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the [[Princeton University Department of Mathematics|Department of Mathematics]] at Princeton;<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Turing | first1 = A.

For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots.

Andrew Hodges and another biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took \"an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}</ref>\n\nPhilosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for [[electroplating]] gold onto spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]]. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.<ref name = \"Copeland\">{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

If the triangle is moved to the other side of the trapezoid, then the resulting figure is a rectangle.  It follows that the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the rectangle:<ref name=AF/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} ''bh''}} <big>&nbsp;(parallelogram).</big>\n[[File:TriangleArea.svg|thumb|right|180px|alt=A parallelogram split into two equal triangles|Two equal triangles.]]However, the same parallelogram can also be cut along a [[diagonal]] into two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles, as shown in the figure to the right.

Given a circle of radius {{math|''r''}}, it is possible to partition the circle into [[Circular sector|sectors]], as shown in the figure to the right.  Each sector is approximately triangular in shape, and the sectors can be rearranged to form an approximate parallelogram.  The height of this parallelogram is {{math|''r''}}, and the width is half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or {{math|\u03c0''r''}}.  Thus, the total area of the circle is {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}:<ref name=AF/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} \u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}} <big>&nbsp;(circle).</big>\nThough the dissection used in this formula is only approximate, the error becomes smaller and smaller as the circle is partitioned into more and more sectors.  The [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the areas of the approximate parallelograms is exactly {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, which is the area of the circle.<ref name=Surveyor/>\n\nThis argument is actually a simple application of the ideas of [[calculus]].  In ancient times, the [[method of exhaustion]] was used in a similar way to find the area of the circle, and this method is now recognized as a precursor to [[integral calculus]].  Using modern methods, the area of a circle can be computed using a [[definite integral]]:\n:<math>A \\;=\\;2\\int_{-r}^r \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\\,dx \\;=\\; \\pi r^2.</math>\n\n====Ellipses====\n{{main article|Ellipse#Area}}\nThe formula for the area enclosed by an [[ellipse]] is related to the formula of a circle; for an ellipse with [[semi-major axis|semi-major]] and [[semi-minor axis|semi-minor]] axes {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} the formula is:<ref name=AF/>\n:<math>A = \\pi xy .</math>\n\n====Surface area====\n{{main article|Surface area}}\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|right|thumb|180px|alt=A blue sphere inside a cylinder of the same height and radius|[[Archimedes]] showed that the surface area of a [[sphere]] is exactly four times the area of a flat [[disk (mathematics)|disk]] of the same radius, and the volume enclosed by the sphere is exactly 2/3 of the volume of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and radius.]]\nMost basic formulas for [[surface area]] can be obtained by cutting surfaces and flattening them out.  For example, if the side surface of a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (or any [[prism (geometry)|prism]]) is cut lengthwise, the surface can be flattened out into a rectangle.  Similarly, if a cut is made along the side of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]], the side surface can be flattened out into a sector of a circle, and the resulting area computed.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a [[sphere]] is more difficult to derive: because a sphere has nonzero [[Gaussian curvature]], it cannot be flattened out.  The formula for the surface area of a sphere was first obtained by [[Archimedes]] in his work ''[[On the Sphere and Cylinder]]''.  The formula is:<ref name=MathWorldSurfaceArea/>\n:{{bigmath|''A'' {{=}} 4''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup>}} <big>&nbsp;(sphere),</big>\nwhere {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the sphere.  As with the formula for the area of a circle, any derivation of this formula inherently uses methods similar to [[calculus]].\n\n===General formulas===\n\n====Areas of 2-dimensional figures====\n* A [[triangle]]: <math>\\tfrac12Bh</math> (where ''B'' is any side, and ''h'' is the distance from the line on which ''B'' lies to the other vertex of the triangle). This formula can be used if the height ''h'' is known. If the lengths of the three sides are known then ''[[Heron's formula]]'' can be used: <math>\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}</math> where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are the sides of the triangle, and <math>s = \\tfrac12(a + b + c)</math> is half of its perimeter.<ref name=AF/> If an angle and its two included sides are given, the area is <math>\\tfrac12 a b \\sin(C)</math> where {{math|''C''}} is the given angle and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are its included sides.<ref name=AF/> If the triangle is graphed on a coordinate plane, a matrix can be used and is simplified to the absolute value of <math>\\tfrac12(x_1 y_2 + x_2 y_3 + x_3 y_1 - x_2 y_1 - x_3 y_2 - x_1 y_3)</math>. This formula is also known as the [[shoelace formula]] and is an easy way to solve for the area of a coordinate triangle by substituting the 3 points ''(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)'', ''(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)'', and ''(x<sub>3</sub>,y<sub>3</sub>)''. The shoelace formula can also be used to find the areas of other polygons when their vertices are known. Another approach for a coordinate triangle is to use [[calculus]] to find the area.\n* A [[simple polygon]] constructed on a grid of equal-distanced points (i.e., points with [[integer]] coordinates) such that all the polygon's vertices are grid points: <math>i + \\frac{b}{2} - 1</math>, where ''i'' is the number of grid points inside the polygon and ''b'' is the number of boundary points.

[[isoperimetric inequality]] states that, for a closed curve of length ''L'' (so the region it encloses has [[perimeter]] ''L'') and for area ''A'' of the region that it encloses,\n\n:<math>4\\pi A \\le L^2,</math>\n\nand  equality holds if and only if the curve is a [[circle]]. Thus a circle has the largest area of any closed figure with a given perimeter.\n\nAt the other extreme, a figure with given perimeter ''L'' could have an arbitrarily small area, as illustrated by a [[rhombus]] that is \"tipped over\" arbitrarily far so that two of its [[angle]]s are arbitrarily close to 0\u00b0 and the other two are arbitrarily close to 180\u00b0.\n\nFor a circle, the ratio of the area to the [[circumference]] (the term for the perimeter of a circle) equals half the [[radius]] ''r''. This can be seen from the area formula ''\u03c0r''<sup>2</sup> and the circumference formula 2''\u03c0r''.\n\nThe area of a [[regular polygon]] is half its perimeter times the [[apothem]] (where the apothem is the distance from the center to the nearest point on any side).\n\n===Fractals===\n\nDoubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the polygon resides in). But if the one-dimensional lengths of a  [[fractal]] drawn in two dimensions are all doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power of two that is not necessarily an integer. This power is called the [[fractal dimension]] of the fractal.\n<ref name=\"Mandelbrot1983\">\n{{cite book\n |last        = Mandelbrot\n |first       = Beno\u00eet B.\n |title       = The fractal geometry of nature <!--Isn't valid anymore: https://books.google.com/books?id=0R2LkE3N7-oC-->\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |accessdate  = 1 February 2012\n |year        = 1983\n |publisher   = Macmillan\n |isbn        = 978-0-7167-1186-5\n |deadurl     = no\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170320115652/https://books.google.com/books?id=JFX9mQEACAAJ\n |archivedate = 20 March 2017\n |df          =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Area bisectors==\n{{Main article|Bisection#Area bisectors and perimeter bisectors}}\n\nThere are an infinitude of lines that bisect the area of a triangle.

Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its [[incircle]]). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.\n\nAny line through the midpoint of a parallelogram bisects the area.\n\nAll area bisectors of a circle or other ellipse go through the center, and any [[Chord (geometry)|chords]] through the center bisect the area.

The [[semi-major axis]] of this [[elliptic orbit]] is defined to be half of the straight [[line segment]] that joins the [[perihelion and aphelion]]. The centre of the Sun lies on this straight line segment, but not at its midpoint. Because ellipses are well-understood shapes, measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically, and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based on observation. In addition, it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance that Earth traverses over the course of a year, defining times and places for observing the largest [[parallax]] (apparent shifts of position) in nearby stars. Knowing Earth's shift and a star's shift enabled the star's distance to be calculated. But all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty, and the uncertainties in the length of the astronomical unit only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances. Improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding. Throughout the twentieth century, measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated, and ever more dependent on accurate observation of the effects described by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[theory of relativity]] and upon the mathematical tools it used.\n\nImproving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of improved understanding of the laws of [[celestial mechanics]], which govern the motions of objects in space. The expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated (in AU) from these laws, and assembled into a collection of data called an [[ephemeris]]. [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] HORIZONS System provides one of several ephemeris computation services.<ref name=Horizons>{{citation |title=HORIZONS System |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons |work=Solar system dynamics |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |publisher=NASA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the astronomical unit, the IAU formally [[IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants|adopted a new definition]]. Although directly based on the then-best available observational measurements, the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides. It stated that \"the astronomical unit of length is that length (''A'') for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time\".<ref name=\"IAU76\">Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976</ref><ref name=\"Tr\u00fcmper\">{{Citation |title=Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology \u2014 Volume VI/4B ''Solar System'' |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=wgydrPWl6XkC&pg=RA1-PA4 |page=4 |date=2009 |author1=H.

As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [[photons]] to be reflected from an object. Because all photons move at the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is calculated as the product of the speed of light and the measured time. However, for precision the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are transiting. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation. Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]] scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of {{val|86400|u=seconds}}). By 2009, the IAU had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements, and calculated the speed of light at {{val|173.1446326847|(69)|u=AU/day}} (TDB).<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf |chapter=Selected Astronomical Constants |title=The Astronomical Almanac Online |publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]\u2013[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]] |page=K6 |date=2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132053/http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) modified the [[International System of Units]] (SI, or \"modern\" metric system) to make the metre independent of physical objects entirely, because other measurements had become too precise for reference to the prototype platinum metre to remain useful.

Neither ''G'' nor {{Solar mass}} can be measured to high accuracy separately, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an [[ephemeris]], so ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.\n\nThe calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on Earth's surface ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer during the Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter during the Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the \"planetary second\" (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{val|0.9832898912}} and {{val|1.0167103335|u=AU}}) and, when Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and Earth is moving faster along [[Earth's orbit|its orbital path]]. As the metre is defined in terms of the second and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the \"planetary metre\" on a periodic basis.\n\nThe metre is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that \"its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored\".<ref>{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166\u201367}}</ref> As such, the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete because it did not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed,<ref name=\"Huang\">{{citation |author=Huang, T.-Y. |author2=Han, C.-H. |author3=Yi, Z.-H. |author4=Xu, B.-X. |date=1995 |title=What is the astronomical unit of length? |bibcode=1995A&A...298..629H |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=298 |pages=629\u201333 }}</ref> and \"vigorous debate\" ensued<ref name=Dodd>{{citation |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |page=76 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&pg=PA76 |chapter=\u00a7&nbsp;6.2.3: Astronomical unit: ''Definition of the astronomical unit, future versions'' |isbn=978-0-521-76917-4}} and also p. 91, ''Summary and recommendations''.</ref> until August 2012 when the IAU adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit = {{val|149597870700}} [[metre]]s.\n\nThe astronomical unit is typically used for [[stellar system]] scale distances, such as the size of a protostellar disk or the heliocentric distance of an asteroid, whereas other units are used for [[cosmic distance ladder|other distances in astronomy]].

The parsec (parallax arcsecond) is defined in terms of the astronomical unit, being the distance of an object with a [[parallax]] of 1 [[arcsecond]].

[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye.

[[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80\u2033 for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of {{val|8.794143}}\u2033), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance), this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth\u2013Sun distance in kilometres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,<ref>Conf\u00e9rence internationale des \u00e9toiles fondamentales, Paris, 18\u201321 May 1896</ref> which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.<ref>Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964</ref> The name \"astronomical unit\" appears first to have been used in 1903.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near Earth in 1900\u20131901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.<ref>{{citation |last=Hinks |first=Arthur R. |authorlink=Arthur Robert Hinks |title=Solar Parallax Papers No. 7: The General Solution from the Photographic Right Ascensions of Eros, at the Opposition of 1900 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=69 |issue=7 |pages=544\u201367 |date=1909 |bibcode=1909MNRAS..69..544H |doi=10.1093/mnras/69.7.544}}</ref> Another international project to measure the parallax of 433 Eros was undertaken in 1930\u20131931.<ref name=\"Weaver\" /><ref>{{citation |last=Spencer Jones |first=H. |authorlink=Harold Spencer Jones |title=The Solar Parallax and the Mass of the Moon from Observations of Eros at the Opposition of 1931 |journal=Mem.

The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\n==Dictionary definitions==\nWiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:\n# A person who creates art.\n# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].\n# A person who is skilled at some activity.\n# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n* A learned person or Master of Arts\n* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]\n* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice\n* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic\n* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art\n* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] \u2013 traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]\n\n==History of the term==\nThe Greek word \"techn\u011b\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, \"technicus\",<ref>\n[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''\n</ref>\nbecame the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:\n* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]\n* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history\n* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs\n* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]\n* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]\n* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]\n* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance\n* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]\n* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.<ref>\n''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002</ref>\n\nThe word ''art'' derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", and conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).<ref>\nP.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998</ref>\n\nWith the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].\n\n==The present day concept of an 'artist'==\n''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music\u2014people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level, but in the 20th century the distinction became rather less relevant {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well\u2014 law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"[[technician]]\", \"entertainer\" and \"[[artisan]]\", \"[[fine arts|fine art]]\" and \"[[applied art]]\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.<ref>Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&source=web&hl=en&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].</ref>\n\nThe English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.\n\nIn ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:<ref>{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}</ref>\n#Create places for some human purpose.\n#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.\n#Record and commemorate.\n#Give tangible form to the unknown.\n#Give tangible form to feelings.\n#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.\n\nAfter looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between \"arts for art's sake\" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that \"this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down\" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007).

Once seen, Artemis got revenge on Actaeon: she forbade him speech \u2014 if he tried to speak, he would be changed into a [[Deer (mythology)|stag]] \u2014 for the unlucky profanation of her virginity's mystery. Upon hearing the call of his hunting party, he cried out to them and immediately transformed. At this he fled deep into the woods, and doing so he came upon a pond and, seeing his reflection, groaned. His own hounds then turned upon him and pursued him, not recognizing him. In an endeavour to save himself, he raised his eyes (and would have raised his arms, had he had them) toward Mount Olympus. The gods did not heed his plea, and he was torn to pieces. An element of the earlier myth made Actaeon the familiar hunting companion of Artemis, no stranger. In an embroidered extension of the myth, the hounds were so upset with their master's death, that [[Chiron]] made a statue so lifelike that the hounds thought it was Actaeon.<ref>Fragmentary sources for the narrative of Actaeon's hounds are noted in Lamar Ronald Lacy, \"Aktaion and a Lost 'Bath of Artemis'\" ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' '''110''' (1990:26\u201342) p. 30 note 32, p. 31 note 37.</ref>\n\nThere are various other versions of his transgression: The Hesiodic ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' and pseudo-Apollodoran ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheke]]'' state that his offense was that he was a rival of [[Zeus]] for [[Semele]], his mother's sister,<ref>Thus potentially endangering the future birth of [[Dionysus]], had he been successful.

These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them, [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]].{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=617}} \n\nIn the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and its associated [[Church of Ireland]] were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition, with theologies, structures, and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way, or ''[[via media]]'', between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism \u2013 a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as \"Catholic and Reformed\".<ref>\"The History of the Church of England\"; http://www.cofe.anglican.org/about/history, Official Church of England website</ref> The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion. Unique to Anglicanism is the [[Book of Common Prayer]], the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches have used for centuries, and is thus acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the Anglican Communion together.\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], Anglican congregations in the United States and [[British North America]] (which would later form the basis for the modern country of Canada) were each reconstituted into autonomous churches with their own bishops and self-governing structures; these were known as the American [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[Anglican Church of Canada|Church of England in the Dominion of Canada]]. Through the expansion of the [[British Empire]] and the activity of [[Christian mission]]s, this model was adopted as the model for many newly formed churches, especially in Africa, [[Australasia]], and Asia-Pacific. In the 19th century, the term ''Anglicanism'' was coined to describe the common religious tradition of these churches; as also that of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], which, though originating earlier within the [[Church of Scotland]], had come to be recognised as sharing this common identity.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Rochester cathedral stained glass 2.jpg|thumb|Jesus depicted in a stained glass window in [[Rochester Cathedral]], Kent.]]\nThe word ''Anglican'' originates in {{lang|la|Anglicana ecclesie libera sit}}, a phrase from the [[Magna Carta]] dated June 15, 1215, meaning \"the Anglican Church shall be free.\"<ref>https://books.google.ca/books?id=pS9DAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA508-IA29&pg=PA508-IA29#v=onepage&q&f=false</ref> Adherents of Anglicanism are called ''Anglicans''. As an adjective, \"Anglican\" is used to describe the people, institutions and churches, as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> \n\nAs a noun, an Anglican is a member of a church in the Anglican Communion. The word is also used by followers of separated groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it, although this is sometimes considered as a misuse. The word ''Anglicanism'' came into being in the 19th century.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> The word originally referred only to the teachings and rites of Christians throughout the world in communion with the [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Diocese of Canterbury|Canterbury]], but has come to sometimes be extended to any church following those traditions rather than actual membership in the modern [[Anglican Communion]].<ref name=\"ODCC\" />\n\nAlthough the term ''Anglican'' is found referring to the Church of England as far back as the 16th century, its use did not become general until the latter half of the 19th century. In British parliamentary legislation referring to the English [[established church]], there is no need for a description; it is simply the Church of England, though the word \"Protestant\" is used in many Acts specifying the succession to the Crown and qualifications for office. When the [[Acts of Union 1800|Union with Ireland Act]] created the United Church of England and Ireland, it is specified that it shall be one \"Protestant Episcopal Church\", thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the Presbyterian polity that prevails in the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref>[[Union with Ireland Act 1800]], s. 1, art. 5.</ref>\n\nThe word ''Episcopal'' is preferred in the title of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (the province of the Anglican Communion covering the United States) and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], though the full name of the former is ''The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America''. Elsewhere, however, the term \"Anglican Church\" came to be preferred as it distinguished these churches from others that maintain an [[episcopal polity]].\n\n===Definition===\nAnglicanism, in its structures, theology and forms of worship, is commonly understood as a distinct Christian tradition representing a middle ground between what are perceived to be the extremes of the claims of 16th-century Roman Catholicism and the [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] varieties of [[Protestantism]] of that era. As such, it is often referred to as being a ''via media'' (or \"middle way\") between these traditions.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1996|p=179}}\n\nThe faith of Anglicans is founded in the [[Scriptures]] and the [[Gospels]], the traditions of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] Church, the [[historical episcopate]], the [[ecumenical council|first four ecumenical councils]],<ref name=\"Kasper2009\">{{cite book|last=Kasper|first=Walter|title=Harvesting the Fruits: Basic Aspects of Christian Faith in Ecumenical Dialogue|date=15 October 2009|publisher=A&C Black|language=English |isbn=9781441121301|page=98|quote=\"Anglicans historically have only recognised the binding authority of the first four ecumenical councils.

The Eucharist is central to worship for most Anglicans as a communal offering of prayer and praise in which the life, death and resurrection of [[Jesus Christ]] are proclaimed through prayer, reading of the Bible, singing, giving God thanks over the bread and wine for the innumerable benefits obtained through the passion of Christ, the breaking of the bread, and reception of the bread and wine as representing the body and blood of Christ as instituted at the [[Last Supper]]. While many Anglicans celebrate the Eucharist in similar ways to the predominant western Catholic tradition, a considerable degree of liturgical freedom is permitted, and worship styles range from the simple to elaborate.\n\nUnique to Anglicanism is the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP), the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries. It was called ''common prayer'' originally because it was intended for use in all Church of England churches which had previously followed differing local liturgies. The term was kept when the church became international because all Anglicans used to share in its use around the world.\n\nIn 1549, the first ''Book of Common Prayer'' was compiled by [[Thomas Cranmer]], who was then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. While it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the Prayer Book is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind Anglicans together.\n\n==Anglican identity==\n{{See also|History of the Anglican Communion}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Saint Alban (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Alban]].]]\nThe founding of Christianity in Britain is commonly attributed to [[Joseph of Arimathea]], according to Anglican legend, and is commemorated in [[Glastonbury Abbey]].{{efn|According to John Godfrey, {{quote|The most famous and beautiful legend of all related to the conversion of Britain is of course that of Joseph of Arimathea, who is said to have arrived in Britain with twelve companions in the year 63 at the bidding of the apostle Philip.

On the contrary, with regard to the Irish branch, this view receives fresh support from our statements. Neither from what tradition tells us about the doctrines and institutions of the Celtic Church, nor from what we know or may fairly conjecture about her history, do we receive any support for the hypothesis that the Celtic Church during her golden age greatly resembled the Church of the apostolic era in institutions and dogma. Just as Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, so the British Church formed (during the fourth century) a branch of the Catholic Church of the West; and during the whole of that century, from the council of Arles (316) onward, took part in all proceedings concerning the Church. But the Irish branch of the Celtic Church was an offshoot of that British Church, and had sprung up as early as the fourth century. At the beginning of the seventh century the institutions of the Celtic Church on either side of the Irish Sea showed divergences from the Church of Rome which are well attested. These, on a closer view, admit of full explanation. Above all, we must not forget the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church the position of the Roman bishop during the fourth century and up to the time of Leo the Great (440\u2013461) differed from that of Pope Gregory the Great (509\u2013604) at the end of the sixth century. At the beginning of the seventh century rigid uniformity of institutions was regarded as an essential requirement of the ''unitas catholica ;'' but to the fourth century this idea was wholly foreign.

The Elizabethan Settlement stopped the radical Protestant tendencies under Edward VI by combining the more radical elements of the Second Prayer Book of 1552 with the conservative 'Catholic' First Prayer Book of 1549. From then on Protestantism was in a \"state of arrested development\" regardless of the attempts to detach the Church of England from its \"idiosyncratic anchorage in the medieval past\" by various groups which tried to push it towards a more Reformed theology and governance in the years 1560\u20131660.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1990|pp=171\u2013172}} It has resolutely refused to identify decisively as Catholic or Protestant and sees it as a \"virtue\" rather than a \"handicap,\" indeed it prefers to see itself as both.{{sfn|MacCulloch|1990|pp=171\u2013172}}\n\n[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]].]]\nAlthough two important constitutive elements of what later would emerge as Anglicanism, were present in 1559 \u2013 the [[historic episcopate]] and the ''Book of Common Prayer'' \u2013 neither the laypeople nor the clergy perceived themselves as Anglicans at the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign. Historical studies on the period 1560\u20131660 written before the late 1960s tended to project the predominant conformist spirituality and doctrine of the 1660s on the ecclesiastical situation one hundred years before, and there was also a tendency to take polemically binary partitions of reality claimed by contestants studied (such as the dichotomies Protestant-'Popish' or 'Laudian'-'Puritan') at face value. Since the late 1960s these interpretations have been criticised. Studies on the subject written during the last forty-five years have, however, not reached any consensus on how to interpret this period in English church history. The extent to which one or several positions concerning doctrine and spirituality existed alongside the more well-known and articulate Puritan movement and the Durham House Party, and the exact extent of continental Calvinism among the English elite and among the ordinary churchgoers from the 1560s to the 1620s are subjects of current and ongoing debate.{{efn|For a study stressing the hegemony of continental Calvinism before the 1620s, see {{harvnb|Tyacke|1987}}.

Consequently, the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] eventually resulted in the creation of two new Anglican churches, the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]] in those states that had achieved independence; and in the 1830s [[Anglican Church of Canada|The Church of England in Canada]] became independent from the Church of England in those North American colonies which had remained under British control and to which many Loyalist churchmen had migrated.{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=43}}\n\nReluctantly, legislation was passed in the British Parliament (the [[Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786]]) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown (whereas no bishoprics had ever been established in the former American colonies).{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=43}} Both in the United States and in Canada, the new Anglican churches developed novel models of self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; that would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities.{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=322}}\n\nIn the following century, two further factors acted to accelerate the development of a distinct Anglican identity. From 1828 and 1829, [[Dissenters]] and Catholics could be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],{{sfn|Edwards|1984|pp=113, 124}} which consequently ceased to be a body drawn purely from the established churches of Scotland, England and Ireland; but which nevertheless, over the following ten years, engaged in extensive reforming legislation affecting the interests of the English and Irish churches; which by the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union of 1800]], had been reconstituted as the [[United Church of England and Ireland]]. The propriety of this legislation was bitterly contested by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarians),{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=178}} who in response developed a vision of Anglicanism as religious tradition deriving ultimately from the [[ecumenical councils]] of the patristic church. Those within the Church of England opposed to the Tractarians, and to their revived ritual practices, introduced a stream of bills in parliament aimed to control innovations in worship.{{sfn|Chadwick|1987|p=324}} This only made the dilemma more acute, with consequent continual litigation in the secular and ecclesiastical courts.\n\nOver the same period, Anglican churches engaged vigorously in [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missions]], resulting in the creation, by the end of the century, of over ninety colonial bishoprics;{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=318}} which gradually coalesced into new self-governing churches on the Canadian and American models. However, the case of [[John Colenso]], [[Bishop of Natal]], reinstated in 1865 by the English [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] over the heads of the Church in South Africa,{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=324}} demonstrated acutely that the extension of episcopacy had to be accompanied by a recognised Anglican ecclesiology of ecclesiastical authority, distinct from secular power.\n\nConsequently, at the instigation of the bishops of Canada and South Africa, the first [[Lambeth Conference]] was called in 1867;{{sfn|Edwards|1984|p=325}} to be followed by further conferences in 1878 and 1888, and thereafter at ten-year intervals. The various papers and declarations of successive Lambeth Conferences, have served to frame the continued Anglican debate on identity, especially as relating to the possibility of ecumenical discussion with other churches. This ecumenical aspiration became much more of a possibility, as other denominational groups rapidly followed the example of the Anglican Communion in founding their own transnational alliances: the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches|Alliance of Reformed Churches]], the [[World Methodist Council|Ecumenical Methodist Council]], the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches|International Congregational Council]], and the [[Baptist World Alliance]].\n\n===Theories===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 330\n| image1    = Edward Bouverie Pusey.jpg\n| width1    = 302\n| height1 = 355\n| caption1  = [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]].\n| image2    = John-Henry-Newman.gif\n| width2    = 600\n| height2 = 811\n| caption2  = [[John Henry Newman]].\n}}\n\nAnglicanism was seen as a middle way, or ''via media'', between two branches of Protestantism, Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Anglican and Episcopal History|year=2003|publisher=Historical Society of the Episcopal Church|language=English|page=15|quote=Others had made similar observations, Patrick McGrath commenting that the Church of England was not a middle way between Roman Catholic and Protestant, but \"between different forms of Protestantism,\" and William Monter describing the Church of England as \"a unique style of Protestantism, a via media between the Reformed and Lutheran traditions.\" MacCulloch has described Cranmer as seeking a middle way between Zurich and Wittenberg but elsewhere remarks that the Church of England was \"nearer Zurich and Geneva than Wittenberg.}}</ref> In their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority, the [[Oxford Movement|Tractarians]] \u2013 and in particular [[John Henry Newman]] \u2013 looked back to the writings of 17th-century Anglican divines, finding in these texts the idea of the English church as a ''via media'' between the Protestant and Catholic traditions.{{sfn|Morris|2003}} This view was associated \u2013 especially in the writings of [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] \u2013 with the theory of Anglicanism as one of three \"[[Branch Theory|branches]]\" (alongside the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest [[ecumenical councils]]. Newman himself subsequently rejected his theory of the ''via media'', as essentially historicist and static; and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church.{{sfn|Morris|2003}} Nevertheless, the aspiration to ground Anglican identity in the writings of the 17th-century divines, and in faithfulness to the traditions of the [[Church Fathers]] reflects a continuing theme of Anglican ecclesiology, most recently in the writings of [[Henry Robert McAdoo]].{{sfn|McAdoo|1991}}\n\nThe Tractarian formulation of the theory of the ''via media'' between Protestantism and Catholicism was essentially a party platform, and not acceptable to Anglicans outside the confines of the [[Oxford Movement]]. However, this theory of the ''via media'' was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], in a more dynamic form that became widely influential. Both Maurice and Newman saw the Church of England of their day as sorely deficient in faith; but whereas Newman had looked back to a distant past when the light of faith might have appeared to burn brighter, Maurice looked forward to the possibility of a brighter revelation of faith in the future. Maurice saw the Protestant and Catholic strands within the Church of England as contrary but complementary, both maintaining elements of the true church, but incomplete without the other; such that a true catholic and evangelical church might come into being by a union of opposites.{{sfn|Sykes|1978|p=16}}\n\n[[File:Frederick Denison Maurice. Portrait c1865.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick Denison Maurice]].]]\nCentral to Maurice's perspective was his belief that the collective elements of family, nation, and church represented a divine order of structures through which God unfolds his continuing work of creation. Hence, for Maurice, the Protestant tradition had maintained the elements of national distinction which were amongst the marks of the true universal church, but which had been lost within contemporary Roman Catholicism in the internationalism of centralised papal authority. Within the coming universal church that Maurice foresaw, national churches would each maintain the six signs of Catholicity: baptism, Eucharist, the creeds, Scripture, an episcopal ministry, and a fixed liturgy (which could take a variety of forms in accordance with divinely ordained distinctions in national characteristics).{{sfn|Morris|2003}} Not surprisingly, this vision of a becoming universal church as a congregation of autonomous national churches, proved highly congenial in Anglican circles; and Maurice's six signs were adapted to form the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888.{{sfn|Woodhouse-Hawkins|1988}}\n\nIn the latter decades of the 20th century, Maurice's theory, and the various strands of Anglican thought that derived from it, have been criticised by [[Stephen Sykes]];{{sfn|Sykes|1978|p=19}} who argues that the terms ''Protestant'' and ''Catholic'' as used in these approaches are synthetic constructs denoting ecclesiastic identities unacceptable to those to whom the labels are applied. Hence, the Catholic Church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church \u2013 but rather identifies itself as the universal church. Moreover, Sykes criticises the proposition, implicit in theories of ''via media'', that there is no distinctive body of Anglican doctrines, other than those of the universal church; accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all.{{sfn|Sykes|1978|p=53}}\n\nContrariwise, Sykes notes a high degree of commonality in Anglican liturgical forms, and in the doctrinal understandings expressed within those liturgies. He proposes that Anglican identity might rather be found within a shared consistent pattern of prescriptive liturgies, established and maintained through canon law, and embodying both a historic deposit of formal statements of doctrine, and also framing the regular reading and proclamation of scripture.{{sfn|Sykes|1978|p=44}} Sykes nevertheless agrees with those heirs of Maurice who emphasise the incompleteness of Anglicanism as a positive feature, and quotes with qualified approval the words of [[Michael Ramsey]]:\n\n{{quote|For while the Anglican church is vindicated by its place in history, with a strikingly balanced witness to Gospel and Church and sound learning, its greater vindication lies in its pointing through its own history to something of which it is a fragment. Its credentials are its incompleteness, with the tension and the travail of its soul. It is clumsy and untidy, it baffles neatness and logic. For it is not sent to commend itself as 'the best type of Christianity,' but by its very brokenness to point to the universal Church wherein all have died.{{sfn|Ramsey|1936|p=220}}}}\n\n==Doctrine==\n{{Main|Anglican doctrine}}\n\n===\"Catholic and Reformed\"===\nIn the time of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the nature of Anglicanism was based on questions of jurisdiction \u2013 specifically, the belief of the Crown that [[national church]]es should be autonomous \u2013 rather than theological disagreement. The effort was to create a national church in legal continuity with its traditions, but inclusive of certain doctrinal and liturgical beliefs of the [[Protestant Reformers|Reformers]]. The result has been a movement with a distinctive self-image among Christian movements. The question often arises as to whether the Anglican Communion should be identified as a Protestant or [[Catholicism|Catholic]] church, or perhaps as a distinct branch of Christianity altogether.\n\nThe distinction between Reformed and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the [[Oxford Movement]] of the mid-19th century, many churches of the communion have revived and extended liturgical and pastoral practices similar to Roman Catholicism. This extends beyond the ceremony of [[high church|high-church]] services to even more theologically significant territory, such as sacramental theology (see [[Anglican sacraments]]). While [[Anglo-Catholic]] practices, particularly liturgical ones, have resurfaced and become more common within the tradition over the last century, there remain many places where practices and beliefs remain on the more Reformed or evangelical side (see [[Sydney Anglicanism]]).\n\n===Guiding principles===\n[[File:Hooker-Statue.jpeg|thumb|[[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] (1554\u20131600), one of the most influential figures in shaping Anglican theology and self-identity.]]\nFor high-church Anglicans, doctrine is neither established by a [[magisterium]], nor derived from the theology of an [[:wikt:eponym|eponymous]] founder (such as [[Calvinism]]), nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical [[creed]]s (such as the [[Lutheran]] [[Book of Concord]]). For them, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which they see as the products of profound theological reflection, compromise and synthesis. They emphasise the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' as a key expression of Anglican doctrine. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name ''[[lex orandi, lex credendi]]'' (\"the law of prayer is the law of belief\").\n\nWithin the prayer books are the fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] and [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] creeds, the [[Athanasian Creed]] (now rarely used), the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the [[catechism]] and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry. For some low-church and evangelical Anglicans, the 16th-century [[Reformed]] Thirty-Nine Articles form the basis of doctrine.\n\n====Distinctives of Anglican belief====\nThe [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] played a significant role in Anglican doctrine and practice. Following the passing of the 1604 canons, all Anglican clergy had to formally subscribe to the articles. Today, however, the articles are no longer binding,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Thirty-nine Articles |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Thirty-nine-Articles |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=29 August 2016}}</ref> but are seen as a historical document which has played a significant role in the shaping of Anglican identity. The degree to which each of the articles has remained influential varies.\n\nOn the doctrine of [[Justification (theology)|justification]], for example, there is a wide range of beliefs within the Anglican Communion, with some [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] arguing for a faith with good works and the sacraments. At the same time, however, some [[evangelical]] Anglicans ascribe to the Reformed emphasis on ''[[sola fide]]'' (\"faith alone\") in their doctrine of justification (see [[Sydney Anglicanism]]). Still other Anglicans adopt a nuanced view of justification, taking elements from the early [[Church Fathers]], [[Catholicism]], [[Protestantism]], [[liberal Christianity|liberal theology]], and [[latitudinarian]] thought.\n\nArguably, the most influential of the original articles has been Article VI on the \"sufficiency of scripture\" which says that \"Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.\" This article has informed Anglican biblical [[exegesis]] and [[hermeneutics]] since earliest times.\n\nAnglicans look for authority in their \"standard divines\" (see below). Historically, the most influential of these \u2013 apart from Cranmer \u2013 has been the 16th-century cleric and theologian [[Richard Hooker (theologian)|Richard Hooker]] who after 1660 was increasingly portrayed as the founding father of Anglicanism. Hooker's description of Anglican authority as being derived primarily from scripture, informed by reason (the intellect and the experience of God) and tradition (the practices and beliefs of the historical church), has influenced Anglican self-identity and doctrinal reflection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula. The analogy of the \"three-legged stool\" of [[Bible|scripture]], [[reason]], and [[Sacred Tradition|tradition]] is often incorrectly attributed to Hooker. Rather Hooker's description is a hierarchy of authority, with scripture as foundational and reason and tradition as vitally important, but secondary, authorities.\n\nFinally, the extension of Anglicanism into non-English cultures, the growing diversity of prayer books and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue, has led to further reflection on the parameters of Anglican identity. Many Anglicans look to the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]] of 1888 as the ''sine qua non'' of communal identity.{{sfn|Sydnor|1980|p=80}} In brief, the quadrilateral's four points are the scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation; the creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds) as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; the dominical sacraments of [[Baptism]] and [[Holy Communion]]; and the historic [[Episcopalian church governance#Anglican Communion|episcopate]].{{sfn|Sydnor|1980|p=80}}\n\n===Anglican divines===\n{{Redirect|Divines|the 2016 film|Divines (film)}}\n{{See also|John Donne|George Herbert|William Laud}}\n[[File:Thomas Cranmer by Gerlach Flicke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Cranmer]].]]\nWithin the Anglican tradition, \"divines\" are clergy of the [[Church of England]] whose theological writings have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship and spirituality and whose influence has permeated the Anglican Communion in varying degrees through the years.<ref>Sykes, Stephen, and John E.

What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by scripture and the ''Book of Common Prayer'', thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the [[Apostolic Fathers]].{{sfn|Booty|1998|p=163}} On the whole, Anglican divines view the ''[[via media]]'' of Anglicanism not as a compromise, but as \"a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly ''ecclesia Anglicana''.\"{{sfn|Booty|1998|pp=164}}\n\nThese theologians regard scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation. Reason and tradition, indeed, is extant in and presupposed by scripture, thus implying co-operation between God and humanity, God and nature, and between the sacred and secular. Faith is thus regarded as [[incarnation]]al and authority as dispersed.\n\n[[File:William Laud.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Laud]].]]\nAmongst the early Anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries, the names of [[Thomas Cranmer]], [[John Jewel]], [[Matthew Parker]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Lancelot Andrewes]], and [[Jeremy Taylor]] predominate. The influential character of Hooker's ''[[Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity]]'' cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight-volume work is primarily a treatise on church-state relations, but it deals comprehensively with issues of [[biblical interpretation]], [[soteriology]], ethics and [[sanctification]]. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.\n\nThe 18th century saw the rise of two important movements in Anglicanism: [[Cambridge Platonists|Cambridge Platonism]], with its mystical understanding of reason as the \"candle of the Lord\" and the [[evangelical revival]] with its emphasis on the personal experience of the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Cambridge Platonist movement evolved into a school called [[Latitudinarianism]], which emphasised reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences.\n\nThe evangelical revival, influenced by such figures as [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Simeon]], re-emphasised the importance of [[Sola fide|justification through faith]] and the consequent importance of personal conversion. Some in this movement, such as Wesley and [[George Whitefield]], took the message to the United States, influencing the [[First Great Awakening]] and creating an Anglo-American movement called [[Methodism]] that would eventually break away, structurally, from the Anglican churches after the American Revolution.\n\nBy the 19th century, there was a renewed interest in pre-Reformation English religious thought and practice. Theologians such as [[John Keble]], [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] and [[John Henry Newman]] had widespread influence in the realm of polemics, homiletics and theological and devotional works, not least because they largely repudiated the old high church tradition and replaced it with a dynamic appeal to antiquity which looked beyond the Reformers and Anglican formularies.{{sfn|Nockles|1994|pp=7\u20138, 113, 125, 127}} Their work is largely credited with the development of the [[Oxford Movement]], which sought to reassert Catholic identity and practice in Anglicanism.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kiefer |first=James E. |title=The Oxford Tractarians, Renewers of the Church |url=http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bio/249.html |work=Biographical Sketches of Memorable Christians of the Past |publisher=Society of Archbishop Justus |access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this movement, clergy such as the Bishop of Liverpool, [[J. C. Ryle]], sought to uphold the distinctly Reformed identity of the Church of England. He was not a servant of the status quo, but argued for a lively religion which emphasised grace, holy and charitable living and the plain use of the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'' (interpreted in a partisan evangelical way){{efn|The 19th-century evangelical interpretation of the Prayerbook, now less frequent, included celebration of Holy Communion while the priest was standing at the northern ''short side'' of the communion table. This misinterpretation was caused by the fact that the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'' retained two contradictory rubrics. From 1552 a rubric was retained that the priest should stand at the northern ''long side'' of a communion table standing east-west in the choir (the communicants sitting in the choir stalls by the northern and southern walls). From 1559 was retained the rubric that 'the chancels shall remain as they have done in times past', originally intended to protect the mediaeval interior of church buildings from calvinist vandalism, and \u2013 mainly neglected during the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I \u2013 it was not consented to generally before the reign of Charles II. During the reign of Elizabeth I, only the [[chapel royal|chapels royal]] retained the mediaeval position of the communion table, standing permanently north-south at the east wall of the choir. The parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, London, began to apply the Chapels Royal arrangement of the communion table in 1599 or 1605, and from there it began to spread. Archbishop [[William Laud]]'s attempt to make it mandatory in the 1630s backfired, with well known consequences. By the reign of Charles II, however, it was applied generally, and the original intention of the ''northward position rubric'' became unintelligible, and easily misunderstood.}} without additional rituals. [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], through such works as ''[[The Kingdom of Christ]]'', played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement, [[Christian socialism]]. In this, Maurice transformed Hooker's emphasis on the [[incarnation]]al nature of Anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice.\n\nIn the 19th century, Anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character, represented by the so-called \"Cambridge triumvirate\" of [[Joseph Lightfoot]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|F. J. A. Hort]] and [[Brooke Foss Westcott]]. Their orientation is best summed up by Lightfoot's observation that \"Life which Christ is and which Christ communicates, the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities, is active fellowship with God.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe earlier part of the 20th century is marked by [[Charles Gore]], with his emphasis on [[natural revelation]], and [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]]'s focus on Christianity and society, while from outside England, [[Robert Leighton (bishop)|Robert Leighton]], Archbishop of Glasgow, and several clergy from the United States have been suggested, such as [[William Porcher DuBose]], [[John Henry Hobart]] (1775\u20131830, Bishop of New York 1816\u201330), [[William Meade]], [[Phillips Brooks]], and [[Charles Brent]].{{sfn|Booty|1998|pp=164, 171\u2013172}}\n\n===Churchmanship===\n[[File:Tridentine mass.jpg|thumb|An eastward-facing [[Solemn High Mass]], a [[Catholic]] liturgical phenomenon which re-emerged in Anglicanism following the [[Oxford Movement|Catholic Revival]] of the nineteenth century.]]\n''[[Churchmanship]]'' can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy, piety and, to some extent, spirituality. Anglican diversity in this respect has tended to reflect the diversity in the tradition's Reformed and Catholic identity. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses and provinces may identify more closely with one or the other, or some mixture of the two.\n\nThe range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of introducing illegal ritual while, at the same time, others were criticised for engaging in public worship services with ministers of Reformed churches. Resistance to the growing acceptance and restoration of traditional Catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of Anglicanism ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the [[Free Church of England]] in England (1844) and the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] in North America (1873).<ref>[http://www.fcofe.org.uk/about_the_free_church_of_england.htm Accessed 9 November 2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119122715/http://www.fcofe.org.uk/about_the_free_church_of_england.htm |date=19 November 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://rechurch.org/about.html Reformed Episcopal Church website Accessed 17 March 2018]</ref>\n\n[[Anglo-Catholic]] (and some broad-church) Anglicans celebrate public liturgy in ways that understand worship to be something very special and of utmost importance. [[Vestments]] are worn by the clergy, sung settings are often used and [[incense]] may be used. Nowadays, in most Anglican churches, the Eucharist is celebrated in a manner similar to the usage of Catholics and some Lutherans though, in many churches, more traditional, \"pre\u2013Vatican II\", models of worship are common, (e.g. an \"eastward orientation\" at the altar). Whilst many Anglo-Catholics derive much of their liturgical practice from that of the pre-Reformation English church, others more closely follow traditional Roman Catholic practices.\n\nThe Eucharist may sometimes be celebrated in the form known as [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]], with a priest, deacon and [[subdeacon]] dressed in traditional vestments, with incense and [[Altar bell|sanctus bells]] and with prayers adapted from the [[Roman Missal]] or other sources by the celebrant. Such churches may also have forms of [[Eucharistic adoration]] such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. In terms of personal piety some Anglicans may recite the [[Anglican Rosary|Rosary]] and [[Angelus]], be involved in a devotional society dedicated to \"Our Lady\" (the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]]) and seek the intercession of the saints.\n\nIn recent years the prayer books of several provinces have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern [[Conciliarism]] (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and [[Oriental Orthodox]] elements in their liturgies, including introduction of the [[Trisagion]] and deletion of the [[filioque]] clause from the [[Nicene Creed]].\n\nFor their part, those [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] (and some broad-church) Anglicans who emphasise the more Protestant aspects of the Church stress the Reformation theme of [[Salvation#Christian views of salvation|salvation]] by grace through faith. They emphasise the two dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist, viewing the other five as \"lesser rites\". Some evangelical Anglicans may even tend to take the inerrancy of scripture literally, adopting the view of Article VI that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. Worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate, with greater emphasis on the [[Liturgy of the Word]] (the reading of the scriptures, the sermon and the intercessory prayers).\n\nThe Order for Holy Communion may be celebrated bi-weekly or monthly (in preference to the [[daily office]]s), by priests attired in [[choir habit]], or more regular clothes, rather than Eucharistic vestments. Ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the 17th-century Puritans \u2013 being a [[Reformed]] interpretation of the [[Ornaments Rubric]] \u2013 no candles, no incense, no bells and a minimum of manual actions by the presiding celebrant (such as touching the elements at the [[Words of Institution]]).\n\nIn recent decades there has been a growth of [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] worship among Anglicans. Both Anglo-Catholics and evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures, music, and other themes evident during the services of otherwise Anglo-Catholic or evangelical parishes.\n\nThe spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels. Many Anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the broad-church tradition and consider themselves an amalgam of evangelical and Catholic. Such Anglicans stress that Anglicanism is the \"''[[via media]]''\" (middle way) between the two major strains of Western Christianity and that Anglicanism is like a \"bridge\" between the two strains.\n\n===Sacramental doctrine and practice===\n{{Main|Anglican sacraments}}\nIn accord with its prevailing self-identity as a ''[[via media]]'' or \"middle path\" of [[Western Christianity]], Anglican sacramental theology expresses elements in keeping with its status as being both a church in the [[Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition as well as a [[English Reformation|Reformed]] church. With respect to sacramental theology the Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism places on the [[sacrament]]s as a means of [[Divine grace|grace]], [[sanctification]] and [[salvation]] as expressed in the church's [[liturgy]] and doctrine.\n\nOf the seven sacraments, all Anglicans recognise [[Baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]] as being directly instituted by Christ. The other five \u2013 [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession and absolution]], [[Christian view of marriage|Matrimony]], [[Confirmation (sacrament)|Confirmation]], [[Holy Orders]] (also called Ordination) and [[Anointing of the Sick]] (also called Unction) \u2013 are regarded variously as full sacraments by [[Anglo-Catholic]]s, many [[high church|high-church]] and some [[broad church|broad-church]] Anglicans, but merely as \"sacramental rites\" by other broad-church and [[low church|low-church]] Anglicans, especially [[evangelicalism|evangelical]]s associated with [[Reform (Anglican)|Reform UK]] and the [[Anglican Diocese of Sydney|Diocese of Sydney]].\n\n====Eucharistic theology====\n{{Main|Anglican eucharistic theology}}\nAnglican eucharistic theology is divergent in practice, reflecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition. Some [[Low Church]] Anglicans take a strictly memorialist ([[Zwingli]]an) view of the sacrament. In other words, they see Holy Communion as a memorial to Christ's suffering, and participation in the Eucharist as both a re-enactment of the Last Supper and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet \u2013 the fulfilment of the eucharistic promise.\n\nOther low-church Anglicans believe in the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] but deny that the presence of Christ is carnal or is necessarily localised in the bread and wine. Despite explicit criticism in the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]], many high-church or Anglo-Catholic Anglicans hold, more or less, the Catholic view of the real presence as expressed in the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]], seeing the Eucharist as a liturgical representation of Christ's atoning sacrifice with the elements actually transformed into Christ's body and blood.\n\nThe majority of Anglicans, however, have in common a belief in the real presence, defined in one way or another. To that extent, they are in the company of the continental reformer [[Martin Luther]] rather than [[Ulrich Zwingli]].\n\nA famous Anglican aphorism regarding Christ's presence in the sacrament, commonly misattributed to [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]], is first found in print in a poem by [[John Donne]]:{{sfn|May|2007|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nHe was the word that spake it,\nHe took the bread and brake it:\nAnd what that word did make it,\nI do believe and take it.{{sfn|May|2007|pp=55, 66}}</poem></blockquote>\n\nAn Anglican position on the eucharistic sacrifice (\"Sacrifice of the Mass\") was expressed in the response ''[[Saepius officio]]'' of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Papal Encyclical ''[[Apostolicae curae]]''.\n\nAnglican and Catholic representatives declared that they had \"substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\" in the 'Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine\" from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation (1971)<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/angl-comm-docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_1971_eucharistic-doctrine_en.html Vatican website]</ref> and the Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement (1979). The final response (1991) to these documents by the Vatican made it plain that it did not consider the degree of agreement reached to be satisfactory.\n\n==Practices==\n{{details|topic=the daily Anglican morning office|Morning Prayer (Anglican)}}\n{{See also|Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Prayer of Humble Access}}\nIn Anglicanism there is a distinction between liturgy, which is the formal public and communal worship of the Church, and personal prayer and devotion which may be public or private. Liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the Holy Eucharist (some call it Holy Communion or Mass), the other six Sacraments, and the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours.\n\n===Book of Common Prayer===\n[[File:Book of common prayer 1596.jpg|thumb|The 1596 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'']]\nThe ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (BCP) is the foundational prayer book of Anglicanism. The original book of 1549 (revised 1552) was one of the instruments of the [[English Reformation]], replacing the various \"uses\" or rites in Latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in the language of the people, so that \"now from henceforth all the Realm shall have but one use\". Suppressed under Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], it was revised in 1559, and then again in 1662, after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. This version was made mandatory in England and Wales by the [[Act of Uniformity 1662|Act of Uniformity]] and was in standard use until the mid-20th century.\n\nWith [[British Empire|British colonial]] expansion from the 17th century onwards, Anglican churches were planted around the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the ''Book of Common Prayer'' until they, like their parent church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, which come under the general heading of the [[Liturgical Movement]].\n\n===Worship===\n{{See also|Church of England parish church}}\nAnglican worship services are open to all visitors. Anglican worship originates principally in the reforms of [[Thomas Cranmer]], who aimed to create a set order of service like that of the pre-Reformation church but less complex in its seasonal variety and said in English rather than [[Latin]]. This use of a set order of service is not unlike the Catholic tradition. Traditionally the pattern was that laid out in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. Although many Anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language, the structures of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' are largely retained. Churches which call themselves Anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' in the shaping of their worship.\n\nAnglican worship, however, is as diverse as Anglican theology. A contemporary \"[[low church]]\" service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream non-Anglican Protestant churches. The service is constructed around a sermon focused on Biblical exposition and opened with one or more Bible readings and closed by a series of prayers (both set and extemporised) and hymns or songs. A \"[[high church|high-church]]\" or Anglo-Catholic service, by contrast, is usually a more formal [[liturgy]] celebrated by clergy in distinctive [[vestments]] and may be almost indistinguishable from a Roman Catholic service, often resembling the \"pre\u2013Vatican II\" [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine rite]].\n\nBetween these extremes are a variety of styles of worship, often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service. Anglican churches tend to have [[pew]]s or chairs and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the Gloria, Collect, Gospel reading, Creed and either the Preface or all of the Eucharistic Prayer. High Anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as Roman Catholics.\n\nOther more traditional Anglicans tend to follow the 1662 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', and retain the use of the King James Bible. This is typical in many Anglican cathedrals and particularly in [[Royal Peculiar]]s such as the [[Savoy Chapel]] and the [[Queen's Chapel]]. These services reflect the original Anglican doctrine and differ from the [[Traditional Anglican Communion]] in that they are in favour of women vicars and the ability of vicars to marry. These Anglican church services include classical music instead of songs, hymns from the [[New English Hymnal]] (usually excluding modern hymns such as Lord of the Dance), and are generally non-evangelical and formal in practice. Due to their association with royalty, these churches are generally host to staunch Anglicans who are strongly opposed to Catholicism.\n\nUntil the mid-20th century the main Sunday service was typically [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning prayer]], but the [[Eucharist]] has once again become the standard form of Sunday worship in many Anglican churches; this again is similar to Roman Catholic practice. Other common Sunday services include an early morning Eucharist without music, an abbreviated Eucharist following a service of morning prayer and a service of [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evening prayer]], sometimes in the form of sung [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]], usually celebrated between 3 and 6&nbsp;pm The late-evening service of [[Compline]] was revived in parish use in the early 20th century. Many Anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the Eucharist.\n\nAn Anglican service (whether or not a Eucharist) will include readings from the Bible that are generally taken from a standardised [[lectionary]], which provides for much of the Bible (and some passages from the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]]) to be read out loud in the church over a cycle of one, two or three years (depending on which eucharistic and office lectionaries are used, respectively). The [[sermon]] (or [[homily]]) is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length, often comparably short to sermons in evangelical churches. Even in the most informal Anglican services it is common for set prayers such as the weekly [[Collect]] to be read. There are also set forms for [[intercessory prayer]], though this is now more often extemporaneous. In high and Anglo-Catholic churches there are generally prayers for the dead.\n\nAlthough Anglican public worship is usually ordered according to the canonically approved services, in practice many Anglican churches use forms of service outside these norms. Liberal churches may use freely structured or experimental forms of worship, including patterns borrowed from ecumenical traditions such as those of [[Taiz\u00e9 Community]] or the [[Iona Community]].\n\n[[Anglo-Catholic]] parishes might use the modern Roman Catholic liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or more traditional forms, such as the [[Tridentine Mass]] (which is translated into English in the [[English Missal]]), the [[Anglican Missal]], or, less commonly, the [[Sarum Rite]]. Catholic devotions such as the [[Rosary]], [[Angelus]] and [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]] are also common among Anglo-Catholics.\n\n====Eucharistic discipline====\nOnly [[Baptism|baptised]] persons are eligible to receive communion,<ref name=\"communion\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.episcopalarchives.org/cgi-bin/acts/acts_resolution-complete.pl?resolution=2006-D084 |publisher=ECUSA |title=Resolution 2006-D084: Uphold Baptism as a Requirement of Receiving Holy Communion |work=The Acts of Convention |date=21 June 2006}}</ref> although in many churches communion is restricted to those who have not only been baptised but also [[Confirmation|confirmed]]. In many Anglican provinces, however, all baptised Christians are now often invited to receive communion and some dioceses have regularised a system for admitting baptised young people to communion before they are confirmed.\n\nThe discipline of fasting before communion is practised by some Anglicans. Most Anglican priests require the presence of at least one other person for the celebration of the Eucharist (referring back to Christ's statement in Matthew 18:20, \"When two or more are gathered in my name, I will be in the midst of them.\"), though some Anglo-Catholic priests (like Roman Catholic priests) may say private Masses. As in the Roman Catholic Church, it is a canonical requirement to use fermented wine for communion.\n\nUnlike in Roman Catholicism, the consecrated bread and wine are always offered to the congregation at a eucharistic service (\"communion in both kinds\"). This practice is becoming more frequent in the Roman Catholic Church as well, especially through the [[Neocatechumenal Way]]. In some churches the sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle or [[aumbry]] with a lighted candle or lamp nearby. In Anglican churches, only a priest or a bishop may be the celebrant at the Eucharist.\n\n===Divine office===\n[[File:Evensong in York Minster.jpg|thumb|Evensong at [[York Minster]]]]\nAll Anglican prayer books contain offices for [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]] (Matins) and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evening Prayer]] (Evensong). In the original ''Book of Common Prayer'' these were derived from combinations of the ancient monastic offices of [[Matins]] and [[Lauds]]; and [[Vespers]] and [[Compline]] respectively. The prayer offices have an important place in Anglican history.\n\nPrior to the [[Oxford Movement|Catholic revival]] of the 19th century, which eventually restored the [[Holy Eucharist]] as the principal Sunday liturgy, and especially during the 18th century, a morning service combining Matins, the [[Litany]] and ante-Communion comprised the usual expression of common worship; while Matins and Evensong were sung daily in cathedrals and some collegiate chapels. This nurtured a tradition of distinctive [[Anglican chant]] applied to the [[canticle]]s and [[psalm]]s used at the offices (although [[plainsong]] is often used as well).\n\nIn some official and many unofficial Anglican service books these offices are supplemented by other offices such as the [[Little Hours]] of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] and prayer during the day such as ([[Terce]], [[Sext]], [[None (liturgy)|None]] and [[Compline]]). Some Anglican monastic communities have a [[Daily Office]] based on that of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' but with additional antiphons and canticles, etc. for specific days of the week, specific psalms, etc. See, for example, [[Order of the Holy Cross]]<ref>[http://www.holycrossmonastery.com/ Holy Cross Monastery<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and Order of St Helena, editors, ''A Monastic Breviary'' (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow, 1976). The All Saints Sisters of the Poor,<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/xnomad4/index.html]  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> with convents in Catonsville, Maryland and elsewhere use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The [[Society of St. Francis]] publishes ''Celebrating Common Prayer'' which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.\n\nIn England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some other Anglican provinces the modern prayer books contain four offices:\n*Morning Prayer, corresponding to Matins, Lauds and Prime.\n*Prayer During the Day, roughly corresponding to the combination of Terce, Sext and None (Noonday Prayer in the USA)\n*Evening Prayer, corresponding to Vespers (and Compline).\n*Compline\n\nIn addition, most prayer books include a section of prayers and devotions for family use. In the US, these offices are further supplemented by an \"Order of Worship for the Evening\", a prelude to or an abbreviated form of Evensong, partly derived from [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] prayers. In the United Kingdom, the publication of ''Daily Prayer'', the third volume of ''[[Common Worship]]'' was published in 2005. It retains the services for Morning and Evening Prayer and Compline and includes a section entitled \"Prayer during the Day\". 'A New Zealand Prayer Book' of 1989 provides different outlines for Matins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as \"Midday Prayer\", \"Night Prayer\" and \"Family Prayer\".\n\nSome Anglicans who pray the office on daily basis use the present [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] of the Catholic Church. In many cities, especially in England, Anglican and Catholic priests and lay people often meet several times a week to pray the office in common. A small but enthusiastic minority use the [[Anglican Breviary]], or other translations and adaptations of the pre\u2013Vatican II Roman Rite and [[Sarum Rite]], along with supplemental material from cognate western sources, to provide such things as a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women and other additional material. Others may privately use idiosyncratic forms borrowed from a wide range of Christian traditions.\n\n==== {{anchor|Quires and Places where they sing}} \"Quires and Places where they sing\" ==== <!-- Please do not \"correct\" the capitalisation or spelling as it is a direct quote -->\n{{Main|Anglican church music}}\nIn the late medieval period, many English cathedrals and monasteries had established small choirs of trained [[lay clerk]]s and boy [[choir|choristers]] to perform [[polyphony|polyphonic]] settings of the [[Mass (music)|Mass]] in their [[Lady chapel]]s. Although these \"Lady Masses\" were discontinued at the Reformation, the associated musical tradition was maintained in the [[Elizabethan Settlement]] through the establishment of choral foundations for daily singing of the Divine Office by expanded choirs of men and boys. This resulted from an explicit addition by Elizabeth herself to the injunctions accompanying the 1559 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' (that had itself made no mention of choral worship) by which existing choral foundations and choir schools were instructed to be continued, and their endowments secured. Consequently, some thirty-four cathedrals, collegiate churches and royal chapels maintained paid establishments of lay singing men and choristers in the late 16th century.{{sfn|Mould|2007|p=94}}\n\nAll save four of these have \u2013 with an interruption during the [[English Interregnum|Commonwealth]] \u2013 continued daily choral prayer and praise to this day. In the Offices of [[Matins]] and [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|Evensong]] in the 1662 ''Book of Common Prayer'', these choral establishments are specified as \"Quires and Places where they sing\".\n\nFor nearly three centuries, this round of daily professional choral worship represented a tradition entirely distinct from that embodied in the intoning of [[Parish Clerk]]s, and the singing of \"[[West gallery music|west gallery choirs]]\" which commonly accompanied weekly worship in English parish churches. In 1841, the rebuilt [[Leeds Parish Church]] established a surpliced [[choir]] to accompany parish services, drawing explicitly on the musical traditions of the ancient choral foundations. Over the next century, the Leeds example proved immensely popular and influential for choirs in cathedrals, parish churches and schools throughout the Anglican communion.{{sfn|Mould|2007|p=177}} More or less extensively adapted, this choral tradition also became the direct inspiration for robed choirs leading congregational worship in a wide range of Christian denominations.\n\nIn 1719 the cathedral choirs of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]], [[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]] and [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]] combined to establish the annual [[Three Choirs Festival]], the precursor for the multitude of summer music festivals since. By the 20th century, the choral tradition had become for many the most accessible face of worldwide Anglicanism \u2013 especially as promoted through the regular broadcasting of choral evensong by the [[BBC]]; and also in the annual televising of the festival of [[Nine lessons and carols]] from [[King's College, Cambridge]]. Composers closely concerned with this tradition include [[Edward Elgar]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Gustav Holst]], [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. A number of important 20th-century works by non-Anglican composers were originally commissioned for the Anglican choral tradition \u2013 for example the ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' of [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the ''[[Nunc dimittis]]'' of [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]].\n\n==Organisation of the Anglican Communion==\n{{Main|Anglican Communion}}\n{{AnglicanCommunion}}\n\n===Principles of governance===\nContrary to popular misconception, the British monarch is not the constitutional \"head\" but in law the \"[[Supreme Governor]]\" of the Church of England, nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside England. The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and even this role is limited, as the Church presents the government with a short list of candidates to choose from. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives ''(see [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]])''. The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.\n\nA characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All thirty-nine provinces of the Anglican Communion are autonomous, each with their own [[primate (bishop)|primate]] and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these Communion provinces may exist subdivisions, called [[ecclesiastical province]]s, under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop.\n\nAll provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of [[diocese]]s, each under the jurisdiction of a bishop. In the Anglican tradition, bishops must be consecrated according to the strictures of [[apostolic succession]], which Anglicans consider one of the marks of [[Catholicism|Catholicity]]. Apart from bishops, there are two other orders of ordained ministry: [[deacon]] and priest.\n\nNo requirement is made for [[clerical celibacy]], though many Anglo-Catholic priests have traditionally been bachelors. Because of innovations that occurred at various points after the latter half of the 20th century, women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in some, and as bishops in a few provinces. [[Anglican religious order]]s and communities, suppressed in England during the Reformation, have re-emerged, especially since the mid-19th century, and now have an international presence and influence.\n\nGovernment in the Anglican Communion is [[synod]]ical, consisting of three houses of [[laity]] (usually elected parish representatives), clergy, and bishops. National, provincial, and diocesan synods maintain different scopes of authority, depending on their [[canon law|canons and constitutions]]. Anglicanism is not [[Congregationalist polity|congregational]] in its polity: it is the diocese, not the parish church, which is the smallest unit of authority in the church. ''(See [[Episcopal polity]])''.\n\n===Archbishop of Canterbury===\n[[File:Archbishcantarms.PNG|thumb|left|The Arms of the [[episcopal see|See]] of Canterbury.]]\nThe [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] has a precedence of honour over the other primates of the Anglican Communion, and for a province to be considered a part of the Communion means specifically to be in full communion with the [[episcopal see|See]] of [[Province of Canterbury|Canterbury]] -- though this principle is currently subject to considerable debate, especially among those in the so-called Global South, including American Anglicans.{{cn|date=June 2018}} The Archbishop is, therefore, recognised as ''[[primus inter pares]]'', or first amongst equals even though he does not exercise any direct authority in any [[province (Anglican)|province]] outside England, of which he is chief primate. [[Rowan Williams]], the Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, was the first archbishop appointed from outside the Church of England since the Reformation: he was formerly the [[Archbishop of Wales]].\n\nAs \"spiritual head\" of the Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury maintains a certain [[moral authority]], and has the right to determine which churches will be in communion with his [[Episcopal See|See]]. He hosts and chairs the [[Lambeth Conference]]s of Anglican Communion bishops, and decides who will be invited to them. He also hosts and chairs the [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]] and is responsible for the invitations to it. He acts as president of the secretariat of the Anglican Communion Office, and its deliberative body, the [[Anglican Consultative Council]].\n\n===Conferences===\nThe Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. All international bodies are consultative and collaborative, and their resolutions are not legally binding on the autonomous provinces of the Communion. There are three international bodies of note.\n\n* The [[Lambeth Conference]] is the oldest international consultation. It was first convened by Archbishop [[Charles Longley]] in 1867 as a vehicle for bishops of the Communion to \"discuss matters of practical interest, and pronounce what we deem expedient in resolutions which may serve as safe guides to future action.\" Since then, it has been held roughly every ten years. Invitation is by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n* The [[Anglican Consultative Council]] was created by a 1968 Lambeth Conference resolution, and meets [[wikt:biennial|biennially]]. The council consists of representative bishops, clergy, and laity chosen by the thirty-eight provinces. The body has a permanent secretariat, the Anglican Communion Office, of which the Archbishop of Canterbury is president.\n* The [[Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting]] is the most recent manifestation of international consultation and deliberation, having been first convened by Archbishop [[Donald Coggan]] in 1978 as a forum for \"leisurely thought, prayer and deep consultation\".{{sfn|Nunley|2005|p=133}}\n\n===Ordained ministry===\n[[File:Chasublepurple.jpg|right|thumb|A priest in Eucharistic [[vestment]]s.]]\n\n{{details|topic=the Anglican priesthood|Anglican ministry}}\nLike the Roman Catholic Church and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches, the Anglican Communion maintains the threefold ministry of [[deacon]]s, [[presbyter]]s (usually called \"[[priest]]s\") and [[bishop]]s.\n\n====Episcopate====\n{{Main|Bishop}}\nBishops, who possess the fullness of Christian priesthood, are the successors of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. [[Primate (bishop)|Primates]], archbishops and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] are all bishops and members of the [[historical episcopate]] who derive their authority through [[apostolic succession]] \u2013 an unbroken line of bishops that can be traced back to the 12 apostles of Jesus.\n\n====Priesthood====\nBishops are assisted by [[Episcopal priest|priests]] and [[deacon]]s. Most ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are priests, who usually work in parishes within a [[diocese]]. Priests are in charge of the spiritual life of parishes and are usually called the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] or [[vicar]]. A [[curate]] (or, more correctly, an 'assistant curate') is a term often used for a priest or deacon who assists the parish priest. Non-parochial priests may earn their living by any vocation, although employment by educational institutions or charitable organisations is most common. Priests also serve as chaplains of hospitals, schools, prisons, and in the armed forces.\n\nAn [[archdeacon]] is a priest or deacon responsible for administration of an [[archdeaconry]], which is often the name given to the principal subdivisions of a [[diocese]]. An archdeacon represents the diocesan bishop in his or her archdeaconry. In the [[Church of England]] the position of archdeacon can only be held by someone in priestly orders who has been ordained for at least six years. In some other parts of the Anglican Communion the position can also be held by deacons. In parts of the Anglican Communion where women cannot be ordained as priests or bishops but can be ordained as deacons, the position of archdeacon is effectively the most senior office an ordained woman can be appointed to.\n\nA [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] is a priest who is the principal cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.\n\nThe Anglican Communion recognises [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] ordinations as valid. Outside the Anglican Communion, Anglican ordinations (at least of male priests) are recognised by the [[Old Catholic Church]] Porvoo Communion Lutherans and various [[Independent Catholic]] churches.\n\n====Diaconate====\n[[File:Stoledeacon.jpg|thumb|The vestments of a deacon, including a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] over the left shoulder.]]\n{{Main|Deacon}}\nIn Anglican churches, deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalised inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned. Unlike Orthodox and most Roman Catholic deacons who may be married only before ordination, deacons are permitted to marry freely both before and after ordination, as are priests. Most deacons are preparing for priesthood and usually only remain as deacons for about a year before being ordained priests. However, there are some deacons who remain so.\n\nMany provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]] ordain both men and women as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priest after a short time as a deacon.\n\nDeacons, in some dioceses, can be granted licences to [[wedding|solemnise matrimony]], usually under the instruction of their parish priest and bishop. They sometimes officiate at [[Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament]] in churches which have this service. Deacons are not permitted to preside at the [[Eucharist]] (but can lead worship with the distribution of already consecrated communion where this is permitted),{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} [[absolution (religious)|absolve sins]], or [[blessing|pronounce a blessing]].{{sfn|Moss|1943|p=393}} It is the prohibition against deacons pronouncing blessings that leads some to believe that deacons cannot solemnise matrimony.\n\n===Laity===\nAll baptised members of the church are called Christian [[Faithful (baptized Catholic)|faithful]], truly equal in dignity and in the work to build the church. Some non-ordained people also have a formal public ministry, often on a full-time and long-term basis \u2013 such as [[lay reader]]s (also known as readers), [[churchwarden]]s, [[verger]]s and [[sexton (office)|sextons]]. Other lay positions include acolytes (male or female, often children), lay [[eucharistic minister]]s (also known as chalice bearers) and lay eucharistic visitors (who deliver consecrated bread and wine to \"shut-ins\" or members of the parish who are unable to leave home or hospital to attend the Eucharist). Lay people also serve on the parish altar guild (preparing the altar and caring for its candles, linens, flowers etc.), in the choir and as cantors, as ushers and greeters and on the church council (called the \"vestry\" in some countries) which is the governing body of a parish.\n\n===Religious orders===\n{{See also|Anglican religious order|Anglican devotions}}\nA small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its [[Anglican religious order|religious orders]] and communities. Shortly after the beginning of the [[Catholic Revival]] in the Church of England, there was a renewal of interest in re-establishing religious and monastic orders and communities. One of Henry VIII's earliest acts was their [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] and seizure of their assets. In 1841 [[Marian Rebecca Hughes]] became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the [[Province of Canterbury]] since the Reformation. In 1848, [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] became the superior of the [[Society of the Most Holy Trinity]] at Devonport, Plymouth, the first organised religious order. Sellon is called \"the restorer, after three centuries, of the religious life in the Church of England.\"<ref>{{Cite book|first=Thomas J.|last=Williams|title=Priscilla Lydia Sellon|location=London|publisher=SPCK|year=1950}}</ref> For the next one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated throughout the world, becoming a numerically small but disproportionately influential feature of global Anglicanism.\n\nAnglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of [[religious order|religious]]. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to God under the [[vow]]s of [[poverty, chastity and obedience]] (or in [[Benedictine]] communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practising a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the [[Breviary]] in choir, along with a daily [[Eucharist]], plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the contemplative orders and the active orders remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life. Another distinctive feature of Anglican religious life is the existence of some mixed-gender communities.\n\nSince the 1960s there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single [[convent]] or [[monastery]] with memberships of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world, and religious life in many parts of the Communion \u2013 especially in developing nations \u2013 flourishes.\n\nThe most significant growth has been in the [[Melanesia]]n countries of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The [[Melanesian Brotherhood]], founded at [[Tabalia]], [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]], in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican Community in the world with over 450 [[monk|brothers]] in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the [[Philippines]] and the United Kingdom. The [[Sisters of the Church]], started by Mother [[Emily Ayckbowm]] in England in 1870, has more [[nun|sisters]] in the Solomons than all their other communities. The [[Community of the Sisters of Melanesia]], started in 1980 by [[Sister Nesta Tiboe]], is a growing community of women throughout the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe [[Society of Saint Francis]], founded as a union of various [[Franciscan]] orders in the 1920s, has experienced great growth in the Solomon Islands. Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid-20s \u2013 vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course \u2013 making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries. Growth of religious orders, especially for women, is marked in certain parts of Africa.\n\n===Worldwide distribution===\n[[File:Anglican C., Porvoo C., Utrecht Union.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|A world map showing the Provinces of the '''Anglican Communion''' (Blue). Shown are the Churches in full communion with the Anglican Church: The Nordic Lutheran churches of the [[Porvoo Communion]] (Green), and the [[Old Catholic Church]]es in the [[Utrecht Union]] (Red).]]\n\nAnglicanism represents the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es.{{sfn|Worsley|2015}} The number of Anglicans in the world is over 85 million {{As of|2011|lc=y}}.<ref>[http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Christianity Major Branches of Religions]</ref> The 11 provinces in Africa saw growth in the last two decades. They now include 36.7&nbsp;million members, more Anglicans than there are in England. England remains the largest single Anglican province, with 26&nbsp;million members. In most industrialised countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th century. Anglicanism's presence in the rest of the world is due to large-scale emigration, the establishment of expatriate communities or the work of missionaries.\n\nThe [[Church of England]] has been a church of [[missionary|missionaries]] since the 17th century when the Church first left English shores with colonists who founded what would become the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa and established Anglican churches. For example, an Anglican chaplain, [[Robert Wolfall]], with [[Martin Frobisher]]'s [[Arctic]] expedition celebrated the Eucharist in 1578 in [[Frobisher Bay]].\n[[File:Jamestown Virginia ruin.JPG|thumb|1854 image of the ruins of [[Jamestown Church]], the first Anglican church in North America]]\nThe first Anglican church in the Americas was built at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607. By the 18th century, missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The great Church of England missionary societies were founded; for example the [[Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK) in 1698. [[Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts]] (SPG) in 1701, and the [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) in 1799.\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social oriented evangelism with societies such as the [[Church Pastoral Aid Society]] (CPAS) in 1836, [[Mission to Seafarers]] in 1856, [[Girls' Friendly Society]] (GFS) in 1875, [[Mothers' Union]] in 1876 and [[Church Army]] in 1882 all carrying out a personal form of evangelism.\n\nThe 20th century saw the Church of England developing new forms of evangelism such as the [[Alpha course]] in 1990 which was developed and propagated from [[Holy Trinity Brompton Church]] in London. In the 21st century, there has been renewed effort to reach children and youth. [[Fresh expressions]] is a Church of England missionary initiative to youth begun in 2005, and has ministries at a [[skate park]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070728180306/http://www.legacyweb.org/YouthCong.htm Legacy XS Youth Centre & Skatepark, St. George's, Benfleet]</ref> through the efforts of St George's Church, [[Benfleet Urban District|Benfleet]], Essex \u2013 [[Diocese of Chelmsford]] \u2013 or youth groups with evocative names, like the C.L.A.W (Christ Little Angels \u2013 Whatever!) youth group at [[Coventry Cathedral]]. And for the unchurched who do not actually wish to visit a bricks and mortar church there are Internet ministries such as the [[Diocese of Oxford]]'s online Anglican [[i-Church]] which appeared on the web in 2005.\n\n===Ecumenism===\n{{details|topic=the ongoing dialogue between Anglicanism and the wider Church|Anglican communion and ecumenism}}\n\nAnglican interest in [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue can be traced back to the time of the Reformation and dialogues with both Orthodox and Lutheran churches in the 16th century. In the 19th century, with the rise of the Oxford Movement, there arose greater concern for reunion of the churches of \"Catholic confession\". This desire to work towards full [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with other denominations led to the development of the [[Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral]], approved by the third [[Lambeth Conference]] of 1888. The four points (the sufficiency of scripture, the historic creeds, the two dominical sacraments, and the historic episcopate) were proposed as a basis for discussion, although they have frequently been taken as a non-negotiable bottom-line for any form of reunion.\n\n===Theological diversity===\nAnglicanism in general has always sought a balance between the emphases of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], while tolerating a range of expressions of [[evangelicalism]] and ceremony. Clergy and laity from all Anglican [[churchmanship]] traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing movement.\n\nWhile there are [[high church|high-church]], [[broad church|broad-church]], and [[low church|low-church]] Continuing Anglicans, many Continuing churches are [[Anglo-Catholic]] with highly ceremonial liturgical practices. Others belong to a more evangelical or [[low church|low-church]] tradition and tend to support the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] and simpler worship services. [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Morning Prayer]], for instance, is often used instead of the [[Holy Eucharist]] for Sunday worship services, although this is not necessarily true of all low church parishes.\n\nMost Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version for their services instead. In addition, Anglo-Catholic bodies may use the [[Anglican Missal]] or [[English Missal]] in celebrating the Eucharist.\n\n==== Conflicts within Anglicanism ====\nA changing focus on social issues after the [[Second World War]] led to Lambeth Conference resolutions countenancing [[contraception]] and the [[remarriage]] of divorced persons. They led to most provinces approving the [[ordination of women]]. In more recent years it has led some jurisdictions to permit the ordination of people in same-sex relationships and to authorise rites for the blessing of same-sex unions (see [[Homosexuality and Anglicanism]]). \"The more liberal provinces that are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow for same-sex unions include Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, South India, South Africa, the US and Wales.\"<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 January 2016 |title=Church Split over Homosexuality Would be a Failure \u2013 Welby |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35278124 |work=BBC News |access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref> More conservative elements within and outside of Anglicanism (primarily African churches and factions within North American Anglicanism) have opposed these proposals.<ref name=\"SexTeaching\">{{cite web |last=Olson |first=Matthew |date=12 December 2013 |title=Anglicans and Sexual Contradictions |url=http://answeringprotestants.com/2013/12/12/anglicans-and-sexual-contradictions/ |website=Answering Protestants |access-date=1 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSome liberal and moderate Anglicans see this opposition as representing a new [[fundamentalism]] within Anglicanism. Others see the advocacy for these proposals as representing a breakdown of Christian theology and commitment. The lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments (see [[Anglican realignment]]). Some Anglicans opposed to various liberalising changes, in particular the ordination of women, have become Roman Catholics or Orthodox. Others have, at various times, joined the [[Continuing Anglican movement]].\n\nThese latter trends reflect a countervailing tendency in Anglicanism towards insularity, reinforced perhaps by the \"big tent\" nature of the tradition which seeks to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies. The insularity and complacency of the early established [[Church of England]] has tended to influence Anglican self-identity and inhibit engagement with the broader society in favour of internal debate and dialogue.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Nonetheless, there is significantly greater cohesion among Anglicans when they turn their attention outward.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==Continuing Anglican movement==\n{{Main|Continuing Anglican movement}}\nThe term \"[[Continuing Anglicanism]]\" refers to a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the [[Anglican Communion]] in the belief that traditional forms of Anglican faith, worship and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades. They therefore claim that they are \"continuing\" traditional Anglicanism.\n\nThe modern Continuing Anglican movement principally dates to the [[Congress of St. Louis]], held in the United States in 1977, where participants rejected changes that had been made in the Episcopal Church's ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and also the Episcopal Church's approval of the [[ordination of women]] to the priesthood. More recent changes in the North American churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the introduction of same-sex marriage rites and the ordination of gay and lesbian people to the [[priesthood]] and [[Bishop|episcopate]], have created further separations.\n\nContinuing churches have generally been formed by people who have left the Anglican Communion. The original Anglican churches are charged by the Continuing Anglicans with being greatly compromised by secular cultural standards and liberal theology. Many Continuing Anglicans believe that the faith of some churches in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury has become [[heterodox|unorthodox]] and therefore have not sought to also be in communion with him.\n\nThe original generation of continuing parishes in the United States were found mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal churches. The 2007\u201308 ''Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes'', published by the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen, contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican realignment movement, a more recent wave of Anglicans withdrawing from the Anglican Communion's North American provinces.\n\n==Social activism==\n[[File:Christchurch Cathedral - Dublin.jpg|thumb|[[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]] in Dublin.]]\nA concern for social justice can be traced to very early Anglican beliefs, relating to an intertwined theology of God, nature, and humanity. The Anglican theologian Richard Hooker wrote in his book ''The Works of that Learned and Judicious Divine'' that, \"God hath created nothing simply for itself, but each thing in all things, and of every thing each part in other have such interest, that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say, 'I need thee not.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Works of that Learned and Judicious Divine|last=Hooker|first=Richard|publisher=Oxford, The Clarendon press|year=1888|isbn=|location=|pages=313}}</ref> Such statements demonstrate a theological Anglican interest in social activism, which has historically appeared in movements such as evangelical Anglican William Wilberforce's campaign against slavery in the 18th century, or 19th century issues concerning industrialisation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Church Schism & Corruption|last=Maseko|first=Achim Nkosi|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=9781409221869|location=|pages=204}}</ref>\n\n=== Working conditions and Christian socialism ===\nLord Shaftesbury, a devout evangelical, campaigned to improve the conditions in factories, in mines, for chimney sweeps, and for the education of the very poor. For years he was chairman of the [[Ragged school|Ragged School]] Board.<ref>J. Wesley Bready, ''Lord Shaftesbury and social-industrial progress'' (1927).</ref> [[Frederick Denison Maurice]] was a leading figure advocating reform, founding so-called \"producer's co-operatives\" and the [[Working Men's College]]. His work was instrumental in the establishment of the [[Christian socialism|Christian socialist]] movement, although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but, \"a Tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor\",{{sfn|Norman|1976|pp=171\u2013172}} influenced Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that, \"the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life. Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of [[William Temple (archbishop)|William Temple]] in the 1930s and 1940s.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Pacifism===\nA question of whether or not Christianity is a [[pacifist]] religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. The leading Anglican spokesman for pacifist ideas, 1914 to 1945, was [[Ernest Barnes]], bishop of Birmingham from 1924\u20131953.  He opposed both world wars.<ref>Stephen Parker, \"\u2018Blessed are the Pacifists':  E. W. Barnes of Birmingham and Pacifism, 1914\u201345,\" ''Midland History'' 34#2 (2009) 204\u2013219.</ref> In 1937, the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including [[Vera Brittain]], [[Evelyn Underhill]], and the former British political leader [[George Lansbury]]. Furthermore, [[Dick Sheppard (priest)|Dick Sheppard]], who during the 1930s was one of Britain's most famous Anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for [[BBC Radio]], founded the [[Peace Pledge Union]] a secular pacifist organisation for the non-religious that gained considerable support throughout the 1930s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pat Starkey|title=I Will Not Fight: Conscientious Objectors and Pacifists in the North West During the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KaZIfHQHbkC&pg=PA4|year=1992|publisher=Liverpool UP|page=4}}</ref>\n\nWhilst never actively endorsed by Anglican churches, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian \"[[Just War]]\" doctrine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ploughshares.ca/pl_publications/no-war-just-war-just-peace-statements-by-the-anglican-church-of-canada-1934-2004/|title=No War, Just War, Just Peace: Statements by the Anglican Church of Canada 1934-2004|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/just-war-theory|title=Just War Theory|date=2012-05-22|work=Episcopal Church|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}</ref> The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remain highly active throughout the Anglican world. It rejects this doctrine of \"just war\" and seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the pacifism inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's [[Sermon on the Mount]]. The principles of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship are often formulated as a statement of belief that \"Jesus' teaching is incompatible with the waging of war ... that a Christian church should never support or justify war ... [and] that our Christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of war.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Who We Are |url=http://www.anglicanpeacemaker.org.uk |publisher=Anglican Pacifist Fellowship |access-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nConfusing the matter was the fact that the 37th Article of Religion in the ''Book of Common Prayer'' states that \"it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.\" Therefore, the Lambeth Council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the Council.\n\nThis statement was strongly reasserted when \"the 67th General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirms the statement made by the Anglican Bishops assembled at Lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979, calling \"Christian people everywhere ... to engage themselves in non-violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged, recognising that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly... this General Convention, in obedience to this call, urges all members of this Church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate, those who engaged in such non-violent action, and particularly those who suffer for conscience' sake as a result; and be it further Resolved, that this General Convention calls upon all members of this Church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives.\"\n\n===After World War II===\n\n[[File:Justin Welby at Seoul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|[[Justin Welby]] in South Korea. As the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Welby is the symbolic head of the international [[Anglican Communion]].]]\n\nThe focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the [[Second World War]]. On the one hand, the growing independence and strength of Anglican churches in the global south brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty, the inequitable distribution of resources, and the lingering effects of colonialism. In this regard, figures such as [[Desmond Tutu]] and [[Ted Scott]] were instrumental in mobilising Anglicans worldwide against the [[apartheid]] policies of South Africa. Rapid social change in the industrialised world during the 20th century compelled the church to examine issues of gender, sexuality and marriage.\n\n==Ordinariates within the Roman Catholic Church==\nOn 4 November 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued an [[apostolic constitution]], ''[[Anglicanorum Coetibus]]'', to allow groups of former Anglicans to enter into [[full communion]] with the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] as members of [[personal ordinariate]]s.{{sfn|Miller|2011}} The 20 October 2009 announcement of the imminent constitution mentioned:\n\n{{quote|Today's announcement of the Apostolic Constitution is a response by Pope Benedict XVI to a number of requests over the past few years to the Holy See from groups of Anglicans who wish to enter into full visible communion with the Roman Catholic Church, and are willing to declare that they share a common Catholic faith and accept the Petrine ministry as willed by Christ for his Church.\n\nPope Benedict XVI has approved, within the Apostolic Constitution, a canonical structure that provides for Personal Ordinariates, which will allow former Anglicans to enter full communion with the Catholic Church while preserving elements of distinctive Anglican spiritual patrimony.\n\nThe announcement of this Apostolic Constitution brings to an end a period of uncertainty for such groups who have nurtured hopes of new ways of embracing unity with the Catholic Church. It will now be up to those who have made requests to the Holy See to respond to the Apostolic Constitution.|The Archbishop of Westminster and The Archbishop of Canterbury<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Nichols |first1=Vincent |author1-link=Vincent Nichols |last2=Williams |first2=Rowan |author2-link=Rowan Williams|date=20 October 2009 |title=Joint Statement by the Archbishop of Westminster and the Archbishop of Canterbury |url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/10/20/ACNS4662 |publisher=Anglican Communion News Service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023050940/http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2009/10/20/ACNS4662 |archive-date=23 October 2009 |access-date=20 October 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nFor each personal ordinariate the [[Ordinary (officer)|ordinary]] may be a former Anglican bishop or priest.

[[Omonoia Square]], ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u039f\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}) is the oldest square in Athens. It is surrounded by hotels and fast food outlets, and contains a train station used by the [[Athens Metro]] and the Ilektrikos, named [[Omonoia station]]. The square is the focus for celebration of sporting victories, as seen after the country's winning of the [[Euro 2004]] and the [[Eurobasket 2005]] tournaments.\n* '''Metaxourgeio''' ({{lang-el|\u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03be\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03bf}}) is a neighborhood of Athens. The neighborhood is located north of the historical centre of Athens, between Kolonos to the east and Kerameikos to the west, and north of Gazi. [[Metaxourgeio]] is frequently described as a transition neighborhood. After a long period of abandonment in the late 20th century, the area is acquiring a reputation as an artistic and fashionable neighborhood following the opening of art galleries, museums, restaurants and caf\u00e9s. [1] Local efforts to beautify and invigorate the neighborhood have reinforced a sense of community and artistic expression. Anonymous art pieces containing quotes and statements in both English and Ancient Greek have sprung up throughout the neighborhood, bearing statements such as \"Art for art's sake\" (\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd). [[Guerilla gardening]] has also helped to beautify the area.\n* '''Psiri and Gazi''' \u2013 The reviving [[Psiri]] ({{lang-el|\u03a8\u03c5\u03c1\u03c1\u03ae}}) neighbourhood \u2013 also known as Athens's \"meat packing district\" \u2013 is dotted with renovated former mansions, artists' spaces, and small gallery areas. A number of its renovated buildings also host fashionable bars, making it a hotspot for the city in the last decade, while live music restaurants known as \"rebetadika\", after [[rebetiko]], a unique form of music that blossomed in [[Syros]] and Athens from the 1920s until the 1960s, are to be found. Rebetiko is admired by many, and as a result rebetadika are often crammed with people of all ages who will sing, dance and drink till dawn.\n\nThe [[Gazi, Athens|Gazi]] ({{lang-el|\u0393\u03ba\u03ac\u03b6\u03b9}}) area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the ''[[Technopolis (Gazi)|Technopolis]]'' cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's \"[[Gay village]]\".

In ancient times the port of [[Piraeus]] was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an [[Developed country|industrial nation]].<ref>[http://www.gto.gr/athens/athens/athens.html Greek Tourist Organizer] \u2013 Retrieved on 6 January 2007</ref> The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new [[Athens International Airport|Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport]] and the [[Attiki Odos]], the freeway that cuts across [[Attica]]).

However, Athens, [[Bronze Age collapse|like many other Bronze Age settlements]], went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Duchy of Athens (de la Roche family).svg|alt=|left|thumb|156x156px|Coat of Arms of the [[Duchy of Athens]] during the rule of the [[de la Roche family]] (13th century)]]\n[[Iron Age]] burials, in the [[Kerameikos]] and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900&nbsp;BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region.<ref>Osborne, R. 1996, 2009. ''Greece in the Making 1200 \u2013 479&nbsp;BC''.</ref> The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and [[Sparta]].\n\n[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|[[Delian League]], under the leadership of Athens before the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431&nbsp;BC]]\n\nBy the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of [[Solon]]. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by [[Cleisthenes]] in 508&nbsp;BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the [[Ionian Revolt|rebellion of the Ionian cities]] against [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule. In the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]] Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at [[Battle of Marathon|Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC, and crucially at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] in 480&nbsp;BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] within one year, after a heroic resistance at [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] by [[Sparta]]ns and other Greeks led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BHe0KeXyL_AC&pg=PA34&dq=persians+sack+athens&hl=nl&sa=X&ei=e0GaVI3CBsWzUdykg6gL&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=persians%20sack%20athens&f=false|title=Nothing Less than Victory: Decisive Wars and the Lessons of History|accessdate=24 December 2014}}</ref> after both [[Boeotia]] and [[Attica]] fell to the Persians.\n\nThe decades that followed became known as the [[Fifth-century Athens|Golden Age of Athenian democracy]], during which time Athens became the leading city of [[Ancient Greece]], with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for [[western culture|Western civilization]]. The playwrights [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], the physician [[Hippocrates]], and the philosopher [[Socrates]]. Guided by [[Pericles]], who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the [[Parthenon]]), as well as empire-building via the [[Delian League]]. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404&nbsp;BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival [[Sparta]].\n\nBy the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of [[Macedon]] was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338&nbsp;BC the armies of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor [[Hadrian]], in the 2nd century CE, constructed a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]].\n\nBy the end of [[Late Antiquity]], the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries CE, and was relatively prosperous during the [[Crusades]], benefiting from Italian trade. After the [[Fourth Crusade]] the [[Duchy of Athens]] was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and entered a long period of decline.\n\n[[File:Temple of Iupiter Olympios in Athens (1821).jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] with river [[Ilisos]] by [[Edward Dodwell]], 1821]]\n[[File:Peter von Hess - The Entry of King Othon of Greece in Athens - WGA11387.jpg|thumb|''The Entry of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] in Athens'', [[Peter von Hess]], 1839.]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time, it was reduced to a town of about 4,000 people in a loose swarm of houses along the foot of the Acropolis. The first [[King of Greece]], Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects [[Stamatios Kleanthis]] and [[Eduard Schaubert]] to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.\n\nThe first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the [[Acropolis]], the ancient cemetery of [[Kerameikos]] and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the [[Greek Parliament]]), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern [[Olympic Games]]. During the 1920s a number of [[Greek refugees]], expelled from [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] after the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]], swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following [[World War II]], and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.\n\nIn the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the [[Attiki Odos]] motorway, the expansion of the [[Athens Metro]], and the new [[Athens International Airport]]), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main article|Culture of Greece}}\n[[File:From Temple of Olympian Zeus to Lycabetus Athens Greece.jpg|alt=|thumb|From the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] to the [[Mount Lycabettus|Lycabettus hill]], as seen from the roof terrace of the \"Royal Olympic\" hotel, Athens, Greece.]]\n[[File:Academy of Athens - interior.jpg|alt=|thumb|Interior of the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]], designed by [[Theophil Hansen]].]]\n\n=== Archaeological hub ===\nThe city is a world centre of [[archaeology|archaeological research]]. Along with  national institutions, such as the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|Athens University]] and  the [[Archaeological Society of Athens|Archaeological Society]], there are multiple archaeological Museums including the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]], the [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art|Cycladic Museum]], the [[Epigraphy|Epigraphic]] Museum, the [[Byzantine & Christian Museum]], as well as museums at the ancient [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]], [[Acropolis Museum|Acropolis]], [[Kerameikos]], and the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]].  The city is also home to the [[Democritus|Demokritos]] laboratory for [[Archaeological science|Archaeometry]], alongside regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the [[Minister for Culture (Greece)|Greek Department of Culture]].\n\nAthens hosts 17 [[List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece|Foreign Archaeological Institutes]] which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions, each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{see also|Modern architecture in Athens}}\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 27 Zappeion.jpg|thumb|The [[Zappeion]] Hall]]\n[[File:Griechisches Parlament nachts (Zuschnitt).jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Hellenic Parliament]]]]\n[[File:Aigyptou Square Athens.JPG|thumb|Two apartment buildings in central Athens.

They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style.\n\nFor the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as [[Eclecticism]], especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the [[Old Royal Palace]] was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, [[Baron Theophil von Hansen|Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]] and [[Ernst Ziller]] took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Athens Academy]] and the [[Zappeion]] Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann]]'s [[Iliou Melathron]].\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, [[Modern architecture]] including [[Bauhaus]] and [[Art Deco]] began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include [[Kolonaki]], and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include [[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]].<ref>[[Helen Fessas-Emmanouil|Fessas-Emmanouil, Helen]].

Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly [[Drama (Art Form)|dramatic forms of Art]], they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include [[Orestis Makris]], [[Kalouta sisters]], [[Vasilis Avlonitis]], [[Afroditi Laoutari]], [[Eleni Papadaki]], [[Marika Nezer]], [[Marika Krevata]] and others. After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition. Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the [[Tango (dance)|tango]], [[waltz]], [[Swing music|swing]], [[foxtrot]], some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. [[Nikos Gounaris]] was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.\n\nIn 1923, after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], many [[ethnic Greeks]] from [[Asia Minor]] fled to Athens as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them [[Rebetiko]] music, making it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the [[La\u00efko]] music.

In [[Association football|football]], [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] have dominated the domestic competitions, [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] made it to the [[1971 European Cup Final]], while [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] is the other member of the [[P.O.K.|big three]]. These clubs also have basketball teams; [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] are among the top powers in European basketball, having won the [[Euroleague Basketball|Euroleague]] six times and three respectively, whilst [[AEK Athens B.C.|AEK Athens]] was the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any team sport.\n\nOther notable clubs within Athens are [[Athinaikos]], [[Panionios]], [[Atromitos F.C.|Atromitos]], [[Apollon Smyrni F.C.|Apollon]], [[Panellinios G.S.|Panellinios]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus]], [[Maroussi BC|Maroussi BCE]] and [[Peristeri B.C.]]. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.\n{{wide image|Interior of OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall, Athens.jpg|align-cap=center|600px|Interior of the [[Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall]]}}\nThe Athens area encompasses a variety of [[terrain]], notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a [[mountain range]]. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on [[hiking|foot]] and [[Mountain biking|bike]].\n\nBeyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include [[skiing]], [[rock climbing]], [[hang gliding]] and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the [[Sierra Club]], which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.\n\n==== Sports clubs ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"|Notable sport clubs based inside the boundaries of [[Athens#Municipality (City) of Athens|Athens Municipality]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Club\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Founded\n!Sports\n!District\n!Achievements\n|-\n|[[Panellinios G.S.]]||1891||Basketball, Volleyball, [[Handball]], Track and Field and others ||[[Kypseli, Athens|Kypseli]]||Panhellenic titles in Basketball, Volleyball, Handball, many honours in Track and Field\n|-\n|[[GS Apollon Smyrnis|Apollon Smyrni]]||1891<br/><small>(originally in [[Smyrni]])</small>||Football, Basketball, Volleyball and others ||[[Rizoupoli]]||Earlier long-time presence in A Ethniki\n|-\n|[[Ethnikos G.S.

Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000<ref name=tung2/> and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the [[Kallimarmaro]] Stadium, and [[Zappeion]] were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount [[Penteli, Greece|Penteli]], the same material used for construction of the [[Parthenon]].\n\n===== 1906 Summer Olympics =====\n{{Main article|1906 Intercalated Games}}\nThe [[1906 Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]], or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics.

From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.\n\nAlthough the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5&nbsp;billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern [[urban planning|urban development]].<ref name=olyy>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/08/29/closing.ceremony/ |title=Athens bids farewell to the Games |date=30 August 2004 |accessdate=29 March 2007 |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games.

Historians confirm that [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from [[Senegal]] lived in St. Christopher in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the [[Leeward Islands]]. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence of at least 100 enslaved people by 1683.

Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]], against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two Anguillian Revolutions in 1967 and 1969 headed by Atlin Harrigan<ref>[http://www.gov.ai/documents/budget/Budget_2009.pdf Budget Address 2009, \"Strengthening the Collective: We are the Solution\"]</ref> and [[Ronald Webster]]. The island briefly operated as the independent \"[[Republic of Anguilla]]\". The goal of the revolution was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis and a return to being a British colony. British authority was fully restored in July 1971; in 1980, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British [[Crown colony]] (now a [[British overseas territory]]).<ref name=\"Introduction ::Anguilla\"/>\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|right|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]\n\n===Political system===\n{{Main|Politics of Anguilla}}\n{{See also|Law of Anguilla}}\nAnguilla is an internally self-governing [[British overseas territory|overseas territory]] of the United Kingdom. Its politics take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[Chief Minister]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe [[United Nations Committee on Decolonization]] includes Anguilla on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]]. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Anguilla House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. {{clear left}}\n\n===Defence===\nAs a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for Anguilla's military defence, although there are no active [[garrisons]] or armed forces present. Anguilla has a small [[marine police]] force, comprising around 32 personnel, which operates one [[VT Group|VT Halmatic]] M160-class 52-foot fast [[patrol boat]].\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographics ===\n{{Main|Demographics of Anguilla}}\nThe majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).\n\n72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the United States, United Kingdom, [[St Kitts & Nevis]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Nigeria]].\n\n2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of Chinese, Indian and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.\n\n=== Religion ===\nChristian churches did not have a consistent or strong presence during the initial period of English colonisation. Spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins. As early as 1813, Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy among converts.<ref>Walicek, Don E. 2011. \"Christianity, Literacy, and Creolization in Nineteenth-Century Anguilla.\" In Anansi's Defiant Webs, Contact, Continuity, Convergence, and Complexity in the Language, Literatures and Cultures of the Greater Caribbean, ed. by N.

Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with [[Antillean Creole]] ('French Creole'), spoken in French islands such as [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]). It is referred to locally by terms such as \"dialect\" (pronounced \"dialek\"), [http://whatwedoinanguilla.com/language/ Anguilla Talk or \"Anguillian\"]. It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean, in terms of its structural features and to the extent of being considered one single language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aig|title=Antigua and Barbuda Creole English|work=Ethnologue}}</ref>\n\nLinguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] and the Windward Coast.<ref>Singler, John. 1993.

The use of Ashmore Island for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. The Australian Government argued that as Australia was not the country of first asylum for these \"[[boat people]]\", Australia did not have a responsibility to accept them.\n\nA number of things were done to discourage the use of the Territory for this purpose, such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called [[Pacific Solution]] of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces; and finally excising the Territory and many other small islands from the [[Australian migration zone]].\n\nTwo boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore Island after failed attempts by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Geography|Islands|Australia}}\n* [[Immigration detention in Australia]]\n* [[Siev 36]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Ashmore and Cartier Islands}}\n{{Commons category|Ashmore and Cartier Islands}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|at|Ashmore and Cartier Islands}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050306222710/http://www.ga.gov.au/education/facts/dimensions/externalterr/ashmore.htm Geoscience Australia\u2014Ashmore and Cartier Islands]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050416130424/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/mpa/ashmore/ Department of the Environment and Heritage\u2014Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve]\n* [http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-reserves/north-west/cartier Department of the Environment and Heritage\u2014Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve]\n* [http://islands.unep.ch/IJA.htm First on list of Australian islands]\n* \"Ashmore Reef Belongs to Indonesia,\" posted on East Timor Action Network.

It derives from [[fluid dynamics]]. See [[acoustics]] for the [[engineering]] approach.\n\nPropagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of continuity (conservation of [[mass]]) and an equation of motion (conservation of [[momentum]]) .  With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:\n: <math>\n  \\begin{align}\n     \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\kappa~\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} & = 0  \\qquad \\text{(Mass balance)} \\\\\n     \\rho_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla p & = 0  \\qquad \\text{(Momentum balance)}\n  \\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math>p(\\mathbf{x}, t)</math> is the acoustic pressure and <math>\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)</math> is the [[flow velocity]] vector, <math>\\mathbf{x}</math> is the vector of spatial coordinates <math>x, y, z</math>, <math>t</math> is the time, <math>\\rho_0</math> is the static mass density of the medium and <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[bulk modulus]] of the medium.

These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.\n\n====Assumption 1: Newtonian fluid====\nIn acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]].  For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the flow velocity by\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mu~\\left[\\nabla\\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla\\mathbf{u})^T\\right] +\n       \\lambda~(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})~\\boldsymbol{I}\n </math>\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the shear [[viscosity]] and <math>\\lambda</math> is the [[bulk viscosity]].\n\nTherefore, the divergence of <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}</math> is given by\n:<math>\n  \\begin{align}\n   \\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau} \\equiv \\cfrac{\\partial s_{ij}}{\\partial x_i} & = \n     \\mu \\left[\\cfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}+\\cfrac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\\right] + \\lambda~\\left[\\cfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_k}\\right)\\right]\\delta_{ij} \\\\\n    & = \\mu~\\cfrac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} + \\mu~\\cfrac{\\partial^2 u_j}{\\partial x_i\\partial x_i} + \\lambda~\\cfrac{\\partial^2 u_k}{\\partial x_k\\partial x_j} \\\\\n    & = (\\mu + \\lambda)~\\cfrac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j} + \\mu~\\cfrac{\\partial^2 u_j}{\\partial x_i^2} \\\\\n    & \\equiv (\\mu + \\lambda)~\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) + \\mu~\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u} ~.\n   \\end{align}\n </math>\nUsing the identity <math>\\nabla^2\\mathbf{u} = \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) - \\nabla\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u}</math>, we have\n:<math>\n  \\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = (2\\mu + \\lambda)~\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) -\n      \\mu~\\nabla\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u}~.\n  </math>\nThe equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as\n:<math>\n   \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\right) = -\\nabla p + (2\\mu + \\lambda)~\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) -\n      \\mu~\\nabla\\times\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u} + \\rho\\mathbf{g}\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 2: Irrotational flow====\nFor most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the [[vorticity]] is zero.  In that case\n:<math>\n   \\nabla\\times\\mathbf{u} = 0\n </math>\nand the momentum equation reduces to\n:<math>\n   \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\right) = -\\nabla p + (2\\mu + \\lambda)~\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u}) + \\rho\\mathbf{g}\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 3: No body forces====\nAnother frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible.  The momentum equation then further simplifies to\n:<math>\n   \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\right) = -\\nabla p + (2\\mu + \\lambda)~\\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u})\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 4: No viscous forces====\nAdditionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form\n:<math>\n   \\rho \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\right) = -\\nabla p\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 5: Small disturbances====\nAn important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small.  This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation.  Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field (<math>\\langle\\cdot\\rangle</math>) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field (<math>\\tilde{\\cdot}</math>) that varies in space and time.  That is\n:<math>\n   p = \\langle p\\rangle + \\tilde{p} ~;~~\n   \\rho = \\langle\\rho\\rangle + \\tilde{\\rho} ~;~~\n   \\mathbf{u} = \\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n </math>\nand\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle p \\rangle}{\\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle \\rho \\rangle}{\\partial t} = 0 ~;~~\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{0} ~.\n </math>\nThen the momentum equation can be expressed as\n:<math>\n   \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right] \\left[\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t}  + \\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\right] \\cdot \\nabla \\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\right]\\right] = -\\nabla \\left[\\langle p\\rangle+\\tilde{p}\\right]\n </math>\nSince the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have\n:<math>\n  \\begin{align}\n   \\langle\\rho\\rangle~\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t} & +\n   \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\cdot\\nabla \\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\right]+\n   \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\cdot\\nabla\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} +\n     \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\nabla\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\right] \\\\\n   & = -\\nabla \\left[\\langle p\\rangle+\\tilde{p}\\right]\n  \\end{align}\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 6: Homogeneous medium====\nNext we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables\n<math>\\langle p \\rangle</math> and <math>\\langle \\rho \\rangle</math> have zero gradients, i.e.,\n:<math>\n  \\nabla\\langle p \\rangle =  0 ~;~~ \\nabla\\langle \\rho \\rangle = 0 ~.\n </math>\nThe momentum equation then becomes\n:<math>\n   \\langle\\rho\\rangle~\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t} +\n   \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\cdot\\nabla \\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\right]+\n   \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\cdot\\nabla\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} +\n     \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\cdot\\nabla\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\\right]\n   = -\\nabla\\tilde{p}\n </math>\n\n====Assumption 7: Medium at rest====\nAt this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, which implies that the mean flow velocity is zero, i.e., <math>\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle = 0 </math>.  Then the balance of momentum reduces to\n:<math>\n    \\langle\\rho\\rangle~\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\tilde{p}\n </math>\nDropping the tildes and using <math>\\rho_0 := \\langle\\rho\\rangle</math>, we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation\n:<math>\n    \\rho_0~\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla p = 0 ~.\n </math>\n\n===Conservation of mass===\nThe equation for the [[Derivation of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations#Conservation of mass|conservation of mass]] in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0</math>\nwhere <math>\\rho(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the mass density of the fluid and <math>\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x},t)</math> is the flow velocity.\n\nThe equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.\n\n====Assumption 1: Small disturbances====\nFrom the assumption of small disturbances we have\n:<math>\n   p = \\langle p\\rangle + \\tilde{p} ~;~~\n   \\rho = \\langle\\rho\\rangle + \\tilde{\\rho} ~;~~\n   \\mathbf{u} = \\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle + \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\n </math>\nand\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle p \\rangle}{\\partial t} = 0 ~;~~ \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle \\rho \\rangle}{\\partial t} = 0 ~;~~\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\langle \\mathbf{u} \\rangle}{\\partial t} = \\mathbf{0} ~.\n </math>\nThen the mass balance equation can be written as\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\rho}}{\\partial t} +\n    \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\nabla \\cdot\\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\right] +\n   \\nabla\\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\cdot \\left[\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}\\right]= 0\n  </math>\nIf we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations, the mass balance equation becomes\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\rho}}{\\partial t} +\n    \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\nabla \\cdot\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\n    \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\nabla\\cdot\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} +\n    \\nabla\\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\cdot\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\n    \\nabla\\langle\\rho\\rangle\\cdot\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}= 0\n  </math>\n\n====Assumption 2: Homogeneous medium====\nNext we assume that the medium is homogeneous, i.e.,\n:<math>\n  \\nabla\\langle \\rho \\rangle = 0 ~.\n </math>\nThen the mass balance equation takes the form\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\rho}}{\\partial t} +\n    \\left[\\langle\\rho\\rangle+\\tilde{\\rho}\\right]\\nabla \\cdot\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle+\n    \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\nabla\\cdot\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} +\n    \\nabla\\tilde{\\rho}\\cdot\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle\n    = 0\n  </math>\n\n====Assumption 3: Medium at rest====\nAt this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, i.e., <math>\\langle\\mathbf{u}\\rangle = 0 </math>.  Then the mass balance equation can be expressed as\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\partial\\tilde{\\rho}}{\\partial t} +\n    \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\nabla\\cdot\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = 0\n  </math>\n\n====Assumption 4: Ideal gas, adiabatic, reversible====\nTo close the system of equations we need an [[equation of state]] for the pressure.  To do that we assume that the medium is an [[ideal gas]] and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an [[adiabatic]] and [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]] manner.  The equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation:\n:<math>\n    \\cfrac{dp}{d\\rho} = \\cfrac{\\gamma~p}{\\rho} ~;~~ \\gamma := \\cfrac{c_p}{c_v} ~;~~ c^2 = \\cfrac{\\gamma~p}{\\rho} ~.\n </math>\nwhere <math>c_p</math> is the [[specific heat]] at constant pressure, <math>c_v</math> is the [[specific heat]] at constant volume, and <math>c</math> is the wave speed.  The value of <math>\\gamma</math> is 1.4 if the acoustic medium is air.\n\nFor small disturbances\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{dp}{d\\rho} \\approx \\cfrac{\\tilde{p}}{\\tilde{\\rho}}  ~;~~\n   \\cfrac{p}{\\rho} \\approx \\cfrac{\\langle p \\rangle}{\\langle \\rho \\rangle} ~;~~\n   c^2 \\approx c_0^2 = \\cfrac{\\gamma~\\langle p\\rangle}{\\langle \\rho \\rangle} ~.\n </math>\nwhere <math>c_0</math> is the [[speed of sound]] in the medium.\n\nTherefore,\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{\\tilde{p}}{\\tilde{\\rho}} = \\gamma~\\cfrac{\\langle p \\rangle}{\\langle \\rho \\rangle}\n     = c_0^2 \\qquad \\implies \\qquad\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\tilde{p}}{\\partial t} = c_0^2 \\cfrac{\\partial\\tilde{\\rho}}{\\partial t}\n </math>\nThe balance of mass can then be written as\n:<math>\n  \\cfrac{1}{c_0^2}\\frac{\\partial\\tilde{p}}{\\partial t} +\n    \\langle\\rho\\rangle\\nabla\\cdot\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = 0\n  </math>\nDropping the tildes and defining <math>\\rho_0 :=  \\langle\\rho\\rangle</math> gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium:\n:<math>\n  \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0~c_0^2~\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} = 0 ~.\n  </math>\n\n==Governing equations in cylindrical coordinates==\nIf we use a [[cylindrical coordinate system]] <math>(r,\\theta,z)</math> with [[basis vectors]] <math>\\mathbf{e}_r, \\mathbf{e}_\\theta, \\mathbf{e}_z</math>, then the [[gradient]] of <math>p</math> and the [[divergence]] of <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> are given by\n:<math>\n   \\begin{align}\n     \\nabla p & = \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}~\\mathbf{e}_r + \\cfrac{1}{r}~\\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}~\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}~\\mathbf{e}_z \\\\\n     \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} & = \\cfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} + \\cfrac{1}{r}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + u_r\\right) + \\cfrac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z}\n   \\end{align}\n </math>\nwhere the [[flow velocity]] has been expressed as <math>\\mathbf{u} = u_r~\\mathbf{e}_r+u_\\theta~\\mathbf{e}_\\theta+u_z~\\mathbf{e}_z</math>.\n\nThe equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] may then be written as\n:<math>\n   \\rho_0~\\left[\\cfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial t}~\\mathbf{e}_r+\\cfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial t}~\\mathbf{e}_\\theta+\\cfrac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial t}~\\mathbf{e}_z\\right] +\n\\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}~\\mathbf{e}_r + \\cfrac{1}{r}~\\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}~\\mathbf{e}_\\theta + \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}~\\mathbf{e}_z = 0\n </math>\nIn terms of components, these three equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] in [[cylindrical coordinates]] are\n:<math>\n    \\rho_0~\\cfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial t} + \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}  = 0 ~;~~\n    \\rho_0~\\cfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial t} + \\cfrac{1}{r}~\\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial \\theta}  = 0 ~;~~\n    \\rho_0~\\cfrac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial t} + \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}  = 0 ~.\n </math>\n\nThe equation for the [[conservation of mass]] can similarly be written in [[cylindrical coordinates]] as\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\kappa\\left[\\cfrac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} + \\cfrac{1}{r}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial u_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + u_r\\right) + \\cfrac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z}\\right] = 0 ~.\n </math>\n\n===Time harmonic acoustic equations in cylindrical coordinates===\nThe acoustic equations for the [[conservation of momentum]] and the [[conservation of mass]] are often expressed in time [[harmonic]] form (at fixed [[frequency]]).  In that case, the pressures and the flow velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form\n:<math>\n   p(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{p}(\\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\\omega t} ~;~~\n   \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}(\\mathbf{x})~e^{-i\\omega t} ~;~~ i := \\sqrt{-1}\n </math>\nwhere <math>\\omega</math> is the frequency.  Substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in [[cylindrical coordinates]] gives us the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of momentum]]\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{\\partial\\hat{p}}{\\partial r} = i\\omega~\\rho_0~\\hat{u}_r ~;~~\n   \\cfrac{1}{r}~\\cfrac{\\partial\\hat{p}}{\\partial \\theta} = i\\omega~\\rho_0~\\hat{u}_\\theta ~;~~\n    \\cfrac{\\partial\\hat{p}}{\\partial z} = i\\omega~\\rho_0~\\hat{u}_z\n </math>\nand the fixed frequency form of the [[conservation of mass]]\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{i\\omega \\hat{p}}{\\kappa} = \\cfrac{\\partial \\hat{u}_r}{\\partial r} + \\cfrac{1}{r}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial \\hat{u}_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\hat{u}_r\\right) + \\cfrac{\\partial \\hat{u}_z}{\\partial z} ~.\n </math>\n\n====Special case: No z-dependence====\nIn the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z-coordinate we can eliminate <math>u_r, u_\\theta</math> to get\n:<math>\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} +\n     \\frac{1}{r^2}~\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial\\theta^2} + \\frac{\\omega^2\\rho_0}{\\kappa}~p = 0\n </math>\nAssuming that the solution of this equation can be written as\n:<math>\n    p(r,\\theta) = R(r)~Q(\\theta)\n </math>\nwe can write the partial differential equation as\n:<math>\n   \\cfrac{r^2}{R}~\\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + \\cfrac{r}{R}~\\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \\cfrac{r^2\\omega^2\\rho_0}{\\kappa} = -\\cfrac{1}{Q}~\\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\\theta^2}\n </math>\nThe left hand side is not a function of <math>\\theta</math> while the right hand side is not a function of <math>r</math>.  Hence,\n:<math>\n   r^2~\\cfrac{d^2R}{dr^2} + r~\\cfrac{dR}{dr} + \\cfrac{r^2\\omega^2\\rho_0}{\\kappa}~R = \\alpha^2~R ~;~~ \\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\\theta^2} = -\\alpha^2~Q\n </math>\nwhere <math>\\alpha^2</math> is a constant.  Using the substitution\n:<math>\n   \\tilde{r} \\leftarrow \\left(\\omega\\sqrt{\\cfrac{\\rho_0}{\\kappa}}\\right) r = k~r\n </math>\nwe have\n:<math>\n   \\tilde{r}^2~\\cfrac{d^2R}{d\\tilde{r}^2} + \\tilde{r}~\\cfrac{dR}{d\\tilde{r}} + (\\tilde{r}^2-\\alpha^2)~R = 0 ~;~~ \\cfrac{d^2Q}{d\\theta^2} = -\\alpha^2~Q\n </math>\nThe equation on the left is the [[Bessel equation]], which has the general solution\n:<math>\n   R(r) =  A_\\alpha~J_\\alpha(k~r) + B_\\alpha~J_{-\\alpha}(k~r)\n </math>\nwhere <math>J_\\alpha</math> is the cylindrical [[Bessel function]] of the first kind and <math>A_\\alpha, B_\\alpha</math> are undetermined constants.

He left school at the age of 13, following his father's death, and trained as a [[stonemason]]. Mackenzie immigrated to Canada when he was 20, settling in what became [[Ontario]]. His masonry business prospered, allowing him to pursue other interests \u2013 such as the editorship of a pro-[[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformist]] newspaper. Mackenzie was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada]] in 1861, as a supporter of [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]].\n\nIn 1867, Mackenzie was elected to the new [[House of Commons of Canada]] for the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]]. He became leader of the party (and thus [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]]) in mid-1873, and a few months later succeeded [[John A. Macdonald]] as prime minister, following Macdonald's resignation in the aftermath of the [[Pacific Scandal]]. Mackenzie and the Liberals won a clear majority at the [[Canadian federal election, 1874|1874 election]]. He was popular among the general public for his humble background and apparent democratic tendencies.\n\nAs prime minister, Mackenzie continued the nation-building programme that had been begun by his predecessor. His government established the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and [[Royal Military College of Canada]], and created the [[District of Keewatin]] to better administer Canada's newly acquired western territories. However, it made little progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railway]], and struggled to deal with the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1873]]. At the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]], Mackenzie's government suffered a landslide defeat. He remained leader of the Liberal Party for another two years, and continued on as a member of parliament until his death, due to a [[stroke]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nMackenzie was born on 28 January 1822 in [[Logierait]], Perthshire, [[Scotland]], the son of Mary Stewart (Fleming) and Alexander Mackenzie Sr. who were married in 1817.  The site of his birthplace is known as Clais-'n-deoir \"The Hollow of the Weeping\", where families said their goodbyes as the convicted were led to nearby Gallows Hill. The house he was born in was built by his father and is still standing in 2019.  He was the third of ten boys, seven of who survived infancy. Alexander Mackenzie Sr. was a carpenter and ship's joiner who had to move around frequently for work after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Mackenzie's father died on 7 March 1836 and at the age of thirteen Alexander Mackenzie Jr. was thus forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family. He apprenticed as a stonemason and met his future wife, Helen Neil, in Irvine, where her father was also a stonemason.  The Neils were Baptist and shortly thereafter, Mackenzie converted from [[Presbyterianism]] to [[Baptist]] beliefs.  Together with the Neils, he immigrated to Canada in 1842 to seek a better life.  Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential [[temperance cause]], particularly strong in [[Canada West]] where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the [[Parliament of Canada]].\n\nThe Neils and Mackenzie settled in Kingston, Ontario.  The limestone in the area proved too hard for his stonemason tools and, not having money to buy new tools, Mackenzie took a job as a labourer constructing a building on Princess Street.  The contractor on the job claimed financial difficulty and so Mackenzie accepted a promissory note for summer wages.  The note later proved to be worthless.  Subsequently, Mackenzie won a contract building a bomb-proof arch at [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]].  He later became a foreman on the construction of Kingston's four [[Martello tower|Martello Towers]] - [[Murney Tower]], [[Fort Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Fort Frederick]], [[Cathcart Tower]], and [[Shoal Tower]].  He was also a foreman on the construction of the [[Welland Canal]] and the [[Lachine Canal]].  While working on the [[Beauharnois Canal]] a one-ton stone fell and crushed one of his legs.  He recovered but never regained the strength in that leg.  It was while in Kingston that Mackenzie became a vocal opponent of religious and political entitlement and corruption in government.\n\nMackenzie married Helen Neil (1826\u201352) in 1845 and with her had three children, with only one girl, Mary, surviving infancy.  He and Helen moved to Sarnia, Ontario (known as Canada West) in 1847 and Mary was born in 1848.  They were soon joined from Scotland by the rest of Mackenzie's brothers and his mother. He began working as a general contractor, earning a reputation for being a hard working, honest man as well as having a working man's view on fiscal policy.  Mackenzie helped construct many courthouses and jails across southern Ontario. A number of these still stand today including the Sandwich Courthouse and Jail now known as the [[Windsor, Ontario|Mackenzie Hall Cultural Centre]] in Windsor, Ontario and the [[Chatham Jail|Kent County Courthouse and Jail]] in Chatham, Ontario.  He even bid, unsuccessfully, on the construction of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in 1859.  Helen died in 1852, finally succumbing to the effects of excessive doses of mercury-based calomel used to treat a fever while in Kingston. In 1853, he married [[Jane Mackenzie|Jane Sym]] (1825\u201393).\n\n[[Image:Mason overseer.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|1875 ''[[Canadian Illustrated News]]'' cartoon shows Mackenzie the Mason and Governor General [[Lord Dufferin]] the Overseer]]\n\n==Early political involvement==\nMackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada.   He fought passionately for equality and the elimination of all forms of class distinction.  In 1851 he became the Secretary for the [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reform Party]] for Lambton.  After convincing him to run in Kent/Lambton, Mackenzie campaigned relentlessly for [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], owner of the [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reformist]] paper ''[[The Globe (Toronto newspaper)|The Globe]]'' in the 1851 election, helping Brown to win his first seat in the Legislative Assembly.  Mackenzie and Brown remained the closest of friends and colleagues for the rest of their lives.  In 1852 Mackenzie became editor of another reformist paper, the Lambton Shield. As editor, Mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal, leading the paper to a lawsuit for libel against the local conservative candidate. Because a key witness claimed Cabinet Confidence and would not testify, the paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship.  After his brother, Hope Mackenzie, declined to run, Alexander was petitioned to run and won his first seat in the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861.  When George Brown resigned from the [[Great Coalition]] in 1865 over reciprocity negotiations with the United States, Mackenzie was invited to replace him as the President of the Council.  Wary of [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald's]] motivations and true to his principles, Mackenzie declined.\n\nHe entered the House of Commons of Canada in 1867, representing the [[Lambton (electoral district)|Lambton]], Ontario, riding.  There was no cohesive national [[Liberal Party of Canada]] at the time and with [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] not winning his seat, there was no official leader.  Mackenzie did not believe he was the best qualified for the position and although he resisted offers of the position, he nevertheless sat as the de facto leader of the Official Opposition.\n\n==Prime Minister (1873\u20131878)==\n\n{{See also|Electoral history of Alexander Mackenzie}}\n\nWhen the [[John A. Macdonald|Macdonald]] government fell due to the [[Pacific Scandal]] in 1873, the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]], called upon Mackenzie, who had been chosen as the leader of the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] a few months earlier, to form a new government.  Mackenzie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an [[Canadian federal election, 1874|election for January 1874]]. The Liberals won, having garnered 53.8% of the popular vote. The voter support of 53.8% remains the record in [[Canada]] for all federal elections.<ref>\u00c9ric Grenier, \"Size of Justin Trudeau's government breaks records, for better and worse Biggest seat gains in Canada's history delivered a majority government \u2014 with one of its smallest mandates\" (Dec 2 2015): <http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-historical-trudeau-government-1.3344130>.</ref> Mackenzie remained prime minister until the [[Canadian federal election, 1878|1878 election]] when Macdonald's [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservatives]] returned to power with a [[majority government]].\n\nIt was unusual for a man of Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a position in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged. Lord Dufferin, the current Governor General, expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government. But on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions:\n\n<blockquote>However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man.</blockquote>\n\nMackenzie served concurrently as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament Buildings. While drawing up the plans for the [[West Block]], he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage-seekers waiting for him in his ante-chamber. Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.\n\n[[Image:Alexander Mackenzie Statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Alexander Mackenzie on Parliament Hill, Ottawa by [[Hamilton MacCarthy]]]] In keeping with his democratic ideals, Mackenzie refused the offer of a knighthood three times, and was thus the only one of Canada's first eight Prime Ministers not to be knighted.  He also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title \"Right Honourable\". His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, \"I do. It is five feet, ten inches. I know, because I built it myself!\"<ref>Canada's Prime Ministers, 1867 \u2013 1994: Biographies and Anecdotes. [Ottawa]: National Archives of Canada, [1994]. 40 p.</ref>\n\nAs Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government, achieving a remarkable record of reform legislation. He introduced the [[secret ballot]]; advised the creation of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]; the establishment of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in 1874; and, the creation of the Office of the [[Auditor General of Canada|Auditor General]] in 1878.  He completed the [[Intercolonial Railway]] but struggled to progress on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|national railway]] due to a worldwide economic depression, almost coming to blows with the then Governor General Lord Dufferin over imperial interference.  Mackenzie stood up for the rights of Canada as a nation and fought for the supremacy of Parliament and honesty in government. Above all else, he was known and loved for his honesty and integrity.\n\nHowever, his term was marked by [[economic depression]] that had grown out of the [[Panic of 1873]], which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new [[free trade]] agreement with the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876 the Conservative opposition announced a [[National Policy]] of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an [[Canadian federal election, 1878|election]] was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were swept back into office in a landslide victory.\n\n=== Supreme Court appointments ===\n[[File:Alexander Mackenzie.jpg|thumb|right|A painting of Mackenzie]]\nMackenzie chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]:\n* Sir [[William Buell Richards]] ([[Chief Justice]])&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[T\u00e9lesphore Fournier]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[William Alexander Henry]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[William Johnstone Ritchie]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Samuel Henry Strong]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* [[Jean-Thomas Taschereau (judge)|Jean-Thomas Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 September 30, 1875\n* Sir [[Henri Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau]]&nbsp;\u2013 October 7, 1878\n\n==Later life==\nAfter his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]] for another two years, until 1880. He was soon struck with a mysterious ailment that sapped his strength and all but took his voice.  Sitting in silence, he nevertheless remained an undefeated MP until his death in 1892 from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall. He died in [[Toronto]] and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in [[Sarnia]], Ontario.<ref name=Parks_Canada>{{cite web | url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/clmhc-hsmbc/Sepulture-gravesiteindx/listesepulture-listgravesite/mackenzie.aspx | title=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada \u2013 Former Prime Ministers and Their Grave Sites \u2013 The Honourable Alexander Mackenzie | author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | date=December 20, 2010 | website=Parks Canada | publisher=Government of Canada | accessdate=March 5, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209014144/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/clmhc-hsmbc/Sepulture-gravesiteindx/listesepulture-listgravesite/mackenzie.aspx | archive-date=February 9, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn their 1999 study of the Prime Ministers of Canada, which included the results of a survey of Canadian historians, [[J.L.

[[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of [[Rajdharma]]. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened  eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.<ref>prachin bharater itihas by sunil chattopadhyay</ref>\n\nEdict 13 of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]] Rock Inscriptions expresses the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Directly after the Kalingas had been annexed began His Sacred Majesty\u2019s zealous protection of the Law of Piety, his love of that Law, and his inculcation of that Law.

The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife [[Kanchanmala]]. In [[Pataliputra]], Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice.

Emperor Ashoka was seen as a role model to leaders within the Buddhist community.  He not only provided guidance and strength, but he also created personal relationships with his supporters.<ref>Vesselin Popovski, Gregory M. Reichberg, and Nicholas Turner, ''World Religions and Norms of War'' (Tokyo: United Nations University Press, 2009), 66.</ref>  Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the [[Angkor]] kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]''. Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism of Thailand]] and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nAccording to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'', Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in [[Pundravardhana]] drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of [[Nirgrantha Jnatiputra]] (identified with [[Mahavira]], 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]]). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the [[Ajivika]]s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order.<ref name=\"John1989\"/><ref name=\"Beni2010\">{{cite book | author=Beni Madhab Barua | title=The Ajivikas | url=https://archive.org/details/ajivikas00barurich | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=5 May 2010 | publisher=General Books | isbn=978-1-152-74433-2 | pages=68\u201369}}</ref> Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in [[Pataliputra]] drew a similar picture.

Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that \"We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics.\"<ref name=\"Ashoka - A Retrospective\">{{cite journal|last1=Thappar|first1=Romila|title=Ashoka - A Retrospective|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=7\u201313 November 2009|volume=44|issue=45|pages=31\u201337}}</ref> The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: [[Buddhism]], [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Ajivika]]ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, \"The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Amartya|title=Universal Truths and the Westernizing Illusion|journal=Harvard International Review|date=Summer 1998|volume=20|issue=3|pages=40\u201343}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the edicts alone strongly {{em|indicate}} that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an \"[[upasaka]]\", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word [[Dharma (Buddhism)|\"dhamma\"]] to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. However, he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct. Romila Thappar writes, \"His dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration, even if its observance promised heaven. It was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations. His logic of Dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people, in relation to each other. Especially where they involved unequal relationships.\"<ref name=\"Ashoka - A Retrospective\">{{cite journal|last1=Thappar|first1=Romila|title=Ashoka - A Retrospective|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=7\u201313 November 2009|volume=44|issue=45|pages=31\u201337}}</ref> Finally, he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.<ref>Richard Robinson, Willard Johnson, and Thanissaro Bhikkhu, ''Buddhist Religions'', fifth ed., Wadsworth 2005, page 59.</ref>\n\nThe Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by a specific event. It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. ''This'' Ashoka is very different from the \"shadowy do-gooder\" of later Pali chronicles.<ref name=\"Pradip2002\"/>\n\nMuch of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the [[Edicts of Ashoka|several inscriptions]] that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate  and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his \"children\" and mentions that as a father he desires their good.<ref name=\"VenSDhammika_1993\"/> These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to [[dharma]] (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at [[Sarnath]] is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the [[Buddha]]. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some events ever actually happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Focus of debate===\n[[File:Vajrasana front frieze design.jpg|thumb|300px|Front frieze of the [[Diamond throne]], built by Ashoka at [[Bodh Gaya]].]]\nRecently scholarly analysis  determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism; and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as ''dhamma'' or [[dharma]], which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2013}} have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the \"military backbone\" of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been \"grossly exaggerated\". The ''dhamma'' of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a \"sort of universal religion\", or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an ''essentially political'' ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a \"virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Singh|2012}}</ref>\n\n===Legends of Ashoka===\n[[File:Sanchi King Ashoka with his Queens, South Gate, Stupa no. 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Ashoka and his two queens, in a relief at [[Sanchi]].

These legends were found in Buddhist textual sources such as the text of ''Ashokavadana''. The ''Ashokavadana'' is a subset of a larger set of legends in the ''Divyavadana'', though it could have existed independently as well. Following are some of the legends narrated in the ''Ashokavadana'' about Ashoka:\n\n1) One of the stories talks about an event that occurred in a past life of Ashoka, when he was a small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha\u2019s begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled a smile that \u201cilluminated the universe with its rays of light\u201d.<ref name=\"Singh 2008-332\"/> These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha\u2019s left palm, signifying that this child Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be \u201ca great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra\u201d.\n\n2) Another story aims to portray Ashoka as an evil person in order to convey the importance of his transformation into a good person upon adopting Buddhism.<ref name=\"Singh 2008-332\"/> It begins by stating that due to Ashoka\u2019s physical ugliness he was disliked by his father Bindusara. Ashoka wanted to become king and so he got rid of the heir by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. He became famous as \u201cAshoka the Fierce\u201d because of his wicked nature and bad temper. He is said to have subjected his ministers to a test of loyalty and then have 500 of them killed for failing it. He is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him. He is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer. And for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself  by torturing other people. The story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with a pious Buddhist monk that Ashoka himself transformed into \u201cAshoka the pious\u201d. A Chinese traveler who visited India in the 7th century CE, [[Xuan Zang]] recorded in his memoirs that he visited the place where the supposed torture chamber stood.\n\n3) Another story is about events that occurred towards the end of Ashoka\u2019s time on earth. Ashoka is said to have started gifting away the contents of his treasury to the Buddhist ''sangha''. His ministers however were scared that his eccentricity would be the downfall of the empire and so denied him access to the treasury. As a result, Ashoka started giving away his personal possessions and was eventually left with nothing and so died peacefully.<ref name=\"Singh 2008-332\"/>\n\nAt this point it is important to note that the ''Ashokavadana'' being a Buddhist text in itself sought to gain new converts for Buddhism and so used all these legends. Devotion to the Buddha and loyalty to the ''sangha'' are stressed. Such texts added to the perception that Ashoka was essentially the ideal Buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation.<ref name=\"Singh 2008-332\"/>\n\n===Ashoka and the relics of the Buddha===\nAccording to Buddhist legend, particularly the [[Mahaparinirvana]], the relics of the Buddha had been shared among eight countries following his death.<ref>Asoka and the Buddha-Relics, T.W.

According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddha's relics.<ref>{{harvnb|Strong|2007|pp=136\u2013137}}</ref> In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals.<ref>{{harvnb|Strong|2007|p=145}}</ref> He gave donations to viharas and [[matha]]s.

He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the  sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as [[Nalanda]] and [[Taxila]]. Ashoka helped to construct  [[Sanchi]] and [[Mahabodhi Temple]]. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism.<ref>N.V. Isaeva, ''Shankara and Indian philosophy''.

The VIth Rock Edict about \"oral orders\" reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his ''dhammavijaya,'' which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the [[Kharosthi]] script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as [[Achaemenid]] influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.<ref name=\"Hinuber2012\">{{cite journal | author=Oskar von Hin\u00fcber |title=Did Hellenistic Kings Send Letters to A\u015boka? | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | issue=130.2 | year=2010 | publisher=Freiburg | pages=262\u2013265}}</ref>\n\n===Hellenistic world===\n[[File:AiKhanoumAndIndia.jpg|thumb|Distribution of the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], and location of the contemporary Greek city of [[Ai-Khanoum]].<ref>Reference: \"India: The Ancient Past\" p.113, Burjor Avari, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-35615-6}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Territories conquered by the Dharma according to Ashoka.jpg|thumb|Territories \"conquered by the Dharma\" according to [[Major Rock Edicts|Major Rock Edict No.13]] of Ashoka (260\u2013218 BCE).<ref name=PK>{{cite book |last1=Kosmin |first1=Paul J. |title=The Land of the Elephant Kings |date=2014 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=9780674728820 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9UWdAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA57 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=ME368>Thomas Mc Evilly \"The shape of ancient thought\", Allworth Press, New York, 2002, p.368</ref>]]\nIn his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic countries]] as converts to Buddhism and recipients of his envoys, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remains:\n\n{{quote|Now it is conquest by Dhamma that Beloved-of-the-Gods considers to be the best conquest.

The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the [[Mauryan]] Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of [[Sarnath]] and The [[Ashoka Pillar]]. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha ([[Spinning wheel]]) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. The Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of the Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Ashoka Chakra was created by Ashoka during his reign. [[Chakra]] is a [[Sanskrit]] word which also means \"cycle\" or \"self-repeating process\". The process it signifies is the cycle of time\u2014as in how the world changes with time.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nA few days before India became independent in August 1947, the specially-formed [[Constituent Assembly]] decided that the [[flag of India]] must be acceptable to all parties and communities.

Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the [[swastika]] stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Lion Capital of Ashoka (Ashokmudra)====\n{{Main article|Lion Capital of Ashoka}}\n[[File:Sarnath capital.jpg|thumb|Ashoka's pillar capital of [[Sarnath]]. Ashokan capitals were highly realistic and used a characteristic polished finish, [[Mauryan polish]], giving a shiny appearance to the stone surface. This sculpture has been adopted as the [[National Emblem of India]]. 3rd century BCE.]]\n\nThe Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Ashoka pillar at [[Sarnath]], now in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The pillar, sometimes called the Ashoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the [[Sarnath Museum]]. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the [[State Emblem of India|National Emblem of India]] and the wheel (\"[[Ashoka Chakra]]\") from its base was placed onto the center of the [[National Flag of India]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on a short cylindrical abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the \"Ashoka Chakra\").  The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, \"No one shall cause division in the order of monks.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord [[Buddha]]'s life.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n* The Elephant represents the Buddha's idea in reference to the dream of Queen Maya of a white elephant entering her womb.\n* The Bull represents desire during the life of the Buddha as a prince.\n* The Horse represents Buddha's departure from palatial life.\n* The Lion represents the accomplishment of Buddha.\n\nBesides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n====Constructions credited to Ashoka====\n[[File:Pipal tree temple of Bodh Gaya depicted in Sanchi Stupa 1 Eastern Gateway.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the original temple built by Asoka at Bodh-Gaya on the location of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]], sculpture of the [[Satavahana]] period at [[Sanchi]], 1st century CE.]]\nThe British restoration was done under guidance from [[Weligama Sri Sumangala]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Goonatilake |first=Hema |date=30 May 2010 |title=Edwin Arnold and the Sri Lanka connection |url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/100530/Plus/plus_10.html |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Colombo |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110231941/http://www.sundaytimes.lk/100530/Plus/plus_10.html |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[Sanchi]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Dhamek Stupa]], [[Sarnath]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India\n* [[Mahabodhi Temple]], [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Barabar Caves]], [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Nalanda]] Mahavihara (some portions like Sariputta Stupa), [[Bihar]], India\n* [[Taxila]] University (some portions like [[Dharmarajika]] Stupa and Kunala Stupa), [[Taxila]], Pakistan\n* [[Bhir Mound]] (''reconstructed''), [[Taxila]], Pakistan\n* [[Bharhut]] [[stupa]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Deorkothar]] Stupa, [[Madhya Pradesh]], India\n* [[Butkara Stupa]], [[Swat, Pakistan]]\n* [[Sannati]] Stupa, [[Karnataka]], India: the only known sculptural depiction of Ashoka{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n* Mir Rukun Stupa, [[Nawabshah]], [[Pakistan]]\n\n==In art, film and literature==\n[[File:Asoka's Queen.jpg|thumb|A {{Circa|1910}} painting by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871\u20131951) depicting Ashoka's queen standing in front of the railings of the Buddhist monument at [[Sanchi]] ([[Raisen district]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]).]]\n* [[Jaishankar Prasad]] composed ''Ashoka ki Chinta'' (''Ashoka's Anxiety''), a poem that portrays Ashoka\u2019s feelings during the war on Kalinga.\n* ''[[Ashok Kumar]]'' is a 1941 [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film directed by Raja Chandrasekhar.

In adjectival use, it means \"of or relating to the United States\"; for example, \"[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer\" or \"the man prefers [[American English]]\". In its noun form, the word generally means a [[demographics of the US|resident]] or [[United States nationality law|citizen]] of the US, or occasionally [[American ethnicity|someone whose ethnic identity is simply \"American\"]]. The noun is rarely used in [[American English]] to refer to people not connected to the United States.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> When used with a [[Grammatical modifier|grammatical qualifier]], the adjective ''American'' can mean \"of or relating to the Americas\", as in [[Latin America]]n or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]]. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in \"[[Spanish dialects and varieties|American Spanish]] dialects and pronunciation differ by country\", or the name of the [[Organization of American States]]. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], for instance, \"In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest\".\n\nCompound constructions such as \"[[African Americans]]\" likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the United States of America, as does the [[prefix]] \"[[:wiktionary:Americo-|Americo-]]\". For instance, the [[Americo-Liberians]] and their language [[Merico language|Merico]] derive their name from the fact that they are [[African-American settlement in Africa|descended from African American settlers]], i.e. former slaves in the United States of America.\n\n==Other languages==\n\n[[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]],{{efn|name=ja-american|Japanese: \"U.S. citizen\" is {{nihongo||\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba|amerika-jin}}<ref name=\"jap-dict\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enja/American|title=American|work=WordReference English-Japanese Dictionary|year=2013}}</ref>}} [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Russian language|Russian]]{{efn|Russian: \"U.S. citizen\" is ''{{transl|ru|amerikanec}}'' ({{lang|ru|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446}}) for males and ''{{transl|ru|amerikanka}}'' ({{lang|ru|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430}}) for females<ref name=\"dict-ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enru/American|title=American|work=WordReference English-Russian Dictionary|year=2013}}</ref>}} speakers may use cognates of ''American'' to refer to inhabitants of the Americas or to U.S. nationals.

Get rid of, he urges, \u201cany appellation derived from local discriminations.\u201d By defining himself as an American rather than as a Virginian, Washington set the national standard for all citizens. \"Over and over, Washington said that America must be something set apart.

other languages. It has built-in language support for [[design by contract|design-by-contract]], extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and [[nondeterministic programming|non-determinism]]. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors.

The Ada&nbsp;95 revision, designed by [[Tucker Taft|S. Tucker Taft]] of [[Intermetrics]] between 1992 and 1995, improved support for systems, numerical, financial, and [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP).\n\nFeatures of Ada include: [[strongly typed languages|strong typing]], [[modularity (programming)|modularity mechanisms]] (packages), [[run-time checking]], [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] ([[Task (computing)|tasks]], synchronous [[message passing]], [[protected objects]], and nondeterministic [[Switch statement|select statements]]), [[exception handling]], and [[generic programming|generics]]. Ada&nbsp;95 added support for [[object-oriented programming]], including [[dynamic dispatch]].\n\nThe syntax of Ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (such as \"or else\" and \"and then\") to symbols (such as \"||\" and \"&&\"). Ada uses the basic arithmetical operators \"+\", \"-\", \"*\", and \"/\", but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as \"declare\", \"begin\", and \"end\", where the \"end\" (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g., ''if \u2026 end if'', ''loop \u2026 end loop''). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a ''[[dangling else]]'' that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages like C or Java.\n\nAda is designed for development of very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately.  Ada package specifications (the package interface) can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency.  This makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts.\n\nA large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code.  For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error.\n\nAda also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory, [[buffer overflow]] errors, range violations, [[off-by-one error]]s, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any [[anomaly in software|anomaly]] might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include [[avionics]], [[Air traffic control|ATC]], railways, banking, military and space technology.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ada helps churn out less-buggy code|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/1999/06/30/Ada-helps-churn-out-lessbuggy-code.aspx|publisher=Government Computer News|accessdate=2010-09-14|author=S.

Ada does not have generic or untyped [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type.  Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared ''access types''.\nEach access type has an associated ''storage pool'' that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]]).  It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools.\nAlso, the language provides for ''accessibility checks'', both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an ''access value'' cannot outlive the type of the object it points to.\n\nThough the semantics of the language allow automatic [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems.  Ada does support a limited form of [[region-based memory management]]; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool.\n\nA double-[[dash]] (\"--\"), resembling an [[em dash]], denotes comment text.  Comments stop at end of line, to prevent unclosed comments from accidentally voiding whole sections of source code.  Prefixing each line (or column) with \"--\" will skip all that code, while being clearly denoted as a column of repeated \"--\" down the page.\n\nThe semicolon (\";\") is a [[statement terminator]], and the null or no-operation statement is <code>null;</code>. A single <code>;</code> without a statement to terminate is not allowed.\n\nUnlike most [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, the Ada language definition (known as the ''Ada Reference Manual'' or ''ARM'', or sometimes the ''Language Reference Manual'' or ''LRM'') is [[free content]]. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers and not just programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written.\n\nOne notable [[free software]] tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is the [[GNAT Programming Studio]].\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1970s, the [[United States Department of Defense|US Department of Defense]] (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, a [[working group]], the [[High Order Language Working Group]] (HOLWG), was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Defence]] requirements. After many iterations beginning with an original [[Straw man proposal]] the eventual programming language was named Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996.\n\nThe HOLWG working group crafted the [[Steelman language requirements]], a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications.\n\nRequests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red ([[Intermetrics]] led by Benjamin Brosgol), Green ([[CII Honeywell Bull]], led by [[Jean Ichbiah]]), Blue ([[SofTech, Inc.|SofTech]], led by John Goodenough)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/people/jbg.cfm |title=John Goodenough &#124; SEI Staff Profile |publisher=Sei.cmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-27}}</ref> and Yellow ([[SRI International]], led by Jay Spitzen).<!-- Though Intermetrics and Bull have previous links, I am including them for parallelism. --> In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada\u2014after [[Ada Lovelace|Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace]]. This proposal was influenced by the programming language [[LIS programming language|LIS]] that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s. The preliminary Ada reference manual\nwas published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 ([[Ada Lovelace]]'s birthday), and\ngiven the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year. In 1981, [[C. A. R. Hoare]] took advantage of his [[Turing Award]] speech to criticize Ada for being overly complex and hence unreliable,<ref>C.A.R. Hoare, \"[http://zoo.cs.yale.edu/classes/cs422/2011/bib/hoare81emperor.pdf The Emperor's Old Clothes].\" Communications of the ACM, 1981.</ref> but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an Ada textbook.<ref>D.A. Watt, B.A. Wichmann and W. Findlay, \"Ada: Language and Methodology.\" Prentice-Hall, 1987.</ref>\n\nAda attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days.

This version of the language is commonly known as Ada&nbsp;83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada&nbsp;87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.\n\nAda&nbsp;95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard ([http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html ISO-8652:1995]) was published in February 1995, making Ada&nbsp;95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language. To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the [[US Air Force]] funded the development of the [[GNAT]] [[Compiler]]. Presently, the GNAT Compiler is part of the [[GNU Compiler Collection]].\n\nWork has continued on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada&nbsp;95 was published in October 2001, and a major Amendment, [http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=45001 ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007] was published on March 9, 2007. At the Ada-Europe 2012 conference in Stockholm, the Ada Resource Association (ARA) and Ada-Europe announced the completion of the design of the latest version of the Ada programming language and the submission of the reference manual to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for approval. ISO/IEC 8652:2012 was published in December 2012.<ref name=ISO_IEC_8652_2012 />\n\nOther related standards include [[ISO 8651]]-3:1988 ''Information processing systems\u2014Computer graphics\u2014Graphical Kernel System (GKS) language bindings\u2014Part 3: Ada''.\n\n== Language constructs ==\nAda is an [[ALGOL]]-like programming language featuring control structures with reserved words such as ''if'', ''then'', ''else'', ''while'', ''for'', and so on. However, Ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original [[ALGOL 60]], such as [[type system|type definitions]], [[record (computer science)|records]], [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]], [[enumerated type|enumerations]]. Such constructs were in part inherited from or inspired by [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]].\n\n=== \"Hello, world!\" in Ada ===\nA common example of a language's [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] is the [[Hello world program]]:\n(hello.adb)\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nwith Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;\nprocedure Hello is\nbegin\n  Put_Line (\"Hello, world!\");\nend Hello;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis program can be compiled by using the freely available open source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">gnatmake hello.adb</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Data types ===\nAda's type system is not based on a set of predefined [[primitive types]] but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.\nSpecial types provided by the language are task types and protected types.\n\nFor example, a date might be represented as:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\ntype Day_type   is range    1 ..   31;\ntype Month_type is range    1 ..   12;\ntype Year_type  is range 1800 .. 2100;\ntype Hours is mod 24;\ntype Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);\n\ntype Date is\n   record\n     Day   : Day_type;\n     Month : Month_type;\n     Year  : Year_type;\n   end record;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTypes can be refined by declaring subtypes:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nsubtype Working_Hours is Hours range 0 .. 12;            -- at most 12 Hours to work a day\nsubtype Working_Day is Weekday range Monday ..

All standard constructs and deep level early exit are supported so the use of the also supported '[[goto (command)|go to]]' commands is seldom needed.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\n-- while a is not equal to b, loop.\nwhile a /= b loop\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (\"Waiting\");\nend loop;\n\nif a > b then\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (\"Condition met\");\nelse\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line (\"Condition not met\");\nend if;\n\nfor i in 1 .. 10 loop\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put (\"Iteration: \");\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put (i);\n  Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line;\nend loop;\n\nloop\n  a := a + 1;\n  exit when a = 10;\nend loop;\n\ncase i is\n  when 0 => Ada.Text_IO.Put (\"zero\");\n  when 1 => Ada.Text_IO.Put (\"one\");\n  when 2 => Ada.Text_IO.Put (\"two\");\n  -- case statements have to cover all possible cases:\n  when others => Ada.Text_IO.Put (\"none of the above\");\nend case;\n\nfor aWeekday in Weekday'Range loop               -- loop over an enumeration\n   Put_Line ( Weekday'Image(aWeekday) );         -- output string representation of an enumeration\n   if aWeekday in Working_Day then               -- check of a subtype of an enumeration\n      Put_Line ( \" to work for \" &\n               Working_Hours'Image (Work_Load(aWeekday)) ); -- access into a lookup table\n   end if;\nend loop;\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Packages, procedures and functions ===\nAmong the parts of an Ada program are packages, procedures and functions.\n\nExample:\nPackage specification (example.ads)\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\npackage Example is\n     type Number is range 1 .. 11;\n     procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number);\nend Example;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nPackage body (example.adb)\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nwith Ada.Text_IO;\npackage body Example is\n\n  i : Number := Number'First;\n\n  procedure Print_and_Increment (j: in out Number) is\n\n    function Next (k: in Number) return Number is\n    begin\n      return k + 1;\n    end Next;\n\n  begin\n    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line ( \"The total is: \" & Number'Image(j) );\n    j := Next (j);\n  end Print_and_Increment;\n\n-- package initialization executed when the package is elaborated\nbegin\n  while i < Number'Last loop\n    Print_and_Increment (i);\n  end loop;\nend Example;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis program can be compiled, e.g., by using the freely available open source compiler [[GNAT]], by executing\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"bash\">gnatmake -z example.adb</syntaxhighlight>\n\nPackages, procedures and functions can nest to any depth and each can also be the logical outermost block.\n\nEach package, procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants, types, variables, and other procedures, functions and packages, which can be declared in any order.\n\n=== Concurrency ===\nAda has language support for task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a ''task'', which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts \u2013 the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task.\nDepending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system threads or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.\n\nTasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of [[message passing|synchronous message passing]]). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more ''accept'' statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with ''select'' statements it is possible to define ''guards'' on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's [[guarded commands]]).\n\nAda also offers ''[[protected object]]s'' for [[mutual exclusion]]. Protected objects are a [[Monitor (synchronization)|monitor-like]] construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions.  The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body.\n\nA protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival.\n\nProtected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have ''guards''. If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed.\n\nCalls to entries can be ''requeued'' to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.\n\nThe ''select'' statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts.\n\nThe following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"ada\">\nwith Ada.Text_IO;

Cuar\u00f3n is the first Mexican director to win the [[Academy Award for Best Director]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/mar/03/alfonso-cuaron-wins-best-director-oscar|title=Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n wins best director Oscar|first=Andrew|last=Pulver|date=2 March 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nMost of Cuar\u00f3n's work has been praised by critics. He has been nominated for six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for ''Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n'' and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] for ''Children of Men''. He was awarded the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] as producer of ''Pan's Labyrinth''.  For ''Gravity'', Cuar\u00f3n received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning the Academy Award for Best Director and Best Film Editing, the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n==Early life==\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n Orozco was born in [[Mexico City]] on 28 November 1961, the son of Alfredo Cuar\u00f3n, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] for many years. He has two brothers, [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n|Carlos]], also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist. Cuar\u00f3n studied philosophy at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC ([[Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr\u00e1ficos]]), a school within the same university. There, he met the director Carlos Marcovich and [[cinematographer]] [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], and they made what would be his first [[short film]], ''Vengeance Is Mine''.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nCuar\u00f3n began working on television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several film productions including ''[[La Gran Fiesta]]'', ''[[Gaby: A True Story]]'' and ''[[Romero (film)|Romero]]'', and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment.\n\n===''S\u00f3lo con Tu Pareja''===\n''[[S\u00f3lo con Tu Pareja]]'' is a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by [[Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho]]) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted [[AIDS]]. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuar\u00f3n co-edited the film with Luis Patl\u00e1n. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the [[Coen Brothers]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]] have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuar\u00f3n continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.\n\nThe film, which also starred cabaret singer [[Astrid Hadad]] and model/actress Claudia Ram\u00edrez (with whom Cuar\u00f3n was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director [[Sydney Pollack]] hired Cuar\u00f3n to direct an episode of ''[[Fallen Angels (TV series)|Fallen Angels]]'', a series of [[neo-noir]] stories produced for the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included [[Steven Soderbergh]], [[Jonathan Kaplan]], [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and [[Tom Hanks]].\n\n===International success===\n[[Image:Alfonso Cuaron by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Cuar\u00f3n at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] (Estados Unidos)]]\nIn 1995, Cuar\u00f3n released his first feature film produced in the United States, ''[[A Little Princess (1995 film)|A Little Princess]]'', an adaptation of [[Frances Hodgson Burnett]]'s classic novel. Cuar\u00f3n's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'' starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Robert De Niro]].\n\nCuar\u00f3n's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film ''[[Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n]]'', starring [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]], [[Diego Luna]] and [[Maribel Verd\u00fa]]. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman who is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuar\u00f3n shared an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] with co-writer and brother [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 2004, Cuar\u00f3n directed the third film in the successful ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. Cuar\u00f3n faced criticism from some of the more purist ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author [[J. K. Rowling]], who had seen and loved Cuar\u00f3n's film ''Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n'', said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far.<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=76 J.K.

D. James]] [[The Children of Men|novel]] starring [[Clive Owen]], [[Julianne Moore]] and [[Michael Caine]], received wide critical acclaim, including three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. Cuar\u00f3n himself received two nominations for his work on the film in [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] (with [[Alex Rodr\u00edguez (film editor)|Alex Rodr\u00edguez]]) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (with several collaborators).\n\nHe created the production and distribution company [[Esperanto Filmoj]] (''Esperanto Films'', named because of his support for the international language [[Esperanto]]<ref>[http://esperantodocumentary.com/blog/an-interview-with-director-alfonso-cuaron Interview] by [[Sam Green]] with Cuar\u00f3n.</ref>), which has credits in the films ''[[Duck Season]]'', ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]''.\n\nCuar\u00f3n also directed the controversial public service announcement \"I Am Autism\" for [[Autism Speaks]] that was criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asansouthwestohio.blogspot.com/2009/09/autistic-community-condemns-autism.html|title=Autistic Self Advocacy Network, SW Ohio: Autistic Community Condemns Autism Speaks|first=|last=Asansouthwestohio|date=23 September 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Cuar\u00f3n began to develop the film ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'', a drama set in space. He was joined by producer [[David Heyman]], with whom Cuar\u00f3n worked on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.

In contrast with the domination of the orthodox church, the Arian was distinguished by a wise tolerance and a mild treatment of the population of other faiths, conduct mainly attributable to the unsophisticated sense of justice characterizing the children of nature, but also traceable in some degree to certain points of agreement between the Arian doctrine and [[Judaism]], points totally absent in the orthodox confession. The very insistence upon the more subordinate relationship of the Son\u2014that is, the Messiah\u2014to the God-father is much nearer to the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish doctrine of the Messiah]] than to the conception of the full divinity of the Son, as enunciated at [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]].}}</ref> which asserts the belief that [[Jesus Christ]] is the [[Son of God]] who was begotten by [[God the Father]] at a point in time,<ref name=\"Steinacher\" /> a creature distinct from the Father and is therefore subordinate to him, but the Son is also God (i.e. God the Son).<ref name=\"Steinacher\" /><ref name=\"ehrmanblogariusalexander\"/> Arian teachings were first attributed to [[Arius]]<ref name=\"Steinacher\" /><ref name=\"JE\" /> ([[circa|c.]] AD 256\u2013336), a Christian [[presbyter]] in [[Alexandria|Alexandria of Egypt]].

His opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God and that this was heretical.<ref name=Pomazansky/> Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father.<ref name=Pomazansky/> The theological term for this submission is [[kenosis]]. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality ([[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being and nature (ousia), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.\n\nConstantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed\u2014Arius himself, the deacon Euzoios, and the Libyan bishops Theonas of Marmarica and [[Secundus of Ptolemais]]\u2014and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and [[Theognis of Nicaea]]. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the ''Thalia'', the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be [[Book burning|burned]]. However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, [[Constantius II]], who was a Semi-Arian Christian, was exiled.\n\nAlthough he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First, he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius's rehabilitation.<ref name=\"Jonathan Kirsch 2004\">Edward Gibbons \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\", Chapter 21, (1776\u201388), Jonathan Kirsch, \"God Against the Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism\", 2004, and [[Charles Freeman (historian)|Charles Freeman]], ''[[The Closing of the Western Mind]]: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason'', 2002.</ref>\n\nAt the [[First Synod of Tyre]] in AD 335, they brought accusations against [[Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria|Athanasius]], now bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius. After this, Constantine had Athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted [[Arius]] to communion in AD 336. Arius died on the way to this event in Constantinople.

From  ''homoousios'' and ''homoiousios'' (\"equal\" and \"similar\") the conflict proceeded through a hundred metamorphoses and several hundred years and split the Eastern Church into sects.... A host of other interests, in part very worldly, attached themselves to the conflict and were concealed in it, so that it assumes the aspect of a merely hypocritical pretext.  For the sake of this quarrel the Church made itself inwardly hollow; for the sake of orthodox dogma it suffered the inward man to be famished, and, itself demoralized, it completely forfeited its higher moral effect upon the individual.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burckhardt|first1=Jacob|title=The Age of Constantine the Great|date=1852|publisher=Univ California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04680-1|pages=312\u2013313}}</ref>}}\n\n===Aftermath of Nicaea===\nThe Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the ''[[homoousios]]'', the central term of the Nicene Creed, as it had been used by [[Paul of Samosata]], who had advocated a [[Monarchianism|monarchianist]] [[Christology]]. Both the man and his teaching, including the term ''homoousios'', had been condemned by the [[Synods of Antioch]] in 269.\n\nHence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son [[Constantius II]], who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene Creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made the bishop of Constantinople.\n\nConstantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene Creed, especially St [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling [[Pope Liberius]] and installing [[Antipope Felix II]].\n\nThe third [[Council of Sirmium]] in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both ''homoousios'' (of one substance) and ''homoiousios'' (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.)\n\n<blockquote>\nBut since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin ''substantia'', but in Greek ''ousia'', that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/second-creed-of-sirmium-or-the-blasphemy-of-sirmium/|title=Second Creed of Sirmium or 'The Blasphemy of Sirmium'|website=www.fourthcentury.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene Creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term ''homoiousios'' (alike in substance) to the Nicene ''homoousios'', while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and co-eternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called \"semi-Arians\" by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like (''[[Acacians|homoios]]'') the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike (''[[Anomoeanism|anhomoios]]'') the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.\n\n[[Epiphanius of Salamis]] labeled the party of [[Basil of Ancyra]] in 358 \"[[Semi-Arianism]]\". This is considered unfair by Kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective ''homoousios'' while others had moved in that direction after the out-and-out Arians had come into the open.<ref>Kelly J.N.D. ''Early Christian Doctrines'' A&G Black 1965, p. 249</ref>\n\nThe debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the [[Council of Sardica]] in 343, the [[Council of Sirmium]] in 358 and the double [[Council of Rimini]] and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] to comment sarcastically: \"The highways were covered with galloping bishops.\" None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint [[Jerome]] remarked that the world \"awoke with a groan to find itself Arian.\"\n\nAfter Constantius' death in 361, his successor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], a devotee of [[State religion of Rome|Rome's pagan gods]], declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor [[Valens]], however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the \"Homoian\" party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire, (e.g., [[St Hilary of Poitiers]] to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene Creed and the ''homoousios'' and the Eastern semi-Arians.\n\n===Council of Constantinople===\n{{Main|Theodosius I}}\nIt was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St [[Aelia Flacilla|Flacilla]] was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. Valens died in the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 378 and was succeeded by [[Theodosius I]], who adhered to the Nicene Creed. This allowed for settling the dispute.\n\nTwo days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, 24 November 380, he expelled the [[Homoiousian]] bishop, [[Demophilus of Constantinople]], and surrendered the churches of that city to [[Gregory Nazianzus]], the leader of the rather small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world. In February he and [[Gratian]] had published an edict<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.iii.xii.iv.html |title=Sozomen's Church History VII.4 |publisher=ccel.org }}</ref> that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith), or be handed over for punishment for not doing so.\n\nAlthough much of the church hierarchy in the East had opposed the Nicene Creed in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the Nicene Creed. In 381, at the [[First Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council]] in Constantinople, a group of mainly Eastern bishops assembled and accepted the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed|Nicene Creed of 381]],<ref>The text of this version of the [[Nicene Creed]] is available at {{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.ix.iii.html |title=The Holy Creed Which the 150 Holy Fathers Set Forth, Which is Consonant with the Holy and Great Synod of Nice |publisher=ccel.org |accessdate=27 November 2010}}</ref> which was supplemented in regard to the [[Holy Spirit]], as well as some other changes: see [[Comparison of Nicene Creeds of 325 and 381|Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381]].

It does not accept the creed's definition of [[Trinity]] that the three are \"[[Consubstantiality|consubstantial]]\" nor the [[Athanasian Creed]]'s<ref>[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/The Athanasian Creed|Catholic Encyclopedia (1913): The Athanasian Creed]]</ref> statement that they are \"incomprehensible\",<ref name=\"Jeffrey R.

CMPA</ref> and [[Church of God General Conference]]<ref>[[Sir Anthony Buzzard, 3rd Baronet|Anthony Buzzard]] and Charles Hunting ''The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound''</ref> are typically [[Socinianism|Socinian]] rather than Arian in their Christology.\n* There are also various [[Binitarian]] churches, which basically believe that God is two persons, the Father and the Son, but they believe that the Holy Spirit is not a person. They include the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)]] and its various offshoots, in particular, the former Radio Church of God, founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, renamed the [[Worldwide Church of God]], which after Armstrong's death converted to Trinitarianism, causing many small breakaway churches to form, and most of them remain loyal to the teachings of Armstrong, for example, the [[Restored Church of God]], the [[United Church of God]], the [[Philadelphia Church of God]], the [[Living Church of God]], and many others. Other Binitarian churches include the Gospel Assemblies, a group of Pentecostal denominations which believe that God adopted the name Jesus, and the [[Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], an offshoot of [[Mormonism]], which believes that God is two personages, not two persons. Binitarian churches generally believe that the Father is greater than the Son, a view somewhat similar to Arianism.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Adoptionism]]\n* [[Arian controversy]]\n* [[Arian creeds]]\n* [[First Council of Nicea]]\n* [[Germanic Christianity]]\n* [[Gothic Bible]]\n* [[History of Unitarianism#Historical antecedents|History of Unitarianism]]\n* [[Jesus in Islam]]\n* [[Monarchianism]]\n* [[Non-Trinitarian churches]]\n* [[Nontrinitarianism]]\n* [[Socinianism]]\n* [[Subordinationism]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Alexandria |first=Athanasius of |title=History of the Arians|place=London|date=2013|url=http://www.limovia.net|isbn=978-1-78336-206-6}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alexandria |first=Athanasius of |authorlink=Athanasius of Alexandria |title=History of the Arians}} [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-47.htm Part I], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-48.htm Part II], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-49.htm Part III], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-50.htm Part IV], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-51.htm Part V], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-52.htm Part VI], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-53.htm Part VII], [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-54.htm Part VIII]\n* {{cite book|first=Lewis|last= Ayres|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DXeHAAAACAAJ&dq=nicaea+and+its+legacy |title=Nicaea and its Legacy: An Approach to Fourth-Century Trinitarian Theology|place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004}}\n* {{Cite book |first=Mark |last=Belletini |title=Arius in the Mirror: The Alexandrian Dissent And How It Is Reflected in Modern Unitarian Universalist Practice and Discourse |url=http://firstuucolumbus.org/sermons/ariuspaper.htm }}\n* {{cite book|title=Arianism.
