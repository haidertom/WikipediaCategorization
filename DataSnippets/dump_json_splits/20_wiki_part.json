Also, there are separate constitutional commissions for the Judicial and Legal Service, the Public Service, and the Police Service.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Simplification of govt structure of Barbados.gif|thumb|right|300px|A simplified diagram of the Barbados government]]\nThe government has been chosen by elections since [[Barbadian general election, 1961|1961 elections]], when Barbados achieved full [[Self-governing colony|self-governance]].  Before then, the government was a [[Crown colony]] consisting of either colonial administration solely (such as the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]]), or a mixture of colonial rule and a partially elected assembly, such as the [[Legislative Council of Barbados|Legislative Council]].   \n\nSince independence the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] (DLP) held office 1966 to 1976, from 1986 to 1994, and from January 2008 to 2018. The [[Barbados Labour Party]] (BLP) governed from 1976 to 1986, from September 1994 \u2013 2008 and has formed the government from 2018-Present.\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe Executive Branch of government conducts the ordinary business of government. These functions are called out by the Prime Minister or president and cabinet ministers. The prime minister chooses the ministers of government they wish to have in the cabinet but they are actually appointed by the governor general.\n\n==Law==\nThe [[Constitution of Barbados]] is the supreme law of the nation.<ref>[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Barbados/barbados66.html The official Constitution of Barbados] (1966) version.</ref> The Attorney General heads the independent [[judiciary]]. Historically, Barbadian law was based entirely on [[English common law]] with a few local adaptations. At the time of independence, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] lost its ability to legislate for Barbados, but the existing English and British common law and statutes in force at that time, together with other measures already adopted by the [[Barbadian Parliament]], became the basis of the new country's legal system.\n\nLegislation may be shaped or influenced by such organisations as the United Nations, the [[Organization of American States]], or other international bodies to which Barbados has obligatory commitments by treaty. Additionally, through international co-operation, other institutions may supply the Barbados Parliament with key sample legislation to be adapted to meet local circumstances before enacting it as local law.\n\nNew acts are passed by the Barbadian Parliament and require [[royal assent]] by the Governor-General to become law.\n\n==Judicial branch ==\n{{main|Judiciary of Barbados}}\n\nThe Judiciary is the legal system through which punishments are handed out to individuals who break the law. The Judiciary also settles disputes.\nThe Functions of The judiciary:\n\u00b0To Enforce Laws\n\u00b0To interpret Laws\n\u00b0To conduct court hearings\n\u00b0To hear court appeals\n\nThe local court system of Barbados is made up of:\n*Magistrates' Courts: Covering Criminal, Civil, Domestic, Domestic Violence, and Juvenile matters. But can also take up matters dealing with Coroner's Inquests, Liquor Licences, and civil marriages. Further, the Magistrates' Courts deal with Contract and Tort law where claims do not exceed $10,000.00.<ref name=\"court\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lawcourts.gov.bb/Aboutus.html |title=Law Courts of Barbados |publisher=Lawcourts.gov.bb |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815015349/http://www.lawcourts.gov.bb/Aboutus.html |archivedate=15 August 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n*The [[Supreme Court of Barbados|Supreme Court]]: is made up of High Court and Court of Appeals.<ref name=\"court\" />\n**High Court: Consisting of Civil, Criminal, and Family law divisions.\n**Court of Appeal: Handles appeals from the High Court and Magistrates' Court. It hears appeals in both the civil, and criminal law jurisdictions. It may consist of a single Justice of Appeal sitting in Chambers; or may sit as a Full Court of three Justices of Appeals.\n*The [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), (based in [[Port of Spain]], Trinidad and Tobago), is the court of last resort (final jurisdiction) over Barbadian law. It replaced the London-based [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (JCPC). The CCJ may resolve other disputed matters dealing with the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy|Caribbean Single Market and Economy]] (CSME).\n\n==Perception==\n[[Transparency International]] ranked Barbados as 17th place (of 179) in the world on its [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] in 2010, with only one nation scoring better in the [[Western Hemisphere|Americas]].

Belarus's fibre optics form synchronous digital hierarchy rings through other countries' systems.\n\n===International connection===\nBelarus is a member of the Trans-European Line (TEL), Trans-Asia-Europe Fibre-Optic Line (TAE) and has access to the Trans-Siberia Line (TSL); three fibre-optic segments provide connectivity to [[Latvia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], and [[Ukraine]]; worldwide service is available to Belarus through this infrastructure; [[Intelsat]], [[Eutelsat]], and [[Intersputnik]] earth stations.\n\nIn 2006 it was announced that Belarus and Russia completed the second broadband link between the two countries, the [[Yartsevo]]-[[Vitebsk]] cable. The capacity of this high speed terrestrial link which based on DWDM and STM technology is 400Gbit/s with the ability to upgrade in the future.<ref>[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/treg/newslog/Beltelecom+Rostelecom+Complete+Crossborder+Fibre+Tieup.aspx Beltelecom, Rostelecom complete cross-border fibre tie-up]</ref>\n\n===Cellular communications===\nBelarus has 3 GSM/UMTS operators - Velcom, MTS, life.

In 2006 Beltelecom introduced a new trademark, ''Byfly'', for its [[ADSL]] access. As of 2008 Byfly was available in all [[administrative centre]]s of Belarus.

In addition to these troops Belarus was host to centrally controlled formations, namely the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]], the [[38th Guards Mobile Brigade|38th Guards Airborne Brigade]], the 11th Air Defence Corps of the [[2nd Air Defence Army]], the [[1st Air Army|26th Air Army]] and also units and formations of the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]], [[Long Range Aviation]], the Navy and special forces.\n\nIn late 1991 the 5th Guards Tank Army comprised the [[55th Guards Rifle Division|30th Guards Motor Rifle Division]], newly arrived from Czechoslovakia, and the [[193rd Tank Division]], plus two armament and equipment storage bases (the former 8th Guards and 29th Tank Divisions), and army troops. The 7th Tank Army comprised the [[3rd Guards Tank Division]], [[34th Tank Division|34th]], and [[37th Guards Tank Division]]s, plus army troops. The 28th Army comprised four divisions, one of which was a low-status mobilisation division. Also arriving from the [[Southern Group of Forces]] in Hungary was the [[19th Guards Tank Division]].\n\nOn September 20, 1991 the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed resolution \"On the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus\" and on January 11, 1992 resolution \"On the Armed Forces deployed in the territory of the Republic of Belarus.\" On March 18, 1992 the parliament passed resolution \"On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus\" that bound the government \"to start the formation of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus as of March 20, 1992\" and \"to submit to the Supreme Soviet for approval the suggested structure of the Armed Forces, their size and order of their material and technical supplies\".\n\nOn May 6, 1992 the [[Belorussian Military District]] was abolished. The Belarusian Ministry of Defence and the Main Staff were formed from its resources.<ref>I N Rodionov, ed, Belorusskiy voyennyy okrug, Military Encyclopedia, t1, \"Voyennoye izdatel'stvo\", Moscow, 1997, 422, cited in Main, 2003, 6.</ref> The former first deputy commander and military district Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General P P Kozlovskiy, was appointed Minister of Defence on 22 April 1992, taking over from acting Minister of Defence Colonel-General Petr Chaus.\n\nOn November 3, 1992, Belarus passed the law \"On the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus\" defining the status, structure and guiding principles of the Armed Forces.<ref>Pavel Bykovsky & Alexander Vasilevich, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/5-2001/dp/mdafb/ Military Development and the Armed Forces of Belarus], Moscow Defence Brief, CAST, 2007</ref> After the introduction of presidency the law was amended twice: on September 4, 1996 and on November 9, 1999 but on the whole the law retains its initial contents.\n\nOn January 1, 1993 all service personnel on Belarusian soil were required to either take an oath of loyalty to Belarus, or leave. This oath however did not alleviate concerns regarding loyalty to Russia in time of crisis, especially since nearly 50% of all military personnel were ethnically Russian at the end of 1992.\n\nIn June 1995, President Lushenko issued a decree on the Mobile Forces. By June 1996, they comprised a headquarters in Vitebsk, two brigades drawn from the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, the 38th Independent Mobile Brigade ([[Brest, Belarus]]), an air transport regiment, and communications, logistics, and engineer units.<ref>Richard Woff, 'Minsk: making limited progress with reform,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], June 1996, 248.</ref>\n\nMembership in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], as well as the 1996 treaty on the [[Union of Russia and Belarus]] and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State in 1999, confirmed a close partnership with Russia. Much of the air defence system is integrated into the Russian air defence network, and in 2006 the two nations signed an agreement on the creation of a unified air defence system.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/russia/2006/russia-061019-rianovosti02.htm Russia, Belarus to sign agreement on joint air defence system], [[RIA Novosti]] via GlobalSecurity.org, 19 October 2006.</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nBelarus government websites say that the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Belarus is supported by Central Command Support Elements and the General Staff of the Armed Forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.mil.by/struct1vseng.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502013106/http://mod.mil.by/struct1vseng.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 May 2006|title=Ministry of Defence of RB - News|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref>\nCombat Support Elements of the Armed Forces included Reconnaissance, Electronic Warfare, Signals, Engineer, NBC Defence, Navigation and Topography, and Maintenance organisations.

Nations]] (the other being the [[Ukrainian SSR]]). Both republics and the [[Soviet Union]] joined the UN when the organization was founded in 1945.\n\n==Prior to 2001==\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], at which time Belarus gained its independence, Belarus became a member of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS), the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]], the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[World Bank]]. The adoption by Supreme Council of the BSSR of the declaration of State Sovereignty of Belarus in 1990 was a turning point on the development of the state. It has also been [[Union State|in a supranational union with Russia]] since 2 April 1996, although this has had little practical effect.\n\n===Belarus\u2013Russia relations===\n{{further|Foreign relations of Russia towards Belarus}}\nThe introduction of [[free trade]] between Russia and Belarus in mid-1995 led to a spectacular growth in bilateral trade, which was only temporarily reversed in the wake of the [[History of post-Soviet Russia#The crises of 1998|financial crisis of 1998]]. President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] sought to develop a closer relationship with Russia. The framework for the Union of Russia and Belarus was set out in the Treaty On the Formation of a Community of Russia and Belarus (1996), the Treaty on Russia-Belarus Union, the Union Charter (1997), and the Treaty of the Formation of a Union State (1999). The integration treaties contained commitments to [[monetary union]], [[civil rights|equal rights]], single citizenship, and a common defence and [[foreign policy]].\n\n===Belarus\u2013European Union relations===\n{{Main|Belarus\u2013European Union relations}}\nFollowing the recognition of Belarus as an independent state in December 1991 by the [[European Community]], EC/EU-Belarus relations initially experienced a steady progress. The signature of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) in 1995 signaled a commitment to political, economic and trade cooperation. Some assistance was provided to Belarus within the framework of the [[TACIS]] programme and also through various aid programs and loans. However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in 1996 after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the [[Drazdy conflict]]. The EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the 1994 constitution. The [[Council of the European Union]] decided against Belarus in 1997: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the [[Council of Europe]] was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.\nAcknowledging the lack of progress in relation to bilateral relations and the internal situation following the position adopted in 1997, the EU adopted a step-by-step approach in 1999, whereby sanctions would be gradually lifted upon fulfillment of the four benchmarks set by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. In 2000, some moderately positive developments toward the implementation of recommendations made by the OSCE AMG were observed but were not sufficient in the realm of access to fair and free elections.\n\n===Belarus\u2013United States relations===\nThe United States has encouraged Belarus to conclude and adhere to agreements with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) on the program of macroeconomic stabilization and related reform measures, as well as to undertake increased privatization and to create a favorable climate for business and investment. Although there has been some American direct private investment in Belarus, its development has been relatively slow given the uncertain pace of reform. An Overseas Private Investment Corporation agreement was signed in June 1992 but has been suspended since 1995 because Belarus did not fulfill its obligations under the agreement. Belarus is eligible for [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] short-term financing [[insurance]] for U.S. investments, but because of the adverse business climate, no projects have been initiated. The IMF granted standby credit in September 1995, but Belarus has fallen off the program and did not receive the second tranche of funding, which had been scheduled for regular intervals throughout 1996.\n\nThe United States - along with the European Union - has restricted the travel of President Alexander Lukashenko and members of his inner circle, as well as imposing economic sanctions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17941637|title=Belarus profile - Timeline|date=2016-09-20|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Present situation (2001 onwards)==\n\n===Relations with the European Union===\n{{main|Belarus\u2013European Union relations}}\nThe structure of Belarus trade reflects the low competitiveness and output decline of manufacturing industry in the country over the past decade, leading to the predominance of primary production, work-intensive goods as exports. Belarusian exports to the EU consist mainly of agricultural and textile products, while imports from the EU are primarily machinery.\n\nBelarus is a beneficiary of the EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). The European Commission decided in 2003 to initiate an investigation into violations of freedom of association in Belarus as the first step towards a possible temporary withdrawal of the GSP from Belarus.\n\nIn December 2004, the EU adopted a position aimed at imposing travel restrictions on officials from Belarus responsible for the fraudulent parliamentary elections and referendum on 17 October 2004, and for human rights violations during subsequent peaceful political demonstrations in [[Minsk]].\nThe [[European Parliament]] released a statement in March 2005 in which it denounced the Belarusian government as a dictatorship. The European parliamentarians were primarily concerned about the suppression of independent media outlets in the country and the fraudulent referendum. A resolution of the European Parliament declared that the personal bank accounts of President Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian officials should be tracked and frozen.\n\nIn 2005, [[Amnesty International]] reported a ''pattern of deliberate obstruction, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders'' in Belarus. [[Reporters Without Borders]] accused the Belarusian authorities of hounding and arresting journalists from the country's Polish minority. Lukashenko has closed the country's main Polish newspaper, printing a bogus paper instead with the same name and size that praises his incumbent government. Several foreign, mainly Polish, journalists have been arrested or expelled from the country. Lukashenko accused Poland of an attempt to overthrow his government by stirring up a peaceful revolution in Belarus comparable to the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2004.\n\nLater in 2005 the Belarusian [[riot police]] seized the headquarters of the [[Union of Poles in Belarus]], an association representing the 400,000 [[ethnic minority]] Polish living in western areas the country that were part of Poland until [[World War II]]. The dispute between Poland and Belarus escalated further as Poland responded by recalling its ambassador from Belarus for indefinite consultations, and called on the European Union to impose sanctions on the Belarusian leadership in order to curtail the [[human rights]] abuses in Belarus. Belarusian papers described this as a 'dirty political game', and part of a 'cold war' waged on president Lukashenko. Polish Foreign Minister [[Adam Rotfeld]] said a clampdown was under way, aimed at destroying ''\"all elements of political pluralism and independence\"'' in Belarus.\n\n[[File:European Union Eastern Partnership.svg|thumb|Members of the Eastern Partnership]]\nIn August 2005 the EU's executive commission called for human rights to be respected in Belarus. The commission said it was considering offering support to independent media in the country and had set aside more than eight million euros from its budget to offer support for human rights activities. France expressed her solidarity with Poland on the issue of human rights in Belarus a day after the EU declared it was worried about the situation in that country. Several former Soviet Republics, including neighbouring Ukraine, also expressed their concerns about the development of the situation in Belarus.\n\nIn May 2009 Belarus and the EU agree on cooperation in the [[Eastern Partnership]] (EaP). However, it is contended by some scholars that the (EaP) is unable to create a workable partnership.<ref name=Korosteleva2008>[[Elena Korosteleva]], \"The Limits of the EU Governance: Belarus ' Response to the European Neighbourhood Policy\", Contemporary Politics, Vol. 15(2), June 2009, pp. 229\u201345</ref> This proved to be correct when Belarus withdrew from the Partnership on 30 September 2011.<ref name=\"Belarus Withdrawal\">[http://www.euractiv.com/europes-east/belarus-quits-eus-eastern-partnership-initiative-news-508050 Belarus quits EU's Eastern Partnership initiative], ''[[Eur Activ]]'', 2011-10-30</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, Belarus expelled all [[Sweden|Swedish]] diplomats, including the Swedish Ambassador to Belarus, Stefan Eriksson, and closed its embassy in [[Stockholm]], after a Swedish [[public relations]] firm released [[teddy bear]]s carrying pro-democracy flyers in parachutes from an airplane over Minsk on 4 July 2012. Lukashenko also fired his air defence chief and the head of the border guards over the incident. Their replacements have been told not to hesitate to use force to stop future intrusions from abroad.<ref name=\"Belarus Sweden\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19176432 Belarus-Sweden teddy bear row escalates], ''[[BBC News]]'', 2012-08-08</ref>\n\n===Relations with Russia===\n{{main|Belarus\u2013Russia relations}}\nRussia remains the largest and most important partner for Belarus both in the political and economic fields. After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' [[customs union|customs duties were unified]] in March 2001 but the customs controls were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian [[industry]], Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of [[raw material]]s and components. After initial negotiation with the [[Central Bank of the Russian Federation|Russian Central Bank]] on [[monetary union]], the [[Russian ruble]] was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.\n\n===Relations with the United States===\n{{Main|Belarus\u2013United States relations}}\nBelarus has had an ongoing discussion to relaunch IMF-backed reforms, concluding an arrangement for an IMF Staff-monitored program (SMP) in 2001. However, the authorities did not follow through with reforms as hoped, leaving an uncertain future for IMF-backed cooperation. Belarus authorities have said on several occasions that they find IMF intervention and recommendations in Belarus counter-productive to the economic development of those countries.\nThe relationships with the United States have been further strained, after [[Congress of the United States]] unanimously passed the [[Belarus Democracy Act of 2004]].\n\nOn 7 March 2008 the government of Belarus ejected US Ambassador [[Karen B. Stewart]] from the country, following a row over travel restrictions placed on President Lukashenko and sanctions against state-owned chemical company [[Belneftekhim]]. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry announced at the same time that it was recalling its own ambassador to the US. This was followed by the expulsion of ten other U.S. embassy staff from Minsk in late April. At the same time the government of Belarus ordered the U.S. Embassy in Minsk to cut its staff by half.<ref name=\"aljazeera1\">{{Cite web\n|url =

relations with the United States and the European Union, as well as occasional high-level disputes with Russia over prices on core imported natural resources such as oil and gas, Belarus aims to develop better relations with countries in other regions like Middle East, Asia, and [[Latin America]].<ref>Rafal Czachor, Polityka wielowektorowo\u015bci Republiki Bia\u0142oru\u015b \u2013 geneza,

In 2005, the public company was split into 2 companies: [[Infrabel]], which manages the rail network and SNCB/NMBS itself, which manages the freight and passenger services. Both companies are held by a third company, named SNCB/NMBS Holding. There is a total of {{convert|3536|km|0}}, ({{convert|2563|km|0|abbr=on}} double track (as of 1998)), of which {{convert|2950|km|0|abbr=on}} are electrified, mainly at 3,000 volts DC but with {{convert|351|km|0|abbr=on}} at 25&nbsp;kV 50&nbsp;Hz AC (2004) and all on [[standard gauge]] of {{RailGauge|sg}}. In 2004 the National Railway Company of Belgium, carried 178.4 million passengers a total of 8,676 million passenger-kilometres. Due to the high population density, operations are relatively profitable, so tickets are cheap and the frequency of services is high. The SNCB/NMBS is continually updating its rolling stock.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe network currently includes [[High-speed rail in Belgium|four high speed lines]], three operating up to {{convert|300|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, and one up to {{convert|260|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. [[HSL 1]] runs from just south of Brussels to the French border, where it continues to [[Lille]], and from there to [[Paris]] or [[London]]. [[HSL 2]] runs from [[Leuven]] to [[Li\u00e8ge]]. [[HSL 3]] continues this route from Li\u00e8ge to the German border near [[Aachen]].

It was initially supposed to be in service in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b-rail.be/projects/pages/inv07.htm|title=SNCB|website=B-rail.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref> but some observers expect it not to be ready before 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibre.be/economie/actualite/article/338350/pas-de-rer-a-bruxelles-avant-2016.html|title=Pas de RER \u00e0 Bruxelles avant ... 2016|website=Lalibre.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Metros and light rail===\n{{see also|Trams in Europe}}\nIn Belgium an extensive system of tram-like local railways called ''[[Vicinal tramway|vicinal or buurtspoor]]'' lines crossed the country in the first half of the 20th century, and had a greater route length than the main-line [[railway]] system. The only survivors of the vicinal/buurtspoor system are the [[Belgian coast tram|Kusttram]] (covering almost the entire coast from France to the Netherlands, being the longest tram line in the world) and some sections of the [[Charleroi Pre-metro]]. Urban tram networks exist in Antwerp (the [[Antwerp Pre-metro]]), [[Ghent]] and Brussels (the [[Brussels trams]]), and are gradually being extended. The only [[rapid transit]] system in Belgium is the [[Brussels Metro]]. Some heavy [[rapid transit|metro]] infrastructures were built in Brussels, Antwerp and the Charleroi area, but these are currently used by [[light rail]] vehicles, and their conversion to full [[rapid transit|metro]] is not envisaged at present due to lack of funds.\n\nRegional transport in Belgium is operated by regional companies: [[De Lijn]] in [[Flanders]] operates the Kusttram and the Antwerp pre-metro and tram, and the tram in Gent, as well as a bus network both urban and interurban, [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 R\u00e9gionale Wallonne du Transport|TEC]] in [[Wallonia]] operates the Charleroi pre-metro as well as a bus network and [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|MIVB/STIB]] in the [[Brussels Capital-Region]] operates the Brussels metro as well as the Brussels tram and bus network. Despite this regional organization, some bus and tram routes operated by STIB/MIVB go beyond the regional border, and some bus routes operated by TEC or De Lijn transport passengers from the Flemish or Walloon regions to the capital city or in the other regions.\n\n==Road transport==\n\n===Road network===\n[[File:Lijn11 a12.jpg|thumb|280px|The [[A12 road (Belgium)|A12]] with a railway in the centre.]]\nThe road network in Belgium is managed by regional authorities, meaning that a road section in Flanders is managed by the [[Flemish Government]], a road section in Brussels by the [[Government of the Brussels-Capital Region|Brussels government]] and a road section in Wallonia by the [[Walloon Government]]. This explains that road signs in Flanders are written in Dutch, even when referring to a Walloon region, and conversely, which can be confusing for foreigners who do not know the different translations of Flemish or Walloon cities in the other language. The road network in Belgium is made of highways, national (or regional) roads (the secondary network) and communal roads (or streets). Communal roads are managed at the municipal level. There are also a number of orbital roads in Belgium around major cities.\n\n* ''total:'' 152,256&nbsp;km (2006)\n* ''country comparison to the world:'' 35\n* ''paved:'' 119,079&nbsp;km (including 1,763&nbsp;km of expressways)\n* ''unpaved:'' 33,177&nbsp;km\n\nBelgian road numbering evolved during the middle decades of the twentieth century, in a relatively inconsistent way. Road number allocations became less systematic during the surge in road building that took place in the 1960s and 70s. Frequently downgraded and deteriorating older national roads retained two digit numbers while newer major roads were identified with less instantly memorable three digit numbers, if only because the shorter numbers were already taken. 1985 saw a comprehensive renumbering of the \"N\" (National) roads which now followed the scheme described below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wegen-routes.be/hist/histsign.html|title=Wegen-Routes.be: Bewegwijzering en wegnummering in Belgi\u00eb|website=Wegen-routes.be|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Highways====\n{{main|List of motorways in Belgium}}\n\nThe highways in Belgium are marked with a letter '''A''' and a number. Most often however the European numbering system for the [[international E-road network]] is used. There is however not always a one-on-one relationship between the two numbering systems along the whole length of the highways.\n\n*[[A1 road (Belgium)|A1]] ([[European route E19|E19]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Antwerp]] - [[Breda]]\n*[[A2 motorway (Belgium)|A2]] ([[European route E314|E314]]): [[Leuven]] - [[Lummen]] - [[Genk]]\n*[[A3 road (Belgium)|A3]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Leuven]] - [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] - [[Aachen]]\n*[[A4 road (Belgium)|A4]] ([[European route E411|E411]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Wavre]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Arlon]] - [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]\n*[[A10 road (Belgium)|A10]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Brussels]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Bruges]] - [[Ostend]]\n*[[A12 road (Belgium)|A12]] ([[Brussels]] - [[Boom, Antwerp|Boom]] - [[Antwerp]] - ''[[Netherlands]]'' ([[Bergen op Zoom]])<br>:''(includes a section not yet fully upgraded to motorway standard)''\n*[[A13 road (Belgium)|A13]] ([[European route E313|E313]]): [[Antwerp]] - [[Beringen, Belgium|Beringen]] - [[Hasselt]] - [[Li\u00e8ge]]\n*[[A14 road (Belgium)|A14]] ([[European route E17|E17]]): [[Lille]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Ghent]] - [[Antwerp]]\n*[[A15 road (Belgium)|A15]] ([[European route E42|E42]]): [[Charleroi]] - [[Namur (city)|Namur]] - [[Huy]] - [[Li\u00e8ge]]\n*[[A17 road (Belgium)|A17]] ([[European route E403|E403]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Kortrijk]] - [[Tournai]]\n*[[A18 road (Belgium)|A18]] ([[European route E40|E40]]): [[Bruges]] - [[Veurne]] - [[Dunkerque]]\n\n====Ringways====\nThe ringways (or orbital roads) around bigger cities have their own series of numbers. The names start with a '''R''' then a first digit indicating the (old) province, and sometimes a second digit to further differentiate in between different ringways.\n\nSome major examples are:\n*[[R0 road (Belgium)|R0]] is the outer ringway around [[Brussels]]. The [[R20 road (Belgium)|R20]] and [[R22 road (Belgium)|R22]] are (parts of) inner ringways around Brussels.\n*[[R1 ring road (Belgium)|R1]] is the southern half ringway and [[R2 road (Belgium)|R2]] is the northern half ringway around [[Antwerp]].\n*[[R3 ring road (Belgium)|R3]] is the outer ringway and [[R9 road (Belgium)|R9]] is the inner ringway around [[Charleroi]].

Cotton accounts for 40% of GDP and roughly 80% of official export receipts. There is also production of [[textile]]s, palm products, and [[cocoa bean]]s. [[Maize]] (corn), [[bean]]s, [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[cashew]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[cassava]], [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and other various tubers are grown for local subsistence. [[Benin]] began producing a modest quantity of offshore oil in October 1982. Production ceased in recent years but exploration of new sites is ongoing.\n\nA modest fishing fleet provides fish and shrimp for local subsistence and export to Europe. Formerly government-owned commercial activities are now privatized. A French [[brewing|brewer]] acquired the former state-run brewery. Smaller businesses are privately owned by Beninese citizens, but some firms are foreign owned, primarily French and [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]. The private commercial and agricultural sectors remain the principal contributors to growth.\n\n==Economic development==\nSince the transition to a [[Democracy|democratic]] government in 1990, Benin has undergone an economic recovery. A large injection of external investment from both private and public sources has alleviated the economic difficulties of the early 1990s caused by global recession and persistently low commodity prices (although the latter continues to affect the economy). The manufacturing sector is confined to some light industry, which is mainly involved in processing primary products and the cow production of consumer goods. A planned joint [[hydroelectric]] project with neighboring [[Togo]] is intended to reduce Benin's dependence on imported energy mostly from [[Ghana]], which currently accounts for a significant proportion of the country's imports.\n\nThe service sector has grown quickly, stimulated by economic liberalization and fiscal reform, and the use of modern technology such as automobiles and computers has grown considerably as a result. Membership of the [[CFA Franc Zone]] offers reasonable currency stability as well as access to French economic support. Benin sells its products mainly to France and, in smaller quantities, to the Netherlands, Korea, Japan, and India. France is Benin's leading source for imports. Benin is also a member of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS).\n\nDespite its rapid growth, the economy of Benin still remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output averaged a sound 5% since 1996, but a rapid population rise offset much of this growth on a per capita basis.  Inflation has subsided over the past several years. Commercial and transport activities, which make up a large part of GDP, are vulnerable to developments in [[Nigeria]], particularly fuel shortages.\n\nAlthough [[trade unions in Benin]] represent up to 75% of the formal workforce, the large informal economy has been noted by the [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITCU) to contain ongoing problems, including a lack of women's wage equality, the use of [[child labor|child labour]], and the continuing issue of [[unfree labour|forced labour]].<ref>{{cite web\n | title=Serious violations of core labour standards in Benin, Burkina Faso and Mali\n | work=ICFTU Online\n | url=http://www.icftu.org/displaydocument.asp?Index=991220267&Language=EN\n | accessdate=30 July 2007\n}}</ref><br />\n\nIn December 2014, the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]] issued a ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''<ref>[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/ List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]</ref> in which the Republic of Benin was mentioned among 74 other countries where significant instances of child labor were observed. Two major products involved such working conditions in Benin: cotton and crushed granite.\n\n==Banks and finance==\n{{one source|date=June 2014}}\nBenin\u2019s financial sector is dominated by banks, and in general remains shallow. However, a series of reforms were undertaken in the 1990s, which resulted in the consolidation of the banking sector and in the privatization of all state banks.\n\nA legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place and underwent significant reforms in 1999. There is no customer deposit insurance system.\n\nBenin has a lively and diversified microfinance sector. Data from 2003 by the Central Bank stated a penetration rate of microfinance services of almost 60 percent. In 2006 the Ministry of Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women counted 762 organizations with 1308 branches, including Cooperatives, NGOs, Savings/Credit Associations and government projects. Programmes for strengthening the sector are carried out on national and regional levels, such as the PRAFIDE (Programme R\u00e9gional d\u2019Appui \u00e0 la finance D\u00e9centralis\u00e9e). The microfinance sector is also subject to supervision through the Central Bank as well as the responsible Ministry for Microfinance and Employment of Youth and Women.\n\nBenin is member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeur Mobili\u00e9s (BRVM) located in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Stocks were issued by a number of companies in the region. Listed bonds were partly issued by companies and partly by governments of the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UEMOA).\n\nThe payment and settlement system and clearing mechanisms were reformed in 2004 through the BCEAO and offer RTGS and SWIFT access to banks, financial institutions, the stock exchange as well as the Central bank and special banks.<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/benin/benin-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A Benin: Financial Sector Profile]</ref>\n\n*[[Banque Internationale du B\u00e9nin]] (BI.BE)\n*[[Bank of Africa]] Benin\n*[[Continental Bank]] Benin\n*[[Diamond Bank Benin]] (DBB)\n*[[Ecobank]]\n*[[Financial Bank]]\n*[[Finadev]]\n*[[Caisse Nationale d'Epargne]]\n*[[Credit du B\u00e9nin]]\n*[[Equibail]]\n* United Bank of Africa\n* Africa Bank for the Industry and the trade\n* Sahelo-Saharian Bank of the Industry and Trade Development\n\n== Data ==\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=70&pr.y=2&sy=1980&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=638&s=NGDP_RPCH,PPPGDP,PPPPC,PCPIPCH,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-09-09|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1980\n!1985\n!1990\n!1995\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|2.69 Bln.\n|3.70 Bln.\n|4.75 Bln.\n|6.59 Bln.\n|9.06 Bln.\n|12.33 Bln.\n|13.22 Bln.\n|14.38 Bln.\n|15.38 Bln.\n|15.86 Bln.\n|16.39 Bln.\n|17.23 Bln.\n|18.39 Bln.\n|20.03 Bln.\n|21.69 Bln.\n|22.38 Bln.\n|23.57 Bln.\n|25.33 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|740\n|866\n|954\n|1,115\n|1,321\n|1,545\n|1,608\n|1,701\n|1,768\n|1,773\n|1,782\n|1,821\n|1,890\n|2,003\n|2,111\n|2,121\n|2,175\n|2,277\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|9.3 %\n|4.3 %\n|9.0 %\n|6.0 %\n|4.9 %\n|1.7 %\n|3.9 %\n|6.0 %\n|4.9 %\n|2.3 %\n|2.1 %\n|3.0 %\n|4.8 %\n|7.2 %\n|6.4 %\n|2.1 %\n|4.0 %\n|5.6 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|9.6 %\n|1.2 %\n|1.1 %\n|14.5 %\n|4.2 %\n|5.4 %\n|3.8 %\n|1.3 %\n|7.9 %\n|0.4 %\n|2.2 %\n|2.7 %\n|6.7 %\n|1.0 %\n|\u22121.1 %\n|0.3 %\n|\u22120.8 %\n|0.1 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|...\n|54 %\n|39 %\n|11 %\n|20 %\n|25 %\n|26 %\n|29 %\n|30 %\n|27 %\n|25 %\n|30 %\n|42 %\n|50 %\n|55 %\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agriculture in Benin]]\n*[[Fishing in Benin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = Mulindabigwi\n  | first = Valens\n  | title = Influence des systemes agraires sur l'utilisation des terroirs, la sequestration du carbone et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 alimentaire dans le bassin versant de l'Oueme superieur au B\u00e9nin\n  | publisher = Cuvillier\n  | year = 2006\n  | location = G\u00f6ttingen \n  | isbn = 978-3-86537-871-2}}\n\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303234153/http://bankinginfo.org/central_bank/benin.htm Benin Banking Information]\n*{{dmoz|Regional/Africa/Benin/Business_and_Economy/Economic_Development}}\n*[http://www.resimao.org West African Agricultural Market Observer/Observatoire du March\u00e9 Agricole  (RESIMAO)], a project of the West-African Market Information Network (WAMIS-NET),  provides live market and commodity prices from fifty seven regional and local public agricultural markets across Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Niger, Mali, Senegal, Togo, and Nigeria.

Agriculture consists largely of [[subsistence farming]] and [[animal husbandry]]. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive.\n\nThe economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. Most production in the industrial sector is of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian [[migrant labour]]. Model education, social, and environment programs are underway with support from multilateral development organisations.\n\nEach economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade, labour, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. [[Hydropower]] exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth, even though GDP fell in 2008 as a result of a slowdown in India, its predominant export market.\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\n{{further|Energy in Bhutan}}\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Bhutan at market prices [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/01/data/weorept.aspx?sy=1980&ey=2008&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&pr1.x=37&pr1.y=8&c=514&s=NGDP_R%2CNGDP_RPCH%2CNGDP%2CNGDPD%2CNGDP_D%2CNGDPRPC%2CNGDPPC%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPWGT%2CPPPPC%2CPPPSH%2CPPPEX%2CPCPI%2CPCPIPCH%2CLP%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&grp=0&a=|reported] by the [[International Monetary Fund]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding the nation's productive base and improving social welfare. Model education, social, and environment programs in Bhutan are underway with support from multilateral development organisations. Each economic program takes into account the government's desire to protect the country's environment and cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale, environmentally conscientious tourists. Detailed controls and uncertain policies in such areas as industrial licensing, trade, labour, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.\n\nIn 2004, Bhutan became the first country in the world to ban smoking and the selling of tobacco.\n\n==Other statistics==\n[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bhutan.jpeg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Bhutan's exports.]]\n'''Industrial production growth rate:'''\n9.3% (1996 est.)\n\n'''Electricity:'''\n* ''production:'' 2 [[TWh]] (2005)\n* ''consumption:'' 380 [[GWh]] (2005)\n* ''exports:'' 1.5 TWh (2005) (exports electricity to India)\n* ''imports:'' 20 GWh (2005)\n\n'''Electricity \u2013 production by source:'''\n* ''fossil fuel:'' 0.39%\n* ''hydro:'' 99.61%\n* ''nuclear:'' 0%\n* ''other:'' 0% (1998)\n\n'''Oil:'''\n* ''production:'' {{convert|0|oilbbl/d}} (2005)\n* ''consumption:'' {{convert|1200|oilbbl/d}} (2005 est.)\n* ''exports:'' {{convert|0|oilbbl/d}} (2004)\n* ''imports:'' {{convert|1138|oilbbl/d}} (2004)\n\n'''Agriculture \u2013 products:'''\nrice, corn, root crops, citrus, foodgrains, dairy products, eggs\n\n'''Currency:'''\n1 [[Bhutanese ngultrum|ngultrum]] (BTN) = 100 chetrum; Indian rupee (INR)\n\n'''Historic exchange rates:'''\n:{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! &nbsp; !!2006 ||2005 ||2004 ||2003 ||2002 ||2001 ||1999 \n|- align=\"right\"\n| align=\"left\"|Ngultrum per US$1 || 45,279|| 44,101|| 45,317|| 46,583|| 48.61|| 47,186|| 43,055\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Agriculture in Bhutan]]\n* [[Banking in Bhutan]]\n* [[Mining in Bhutan]]\n* [[Fishing in Bhutan]]\n* [[Forestry in Bhutan]]\n* [[Bhutanese ngultrum]], currency\n\n==References==\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n*{{StateDept}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21160796~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:223547,00.html Global Economic Prospects: Growth Prospects for South Asia] [[The World Bank]], 13 December 2006\n\n{{Bhutan topics}}\n{{Asia in topic|Economy of}}\n{{SAFTA}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Bhutan}}\n[[Category:Economy of Bhutan| ]]", "sha1": "m54i5zckgjes5h0qc1nhw5cd3860bqq"}}, {"title": "Bhutan/Transnational issues", "ns": "0", "id": "3587", "redirect": {"title": "Bhutan"}, "revision": {"id": "783859726", "parentid": "629652832", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:19:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Bhutan]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from subpage}}\n}}", "sha1": "s20aynwtyukrxlgdsebo9phesplbrk3"}}, {"title": "Lhop people", "ns": "0", "id": "3589", "revision": {"id": "847068245", "parentid": "845799646", "timestamp": "2018-06-22T18:11:57Z", "contributor": {"ip": "186.241.208.155"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group   = Lhop<br>(Doya)\n|image = \n|caption  =\n|population = 2,500 (1993)<ref name=VanDriem93>{{cite web|url=http://repository.forcedmigration.org/pdf/?pid=fmo:3003 |format=PDF |last=van Driem |first=George L. |authorlink=George van Driem |title=Language Policy in Bhutan |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] |location=[[London]] |year=1993 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n|popplace = Southwestern [[Bhutan]] ([[Samtse District]])\n|langs    = [[Lhokpu language|Lhokpu]], [[Dzongkha]]\n|rels     = [[Buddhism]], [[B\u00f6n]]\n|related-c  = [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]]\n}}\nThe '''Lhop''' or '''Doya people''' are a little-known tribe of southwest [[Bhutan]].

[[Judeo-Christian]] [[literature]] positioned blindness as a flaw; only through a cure could God's love be made manifest, when the scales would fall away from the eyes of an afflicted individual upon contact with a holy man or relic. Almost without exception in early literature, blind people could bring this condition down upon themselves through sin or trespasses against the gods, but were never the sole instruments of its reversal.\n\n==Blind people in literature written by visually able authors==\n\nIt is impossible to make a blanket generalization about how the blind were treated in literature beyond that point&nbsp;\u2013 they were marvelous, gifted, evil, malicious, ignorant, wise, helpless, innocent, or burdensome depending upon who wrote the story&nbsp;\u2013 except to say that blindness is perceived to be such a loss that it leaves an indelible mark on a person's character.\n\nEven pioneers in training the blind, such as [[Dorothy Harrison Eustis]], harboured negative stereotypes about them. Blind people had, in her opinion, grown so accustomed to waiting on others as to be passive and 'whiney.'\n\nFather Thomas Carroll, who founded the Carroll Centre for the Blind, wrote ''Blindness: What It Is, What It Does and How to Live with It'' in 1961. In it, he characterized blindness in terms of 20 losses, and as the 'death' of the sighted individual.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.org/hall/bios/carroll.html|title=American Printing House for the Blind Hall of Fame|publisher=www.aph.org}}</ref>\n\nIn \"Moumoku Monogatari\", [[Junichiro Tanizaki]] retells the well-known tale of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] from the perspective of a blind servant. The character is portrayed as demonstrating a number of traditional Japanese virtues, but ultimately falls prey to his own human flaws.\n\n\"[[The Country of the Blind]]\", a short story by [[H. G. Wells]], is one of the most well-known stories featuring blind characters. A sighted man finds himself in a country that has been isolated from the rest of the world for centuries, wherein all the inhabitants are blind even as their ancestors had been. These people are depicted as self-sufficient, having developed their other senses, but they are ultimately closed-minded and insular to the point of [[xenophobia]]. As they themselves have no sight, they wish to deprive the traveler of his own eyes in this allegorical tale of stagnation.\n\n''[[All the Light We Cannot See]],'' a [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer prize]] winning novel by [[Anthony Doerr]], tells the story of Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a young girl who has gone completely blind due to [[cataract]]s at the age of 6. She keeps her mind sharp with intricate puzzle boxes, which her father carves for her, and [[Braille]] novels.\n\n==Literature by blind people==\nWhile blind and visually impaired people had contributed to the body of common literature for centuries, one notable example being the author of ''Paradise Lost'', [[John Milton]], the creation of autobiographical materials, or materials specific to blindness, is relatively new.\n\nMost people are familiar with [[Helen Keller]], who was both blind and deaf, but there has been considerable progress since the publication of her work.\n\n* Blind author [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] has written several inspirational books, including ''If You Could See What I Hear'', about his life and accomplishments.\n* [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who suffered from a congenital condition that caused him to become blind by middle age, discussed his condition in many autobiographical and semi-autobiographical works.\n* Stephen Kuusisto wrote about his experiences as a visually impaired person in ''Planet of the Blind,'' and his upcoming memoir, ''Eavesdropping: A Life By Ear''.\n* John Hull, a university lecturer, wrote about going blind in ''Touching the Rock: An Experience of Blindness''.\n* [[Reinmar von Zweter]] 13th century German writer of [[Gnomic poetry]], featured in the ''[[Codex Manesse]]''.  \n* Georgina Kleege, visually impaired since age 11, wrote about her life and how it was affected by cultural perceptions of blindness in ''Sight Unseen''.\n*[[Sally Hobart Alexander]] became blind when she was about 25 and a schoolteacher, during the 1970s, because of an eye disease. She wrote at least three autobiographical books about adapting to blindness.\n*French author [[Jacques Lusseyran]], who was visually impaired at the age of 7 when he injured his eyes on the sharp corner of a teacher's desk, became part of the French resistance during World War II. He spent a year in concentration camps, surviving the experience and writing several books. \"And There Was Light\" chronicles his experiences from early childhood until his liberation from a concentration camp.\n\n==See also==\n* [[On His Blindness]] by [[John Milton]]\n* [[Blindness and education]]\n* [[Nico (TV series)|''Nico'' (also known as ''Nicholas'')]], a TV series for educating children about blind people (considering television a sort of literature)\n*[[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Ad\u00e8le Husson]]\n*[[:Category:Literature about blindness]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040417060049/http://www.blind.net/bpba1974.htm Blindness: Is Literature Against Us?]\n*[https://archive.is/20040929102431/http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/11870 The Country of the Blind and Other Stories, by H.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian plain|Pannonian basin]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic sea]].\n\nThe country's natural resources include: coal, iron ore, bauxite, manganese, nickel, clay, gypsum, salt, sand, timber and hydropower\n\n==Regions==\n\nThe country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the southern part of the country.\n\nThe major cities are the capital [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Biha\u0107]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the capital of [[Herzegovina]].\n\nThe south part of Bosnia has Mediterranean climate and a great deal of agriculture. Central Bosnia is the most mountainous part of Bosnia featuring prominent mountains [[Vla\u0161i\u0107 (Bosnian mountain)|Vla\u0161i\u0107]], [[\u010cvrsnica]], and [[Prenj]]. Eastern Bosnia also features mountains like [[Trebevi\u0107]], [[Jahorina]], [[Igman]], [[Bjela\u0161nica]] and [[Treskavica]]. It was here that the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] were held.\n\nEastern Bosnia is heavily forested along the river Drina, and overall close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Northern Bosnia contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighbouring Croatia and Serbia. The river Sava and corresponding [[Posavina]] river basin hold the cities of Br\u010dko, Bosanski \u0160amac, Bosanski Brod and Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka.\n\nThe northwest part of Bosnia is called [[Bosanska Krajina]] and holds the cities of [[Banja Luka]], [[Prijedor]], [[Sanski Most]], [[Jajce]], Cazin, Velika Kladu\u0161a and [[Biha\u0107]]. [[Kozara National Park]] and Mrakovica World War II monument is located in this region.\n\nThe country has only {{convert|20|km|mi|1}} of coastline,<ref name=\"coastline\">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html Field Listing \u2013 Coastline], ''[[The World Factbook]]'', 2006-08-22</ref> around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton, although surrounded by Croatian peninsulas it is possible to get to the middle of the Adriatic from Neum. By United Nations law, Bosnia has a right of passage to the outer sea. Neum has many hotels and is an important tourism destination.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Rivers==\n[[File:Croatia Bosnia Herzegovina Drainage basins.svg|thumb|right|Drainage basins in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia]]\n[[File:Vrelo Bosne 3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river, [[Ilid\u017ea]]]]\nThere are seven major rivers in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina:\n\n*The [[Una (Sava)|Una]] in the northwest part of Bosnia flows along the northern and western border of Bosnia and Croatia and through the Bosnian city of Biha\u0107. It is a very beautiful river and popular for rafting and adventure sports.\n*The [[Sana River|Sana]] flows through the city of Sanski Most and Prijedor and is a tributary of the river Una in the north.\n*The [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] flows through the cities of Gornji Vakuf \u2013 Uskoplje, Bugojno, Jajce, Banja Luka, Srbac and reaches the river Sava in the north. The Vrbas flows through the central part of Bosnia and flows outwards to the North.\n*The River [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] is the longest river in Bosnia and is fully contained within the country as it stretches from its source near Sarajevo to the river Sava in the north. It gave its name to the country.\n*The [[Drina River|Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, at many places in the border between Bosnia and Serbia. The Drina flows through the cities of Fo\u010da, Gora\u017ede Vi\u0161egrad and Zvornik.\n*The [[Neretva]] river is a large river in Central and Southern Bosnia, flowing from Jablanica south to the Adriatic Sea. The river is famous as it flows through the famous city of Mostar.\n*[[File:Affected People by Floods 2005 2015 Europe.png|thumb|Percent of population affected by Flood Disasters in Europe by country from 2005\u20132015.]]The [[Sava]] river is the largest river in Bosnia and Herzegovina but not the largest river that is flowing through Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Sava river flows through Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. Sava is used as a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and towns like Br\u010dko, Bosanski \u0160amac, Bosanska Gradi\u0161ka lies on the river.\n\n==Phytogeography==\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian mixed forests, Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Expand section|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe southern parts of the country have a [[Mediterranean climate]]. The Western and the Central parts experience hot and arid summers reaching up to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C while in the winter, temperatures are below freezing with lots of snow. The north-eastern region has a typical continental climate.\n\n== Mining industry ==\n[[File:Calcite Crystal from Trebevi\u0107.JPG|thumb|200px|left| [[Calcite]] Crystal found at [[Trebevi\u0107]] mountain around [[Sarajevo]]; Bosnia and Herzegovina on display at [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]] \nVarious archaeological artifacts including relicts of mining activities and tools belonging to similar age groups, provide an indication of the geographical distribution, scale and methods of mining activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the [[Paleolithic]] to [[Roman era]].\n\nMost important of these is the so-called area of \u201ccentral Bosnian mountains\u201d located between the rivers [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]], [[La\u0161va]], [[Neretva]], [[Rama]] and their tributaries. The second one is the area of western Bosnia, bordered by the Vrbas and [[Una (Sava)|Una]] rivers, with its main orebearing formations found in the river-valleys of [[Sana]] and Japra, and their tributaries. The third area is eastern Bosnia, around the river [[Drina]] between the towns of [[Fo\u010da]] and [[Zvornik]], the principal mining activity centered around [[Srebrenica]].\n\nOres of various metals, including iron, are found in these areas and exploitation has been going on for more than 5000 years \u2013 from the period of prehistoric human settlers, through [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], Roman, Slavic, [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and Austrian rulers, into the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anubih.ba/vanserijska/Minerali-1.pdf|title=Minerali Bosne i Hercegovine|date=1 September

Members of the Parliamentary Assembly are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.\n\nThe [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The intention of the Agreement was to retain Bosnia's exterior border, while creating a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government based on proportional representation similar to the former socialist r\u00e9gime, and charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy.\n\nThe Dayton Agreement established the Office of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement.

The methods selected by the High Representative are often seen as dictatorship. Even the symbols of Bosnian statehood (flag, coat of arms) have been chosen by the High Representative rather than by the Bosnian people. The source of the authority of the High Representative is in [[international law]] while his role is essentially contractual. His mandate derives from the Dayton Agreement, as confirmed by the [[Peace Implementation Council]], a body with a Steering Board composed of representatives of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[presidency of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates amongst three members (a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], a [[Serb]], and a [[Croat]]) every 8 months within their 4-year term. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people, with Federation voters electing both the Bosniak and the Croat member, and Republika Srpska voters electing the Serb member. The Presidency serves as a collective [[head of state]]. The Presidency is mainly responsible for the [[foreign policy]] and proposing the [[budget]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2015/568324/EPRS_ATA(2015)568324_EN.pdf|title=At a glance: Bosnia and Herzegovina: Political Parties|last=|first=|date=September 2015|website=www.europal.europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Prime Minister, formally titled [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives.

Appointed judges are not eligible for reappointment. Judges subsequently appointed will serve until the age of 70, unless they resign sooner or are removed. Appointments made 5 years into the initial appointments may be governed by a different regulation for selection, to be determined by the Parliamentary Assembly.\n\nProceedings of the Court are public, and decisions are published. Court rules are adopted by a majority in the Court. Court decisions are final and supposedly binding though this is not always the case, as noted.<ref name=court/>\n\nThe Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over deciding in constitutional disputes that arise between the Entities or amongst Bosnia and Herzegovina and an Entity or Entities. Such disputes may be referred only by a member of the Presidency, the Chair of the Council of Ministers, the Chair or Deputy Chair of either of the chambers of the Parliamentary Assembly, or by one-fourth of the legislature of either Entity.\n\nThe Court also has appellate jurisdiction within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n=== State Court ===\nThe [[State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] consists of three divisions \u2013 Administrative, Appellate and Criminal \u2013 having jurisdiction over cases related to the state-level law and executive, as well as appellate jurisdiction over cases initiated in the entities.\n\nA War Crimes Chamber was introduced in January 2005, and has adopted two cases transferred from the ICTY, as well as dozens of war crimes cases originally initiated in cantonal courts.\n\nThe State Court also deals with organized crime, and economic crime including corruption cases. For example, the former and 2014 member-elect of the Presidency [[Dragan \u010covi\u0107]] is currently on trial for alleged involvement in organized crime.\n\n=== Human Rights Chamber ===\nThe [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Dom za ljudska prava za Bosnu i Hercegovinu'') existed between March 1996 and 31 December 2003. It was a judicial body established under the Annex 6 to the [[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Dayton Peace Agreement]]).\n\n=== Entities ===\nThe two Entities have Supreme Courts. Each entity also has a number of lower courts. There are 10 cantonal courts in the Federation, along with a number of municipal courts. The Republika Srpska has five municipal courts.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Politics of

Herzegovina''' since [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s declaration of sovereignty in October 1991 and the declaration of independence from the former [[Yugoslavia]] on 3 March 1992.\n\n==Overview==\nBosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. Today, it is an EU potential candidate country and is now embarking on a new growth model amid a period of slow growth and the global financial crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bosniaandherzegovina|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Worldbank.org|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> The key economic challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports. The country needs to shift to a business environment that is conducive to private investment. The country faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing  liberty market reforms to its economy. One legacy of the previous era is strong metal industry; under former republic premier [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]], and Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants. Although agriculture is almost all in private hands, the republic traditionally is an exporter of food. Industry was very strong, a holdover from the Mixed economic structure of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, Yugoslav premier [[Ante Markovi\u0107]], made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased development in these actions.\n\nThe [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995 and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996\u201399 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000\u201302. Part of the lag in output was made up in 2003\u201305. National-level statistics are limited and do not capture the large share of black market activity.\n\nThe [[konvertibilna marka]] (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide \u2013 an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018193841/http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |archive-date=2012-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2012, the IMF has approved a two-year stand-by arrangement of 405.3 million euro for Bosnia. The IMF loan, approved on September 26, is designed to support Bosnia's economic programme for the next two years, ease the effects of the \"external environment and address domestic structural weaknesses\". Bosnia's two autonomous entities will be using the cash from the loan but will not get the whole amount at once. The IMF has enabled an initial disbursement of 60.8 million euro, saying that the rest of the money will be spread out over two years, after successful quarterly reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/imf-approves-bosnia-some-e4%C3%A55-million|title=IMF Approves \u20ac405 Million Standby for Bosnia|website=Balkaninsight.com|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Brief economic history until the 1990s ==\n[[File:Real GDP growth rates RS & FBH.png|250px|thumb|Real GDP growth rates in Republic of Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\nThe  economy was slowed, because of destruction in the  War. The Industry, what is left, reflecting the rigidity of the liberal market economy, after the war. Under President Tito, metal industries were pushed in the republic; Bosnia hosted a large share of Yugoslavia metal industry - Bosnia was in the center of metal industry in former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Bosnian Civil War|During the Bosnian civil war]] (1992\u20131995) much of the economy and infrastructure in Bosnia was damaged or destroyed, causing unemployment to soar.\n\nBosnia has been facing a dual challenge: to rebuild the infrastructure, and to finish the transition from self-govern socialism  to liberal market capitalism.\n\nWith an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996\u201398 at high percentage rates on a low base; but output growth slowed appreciably in 1999, and GDP remains far below the 1990 level.\n\nEconomic data are of limited use because, although [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|both entities]] issue figures, national-level statistics are not available. Moreover, official data do not capture the large share of activity that occurs on the [[black market]]. The [[Grey market]] is a notable source of income for Bosnian traders.\n\nA Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997,  debt negotiations were held with the [[London Club]] in December 1997 and with the [[Paris Club]] in October 1998, and a new currency, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings.\n\nDue to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the Bosnian mark to the Euro, [[inflation]] has remained low in the entire country.\n\nThe country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and [[humanitarian aid]] from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of [[economic growth]] in Bosnia.\n\nHowever, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.\n\nMovement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established in the republic. [[Banking]] reform lagged, as did the implementation of [[privatization]]. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons destroy that factories.\n\n===Macro-Economic===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1997\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=1992&ey=2023&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=961&s=NGDP_RPCH,NGDP,NGDPPC,PCPIPCH,LUR,GGXWDG_NGDP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=22&pr.y=11|format=|accessdate=2018-09-04|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=en-US|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Year\n!1997\n!2000\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n|-\n|GDP in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|14.09 Bln.\n|19.44 Bln.\n|27.01 Bln.\n|29.43 Bln.\n|32.02 Bln.\n|34.47 Bln.\n|34.45 Bln.\n|35.14 Bln.\n|36.19 Bln.\n|36.59 Bln.\n|36.24 Bln.\n|39.19 Bln.\n|40.83 Bln.\n|42.68 Bln.\n|44.62 Bln.\n|-\n|GDP per capita in $<br /><small>(PPP)</small>\n|3,748\n|5,161\n|7,143\n|7,786\n|8,483\n|9,159\n|9,195\n|9,440\n|9,810\n|10,031\n|10,557\n|10,989\n|11,547\n|12,136\n|12,724\n|-\n|GDP growth<br /><small>(real)</small>\n|22.9 %\n|4.4 %\n|4,2 %\n|5.7 %\n|6.0 %\n|5.6 %\n|\u22120.8 %\n|0.8 %\n|0.9 %\n|\u22120.7 %\n|2.4 %\n|1.2 %\n|3.1 %\n|3.2 %\n|2.7 %\n|-\n|Inflation<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|5.7 %\n|5.0 %\n|3.6 %\n|6.1 %\n|1.5 %\n|7.4 %\n|\u22120.4 %\n|2.1 %\n|3.7 %\n|2.0 %\n|\u22120.1 %\n|\u22120.9 %\n|\u22121.1 %\n|\u22121.1 %\n|\u22121.3 %\n|-\n|Unemployment rate<br /><small>(in Percent)</small>\n|35.3 %\n|31.1 %\n|31.1 %\n|31.1 %\n|29.0 %\n|23.4 %\n|24.1 %\n|27.2 %\n|27.6 %\n|28.0 %\n|27.5 %\n|27.5 %\n|27.7 %\n|25.4 %\n|20.5 %\n|-\n|Government debt<br /><small>(Percentage of GDP)</small>\n|...\n|35 %\n|26 %\n|21 %\n|19 %\n|31 %\n|35 %\n|43 %\n|43 %\n|43 %\n|45 %\n|45 %\n|46 %\n|44 %\n|41 %\n|}\n\n== Present ==\n[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bosnia and Herzegovina.jpeg|thumb|310px|Graphical depiction of Bosnia and Herzegovina's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]\n[[Image:2006Bosnian exports.PNG|thumb|right|310px|Exports of Bosnia and Herzegovina during 2006.]] \n'''Overall value of [[foreign direct investment]] (1999\u20132011):'''<ref name=\"Lemo\">{{cite web|url=http://nezavisne.com/vijesti.php?vijest=17929&meni=5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216032352/http://www.nezavisne.com/vijesti.php?vijest=17929&meni=5|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 December 2007|title=Najve\u0107i investitor Srbija sa 707 miliona evra|website=Nezavisne.com|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n*1999: \u20ac166&nbsp;million\n*2000: \u20ac159&nbsp;million\n*2001: \u20ac133&nbsp;million\n*2002: \u20ac282&nbsp;million\n*2003: \u20ac338&nbsp;million\n*2004: \u20ac534&nbsp;million\n*2005: \u20ac421&nbsp;million\n*2006: \u20ac556&nbsp;million\n*2007: \u20ac1.628&nbsp;billion\n*2008: \u20ac1.083&nbsp;billion\n*2009: \u20ac434&nbsp;million\n*2010: \u20ac359&nbsp;million\n*2011: \u20ac313&nbsp;million\nFrom 1994 to 2011, \u20ac6.4&nbsp;billion were invested in the country.<ref>{{cite web|first=Dejan |last=\u0160ajinovi\u0107 |url=http://www.nezavisne.com/dogadjaji/vijesti/36423/Ulozeno-53-milijarde-evra-u-BiH.html |title=Ulo\u017eeno 5,3 milijarde evra u BiH \u2013 Doga\u0111aji |website=Nezavisne.com |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205111218/http://www.nezavisne.com/dogadjaji/vijesti/36423/Ulozeno-53-milijarde-evra-u-BiH.html |archivedate=5 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n'''The top investor countries (1994\u20132007)''':<ref name=\"Lemo\"/>\n*Austria (\u20ac1,294&nbsp;million)\n*Serbia (\u20ac773&nbsp;million)\n*Croatia (\u20ac434&nbsp;million)\n*Slovenia (\u20ac427&nbsp;million)\n*Switzerland (\u20ac337&nbsp;million)\n*Germany (\u20ac270&nbsp;million)\n*Italy (\u20ac94.29&nbsp;million)\n*Netherlands (\u20ac63.52&nbsp;million)\n*United Arab Emirates (\u20ac56.70&nbsp;million)\n*Turkey (\u20ac54.81&nbsp;million)\n*All Other Countries (\u20ac892.54&nbsp;million)\n\n'''Foreign investments by sector for (1994\u20132007):'''<ref name=\"Lemo\"/>\n*37.7% Manufacturing\n*21% Banking\n*4.9% Services\n*9.6% Trade\n*0.30% Transport\n*1% Tourism\n{{Clear}}\n\nBy some estimates, [[grey economy]] is 25.5% of GDP.<ref>http://ba.n1info.com/a223736/Vijesti/Vijesti/Siva-ekonomija-cini-25-posto-BDP-a-BiH.html</ref>\n\n=== 2017 ===\n\nIn 2017, exports grew by 17% when compared to the previous year, totaling \u20ac5.65 billion.<ref>https://radiokameleon.ba/2018/01/02/bih-povecala-izvoz-2017-godini-evo-koje-drzave-najvise-uvoze-nase-proizvode/</ref> The total volume of [[foreign trade]] in 2017 amounted to \u20ac14.97 billion and increased by 14% compared to the previous year.

The city's geographical location close to major European capitals has made it an important industrial and commercial hub nationally.\nIt has a developed financial sector, 11 international banks are represented, 5 microcredit organizations and a foundation for development.\nThe city's huge economic potential is in the strategic geographical location being close to Zagreb, Belgrade, Budapest and Vienna. Giving it one of the best climates for economic expansion in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nThe agricultural land around the city, raw minerals in the municipality and growth of high educated population in the city proper gives it a unique combination of both being able to produce sophisticated industrial products, food and service branches.\n\n====Companies====\n\nThe Zenica city host today the Bosnian part of [[ArcelorMittal]] Steel Company, former RMK Zenica, which employ about 3000 workers, steel company from [[Luxembourg]] with over 320,000 employees in more than 60 countries.

However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly.

This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[Value-added tax]] (VAT) Authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.\n\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{main|Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n[[File:Stari Most September 2004 4.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Stari Most]] in [[Mostar]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]\nThe [[tourism]] sector has been recovering and helping the economy altogether in the process, with popular winter skiing destinations as well as summer countryside tourism. \n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has been a top performer in recent years in terms of [[tourism]] development; tourist arrivals have grown by an average of 24% annually from 1995 to 2000.

[[Conscription]] was completely abolished in Bosnia and Herzegovina effective on and from 1 January 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/special/dayton/peacekeeping/feature-11|title=NATO and the Defence Reform Commission: partners for progress|website=Setimes.com|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Defence law==\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina Defence Law addresses the following areas: the Military of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Government Institutions, Entity Jurisdictions and Structure, Budget and Financing, Composition of Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, War Declaration, natural disasters, conflict of interests and professionalism, Oath to Bosnia-Herzegovina, flags, anthem and military insignia, and transitional and end orders.\n\n==History==\nThe AFBiH was formed from three armies of the [[Bosnian War]] period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of Serbs and Croats) [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the Bosnian Serb [[Army of Republika Srpska]], and the [[Croat Defence Council]].\n\nThe Army of the Republic of Bosnia And Herzegovina was created on 15 April 1992 during the early days of the [[Bosnian War]]. Before the ARBiH was formally created, there existed [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence]], an official military force of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the [[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]], [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]], and [[civil defense]] groups, as well as many criminal gangs and collections of police and military professionals. The army was formed under poor circumstances, with a very low number of [[tanks]], [[Armored Personnel Carrier|APC]]s and no military aviation assets. The army was divided into Corps, each Corp was stationed in a territory. The first commander was [[Sefer Halilovi\u0107]].\n\nThe Army of Republika Srpska was created on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was formally created, there were a number of [[paramilitary]] groups such as the Srpska Dobrovolja\u010dka Garda, [[White Eagles (paramilitary)|Beli Orlovi]], as well as some [[Russians|Russian]], [[Greeks|Greek]] and other volunteers. The army was equipped with ex-[[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly [[T-55]]s and 85 [[M-84]]s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like [[F-16]], [[Mirage 2000]], [[F-18]] and one [[Croatian Air Force]] [[MiG-21]]. The VRS received support from the [[Yugoslav Army]] and [[FRY]].\n\nThe [[Croatian Defence Council]] was the main military formation of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]] during the Bosnian War. It was first organized military force to with the aim to control the Croat populated areas, created on 8 April 1992. They ranged from men armed with shotguns assigned to [[Croatian Defence Council#Village Guards|village defense tasks]] to organized, uniformed, and well-equipped [[Croatian Defence Council#Guard brigades|brigade-sized formations]] that nevertheless employed [[Croatian Defence Council#Home Guard|part-time soldiers]]. As time went on, the HVO forces became increasingly better organized and more \"professional\", but it was not until early 1994, that the HVO began to form the so-called [[Croatian Defence Council#Guard brigades|guards brigades]], mobile units manned by full-time professional soldiers.\n\nIn 1995\u201396, a [[NATO]]-led international peacekeeping force ([[Implementation Force|IFOR]]) of 60,000 troops served in Bosnia and Herzegovina, beginning on December 21, 1995 to implement and monitor the military aspects of the [[Dayton Peace Agreement]]. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization Force or [[SFOR]]. The number of SFOR troops was reduced first to 12,000 and then to 7,000. SFOR was in turn succeeded by an even smaller, [[European Union]]-led European Union Force, [[EUFOR Althea]]. {{as of|2004}}, EUFOR Althea numbered around 7,000 troops.\n\nThe Dayton Peace Agreement left the country with three armies under two commands: the Bosniak and Bosnian Croat armies within the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], facing their recent adversaries the [[Army of the Republika Srpska]]. These three forces together had around 419,000 personnel in regulars and reserves.<ref>[https://www.nato.int/sfor/indexinf/171/p03a/t02p03a.htm HQ SFOR's Joint Military Affairs and BiH Defence Reform], First published in SFOR Informer#171, June, 2004.</ref>  This force size and orientation was totally at odds with the international peacemakers' vision. Slow reductions did take place. By 2004, the two warring factions had reduced their forces to 12,000 regulars and 240,000 reserves but had made virtually no progress in integrating the two into one new force, though the basis of a state defence ministry had been put in place via the [[Standing Committee on Military Matters]] (SCMM).  Conscription for periods of around four months continued, the costs of which were weighing down both entities. \n\nThe restructuring of the three armies into the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina represents part of a wider process of 'thickening' the central state institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Aitchison|first1=Andy|title=Governing through Crime Internationally? Bosnia and Herzegovina|journal=British Journal of Politics and International Relations|date=2013|volume=15|issue=4|page=558|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2012.00521.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-856X.2012.00521.x/abstract}}</ref> In order to mitigate some of the potential controversy around restructuring, the [[Office of the High Representative]] (OHR) made use of evidence of malpractice in Republika Srpska military institutions. Firstly, from 2002 onwards, OHR utilised a scandal around the provision of parts and assistance to Iraq in breach of a UN embargo (the so-called Orao affair) to support the cause for bringing governance of the armies under the level of central institutions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Paddy|title=Swords and Ploughshares: Bringing Peace to the 21st Century|date=2007|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0297853039|pages=248\u2013250}}</ref> Following this, in 2004, the process was accelerated,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Paddy|title=Swords and Ploughshares: Bringing Peace to the 21st Century|date=2007|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0297853039|page=294}}</ref> drawing its justification from new evidence of material and other forms of support flowing from Republika Srpska armed forces to ICTY indictee [[Ratko Mladi\u0107]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina deployed a unit of 37 men to destroy munitions and clear mines, in addition to 6 command personnel as part of the [[Multinational force in Iraq]]. The unit was first deployed to [[Fallujah]], then [[Talil Air Base]], and is now located at [[Camp Echo (Iraq)|Camp Echo]]. In December 2006, the Bosnian government formerly extended its mandate through June 2007. Bosnia and Herzegovina is planning to send another 49 soldiers from the 6th Infantry Division to Iraq in August 2008, their mission will be to protect/guard [[Camp Victory]] in [[Baghdad]].\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:ISAFBHTF.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[ISAF]] Bosnian troops display their national flag.]]\n[[File:LineBHISAF.jpg|thumbnail|right|ISAF Bosnian troops line up, awaiting for the general march of the Lt.

There are two major commands under the Joint Staff: Operational Command and Support Command.\n\nThere are three regiments that are each formed by soldiers from the three ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs and trace their roots to the armies that were created during the war in BiH. These regiments have their distinct ethnic insignias and consist of three active battalions each. Headquarters of [[Regiment]]s have no operational authority. On the basis of the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the regimental headquarters have the following tasks: to manage the regimental museum, monitor financial fund Regiment, prepare, investigate and cherish the history of the regiment, the regiment publish newsletters, maintain cultural and historical heritage, give guidance on holding special ceremonies, give guidance on customs, dress and deportment Regiment, conduct officer, NCO and military clubs.

The [[Zagreb]]-[[Biha\u0107]]-[[Split, Croatia|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue. The road [[Karlovac]]-[[Plitvice Lakes]]-[[Knin]], which is on the [[European route]] E71, is becoming increasingly unused because Croatia built a separate highway to the west of it.\n\nThe border on the Una river between [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and [[Bosanska Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.\n\nThe Herzegovinian municipality of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an exclave and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelje\u0161ac bridge|bridge to the Pelje\u0161ac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that the bridge will close its access to international waters (although Croatian territory and territorial waters surround Bosnian-Herzegovinian territory and waters completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships.

There is also a long tradition of economic relations between Germany and Bosnia. When the country was still part of the former Yugoslavia, joint ventures and cooperation played a large role here (motor industry, metal processing, textile industry/contract processing work, steel and chemicals). After the war, Germany took on a spearheading role in investments in production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is undergoing a transitional phase from a centrally planned to a market economy.

As stated above, this support has been key to the growth and revitalization of the economy and infrastructure in the republic. However, most of this aid has been targeted at the Federation; the previous government of the RS was anti-Dayton and not assisted by the U.S. The election of the \"Sloga\" or \"Unity\" Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dodik, has shifted the balance of power in the [[Republika Srpska]] (RS) to a pro-Dayton stance and will result in an upsurge of funding to the RS from the international community.\n\nIn addition to SEED funding, [[USAID]] programs have been crucial to the redevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Prior to [[Europe]]an contact, the [[Batswana]] lived as [[herders]] and farmers under [[tribal rule]].\n\n==Before European contact==\n{{Main|Bantu expansion}}\nSometime between 200-500&nbsp;AD, the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people who were living in the [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] area (today part of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|DRC]] and [[Zambia]]) crossed the [[Limpopo River]], entering the area today known as [[South Africa]] as part of the [[Bantu expansion]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Africa: Botswana|url=https://www.q-files.com/geography/africa/botswana/|website=Q-files: The Great Illustrated Encyclopedia|publisher=Orpheus Books Limited|accessdate=17 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere were 2 broad waves of immigration to South Africa; [[Nguni people|Nguni]] and [[Sotho people|Sotho]]-[[Tswana people|Tswana]]. The former settled in the eastern coastal regions, while the latter settled primarily in the area known today as the [[Highveld]] &mdash; the large, relatively high central plateau of [[South Africa]].\n\nBy 1000 AD the Bantu colonization of the eastern half of [[South Africa]] had been completed (but not [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]], which are believed to have been inhabited by [[Khoisan]] people until [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonisation). The Bantu-speaking society was highly a decentralized feudal society organized on a basis of [[kraals]] (an enlarged clan), headed by a chief, who owed a very hazy allegiance to the nation's head chief. According to [[Neil Parsons]]'s online \"Brief History of Botswana\":\n\n{{quote|\"From around 1095 south-eastern Botswana saw the rise of a new culture, characterized by a site on Moritshane hill near [[Gabane]], whose pottery mixed the old western style with new Iron Age influences derived from the eastern Transvaal (Lydenburg culture). The Moritsane culture is historically associated with the Khalagari (Kgalagadi) chiefdoms, the westernmost dialect-group of Sotho (or Sotho-Tswana) speakers, whose prowess was in cattle raising and hunting rather than in farming.\n\n\u201cIn east-central Botswana, the area within 80 or 100 kilometres of [[Serowe]] (but west of the railway line) saw a thriving farming culture, dominated by rulers living on Toutswe hill, between about 600-700AD and 1200-1300AD. The prosperity of the state was based on cattle herding, with large corrals in the capital town and in scores of smaller hill-top villages. (Ancient cattle and sheep/goat corrals are today revealed by characteristic grass growing on them.) The Toutswe people were also hunting westwards into the [[Kalahari]] and trading eastwards with the Limpopo. East coast shells, used as trade currency, were already being traded as far west as Tsodilo by 700AD.\n\n\u201cThe Toutswe state appears to have been conquered by its [[Mapungubwe]] state neighbour, centred on a hill at the Limpopo-[[Shashe]] confluence, between 1200AD and 1300AD. Mapungubwe had been developing since about 1050 AD because of its control of the early [[gold]] trade coming down the Shashe, which was passed on for sale to sea traders on the [[Indian Ocean]]. The site of Toutswe town was abandoned, but the new rulers kept other settlements going - notably Bosutswe, a hill-top town in the west, which supplied the state with hunting products, caught by Khoean hunters, and with Khoesan cattle given in trade or tribute from the Boteti River. But Mapungubwe's triumph was short-lived, as it was superseded by the new state of [[Great Zimbabwe]], north of the Limpopo River, which flourished in control of the gold trade from the 13th to the 15th centuries. It is not known how far west the power of Great Zimbabwe extended. Certainly its successor state, the [[Kingdom of Butua|Butua state]] based at Kame near [[Bulawayo]] in western Zimbabwe from about 1450 onwards, controlled trade in salt and hunting dogs from the eastern Makgadikgadi pans, around which it built stone- walled command posts.\"|Neil Parsons|Brief History of Botswana<ref>[http://www.thuto.org/ubh/bw/bhp1.htm Brief History of Botswana]</ref>}}\n\n==Bechuanaland Protectorate==\n{{main|Bechuanaland Protectorate}}\n[[Image:Kapstaaten 1905.png|thumb|300px|right|German map in use in 1905 still showing the undivided Bechuanaland area]]\n[[Image:British bechuanaland 1887.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A map of 1887 showing the Protectorate and British Bechuanaland]]\n[[Image:Botswana Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Modern Botswana. The country's borders have been stable since independence in 1966]]\nIn the late 19th century, hostilities broke out between the [[Shona people|Shona]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Southern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were migrating into the territory from the [[Kalahari Desert]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Tensions also escalated with the [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], [[Bathoen I]], and [[Sebele I]], who personally travelled to London, for assistance, the British Government on 31 March 1885 put \"[[Bechuanaland]]\" under its protection. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] and is today's Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa; the majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa. The [[Tati Concessions Land]], formerly part of the [[Matabele kingdom]], was administered from the Bechuanaland Protectorate after 1893, to which it was formally [[annexation|annexed]] in 1911.\n\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]), and [[Swaziland]] (the \"High Commission Territories\") were not included, but provision was made for\ntheir later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying, and it never occurred. The election of the\nNational Party government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAn expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils representing Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Independent Botswana==\nIn June 1966, Britain accepted proposals for democratic self-government in Botswana.<ref>Peter Fawcus, and Alan Tilbury, ''Botswana: The Road to Independence'' (Pula Press, 2000)</ref> The seat of government was moved from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to newly established [[Gaborone]] in 1965. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice, and died in office in 1980. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Ketumile Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998.

In 1884 the Germans took possession of German south west Africa (Namibia) and systematically appropriated Herero grazing lands. The ensuing conflict between the Germans and the Herero was to last for years, only ending in a calculated act of genocide which saw the remaining of the tribe flee across the border into Botswana. The refugees settled among the [[Batawana]] and were initially subjugated, but eventually regained their herds and independence. These days the Herero are among the wealthiest [[herders]] in [[Botswana]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harpending |first1=Henry |last2=Pennington |first2=Renee |date=1990 |title=Herero Households |url= |journal=Human Ecology |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=417\u2013439 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n=== Basubiya ===\nThe Basubiya, [[Wayeyi]] and [[Mbukushu]] are all riverine peoples scattered around the [[Chobe District|Chobe]] and [[Linyanti Constituency|Linyanti]] rivers and across the [[Okavango Basin|Okavango]] pan-handle.Their histories and migrations are a text book example of the ebb and flow of power and influence. For a long time, the Basubiya were the dominant force, pushing the wayeyi from the [[Chobe District|Chobe]] river and into the Okavango after a little spat over a lion skin, so tradition says. The Basubiya were agriculturists and as such proved easy prey for the growing [[Lozi people|Lozi Empire]] (from modern [[Zambia]]), which in turned collapsed in 1865. They still live in the [[Chobe District|Chobe district]].\n\n=== Wayeyi (Bayei) ===\nOriginally from the same areas in [[Namibia]] and Angola as the Mbukushu, the Wyeyi moved south from the Chobe river into the Okavango Delta in the mid-18 century to avoid the growing conflict with the Basubiya.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/botswana/background/other-features/0747faff-e78f-484a-8726-834280010674/a/nar/0747faff-e78f-484a-8726-834280010674/355092|title=People of Botswana in Botswana|last=Planet|first=Lonely|work=Lonely Planet|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}</ref><br>{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Colonial heads of Botswana (Bechuanaland)]]\n*[[Heads of government of Botswana]]\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of Southern Africa]]\n*[[History of Gaborone]]\n* [[Timeline of Gaborone]]\n*[[List of Presidents of Botswana]]\n*[[Politics of Botswana]]\n*[[Postage stamps and postal history of Bechuanaland Protectorate]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Acemoglu, Daron, Simon Johnson, and James A.

[[Botswana]] occupies an area of {{Convert|581730|km2|mi2}}, of which {{Convert|566730|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} are land.  Botswana has land boundaries of combined length {{Convert|4347.15|km|mi}}, of which the constituent boundaries are shared with [[Namibia]], for {{Convert|1544|km|mi|abbr=on}}; [[South Africa]] {{Convert|1969|km|mi|abbr=on}}; [[Zimbabwe]], {{Convert|834|km|mi|abbr=on}} and [[Zambia]], {{Convert|0.15|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  Much of the population of Botswana is concentrated in the eastern part of the country.\n\nSunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.<ref name=\"Landsberg\">General Survey of Climatology, Landsberg (ed.),Elsevier, 2001</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nBotswana is semi-arid, due to the short rain season. However, the relatively high altitude of the country and its continental situation gives it a subtropical climate. The country is remote from moisture-laden air flows for most of the year. The dry season lasts from April to October in the south and to November in the north where, however, rainfall totals are higher. The south of the country is most exposed to cold winds during the winter period (early May to late August) when average temperatures are around {{convert|14|\u00b0C|1}}. The whole country has hot summers with average temperatures around {{convert|26|\u00b0C|1}}. Sunshine totals are high all year round although winter is the sunniest period. The whole country is windy and dusty during the dry season.<ref name=\"Landsberg\" />\n\n==Geography==\nThe land is predominantly flat to gently undulating [[tableland]], although there is some hilly country, where mining is carried out. The [[Kalahari Desert]] is in the central and the southwest.  The [[Okavango Delta]], one of the world's largest inland deltas, is in the northwest and the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]], a large [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]] lies in the north-central area.  The Makgadikgadi has been established as an early habitation area for primitive man; This large seasonal [[wetland]] is composed of several large component pans, the largest being [[Nwetwe Pan]], [[Sua Pan]] and [[Nxai Pan]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&mode=&order=0 ''Makgadikgadi'', Megalithic Portal, ed. A.Burnham]</ref> Botswana's lowest elevation point is at the junction of the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] and Shashe Rivers, at a height of {{Convert|513|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  The highest point is [[Monalanong Hill]], at {{Convert|1494|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\nThe country is divided into four drainage regions, which are sometimes indistinct due to the arid nature of the climate:\n* the [[Chobe River]] on the border with the [[Caprivi Strip]] of Namibia together with a small adjacent swampy area is part of the [[Zambezi]] basin;\n* most of the north and central region of the country is part of the [[Okavango Basin|Okavango]] inland drainage basin;\n* the easternmost part of the country falls into the [[Limpopo]] drainage basin;\n* the southern and southwestern regions, which are the driest of all, are drained by the Molopo river along the South African border and the [[Nossob River|Nossob river]] through the [[Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park|Kalahari Gemsbok National Park]], and are technically part of the basin of the [[Orange River]]. None of these rivers normally flows as far as the Orange, however. (The last recorded confluence was in the 1880s.)<ref>Times Comprehensive Atlas, (2007), Times Books, London</ref>\nExcept for the Chobe, Okavango, [[Boteti]] and [[Limpopo river]]s, most of Botswana's rivers cease to flow during the dry and early rainy seasons.\n\n==Natural hazards==\nBotswana is affected by periodic droughts, and seasonal August winds blow from the west, carrying sand and dust, which can obscure visibility.\n\n==Environment==\n\nCurrent environmental issues in Botswana are overgrazing, desertification and the existence of only limited fresh water resources.\n\nResearch from the [[University of Botswana]] has found that the common practice of [[Grazing#Disadvantages|overstocking cattle]] to cope with drought losses actually depletes scarce [[biomass]], making ecosystems more vulnerable. The study of the Kgatleng district predicts that by 2050 the cycle of mild drought is likely to become shorter \u201418 months instead of two years\u2014due to [[climate change]].<ref>[http://www.scidev.net/en/sub-suharan-africa/news/sub-saharan-africa-news-in-brief-10-22-april-2008.html Sub-Saharan Africa news in brief: 10\u201322 April 2008 - SciDev.Net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==International agreements==\nBotswana is a party to the following international agreements:  Biodiversity, Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection and Wetlands.\n\n== Extreme points ==\n\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Botswana]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Zambia]] and [[Namibia]], [[Ngamiland District]]\n* Easternmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]], [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]]\n* Southernmost point - [[Bokspits]], [[Kgalagadi District]]\n* Westernmost point - the western section of the border with [[Namibia]]*\n* ''Note: Botswana does not have a westernmost point as the western section is formed by the 22nd meridian of longitude east of Greenwich.''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Botswana topics}}\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Botswana}}\n[[Category:Geography of Botswana| ]]", "sha1": "rf9jtcb092r37kkockvu3yswi3cdalq"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Botswana", "ns": "0", "id": "3614", "revision": {"id": "866448766", "parentid": "858899264", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T11:59:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wbm1058", "id": "14383484"}, "minor": "", "comment": "sp.: [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], per [[MOS:CONSISTENCY]], proper names use the subject's own spelling (via [[WP:JWB]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Botswana]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n[[Image:Botswana-demography.svg|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Botswana, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2008; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\n[[Image:Botswanahouse.jpg|thumb|250px|A type of house in Botswana]]\n\n[[Botswana]], like many nations in southern [[Africa]], suffers from a high [[HIV]] infection rate, estimated among adults ages 15 to 49 to be 24.8%.<ref name=avert>{{cite web | title =HIV & Aids in Botswana|publisher=AVERT International HIV & Aids Charity|url = http://www.avert.org/aids-botswana.htm|accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\n\n===Census results===\n{{Historical populations\n| title=Botswana Population and Housing Census\n| percentages = pagr\n| 1904 |120776\n| 1911 |124350\n| 1921 |152983\n| 1936 |265756\n| 1946 |296310\n| 1956 |309175\n| 1964 |549510\n| 1971 |596994\n| 1981 |941027\n| 1991 |1326796\n| 2001 |1680863\n| 2011 |2024787\n| footnote=<ref name=history /><ref name=\"indicators\">{{cite web |title=TABLE 1: 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001 CENSUS DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS; BOTSWANA |url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/templates/cso/file/File/Table_1971-2001_Census_Demographic_Indicators(1).pdf |publisher=Central Statistics Office |accessdate=20 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69I3pDlJb?url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/templates/cso/file/File/Table_1971-2001_Census_Demographic_Indicators(1).pdf |archivedate=20 July 2012 |location=Gaborone |page=1 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name=2011Census>{{cite web |title=The Population of Towns, Villages and Associated Localities |work=2011 Population and Housing Census |url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/templates/cso/file/File/Population%20of%20Towns%20and%20Villages%20_2011%20PHC_%20Jun%204%202012..pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68QAYaEFm?url=http://www.cso.gov.bw/templates/cso/file/File/Population%20of%20Towns%20and%20Villages%20_2011%20PHC_%20Jun%204%202012..pdf |archivedate=14 June 2012 |accessdate=20 July 2012 |date=June 2012 |publisher=Statistics Botswana |location=Gaborone |format=PDF |page=1 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>\n}}\n\n====Bechuanaland Protectorate====\nThe seven censuses of Botswana before its independence happened irregularly.

The 1971 census was the first census in Botswana to use de facto enumeration; this method counts people based on how many people spent census night at a specific location. Previously, the citizens were counted based on their usual place of residence. The 2001 census was the first census in Botswana to comply with the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] 2000 Census Project, the guidelines of which unify the demographic statistics in southern [[Africa]].

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. The party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]] (BDP), which has never lost power since independence. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n[[Botswana]] is formally a multiparty constitutional democracy. Each of the elections since independence in September 1966 has been freely and fairly contested and has been held on schedule. The country's small white minority and other minorities participate freely in the political process. There are two main rival parties and a number of smaller parties. General elections are held at least every five years.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1830.htm Background Note: Botswana]</ref>\n\nThe [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] has rated Botswana as a \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|flawed democracy]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n\n[[File:BotswanaParliament.jpg|thumb|left|[[National Assembly (Botswana)|National Assembly of Botswana]].]]\nThe National Assembly has 57 elected and 4 appointed members;<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/151/fields/59.html]</ref> it is expanded following each census (every 10 years).

District commissioners have executive authority and are appointed by the central government and assisted by elected and nominated district councilors and district development committees.

This will be the main force behind continued economic expansion.\n\nEconomic growth slowed in 2005-2008 and turned negative in 2009 as a result of the [[Great Recession]], contracting by 5.2%.

Four large diamond mines have opened since independence. De Beers prospectors discovered diamonds in northern Botswana in the early 1970s. The first mine began production at [[Orapa diamond mine|Orapa]] in 1972, followed by a smaller mine at [[Letlhakane diamond mine|Letlhakane]]. What has become the single richest diamond mine in the world opened in [[Jwaneng diamond mine|Jwaneng]] in 1982. The mine was discovered when termites looking for water brought grains of diamond to the surface. Botswana produced a total over 30 million carats (6,000&nbsp;kg) of diamonds (about 25% of worldwide production) from the three Debswana mines in 1999, and is the highest producer of diamonds by value in the world. According to Debswana, the Orapa 2000 Expansion project increased the Orapa's mine annual output from 6 million carats to 12 million carats and raised total production to 26 million carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.debswana.com/About-Us/Pages/Our-History.aspx|publisher=Debswana|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> In 2003, Debswana opened the [[Damtshaa diamond mine]] about 220 kilometres (140&nbsp;mi) west of the city of [[Francistown]].

In early 2008, the entire southern African region was hit hard by massive shortages in power, since the region works to share its power resources through the [[Southern African Power Pool]], with most of the capacity coming from South Africa. Botswana has in turn put in place plans to become a net exporter of power to the regional pool, through governmental expansion of the Morupule power station, as well as encouraging private investment in the form of a 4 gigawatt power station by the Canadian Greenfield company CIC Energy. In 2012, CIC Energy was acquired by India's [[Jindal Steel and Power]]. Jindal Africa currently aims to operate three surface mines in the coalfields of [[Mmamabula]], as well as a power plant. According to the company, \"the mine\u2019s development will meet the demands of 600MW power station and export region coal markets, with the potential to employ more than 2,000 people.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana Overview|url=http://www.jindalafrica.com/countries/botswana/botswana-overview|publisher=Jindal Africa|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Botswana|url=https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/toolsres_coal_overview_ch3.pdf|publisher=Global Methane Initiative|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nBotswana also produces [[soda ash]] through Botash, a joint venture between the government and South Africa's Chlor-Alkali Holdings (CAH) Group. Botash has been operating in the [[Sua Pan]] in northeastern Botswana since April 1991.

One of the world's unique ecosystems, the [[Okavango Delta]], is located in Botswana. The country offers excellent game viewing and birding both in the Delta and in the [[Chobe Game Reserve]] \u2014 home to one of the largest herds of free-ranging elephants in the world. Botswana's [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] also offers good game viewing and some of the most remote and unspoiled wilderness in southern Africa.\n\nA number of national parks and game reserves, with their abundant wildlife and wetlands, are major tourist attractions. The wildlife, including lions, [[brown hyena]]s, cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs and antelope, was described in great detail in the best-selling book ''Cry of the Kalahari'' by Mark and Delia Owens.\n\nThe main [[safari]] destinations for tourism are [[Moremi Game Reserve]] in the Okavango Delta, and [[Chobe National Park]]. Botswana is also participating in community based natural resource management projects by trying to involve villagers in tourism. One example is the village of [[Khwai]] and its Khwai Development Trust.\n\nBotswana was the setting for the 1980 movie ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'', although the movie was mostly filmed in South Africa.\nThe seventh season of the ''[[Amazing Race]]'' visited Botswana. Tourism has been stimulated by the [[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency|series of detective novels]] by [[Alexander McCall Smith]] and the American dramatisation that followed them.\n\n==Agriculture==\nMore than half of Batswana live in rural areas and are dependent on subsistence crop and livestock farming, together with money sent home by relatives in urban areas. Agriculture meets only a small portion of food needs and contributes just 2.8% to GDP\u2014primarily through beef exports\u2014but it remains a social and cultural touchstone. Cattle raising dominated Botswana's social and economic life before independence. The [[Botswana Meat Commission]] (BMC) has a monopoly on beef production. The national herd was about 2.5 million in the mid-1990s, though the government-ordered slaughter of the entire herd in Botswana's north-west [[Ngamiland]] District in 1995 has reduced the number by at least 200,000. The slaughter was ordered to prevent the spread of \"cattle lung disease\" to other parts of the country.\n\nOnly about 0.7% of total land area is [[Arable land|arable]]. Crop production is hampered by traditional farming methods, recurrent drought, erosion, and disease. Most of the land under cultivation is in the eastern region. The principal crops for domestic use are [[sorghum]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[millet]]. Sorghum and maize production in 2004 were 32,000 tons and 10,000 tons, respectively. The sorghum and maize harvests comprise less than 10% of the annual requirement of 250,000 tons. In 2004, Botswana\u2019s agricultural imports (primarily cereals) exceeded agricultural exports by $102.5 million. Grain\nis often imported from South Africa. Smaller quantities of [[cowpea]]s, [[beans]], and other pulses are also grown. The 2004{{Fix|text=out of date}} output of all these crops was about 20,000 tons; in addition, 16,000 tons of vegetables and 10,000 tons of fruit were grown.\n\nAgricultural research has been devoted to soil conservation, grazing experiments, and developing and distributing improved strains of grain. The construction of dams and the drilling of boreholes to tap underground water are continuing government programmes. In early 1990, the government changed its official agricultural policy to emphasise the production only of those foodstuffs that can be raised economically. The Arable Lands Development\nProgramme and the Tribal Grazing Land Policy are government programmes designed to help farmers in communal areas.\n\n==Private sector development and foreign investment==\nBotswana seeks to diversify its economy away from [[mineral]]s, the earnings from which have levelled off. In 1998-99, non-mineral sectors of the economy grew at 8.9%, partially offsetting a slight 4.4% decline in the minerals sector. [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign investment]] and management have been welcomed in Botswana.\n\nExternal investment in Botswana has grown fitfully. In the early 1990s, two American companies, Owens Corning and H.J. [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], made major investments in production facilities in Botswana. In 1997, the St. Paul Group purchased Botswana Insurance, one of the country's leading short-term insurance providers. An American Business Council (ABC), with over 30 member companies, was inaugurated in 1995.\n\n[[Hyundai]] operated a car assembly plant in Botswana from 1994 to 2000.<ref>[http://www.gov.bw/economy/index.html The Government of Botswana - Economic Snapshot<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106025801/http://www.gov.bw/economy/index.html |date=6 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tourist Resort at Kasane.jpg|thumb|right|Tourist resort at [[Kasane]]]]\nBotswana seeks to further diversify its economy away from minerals, which account for a quarter of GDP, down from nearly half of GDP in the early 1990s. Foreign investment and management are welcomed in Botswana and, as a result, financial and services sectors have increased at an exponential rate in the 2000s to replace mining as the leading industry. Botswana abolished [[foreign exchange controls]] in 1999, has a low corporate tax rate (15%), no prohibitions on foreign ownership of companies, and a moderate inflation rate (7.6% November 2004).\n\nThe government considers private-sector participation as being critical to the success of the country's ''Tenth National Development Plan'' (2009\u20132016) and enhancing the [[Science and technology in Botswana|role of research and development]] as being the most effective way to nurture entrepreneurship and private-sector growth. The government is considering additional policies to enhance competitiveness, including a new Foreign Direct Investment Strategy, Competition Policy, Privatisation Master Plan and National Export Development Strategy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002247/224725E.pdf|title=Mapping Research and Innovation in the Republic of Botswana|last=Lemarchand|first=Guillermo A.|last2=Schneegans|first2=Susan (eds)|publisher=UNESCO|year=2013|isbn=978-92-3-001219-9|location=Paris|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=546\u2013547}}</ref>\n\nBotswana is known to have vast coal deposits making it possibly one of the most coal-rich countries in the world. Large coal mines, massive coal-fired power plants, as well as a coals to liquid plant (through the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]]) to produce synthetic automotive fuel have been planned.\n\nWith its proven record of good economic governance, Botswana was ranked as Africa's least corrupt country by [[Transparency International]] in 2004, ahead of many European and Asian countries. The World Economic Forum rates Botswana as one of the two most economically competitive nations in Africa. In 2004 Botswana was once again assigned \"A\" grade credit ratings by [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]]. This ranks Botswana as by far the best credit risk in Africa and puts it on par with or above many countries in central Europe, East Asia, and Latin America.\n\nU.S. investment in Botswana remains at relatively low levels, but continues to grow. Major U.S. corporations, such as [[H.J. Heinz]] and [[AON Corporation]], are present through direct investments, while others, such as [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] and [[Remax]], are present via franchise. The sovereign credit ratings by Moody's and Standard & Poor's clearly indicate that, despite continued challenges such as small market size, landlocked location, and cumbersome bureaucratic processes, Botswana remains one of the best investment opportunities in the developing world. Botswana has a 90-member American Business Council that accepts membership from American-affiliated companies.\n\nDue to its history and geography, Botswana has long had deep ties to the economy of South Africa. The [[Southern Africa Customs Union]] (SACU), comprising Botswana, [[Lesotho]], Swaziland, and South Africa, dates from 1910, and is the world\u2019s oldest customs union. Namibia joined in 1990. Under this arrangement, South Africa has collected [[Tax|levies]] from customs, sales, and excise duties for all five members, sharing out proceeds based on each countries portion of imports. The exact formula for sharing revenues and the decision-making authority over duties\u2014held exclusively by the Government of South Africa\u2014became increasingly controversial, and the members renegotiated the arrangement in 2001. The new structure has now been formally ratified and a SACU Secretariat has been established in [[Windhoek]], Namibia. Following South Africa's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), Botswana also joined; many of the SACU duties are thus declining, making products from outside the area more competitive in Botswana. Currently the SACU countries and the U.S. are negotiating a free trade agreement. Botswana is currently also negotiating a free trade agreement with [[Mercosur]] and an Economic Partnership Agreement with the [[European Union]] as part of SADC.\n\n[[File:Okavango11.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view over [[Okavango Delta]]]]\nGaborone is host to the headquarters of the fourteen-nation [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), a successor to the [[Southern African Development Coordination Conference]] (SADCC, established in 1980), which focused its efforts on freeing regional economic development from dependence on apartheid South Africa. SADC embraced the newly democratic South Africa as a member in 1994 and has a broad mandate to encourage growth, development, and economic integration in Southern Africa. SADC's Trade Protocol, which was launched on 1 September 2000, calls for the elimination of all tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade by 2008 among the 11 signatory countries. If successful, it will give Botswana companies free access to the far larger regional market. SADC's failure to distance itself from the [[Robert Mugabe|Mugabe]] government in Zimbabwe has diminished the number of opportunities for cooperation between the U.S. and SADC.\n\nBotswana has successfully carried an Action Programme on the Elimination of [[Child labour in Botswana|Child Labour]], which was adopted in the period 2006-2007. [[Free the Children]] delisted Botswana as a nation harbouring child-labour facilities in 2008.\n\n==Financial sector==\nBotswana has a growing financial sector, and the country's national stock market, the [[Botswana Stock Exchange]] (BSE), based in Gaborone, is given the responsibility to operate and regulate the equities and fixed interest securities market. Formally established in 1989, the BSE continues to be pivotal to Botswana\u2019s financial system, and in particular the capital market, as an avenue on which government, quasi-government and the private sector can raise debt and equity capital. Although the BSE has just under 40 companies listed, it plays host to the most pre-eminent companies doing business in Botswana. These companies represent a spectrum of industries and commerce, from Banking and financial services to Wholesaling and Retailing, Tourism and Information Technology.\n\nTo date, the BSE is one of Africa\u2019s best performing stock exchanges, averaging 24% aggregate return in the past decade. This has allowed the BSE to be the third largest stock exchange, in terms of market capitalisation, in Southern Africa.\n\nGiven Botswana's lack of exchange controls, stable currency and exceptionally performing stock market, the financial sector has attracted a host of global investors seeking better returns.\n\nBotswana's currency, the [[Botswana pula|pula]], is fully convertible and is valued against a basket of currencies heavily weighted toward the South African [[Rand (currency)|Rand]]. Profits and direct investment can be repatriated without restriction from Botswana. The Botswana Government eliminated all exchange controls in 1999. The Central Bank devalued the Pula by 7.5% in February 2004 in a bid to maintain export competitiveness against the real appreciation of the Pula. There was a further 12% devaluation in May 2005 and the policy of a \"[[Crawling peg]]\" was adopted.\n\nThe recently established Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) is responsible for the oversight of all non-banking financial services entities in the country. As of 2005, about 54 percent of Botswana\u2019s population had access to formal or informal financial services, and 43 percent is banked (with access to at least one formal banking product). The overall access ratio is still low, especially in rural areas, where there are 3.8 branches and 73 ATMs per 100,000 people. Mobile banking services have just started to be offered. In recent years the government and Central Bank have undertaken serious steps to modernize the country\u2019s payment system infrastructure. These efforts included the establishment of a code-line clearing system for the exchange of cheques and electronic funds as well as a Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, including SWIFT connection. The stock exchange implemented a Central Securities Depository in 2007. Remittance Flows for Botswana amounted to USD 117 million in 2007, a figure that is higher than the total net value of official development assistance.<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html MFW4A]</ref>\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Sadc logo.gif|thumb|left|120px|SADC Logo]] -->[[Gaborone]] is host to the headquarters of the 14-nation [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).

Botswana is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\nBotswana has a small number of [[Botswana diplomatic missions|diplomatic missions]] abroad.\n\n==Bilateral Relations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Belize}}||<!--Date started-->28 February 2008||\n\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on February 28, 2008.<ref>[http://www.mofaic.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=134:bilateral-relations-b&catid=2&Itemid=43]</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Croatia}}||<!--Date started-->9 September 2005||\nDiplomatic relations between Botswana and Croatia were established on September 9, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvep.hr/en/foreign-politics/bilateral-relations/date-of-recognition-and-establishment-of-diplomatic-relations/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvep.hr/en/foreign-politics/bilateral-relations/overview-by-country/botswana,161.html }}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Cyprus}}||<!--Date started-->22 February 2005||\nDiplomatic relations between Botswana and Cyprus were established on February 22, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olc.gov.cy/olc/olc.nsf/all/6F543F579FA382BFC22575D70021C909/$file/List%20of%20Botswana.pdf?openelement }}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Dominica}}||<!--Date started-->23 July 2007||\nBoth countries established diplomatic relations on 23 July 2007.<ref>[http://www.mofaic.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=135:bilateral-relations-c&catid=2&Itemid=53 ]</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Georgia}}||<!--Date started-->5 November 2015||\nDiplomatic relations between Georgia and Botswana were established on November 5, 2015.\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Greece}}||<!--Date started-->||\nBotswana is represented in Greece through its Permanent Representation to the United Nation Office in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and Greece is represented in Botswana through its embassy in [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gr/en/blog/greece-bilateral-relations/botswana/ }}</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Guinea Bissau}}||<!--Date started-->22 March 2010||\n\nBotswana and [[Guinea-Bissau]] established diplomatic relations on 22 March 2010.<ref name=\"gov.bw\">[http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20100330&i=Botswana_establishes_relations_with_Samoa_Guinea_Bissau \"Botswana establishes relations with Samoa, Guinea Bissau\"]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 March 2010 Link retrieved 1 April 2010</ref>\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Guyana}}||<!--Date started-->28 October 1975||\n*Both countries have established diplomatic relations on 28 October 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minfor.gov.gy/docs/other/diplomatic_relations_list.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307101008/http://www.minfor.gov.gy/docs/other/diplomatic_relations_list.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n*Guyana is covered through the Botswana Mission in New York, USA.<ref>[http://www.mofaic.gov.bw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=140:bilateral-relations-g&catid=2&Itemid=43]</ref> \n*Both countries are full members of [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|India}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Botswana\u2013India relations]]\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Israel}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Botswana\u2013Israel relations]]\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Malawi}}||<!--Date started-->||\nBoth countries are full members of the [[Southern African Development Community]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Mexico}}||<!--Date started-->5 December 1965||\n\n* Botswana is accredited to Mexico from its embassy in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.<ref>[http://www.botswanaembassy.org/ Embassy of Botswana in the United States]</ref>\n* Mexico is accredited to Botswana from its embassy in Pretoria, South Africa<ref>[https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/sudafrica/ Embassy of Mexico in South Africa]</ref> and maintains an honorary consulate in Gaborone.<ref>[http://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/8936/CON_HON_160415_AFRICA.pdf Honorary consulate of Mexico in Gaborone (in Spanish)]</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Namibia}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Botswana\u2013Namibia relations]]\n\nBotswana\u2013Namibia relations are friendly, with the two neighbouring countries cooperating on economic development.

The U.S. [[Peace Corps]] returned to Botswana in August 2002 with a focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]-related programs after concluding 30 years of more broadly targeted assistance in 1997. Similarly, the [[USAID]] phased out a long-standing bilateral partnership with Botswana in 1996, after successful programs emphasizing education, training, [[entrepreneurship]], environmental management, and [[reproductive health]]. Botswana, however, continues to benefit along with its neighbours in the region from USAID's Initiative for Southern Africa, now based in [[Pretoria]], and USAID's Southern Africa Global Competitiveness Hub, headquartered in [[Gaborone]]. The United States International Board of Broadcasters (IBB) operates a major [[Voice of America]] (VOA) relay station in Botswana serving most of the African continent.\n\nIn 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) started the BOTUSA Project in collaboration with the Botswana Ministry of Health in order to generate information to improve [[tuberculosis]] control efforts in Botswana and elsewhere in the face of the TB and HIV/AIDS co-epidemics. Under the 1999 U.S. Government's Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative, CDC through the BOTUSA Project has undertaken many projects and has assisted many organizations in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Botswana. Botswana is one of the 15 focus countries for PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, and has received more than $230 million since the program began in January 2004 through September 2007. PEPFAR assistance to Botswana, which totalled $76.2 million in FY 2007, is contributing to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care interventions.\n\nThe Governments of Botswana and the United States entered into an agreement in July 2000 to establish an International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Gaborone. The academy, jointly financed, managed and staffed by the two nations, provides training to [[police]] and government officials from across the Sub-Saharan region. The academy's permanent campus, in [[Otse]] outside of Gaborone, opened March 2003. Over 3,000 law enforcement professionals from Sub-Saharan Africa have received training from ILEA since it began offering classes in 2001.\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Zimbabwe}}||<!--Date

[[Atlantic Ocean]]. Brazil covers a total area of {{convert|8514215|km2|abbr=on}} which includes {{convert|8456510|km2|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|55455|km2|abbr=on}} of water. The highest point in Brazil is [[Pico da Neblina]] at {{convert|2994|m|abbr=on}}. Brazil is bordered by the countries of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]],  [[Guyana]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], and [[France]] (overseas department of France, [[French Guiana]]).\n\nMuch of the climate is tropical, with the south being relatively temperate. The largest river in Brazil, the second longest in the world, is the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].\n\n==Size and geographical location==\nBrazil occupies most of the eastern part of the [[South America|South American continent]] and its geographic heartland (48% of South America), as well as various islands in the Atlantic Ocean. The only countries in the world that are larger are Russia, Canada, China, and the United States. The national territory extends {{convert|4395|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from north to south (5\u00b016'20\" N to 33\u00b044'32\" S latitude), and {{convert|4319|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from east to west (34\u00b047'30\" E to 73\u00b059'32\" W longitude). It spans three [[time zone]]s, the westernmost of which is one hour ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] in the United States. The [[Time in Brazil|time zone of the capital (Bras\u00edlia)]] and of the most populated part of Brazil along the east coast ([[UTC-3]]) is two hours ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]], except when it is on its own [[daylight saving time]], from October to February. The Atlantic islands are in the easternmost time zone.\n\nBrazil possesses the archipelago of [[Fernando de Noronha]], located {{convert|350|km|mi|0|sp=us}} northeast of its \"horn\", and several small islands and atolls in the Atlantic - [[Abrolhos Marine National Park|Abrolhos]], [[Atol das Rocas]], [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks|Penedos de S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Trindade]], and [[Trindade and Martim Vaz|Martim Vaz]]. In the early 1970s, Brazil claimed a territorial sea extending {{convert|362|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the country's shores, including those of the islands.\n\nOn Brazil's east coast, the Atlantic coastline extends {{convert|7367|km|mi|0|sp=us}}. In the west, in clockwise order from the south, Brazil has {{convert|15719|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of borders with Uruguay, [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], and [[French Guiana]] (overseas department of [[France]]). The only South American countries with which Brazil does not share borders are [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]]. A few short sections are in question, but there are no true major boundary controversies with any of the neighboring countries.\n\nBrazil has six major [[ecosystem]]s: the [[Amazon Basin]], a tropical rainforest system; the [[Pantanal]] bordering Paraguay and Bolivia, a tropical wetland system; the [[Cerrado]], a [[savanna]] system that covers much of the center of the country; the [[Caatinga]] or thorny scrubland habitat of the Northeast; the [[Atlantic Forest]] (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica) that extends along the entire coast from the Northeast to the South; and the [[Pampas]] or fertile lowland plains of the far South.\n\n== Geology, geomorphology and drainage ==\nIn contrast to the [[Andes]], which rose to elevations of nearly {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in a relatively recent epoch and inverted the Amazon's direction of flow from westward to eastward, Brazil's geological formation is very old.  [[Precambrian]] crystalline shields cover 36% of the territory, especially its central area.  The dramatic granite [[bornhardt|sugarloaf mountains]] in the city of Rio de Janeiro are an example of the terrain of the Brazilian shield regions, where continental basement rock has been sculpted into towering domes and columns by tens of millions of years of [[erosion]], untouched by mountain-building events.\n\nThe principal mountain ranges average elevations just under {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The [[Serra do Mar]] Range hugs the Atlantic coast, and the [[Serra do Espinha\u00e7o]] Range, the largest in area, extends through the south-central part of the country. The highest mountains are in the Tumucumaque, [[Pacaraima]], and Imeri ranges, among others, which traverse the northern border with the Guianas and Venezuela.\n\nIn addition to mountain ranges (about 0.5% of the country is above {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Brazil's Central Highlands include a vast central plateau ([[Planalto Central]]). The plateau's uneven terrain has an average elevation of {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The rest of the territory is made up primarily of sedimentary basins, the largest of which is drained by the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and its tributaries. Of the total territory, 41% averages less than {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation. The coastal zone is noted for thousands of kilometers of tropical beaches interspersed with [[mangrove]]s, [[lagoon]]s, and [[dune]]s, as well as numerous [[coral reef]]s.{{fact|date=August 2016}}\nThe [[Parcel de Manuel Lu\u00eds Marine State Park]] off the coast of [[Maranh\u00e3o]] protects the largest coral reef in South America.<ref>{{citation |title=Decreto n\u00ba 11.902 de 11 de Junho de 1991 |language=Portuguese\n |author1=Edison Lob\u00e3o|author2=Fernando C\u00e9sar de Moreira Mesquita|date=11 June 1991|publisher=State of Maranh\u00e3o\n |url=https://documentacao.socioambiental.org/ato_normativo/UC/305_20100823_151217.pdf|accessdate=2016-08-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Brazil topo.jpg|thumb|250px|Topographic map of Brazil]]\n\nBrazil has one of the world's most extensive [[river system]]s, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic Ocean. Two of these basins \u2014 the [[Amazon basin|Amazon]] and Tocantins-Araguaia account for more than half the total drainage area. The largest river system in Brazil is the Amazon, which originates in the Andes and receives tributaries from a basin that covers 45.7% of the country, principally the north and west. The main Amazon river system is the Amazonas-Solim\u00f5es-Ucayali axis (the {{convert|6762|km|mi|0|sing=on|sp=us}}-long Ucayali is a Peruvian tributary), flowing from west to east. Through the Amazon Basin flows one-fifth of the world's fresh water. A total of {{convert|3615|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of the Amazon are in Brazilian territory. Over this distance, the waters decline only about {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|sp=us}}. The major tributaries on the southern side are, from west to east, the Javari, Juru\u00e1, Purus (all three of which flow into the western section of the Amazon called the [[Solim\u00f5es]]), [[Madeira River|Madeira]], [[Tapaj\u00f3s]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]], and [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]]. On the northern side, the largest tributaries are the [[Branco River|Branco]], [[Japur\u00e1 River|Japur\u00e1]], [[Jari River|Jari]], and [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]]. The above-mentioned tributaries carry more water than the Mississippi (its discharge is less than one-tenth that of the Amazon). The Amazon and some of its tributaries, called \"white\" rivers, bear rich sediments and hydrobiological elements. The black-white and clear rivers\u2014such as the Negro, Tapaj\u00f3s, and Xingu\u2014have clear (greenish) or dark water with few nutrients and little sediment.\n\nThe major river system in the Northeast is the [[S\u00e3o Francisco River|Rio S\u00e3o Francisco]], which flows {{convert|1609|km|mi|0|sp=us}} northeast from the south-central region. Its basin covers 7.6% of the national territory. Only {{convert|277|km|mi|0|sp=us}} of the lower river are navigable for oceangoing ships. The [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]] system covers 14.5% of the country. The Paran\u00e1 flows south among the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], reaching the Atlantic between Argentina and Uruguay. The headwaters of the Paraguai, the Paran\u00e1's major eastern tributary, constitute the [[Pantanal]], the largest contiguous wetlands in the world, covering as much as {{convert|230000|km2|sqmi|-3|sp=us}}.\n\nBelow their descent from the highlands, many of the tributaries of the Amazon are navigable. Upstream, they generally have [[rapid]]s or [[waterfall]]s, and boats and barges also must face sandbars, trees, and other obstacles. Nevertheless, the Amazon is navigable by oceangoing vessels as far as {{convert|3885|km|mi|0|sp=us}} upstream, reaching [[Iquitos]] in [[Peru]]. The Amazon river system was the principal means of access until new roads became more important. Hydroelectric projects are [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]], in Paran\u00e1, with 12,600 MW; Tucuru\u00ed, in [[Par\u00e1]], with 7,746 MW; and [[Paulo Afonso]], in [[Bahia]], with 3,986 MW.\n\n=== Natural resources ===\n[[Natural resources]] include: [[bauxite]], [[gold]], [[iron ore]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[phosphates]], [[platinum]], [[tin]], [[clay]], rare earth elements, [[uranium]], [[petroleum]], [[hydropower]] and [[timber]].\n\n== Rivers and lakes ==\n[[Image:Brasil Bacias hidrograficas.svg|thumb|250px|Main Hydrographic Regions of Brazil]]\n\n[[List of rivers of Brazil]]\n\nAccording to organs of the Brazilian government there are 12 major hydrographic regions in Brazil. Seven of these are river basins named after their main rivers; the other five are groupings of various river basins in areas which have no dominant river.\n\n*7 Hydrographic Regions named after their dominant rivers:\n** [[Amazon Basin|Amazonas]]\n** [[Paraguay River|Paraguai]]\n** [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]]\n** [[Parnaiba River|Parna\u00edba]]\n** [[S\u00e3o Francisco River|S\u00e3o Francisco]]\n** [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]]\n** [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]]\n*5 coastal Hydrographic Regions based on regional groupings of minor river basins (listed from north to south):\n** Atl\u00e2ntico Nordeste Ocidental (Western North-east Atlantic)\n** Atl\u00e2ntico Nordeste Oriental (Eastern North-east Atlantic)\n** Atl\u00e2ntico Leste (Eastern Atlantic)\n** Atl\u00e2ntico Sudeste (South-east Atlantic)\n** Atl\u00e2ntico Sul (South Atlantic)\n\nThe [[Amazon River]] is the widest and second longest river (behind the Nile) in the world. This huge river drains the greater part of the world's rainforests. Another major river, the Paran\u00e1, has its source in Brazil. It forms the border of Paraguay and Argentina, then winds its way through Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean, along the southern coast of Uruguay.\n\n== Soils and vegetation ==\n[[Image:Amazon.A2002182.1405.1km.jpg|thumb|250px|The Amazon Rainforest]]\n\nBrazil's tropical soils produce almost 210 million tons of grain crops per year,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ibge statistics|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/indicadores/agropecuaria/lspa/lspa_201507_7.shtm}}</ref> from about 70 millions hectares of crops. The country also has the largest arable land in the world. Burning also is used traditionally to remove tall, dry, and nutrient-poor grass from pasture at the end of the dry season. Until mechanization and the use of chemical and genetic inputs increased during the agricultural intensification period of the 1970s and 1980s, [[coffee]] planting and farming in general moved constantly onward to new lands in the west and north. This pattern of horizontal or extensive expansion maintained low levels of technology and productivity and placed emphasis on quantity rather than quality of agricultural production.\n\nThe largest areas of fertile soils, called terra roxa (red earth), are found in the states of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The least fertile areas are in the Amazon, where the dense [[rainforest]] is. Soils in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] are often fertile, but they lack water, unless they are [[irrigation|irrigated]] artificially.\n\nIn the 1980s, investments made possible the use of irrigation, especially in the Northeast Region and in [[Rio Grande do Sul]] State, which had shifted from grazing to [[soy]] and [[rice]] production in the 1970s. [[Savanna]] soils also were made usable for soybean farming through acidity correction, [[fertilization]], [[plant breeding]], and in some cases spray irrigation. As agriculture underwent modernization in the 1970s and 1980s, soil fertility became less important for agricultural production than factors related to capital investment, such as infrastructure, mechanization, use of chemical inputs, breeding, and proximity to markets. Consequently, the vigor of frontier expansion weakened.\n\nThe variety of climates, soils, and drainage conditions in Brazil is reflected in the range of its vegetation types. The Amazon Basin and the areas of heavy rainfall along the Atlantic coast have tropical rain forest composed of [[broadleaf]] evergreen trees. The rain forest may contain as many as 3,000 [[species]] of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] within a {{convert|2.6|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|sing=on}} area. The Atlantic Forest is reputed to have even greater biological diversity than the Amazon rain forest, which, despite apparent homogeneity, contains many types of vegetation, from high canopy forest to bamboo groves.\n\nIn the semiarid Northeast, [[caatinga]], a dry, thick, thorny vegetation, predominates. Most of central Brazil is covered with a woodland savanna, known as the [[cerrado]] (sparse scrub trees and drought-resistant grasses), which became an area of agricultural development after the mid-1970s. In the [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]] (Sul), needle-leaved [[pine]]woods (Paran\u00e1 pine or [[araucaria]]) cover the highlands; grassland similar to the Argentine [[pampa]] covers the sea-level plains. The Mato Grosso [[swampland]]s ([[Pantanal]] Mato-grossense) is a [[Florida]]-sized plain in the western portion of the Center-West (Centro-Oeste). It is covered with tall [[grass]]es, [[Woody plant|bush]]es, and widely dispersed trees similar to those of the cerrado and is partly submerged during the rainy season.\n\n[[Image:Brazil veg 1977.jpg|thumb|350px|Natural vegetation map of Brazil, 1977. The \"Paran\u00e1 pine\" (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]'') is a [[conifer]] but not a [[pine]], pines are not native to the Southern Hemisphere.]]\nBrazil, which is named after reddish dyewood ([[pau brasil]]), has long been famous for the wealth of its tropical forests. These are not, however, as important to world markets as those of Asia and Africa, which started to reach depletion only in the 1980s. By 1996 more than 90% of the original Atlantic forest had been cleared, primarily for agriculture, with little use made of the wood, except for araucaria pine in Paran\u00e1.\n\nThe inverse situation existed with regard to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, and part of the remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of woody species per [[hectare]], there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as [[mahogany]] and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of [[forest fire]]s, which are otherwise rare in [[rainforest]]s. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of [[Par\u00e1]] State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of [[plywood]] have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, rapid deforestation and extensive burning in Brazil received considerable international and national attention. [[Satellite image]]s have helped document and quantify deforestation as well as fires, but their use also has generated considerable controversy because of problems of defining original vegetation, cloud cover, and dealing with secondary growth and because fires, as mentioned above, may occur in old pasture rather than signifying new clearing. Public policies intended to promote sustainable management of timber extraction, as well as sustainable use of nontimber forest products (such as rubber, [[Brazil nut]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[seed]]s, [[vegetable oil|oils]], and [[vine]]s), were being discussed intensely in the mid-1990s. However, implementing the principles of sustainable development, without irreversible damage to the environment, proved to be more challenging than establishing international agreements about them.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Brazil}}\n\n[[File:Brazil map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Brazil map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nAlthough 90% of the country is within the [[tropical zone]], the climate of Brazil varies considerably from the mostly tropical North (the [[equator]] traverses the mouth of the Amazon) to [[temperate zone]]s below the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] (23\u00b027' S latitude), which crosses the country at the latitude of the city of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (city)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]. Brazil has five climatic regions: [[Equatorial climate|equatorial]], tropical, [[semiarid]], [[tropical|highland tropical]], and [[subtropical]].\n\nTemperatures along the [[equator]] are high, averaging above {{convert|25|C|F|0}}, but not reaching the summer extremes of up to {{convert|40|C|F|0}} in the temperate zones. There is little seasonal variation near the equator, although at times it can get cool enough for wearing a jacket, especially in the rain. At the country's other extreme, there are frosts south of the Tropic of Capricorn during the winter (June\u2013August), and there is snow in the mountainous areas, such as [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] and [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]. Temperatures in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, [[Belo Horizonte]], and [[Bras\u00edlia]] are moderate (usually between {{convert|15|and|30|C|F|0|disp=or}}), despite their relatively low latitude, because of their elevation of approximately {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]], Recife, and Salvador on the coast have warm climates, with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|to|27|C|F|1}}, but enjoy constant trade winds. The southern cities of [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Curitiba]] have a subtropical climate similar to that in parts of the United States and Europe, and temperatures can fall below freezing in winter.\n\nPrecipitation levels vary widely. Most of Brazil has moderate [[rainfall]] of between {{convert|1000|and|1500|mm|in|1}} a year, with most of the rain falling in the winter (between December and April) south of the Equator. The [[Amazon region]] is notoriously humid, with rainfall generally more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1}} per year and reaching as high as {{convert|3000|mm|in|1}} in parts of the western Amazon and near Bel\u00e9m. It is less widely known that, despite high annual precipitation, the Amazon rain forest has a three- to five-month dry season, the timing of which varies according to location north or south of the equator.\n\nHigh and relatively regular levels of precipitation in the Amazon contrast sharply with the dryness of the semiarid Northeast, where rainfall is scarce and there are severe droughts in cycles averaging seven years. The [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] is the driest part of the country. The region also constitutes the hottest part of Brazil, where during the dry season between May and November, temperatures of more than {{convert|38|C|F|0}} have been recorded. However, the [[sert\u00e3o]], a region of [[desert|semidesert vegetation]] used primarily for low-density ranching, turns green when there is rain. Most of the Center-West has {{convert|1500|to|2000|mm|in|1}} of rain per year, with a pronounced dry season in the middle of the year, while the South and most of the year without a distinct dry season.\n\n==Geographic regions==\n{{Main|Regions of Brazil}}\nBrazil's 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] (Distrito Federal) are divided conventionally into five regions: [[North Region, Brazil|North]] (Norte), Northeast (Nordeste), [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]] (Sudeste), [[Southern Region, Brazil|South]] (Sul), and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] (Centro-Oeste) - see fig. 4. In 2015 there were 5,570 [[municipal]]ities (munic\u00edpios), which have municipal governments. Many municipalities, which are comparable to United States counties, are in turn divided into [[district]]s (distritos), which do not have [[Politics|political]] or [[Administrative division|administrative]] [[autonomy]]. In 2015 there were 10,424 districts. All municipal and district seats, regardless of size, are considered officially to be urban. For purely statistical purposes, the municipalities were grouped in 1990 into 558 micro-regions, which in turn constituted 137 meso-regions. This grouping modified the previous micro-regional division established in 1968, a division that was used to present census data for 1970, 1975, 1980, and 1985.\n\nEach of the five major regions has a distinct [[ecosystem]]. Administrative boundaries do not necessarily coincide with ecological boundaries, however. In addition to differences in [[physical environment]], patterns of [[economic activity]] and population settlement vary widely among the regions. The principal ecological characteristics of each of the five major regions, as well as their principal socioeconomic and demographic features, are summarized below.\n\n{{Detailed map of Brazil}}\n\n=== Centre west ===\n{{Main|Center-West Region, Brazil}}\nThe Center-West consists of the states of [[Goi\u00e1s]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (separated from Mato Grosso in 1979) and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], where [[Bras\u00edlia]] is located, the national capital. Until 1988 Goi\u00e1s State included the area that then became the state of Tocantins in the North.\n\nThe Center-West has {{convert|1612077|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}} and covers 18.9% of the national territory. Its main biome is the [[cerrado]], the tropical savanna in which natural grassland is partly covered with twisted shrubs and small trees. The cerrado was used for low-density cattle-raising in the past but is now also used for soybean production. There are [[gallery forest]]s along the rivers and streams and some larger areas of forest, most of which have been cleared for [[farming]] and [[livestock]]. In the north, the cerrado blends into tropical forest. It also includes the [[Pantanal]] [[wetland]]s in the west, known for their wildlife, especially aquatic birds and [[caiman]]s. In the early 1980s, 33.6% of the region had been altered by anthropic activities, with a low of 9.3% in Mato Grosso and a high of 72.9% in Goi\u00e1s (not including Tocantins). In 1996 the Center-West region had 10.2 million inhabitants, or 6% of Brazil's total population. The average density is low, with concentrations in and around the cities of [[Bras\u00edlia]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]], [[Campo Grande]], and [[Cuiab\u00e1]]. Living standards are below the national average. In 1994 they were highest in the Federal District, with per capita income of US$7,089 (the highest in the nation), and lowest in Mato Grosso, with US$2,268.\n\n=== Northeast ===\n{{Main|Northeast Region, Brazil}}\n\nThe nine states that make up the Northeast are [[Alagoas]], [[Bahia]], [[Cear\u00e1]], [[Maranh\u00e3o]], [[Para\u00edba]], [[Pernambuco]], [[Piau\u00ed]], Rio Grande do Norte, and [[Sergipe]]. The [[Fernando de Noronha]] archipelago (formerly the federal territory of [[Fernando de Noronha]], now part of [[Pernambuco]] state) is also included in the Northeast.\n\nThe Northeast, with {{convert|1561178|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, covers 18.3% of the national terrest concentration of rural population, and its living standards are the lowest in Brazil. In 1994 Piau\u00ed had the lowest per capita income in the region and the country, only US$835, while Sergipe had the highest average income in the region, with US$1,958.\n\n=== North ===\n{{Main|North Region, Brazil}}\n\nThe equatorial North, also known as the Amazon or [[Amaz\u00f4nia]], includes, from west to east, the states of [[Rond\u00f4nia]], Acre, [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], [[Roraima]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Amap\u00e1]], and, as of 1988, [[Tocantins (state)|Tocantins]] (created from the northern part of Goi\u00e1s State, which is situated in the Center-West). Rond\u00f4nia, previously a federal territory, became a state in 1986. The former federal territories of Roraima and Amap\u00e1 were raised to statehood in 1988.\n\nWith {{convert|3869638|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, the North is the country's largest region, covering 45.3% of the national territory. The region's principal [[biome]] is the humid [[tropical forest]], also known as the rain forest, home to some of the planet's richest [[biological diversity]]. The North has served as a source of forest products ranging from \"backlands drugs\" (such as [[Smilax regelii|sarsaparilla]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cinnamon]], and [[turtle|turtle butter]]) in the colonial period to rubber and [[Brazil nut]]s in more recent times. In the mid-twentieth century, nonforest products from [[mining]], [[farming]], and livestock-raising became more important, and in the 1980s the [[lumber industry]] boomed. In 1990, 6.6% of the region's territory was considered altered by anthropic (man-made) action, with state levels varying from 0.9% in Amap\u00e1 to 14.0% in Rond\u00f4nia.\n\nIn 1996 the North had 11.1 million inhabitants, only 7% of the national total. However, its share of Brazil's total had grown rapidly in the 1970s and early 1980s as a result of interregional migration, as well as high rates of natural increase. The largest population concentrations are in eastern Par\u00e1 State and in Rond\u00f4nia. The major cities are [[Bel\u00e9m]] and [[Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1|Santar\u00e9m]] in Par\u00e1, and [[Manaus]] in Amazonas. Living standards are below the national average. The highest [[per capita income]], US$2,888, in the region in 1994, was in Amazonas, while the lowest, US$901, was in Tocantins.\n\n=== Southeast ===\n{{Main|Southeast Region, Brazil}}\n\nThe Southeast consists of the four states of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], and [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]. Its total area of {{convert|927286|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}} corresponds to 10.9% of the national territory. The region has the largest share of the country's population, 63 million in 1991, or 39% of the national total, primarily as a result of internal migration since the mid-19th century until the 1980s. In addition to a dense urban network, it contains the megacities of S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which in 1991 had 18.7 million and 11.7 million inhabitants in their metropolitan areas, respectively. The region combines the highest living standards in Brazil with pockets of urban poverty. In 1994 S\u00e3o Paulo boasted an average income of US$4,666, while Minas Gerais reported only US$2,833.\n\nOriginally, the principal biome in the Southeast was the Atlantic Forest, but by 1990 less than 10% of the original forest cover remained as a result of clearing for farming, ranching, and charcoal making. Anthropic activity had altered 79.7% of the region, ranging from 75% in Minas Gerais to 91.1% in Esp\u00edrito Santo. The region has most of Brazil's [[industrialization|industrial production]]. The state of S\u00e3o Paulo alone accounts for half of the country's industries. Agriculture, also very strong, has diversified and now uses modern technology.\n\n=== South ===\n{{Main|Southern Region, Brazil}}\n\nThe three states in the temperate South: [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], and Santa Catarina\u2014cover {{convert|577214|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, or 6.8% of the national territory. The population of the South in 1991 was 23.1 million, or 14% of the country's total. The region is almost as densely settled as the Southeast, but the population is more concentrated along the coast. The major cities are [[Curitiba]] and [[Porto Alegre]]. The inhabitants of the South enjoy relatively high living standards. Because of its industry and agriculture, Paran\u00e1 had the highest average income in 1994, US$3,674, while Santa Catarina, a land of small farmers and small industries, had slightly less, US$3,405.\n\nIn addition to the [[Atlantic Forest]] and [[Araucaria moist forests]], much of which were cleared in the post-World War II period, the southernmost portion of Brazil contains the [[Uruguayan savanna]], which extends into [[Argentina]] and Uruguay. In 1982, 83.5% of the region had been altered by anthropic activity, with the highest level (89.7%) in Rio Grande do Sul, and the lowest (66.7%) in Santa Catarina. [[Agriculture]]\u2014much of which, such as [[rice]] production, is carried out by small farmers\u2014has high levels of productivity. There are also some important industries.\n\n==Environmental issues==\n{{Main|Environment of Brazil}}\n\nThe [[environmentalism|environmental problem]] that attracted most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]]. Of all [[Latin American]] countries, Brazil still has the largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but [[Deforestation|clearing]] and [[burning]] in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of the clearing resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from [[slash and burn]] techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.\n\n[[Desertification]], another important environmental problem in Brazil, only received international attention following the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Environment and Development, also known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992. Desertification means that the soils and vegetation of drylands are egraded, not necessarily that land turns into desert. In the early 1990s, it became evident that the semiarid [[caatinga]] ecosystem of the Northeast was losing its natural vegetation through clearing and that the zone was therefore running the risk of becoming even more arid, as was occurring also in some other regions.\n\nIn areas where agriculture is more intense and developed, there are serious problems of [[soil erosion]], [[silt]]ation and [[sedimentation]] of streams and rivers, and pollution with [[pesticide]]s. In parts of the [[savanna]]s, where irrigated [[soybean]] production expanded in the 1980s, the [[water table]] has been affected. Expansion of pastures for cattle raising has reduced natural [[biodiversity]] in the savannas. Swine effluents constitute a serious environmental problem in Santa Catarina in the South.\n\nIn urban areas, at least in the largest cities, levels of [[air pollution]] and [[Traffic congestion|congestion]] are typical of, or worse than, those found in cities in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. At the same time, however, basic environmental problems related to the lack of [[sanitation]], which developed countries solved long ago, persist in Brazil. These problems are sometimes worse in middle-sized and small cities than in large cities, which have more resources to deal with them. Environmental problems of cities and towns finally began to receive greater attention by society and the government in the 1990s.\n\nAccording to many critics, the [[economic crisis]] in the 1980s worsened environmental degradation in Brazil because it led to [[overexploitation]] of [[natural resources]], stimulated settlement in fragile lands in both rural and urban areas, and weakened environmental protection. At the same time, however, the lower level of economic activity may have reduced pressure on the environment, such as the aforementioned decreased level of investment in large-scale clearing in the Amazon. That pressure could increase if economic growth accelerates, especially if consumption patterns remain unchanged and more sustainable forms of production are not found.\n\nIn Brazil public policies regarding the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] are generally advanced, although their implementation and the enforcement of [[environmental law]]s have been far from ideal. Laws regarding forests, water, and wildlife have been in effect since the 1930s. Brazil achieved significant institutional advances in environmental policy design and implementation after the Stockholm Conference on the Environment in 1972. Specialized environmental agencies were organized at the federal level and in some states, and many [[National park (Brazil)|national park]]s and reserves were established. By 1992 Brazil had established 34 national parks and fifty-six [[Biological reserve (Brazil)|biological reserve]]s. In 1981 the National Environment Policy was defined, and the National System for the Environment (Sistema Nacional do Meio Ambiente\u2014Sisnama) was created, with the National Environmental Council (Conselho Nacional do Meio Ambiente\u2014Conama) at its apex, municipal councils at its base, and state-level councils in between. In addition to government authorities, all of these councils include representatives of civil society.\n\nThe 1988 constitution incorporates environmental precepts that are advanced compared with those of most other countries. At that time, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]] (C\u00e2mara dos Deputados) established its permanent Commission for Defense of the Consumer, the Environment, and Minorities. In 1989 the creation of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renov\u00e1veis--[[Ibama]]) joined together the federal environment secretariat and the federal agencies specializing in [[forestry]], [[rubber]], and fisheries. In 1990 the administration of [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] (president, 1990\u201392) appointed the well-known environmentalist Jos\u00e9 Lutzemberger as secretary of the environment and took firm positions on the environment and on Indian lands. In 1992 Brazil played a key role at the [[Earth Summit]], not only as its host but also as negotiator on sustainable development agreements, including the conventions on climate and biodiversity. The Ministry of Environment was created in late 1992, after President Collor had left office. In August 1993, it became the Ministry of Environment and the [[Legal Amazon]] and took a more pragmatic approach than had the combative Lutzemberger. However, because of turnover in its leadership, a poorly defined mandate, and lack of funds, its role and impact were limited. In 1995 its mandate and name were expanded to include water resources\u2014the Ministry of Environment, Hydraulic Resources, and the Legal Amazon\u2014it began a process of restructuring to meet its mandate of \"shared management of the sustainable use of natural resources.\" In 1997 the Commission on Policies for Sustainable Development and Agenda 21 began to function under the aegis of the Civil Household. One of its main tasks was to prepare Agenda 21 (a plan for the twenty-first century) for Brazil and to stimulate preparation of state and local agendas.\n\nInstitutional development at the official level was accompanied and in part stimulated by the growth, wide diffusion, and growing professional development of [[nongovernmental organization]]s (NGOs) dedicated to environmental and socio-environmental causes. The hundreds of NGOs throughout Brazil produce documents containing both useful information and passionate criticisms. Among the Brazilian environmental NGOs, the most visible are SOS Atlantic Forest ([[SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica]]), the Social-Environmental Institute (Instituto S\u00f3cio-Ambiental\u2014ISA), the Pro-Nature Foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Pr\u00f3-Natureza\u2014Funatura), and the Amazon Working Group (Grupo de Trabalho Amaz\u00f4nico\u2014GTA). The Brazilian Forum of NGOs and Social Movements for the Environment and Development and the Brazilian Association of Nongovernmental Organizations (Associac\u00e3o Brasileira de Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es N\u00e3o-Governamentais\u2014ABONG) are national networks, and there are various regional and thematic networks as well. The main international environmental NGOs that have offices or affiliates in Brazil are the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Conservation International (CI), and Nature Conservancy.\n\nEspecially after the events of the late 1980s, international organizations and developed countries have allocated significant resources for the environmental sector in Brazil. In 1992 environmental projects worth about US$6.8 million were identified, with US$2.6 in counterpart funds (funds provided by the Brazilian government). More than 70% of the total value was for sanitation, urban pollution control, and other urban environmental projects. Thus, the allocation of resources did not accord with the common belief that funding was influenced unduly by alarmist views on deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nAmong the specific environmental projects with international support, the most important was the National Environmental Plan (Plano Nacional do Meio Ambiente\u2014PNMA), which received a US$117 million loan from the World Bank. The National Environmental Fund (Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente\u2014FNMA), in addition to budgetary funds, received US$20 million from the Inter-American Development Bank to finance the environmental activities of NGOs and small municipal governments. The Pilot Program for the Conservation of the Brazilian Rain Forests (Programa Piloto para a Prote\u00e7\u00e3o das Florestas Tropicais do Brasil\u2014PPG-7) was supported by the world's seven richest countries (the so-called G-7) and the European Community, which allocated US$258 million for projects in the Amazon and Atlantic Forest regions. The Global Environment Facility (GEF), created in 1990, set aside US$30 million for Brazil, part of which is managed by a national fund called Funbio. GEF also established a small grants program for NGOs, which focused on the cerrado during its pilot phase. The World Bank also made loans for environmental and natural resource management in Rond\u00f4nia and Mato Grosso, in part to correct environmental and social problems that had been created by the World Bank-funded development of the northwest corridor in the 1980s.\n\nDespite favorable laws, promising institutional arrangements, and external funding, the government has not, on the whole, been effective in controlling damage to the environment. This failure is only in small measure because of the opposition of anti-environmental groups. In greater part, it can be attributed to the traditional separation between official rhetoric and actual practice in Brazil. It is also related to general problems of governance, fiscal crisis, and lingering doubts about appropriate tradeoffs between the environment and development. Some of the most effective governmental action in the environmental area has occurred at the state and local levels in the most developed states and has involved NGOs. In 1994 the PNMA began to stress decentralization and strengthening of state environmental agencies, a tendency that subsequently gained momentum.\n\n'''Environment - current issues:'''\n[[Deforestation]] in Amazon Basin destroys the habitat and endangers the existence of a multitude of plant and animal species indigenous to the area; there is a lucrative illegal wildlife trade; air and water pollution in [[Rio de Janeiro]], S\u00e3o Paulo, and several other large cities; land degradation and water pollution caused by improper mining activities; wetland degradation; severe oil spills\n<br>''note:''\nPresident [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso|Cardoso]] in September 1999 signed into force an environmental crime bill which for the first time defines [[pollution]] and deforestation as crimes punishable by stiff fines and jail sentences\n\n'''Environment - international agreements:'''\n<br>''party to:''\nAntarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Seals, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-[[Kyoto Protocol]], Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling\n<br>''signed, but not ratified:''\nnone of selected agreements\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{loc}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/807 Brazil] - from 1565 {{en icon}}\n* [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/1074 Brazil: of the Noble Class, of Loves, and of Letters\u2026] a map from around 1640 {{la icon}} {{en icon}}\n\n{{Brazil topics}}\n{{Geography of South America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Brazil}}\n[[Category:Geography of Brazil| ]]", "sha1": "2131fbo6qe3tf2gihtjewjxce6voku1"}}, {"title": "Politics of Brazil", "ns": "0", "id": "3633", "revision": {"id": "863919610", "parentid": "851594824", "timestamp": "2018-10-13T23:22:46Z", "contributor": {"ip": "186.223.247.239"}, "comment": "/* States */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Update|reason=Has no information on the government since 2010|date=May 2017}}\n\n{{Politics of Brazil}}\nThe '''politics of Brazil''' take place in a framework of a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Brazil|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. The political and administrative organization of [[Brazil]] comprises the [[Federal government of Brazil|federal government]], the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and a [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]], and the [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]].\n\nThe federal government exercises control over the [[central government]] and is divided into three independent branches: executive, legislative and judicial. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the President, advised by a [[Cabinet of Brazil|cabinet]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested upon the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], a two-chamber legislature comprising the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]. [[Judicial power]] is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Federal Court]], the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]] and other [[Federal courts of Brazil|Superior Courts]], the [[National Justice Council]] and the [[Regional Federal Courts]].\n\nThe states are [[Autonomy|autonomous]] [[Administrative division|sub-national entities]] with their own governments that, together with the other federal units, form the Federative Republic of Brazil. Currently, Brazil is divided politically and administratively into 27 federal units, being 26 states and one federal district. The executive power is exercised by a [[governor]] elected to a four-year term. The judiciary is exercised by courts of first and second instance addressing the common justice. Each State has a unicameral [[legislature]] with deputies who vote on state laws. The Constitution of Brazil knows also two elements of [[direct democracy]], stated in Article 14.<ref name=\"DD-Navi\">{{en icon}} Navigator to Direct Democracy [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120035432/http://direct-democracy-navigator.org/countries/brazil/legal_designs \"Scientific overview of direct democracy procedures in Brazil\"]</ref> The legislative assemblies supervise the activities of the Executive power of the states and municipalities.\n\nThe [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] are minor federal units of the Federative Republic of Brazil. Each municipality has an autonomous [[local government]], comprising a [[mayor]], directly elected by the people to a four-year term, and a legislative body, also directly elected by the people.\n\nDue to a mix of [[proportional voting]] (the only [[first-past-the-post]] elections are for the 1/3 of senate seats every 8 years and for mayors in small and medium-sized cities every 4 years), the lack of [[election threshold]] and the cultural aspects of [[Latin America]]n ''[[caudillismo]]''-''[[coronelismo]]'', party politics in Brazil tends to be highly fragmented.

It was monarchic, hereditary, and highly centralized, permitting suffrage only to property-holders.\n* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1891]] \u2013 the republic was proclaimed in 1889, but a new constitution was not promulgated until 1891. This federalist, democratic constitution was heavily influenced by the [[United States|U.S.]] model. However, women and illiterates were not permitted to vote.\n* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1934]] \u2013 when [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] came to power in 1930, he canceled the 1891 constitution and did not permit a new one until 1934. The [[Constitutionalist Revolution]] of 1932 forced Vargas to enact a new democratic constitution that permitted women's suffrage. Get\u00falio Vargas was indirectly elected president by the Constitutional Assembly to a four-year term, beginning in 1933.\n* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1937]] \u2013 Get\u00falio Vargas suppressed a Communist uprising in 1935 and two years later (November 10, 1937) used it as a pretext to establish autocratic rule. He instituted a corporatist constitution nicknamed ''the Polish,'' (because it was said to have been inspired by a Polish constitution), written by [[Francisco Campos (lawyer)|Francisco Campos]].\n* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1946]] \u2013 in October, 1945, with World War II over, a civil-military coup ousted dictatorial Get\u00falio Vargas, an Assembly wrote a democratic constitution.\n* [[History of the Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1967]] \u2013 after the 1964 coup d'\u00c9tat against [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]], the military dictatorship passed the ''Institutional Acts'', a supraconstitutional law. This strongly undemocratic constitution simply incorporated these Acts.\n* [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1988]] \u2013 the progressive redemocratization culminated in the current constitution. Very democratic, it is more expansive than a typical constitution \u2013 many statutory acts in other countries are written into this constitution, like Social Security and taxes.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{Main|List of political parties in Brazil}}\n[[File:Congresso brasileiro.jpg|thumb|right|[[National Congress of Brazil]], the national [[legislature]] and the only in [[bicameral]] format.]]\n[[File:Palacio do Planalto.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto]], the seat of the [[executive power]].]]\nAccording to sociologist Marcelo Ridenti, Brazilian politics is divided between internationalist [[liberalism|liberal]]s and [[Statism|statist]] nationalists.<ref name=\"Barr\">{{pt icon}} Barros, Ana Cl\u00e1udia.

Senate]'''\n\n==Government==\n\n===Federal government===\n{{Main|Federal government of Brazil}}\n\n[[Image:Chamber of Deputies of Brazil 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]], the [[lower house]].]]\n[[Image:2030JC012.jpg|thumb|[[Federal Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]], the [[upper house]].]]\n\nBrazil is a [[Federalism|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] constitutional republic, based on [[representative democracy]]. The federal government has three independent [[Separation of powers|branches]]: executive, legislative, and judicial. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the executive branch, headed by the [[President of Brazil|President]], advised by a [[Cabinet of Brazil|Cabinet]]. The President is both the [[head of state]] and the [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested upon the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]], a two-chamber legislature comprising the [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]. [[Judicial power]] is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Federal Court]], the [[Superior Court of Justice (Brazil)|Superior Court of Justice]] and other [[Federal courts of Brazil|Superior Courts]], the [[National Justice Council]] and the [[Regional Federal Courts]].\n\n===States===\n{{Main|States of Brazil}}\n\n[[Image:Rio-PalacioTiradentes.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro]] holds the legislature of [[Rio de Janeiro]] state.]]\n[[Image:Cidade Administrativa MG 1.jpg|thumb|[[Pal\u00e1cio Tiradentes]] holds the executive power of [[Minas Gerais]] state.]]\n\nThe 26 Brazilian ''states'' are semi-autonomous self-governing entities organized with complete administration branches, relative financial independence and their own set of symbols, similar to those owned by the country itself. Despite their relative autonomy they all have the same model of administration, as set by the Federal Constitution.\n\nStates hold elections every four years and exercise a considerable amount of power. The 1988 constitution allows states to keep their own taxes, set up [[State Senator (Brazil)|State Houses]], and mandates regular allocation of a share of the taxes collected locally by the federal government.\n\nThe Executive role is held by the ''Governador'' (Governor) and his appointed ''Secret\u00e1rios'' (Secretaries); the Legislative role is held by the ''Assembl\u00e9ia Legislativa'' (Legislative Assembly); and the Judiciary role, by the ''Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a'' (Justice Tribunal). The governors and the members of the assemblies are elected, but the members of the Judiciary are appointed by the governor from a list provided by the current members of the State Law Court containing only judges (these are chosen by merit in exams open to anyone with a Law degree). The name chosen by the governor must be approved by the Assembly before inauguration. The 1988 Constitution has granted the states the greatest amount of autonomy since the Old Republic.\n\nEach of the 26 state governors must achieve more than 50% of the vote, including a second round run-off between the top two candidates if necessary. In contrast to the federal level, state legislatures are unicameral, although the deputies are elected through similar means, involving an open-list system in which the state serves as one constituency. State level elections occur at the same time as those for the presidency and Congress. In 2002, candidates from eight different parties won the gubernatorial contest while 28 parties are represented in the country's state legislatures. The last set of elections took place in 2006.\n\n===Municipalities===\n{{Main|Municipalities of Brazil}}\n\n[[Image:Vista do Pal\u00e1cio Anchieta.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Municipal Chamber of S\u00e3o Paulo]], the municipal legislature of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] city.]]\n[[Image:Pal\u00e1cio do Anhangaba\u00fa (Ed. Matarazzo) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Pal\u00e1cio do Anhangaba\u00fa]] holds the municipal executive power of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\nBrazil has no clear distinction between ''towns'' and ''cities'' (in effect, the Portuguese word ''cidade'' means both). The only possible difference is regarding the municipalities that have a court of first instance and those that do not. The former are called ''Sedes de Comarca'' (seats of a ''comarca'', which is the territory under the rule of that court). Other than that, only size and importance differs one from another.\n\nThe municipality (''munic\u00edpio'') is a territory comprising one urban area, the ''sede'' (seat), from which it takes the name, and several other minor urban or rural areas, the ''distritos'' (districts). The seat of a municipality must be the most populous urban area within it; when another urban area grows too much it usually splits from the original municipality to form another one.\n\nA municipality is relatively autonomous: it enacts its own \"constitution\", which is called ''organic law'' (''Lei Org\u00e2nica''), and it is allowed to collect taxes and fees, to maintain a municipal police force (albeit with very restricted powers), to pass laws on any matter that do not contradict either the state or the national constitutions, and to create symbols for itself (like a flag, an anthem and a coat-of-arms). However, not all municipalities exercise all of this autonomy. For instance, only a few municipalities keep local police forces, some of them do not collect some taxes (to attract investors or residents) and many of them do not have a flag (although they are all required to have a coat-of-arms).\n\nMunicipalities are governed by an elected ''prefeito'' ([[Mayor]]) and a unicameral ''C\u00e2mara de Vereadores'' (Councillors' Chamber). In municipalities with more than 200,000 voters, the Mayor must be elected by more than 50% of the valid vote. The executive power is called ''Prefeitura''.\n\nBrazilian municipalities can vary widely in area and population. The municipality of [[Altamira, Brazil|Altamira]], in the State of [[Par\u00e1]], with 161,445.9 square kilometres of area, is larger than many countries in the world. Several Brazilian municipalities have over 1,000,000 inhabitants, with S\u00e3o Paulo, at more than 9,000,000, being the most populous.\n\nUntil 1974 Brazil had one state-level municipality, the [[State of Guanabara]], now merged with [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|the State of Rio de Janeiro]], which comprised [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|the city of Rio de Janeiro]] solely.\n\n===The Federal District===\n{{Main|Federal District (Brazil)}}\n\n[[File:C\u00e2mara Legislativa do Distrito Federal 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Legislative Chamber of the Federal District (Brazil)|Legislative Chamber of the Federal District]].]]\nThe Federal District is an anomalous unit of the federation, as it is not organized in the same manner as a municipality, does not possess the same autonomy as a state (though usually ranked among them), and is closely related to the central power.\n\nIt is considered a single and indivisible entity, constituted by the seat, [[Bras\u00edlia]] and some [[Satellite town|of the satellite cities]]. Bras\u00edlia and the satellite cities are governed by the [[Regional Administrator]]s individually and as a whole are governed by the Governor of the Federal District.\n\n==History==\nThroughout its history, Brazil has struggled to build a [[democracy|democratic]] and egalitarian society because of its origins as a [[plantation]] colony and the strong influence of slavery.\n<!--Don't enlarge it too much... Leave details to the history series -->\n\n===Empire===\n{{Main|Empire of Brazil}}\nIn 1822 the [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara]], son of King [[John VI of Portugal]], proclaimed independence. He was the first Emperor (Pedro I) until his abdication in 1831 in favor of his elder son. Due to the son's age (five years) a regency was established and the country had its first elections, though [[censitary vote|vote]] was still restricted to a minority of the population.\n\n===Old Republic (1889\u20131930) ===\n{{Main|First Brazilian Republic}}\nIn 1889, Marshal [[Deodoro da Fonseca]] declared the republic, by a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Until 1930, Brazilian republic was formally a democracy, although the power was concentrated in the hands of powerful land owners.\n\n===Vargas years (1930\u20131945) ===\n{{Main|Vargas Era}}\nIn 1930, a bloodless [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] led [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] to power. For about 15 years, he controlled the country's politics, with a brief three-year constitutional interregnum from 1934 to 1937. A longer, heavier regime, the ''Estado Novo'' had loose ties with European [[fascism]] and spanned the years 1938 to 1945.\n\n===Populist years (1946\u20131964) ===\n{{Main|Second Brazilian Republic}}\nLike most of Latin America, Brazil experienced times of political instability after the Second World War. When Vargas was ousted from the presidency in another bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat, in 1945, a new and modern constitution was passed and the country had its first experience with an effective and widespread democracy. But the mounting tension between populist politicians (like Vargas himself and, later, [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]]) and the right led to a crisis that ultimately brought up the military coup d'\u00e9tat in 1964, now known, through declassified documents, to have been supported by the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Brazil Marks 40th Anniversary of Military Coup|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB118/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Military dictatorship (1964\u20131985)===\n{{Main|Brazilian military government}}\nIn 1964 a military-led coup d'\u00e9tat deposed the democratically elected president of Brazil, [[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]]. Between 1964 and 1985, Brazil was governed by the military, with a [[two-party system]] that comprised a pro-government [[National Renewal Alliance Party]] (ARENA) and an opposition [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] (MDB). Thousands of politicians (including former president [[Juscelino Kubitschek]]) had their political rights suspended, and military-sanctioned indirect elections were held for most elected positions until political liberalization during the government of [[Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo]].\n\n===New Republic (1985\u20131990)===\n{{Main|Jos\u00e9 Sarney|History of Brazil since 1985}}\nIn 1985, the military were defeated in an election according to the scheme they had set up as a consequence of the loss of political support among the elites. The opposition candidate, [[Tancredo Neves]], was elected President, but died of natural causes before he was able to take office. Fearing a political vacuum that might stifle the democratic effort, Neves' supporters urged vice-president, [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]] to take the oath and govern the country. Tancredo Neves had said that his election and the demise of military r\u00e9gime would create a \"New Republic\" and Sarney's term of government is often referred to by this name.\n\nSarney's government was disastrous in almost every field. The ongoing [[recession]] and the soaring [[external debt]] drained the country's assets while ravaging [[inflation]] (which later turned into [[hyperinflation]]) demonetized the currency and prevented any stability. In an attempt to revolutionize the economy and defeat inflation, Sarney carried on an ambitious \"heterodox\" economic plan ([[Cruzado]]) in 1986, which included price controls, default on the external debts and reduction of salaries. The plan seemed successful for some months, but it soon caused wholesale shortages of consumer goods (especially of easily exportable goods like meat, milk, automobiles, grains, sugar and alcohol) and the appearance of a black market in which such goods were sold for higher prices. Buoyed by the ensuing popularity from the apparent success of the plan, Sarney secured the largest electoral win in Brazilian history; the party he had just joined, [[Brazilian Democratic Movement|Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]] (PMDB), won in 26 out of 27 states and in more than 3,000 municipalities. Just after the elections, Sarney's \"corrections\" to the economy failed to control inflation and the public perception that he had used an artificial control of inflation to win the elections proved to be his undoing. His popularity never recovered and he was plagued by vehement criticism from most sectors of society until the end of his term. Despite popular rejection, Sarney managed to extend his term from four to five years, and exerted pressure on the Constitutional Assembly that was drafting the new constitution to abort the adoption of [[Parliamentarism]].\n\n===Collor government (1990\u20131992)===\n{{Main|Fernando Collor de Mello}}\nIn 1989 Fernando Collor de Mello was elected president for the term from 1990\u20131994. The elections were marked by unanimous condemnation of [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]], with all candidates trying to keep distance from him.\n\nCollor made some very bold statements, like saying that the Brazilian industry (of which the Brazilians used to be very proud) was mostly obsolete and polluting or that defaulting the debt was equal to not paying the rent. He also took quite revolutionary measures, like reducing the number of ministries to only 12 and naming [[Z\u00e9lia Cardoso de Mello]] Minister of Economy or removing existing barriers to importing of goods.\n\nHis inflation control plan was based on an attempt to control prices and a complicated currency conversion process that prevented people from cashing their bank accounts for 18 months.\n\nAll of this made him quite unpopular and denied him support in the parliament that he needed since his own party held few seats. At the beginning of his third year in office, he resigned as a result of in a huge corruption scandal. The charges against him would later be dropped, some on mere technicalities, some for actually being irrelevant or false.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nCollor desperately tried to resist [[impeachment]] by rallying the support of the youth and of the lower classes, but his call for help was answered by massive popular demonstrations, led mostly by students, demanding his resignation.\n\n===Itamar government (1992\u20131994)===\n{{Main|Itamar Franco}}\nIn 1992, the vice-president, Itamar Franco, took office as president and managed to evade the most feared consequences of Collor's downfall. He had to face a country with hyper-inflation, high levels of misery and unemployment. Far-left organizations were trying to turn the anti-Collor campaign into a wider revolutionary fight to overthrow the regime. Itamar finally granted full powers to his Minister of Economy, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, so the minister could launch the [[Plano Real]], a new economic plan that seemed to be just the same as the many unsuccessful plans launched by Sarney, Collor and their military predecessor. But the Real was a success, and terminated inflation in a few months.\n\n===FHC government (1995\u20132003)===\n{{Main|Fernando Henrique Cardoso}}\nIn 1994, Cardoso launched his [[Plano Real]], a successful economic reform that managed to permanently rid the country of the excessive inflation that had plagued it for more than forty years. The plan consisted of replacing the discredited old currency ([[Brazilian cruzeiro|cruzeiro]] and [[Brazilian cruzeiro real|cruzeiro real]]) and pegging its value temporarily to the United States dollar. Inflation \u2013 which had become a fact of Brazilian life \u2013 was cut dramatically, a change that the Brazilians took years to get used to. Because of the success of Plano Real, Cardoso was chosen by his party to run for president and, with the strong support of Franco, eventually won, beating [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]], who had emerged as the favorite only one year earlier.\n\nCardoso's term was marked by other major changes in Brazilian politics and economy. Public services and state-owned companies were [[privatization|privatized]] (some for values supposedly too cheap according to his adversaries), the strong [[Brazilian real|real]] made it easy to import goods, forcing Brazilian industry to modernize and compete (which had the side effect of causing many of them to be bought by foreign companies). During his first term, a constitutional amendment was passed to enable a sitting Executive chief to run for re-election, after which he again beat Lula in 1998.\n\n===Lula government (2003\u20132011)===\n[[Image:Brazilian cabinet meeting.jpg|thumb|right|Meeting of the Cabinet of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in the Oval Room, Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, 2007]]\n{{Main|Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva}}\n\nIn 2002, at his fourth attempt, Lula was elected president. In part his victory was derived from the considerable unpopularity of Cardoso's second term, which failed to decrease the economic inequality, and in part from a softening of his and the party's radical stance, including a vice-presidential candidate from the [[Liberal Party (Brazil)|Liberal Party]], acceptance of an [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) accord agreed to by the previous government and a line of discourse friendly to the financial markets.\n\nDespite some achievements in solving part of the country's biggest problems, his term was plagued by multiple corruption scandals that rocked his cabinet, forcing some members to resign their posts.\n\nIn 2006 Lula regained part of his popularity and ran for re-election. After almost winning on the first round, he won the run-off against [[Geraldo Alckmin]] from the [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB), by a margin of 20 million votes.\n\nIn 2010, Lula's handpicked successor, [[Dilma Rousseff|Dilma]], was elected to the Presidency.\n\n==International organization participation==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[African Development Bank]]\n*[[Customs Cooperation Council]]\n*[[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]]\n*[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]\n*[[Group of 11]]\n*[[Group of 15]]\n*[[Group of 19]]\n*[[Group of 24]]\n*[[Group of 77]]\n*[[Inter-American Development Bank]]\n*[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]\n*International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ([[World Bank]])\n*[[International Civil Aviation Organization]]\n*[[International Chamber of Commerce]]\n*[[International Criminal Court]]\n*[[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]\n*[[International Development Association]]\n*[[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]\n*[[International Finance Corporation]]\n*[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]]\n*[[International Hydrographic Organization]]\n*[[International Labour Organization]]\n*[[International Monetary Fund]]\n*[[International Maritime Organization]]\n*[[Inmarsat]]\n*[[International Telecommunications Satellite Organization]]\n*[[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]]\n*[[International Olympic Committee]]\n*[[International Organization for Migration]] (observer)\n*[[International Organization for Standardization]]\n*[[International Telecommunication Union]]\n*[[International Trade Union Confederation]]\n*[[Latin American Economic System]]\n*[[Asociaci\u00f3n Latinoamericana de Integraci\u00f3n]]\n*[[Mercosur]], [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (observer)\n*[[Nuclear Suppliers Group]]\n*[[Organization of American States]]\n*[[Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean]]\n*[[Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]]\n*[[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]\n*[[Rio Group]]\n*[[United Nations]]\n*[[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]\n*[[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]]\n*[[Union of South American Nations]]\n*[[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]\n*[[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]\n*[[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka]]\n*[[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]]\n*[[United Nations University]]\n*[[Universal Postal Union]]\n*[[World Federation of Trade Unions]]\n*[[World Health Organization]]\n*[[World Intellectual Property Organization]]\n*[[World Meteorological Organization]]\n*[[World Tourism Organization]]\n*[[World Trade Organization]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Brazil topics}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.is/20130414194957/http://report.globalintegrity.org/brazil Global Integrity Report: Brazil] Reports on anti-corruption efforts.\n* [http://observingbrazil.com] Reports on political culture and political news, with a focus on transparency and good government.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100308062529/http://brazilinfocus.com/] Essays on Brazilian politics and policies by leading intellectuals and public figures.\n* [http://geostadia.com] Reports on the politics and issues surrounding Brazilian soccer and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\n==Further reading==\n* Goertzel, Ted and Paulo Roberto Almeida, ''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NZBPX8A The Drama of Brazilian Politics from Dom Jo\u00e3o to Marina Silva]'' Amazon Digital Services. {{ISBN|978-1-4951-2981-0}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Brazil}}\n[[Category:Politics of Brazil| ]]", "sha1": "379smk0tjc6b6t9ugb22k1lcu63ol11"}}, {"title": "Economy of Brazil", "ns": "0", "id": "3634", "revision": {"id": "866498076", "parentid": "866043760", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T18:14:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Archon 2488", "id": "7646666"}, "minor": "", "comment": "rm quotemark", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use American English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox economy\n|country         = Brazil\n|image           = MarginalPinheiros.jpg\n|image_size      = 300px\n|caption         = [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the [[Financial centre|financial capital]] of Brazil\n|currency        = [[Brazilian real]] (BRL) = 0.258 [[USD]]  \n|year            = 1 January \u2013 31 December  \n|organs          = [[Union of South American Nations|Unasul]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Mercosur]], [[G-20 major economies|G-20]] and others\n|gdp             = $2.138&nbsp;trillion (nominal;

From Portugal's [[Colonial Brazil|colonization of Brazil]] (1500\u20131822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the production of [[primary products]] for [[export]]s. In the [[Portuguese Empire]], Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial [[mercantile]] policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles \u2013 sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African [[slave labor]] until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period Brazil was also the colony with the largest amount of European settlers, most of them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see [[Dutch Brazil]]), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish and Sephardic [[Brazilian Jews|Jews]]. Since then, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe, mainly from [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portugal]] (including the Azores and Madeira), [[Italian Brazilian|Italy]], [[Spanish Brazilian|Spain]], [[German Brazilian|Germany]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poland]], [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukraine]], [[Swiss Brazilian|Switzerland]], [[Austrian Brazilian|Austria]] and Russia. Smaller numbers of immigrants also came from the [[Dutch Brazilian|Netherlands]], [[French Brazilian|France]], [[Finnish Brazilian|Finland]], [[Icelandic Brazilian|Iceland]] and the [[Scandinavian Brazilian|Scandinavian]] countries, [[Lithuanians in Brazil|Lithuania]], [[Belgian Brazilian|Belgium]], [[Bulgarian Brazilian|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Hungary]], [[Greek Brazilian|Greece]], [[Latvian Brazilian|Latvia]], [[English Brazilian|England]], [[Irish Brazilian|Ireland]], [[Scottish Brazilian|Scotland]], [[Croat Brazilian|Croatia]], [[Czech Brazilian|Czech Republic]], [[Maltese Brazilian|Malta]], [[Macedonians in Brazil|Macedonia]] and [[Luxembourg Brazilian|Luxembourg]], the [[Arab Brazilian|Middle East]] (mainly from [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanon]], [[Syrian Brazilian|Syria]] and [[Armenian Brazilian|Armenia]]), Japan, the [[Confederados|United States]] and [[Afrikaners|South Africa]], until the 1930s. In the New World, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, Paraguay, Puerto Rico and Peru (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazil's case, statistics showed that 4.5&nbsp; million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.\n\nIn 2007, with a population of over 209 million and abundant natural resources, Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5&nbsp; million television sets, and 3&nbsp; million refrigerators. In addition, about 70&nbsp; million cubic meters of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundreds of petrochemicals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://countryeconomy.com/demography/population/brazil|title=Brazil - Population 2017|work=countryeconomy.com|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en}}</ref> <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBrazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads, more than 150 <ref>http://www2.aneel.gov.br/aplicacoes/capacidadebrasil/capacidadebrasil.cfm</ref>Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity and its real per capita GDP surpassed US$9,800 in 2017  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://knoema.com/atlas/Brazil/GDP-per-capita|title=Brazil GDP per capita, 1980-2017 - knoema.com|work=Knoema|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />.

The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Economic status ==\n\n{| width=\"23%\" style=\"toc: 25em; font-size: 85%; lucida grande, sans-serif; text-align: left;\" class=\"infobox\"\n|-\n!align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" colspan=\"2\"|<big>Statistical Table</big>\n|-\n!align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" colspan=\"2\"|Inflation (IPCA)\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2002\n|valign=\"top\"| 12.53%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2003\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 9.30%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2004\n|valign=\"top\"|7.60%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2005\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 5.69%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2006\n|valign=\"top\"| 3.14%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2007\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 4.46%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2008\n|valign=\"top\"| 5.91%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2009\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 4.31%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2010\n|valign=\"top\"| 5.90%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2011\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 6.50%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2012\n|valign=\"top\"| 5.84%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2013\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 5.91%\n|-\n!2014\n!6.41%\n|-\n!2015\n!10.67%\n|-\n!2016\n!6.29%\n|-\n!2017\n!2.95%\n|-\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\"|<small>Source:<ref>[http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/ Inflation] Ipea</ref></small>\n|-\n!align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightblue\" colspan=\"2\"|Average GDP growth rate 1950\u20132013\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1950\u201359\n|valign=\"top\"| 7.1%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1960\u201369\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 6.1%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1970\u201379\n|valign=\"top\"| 8.9%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1980\u201389\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 3.0%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|1990\u201399\n|valign=\"top\"| 1.7%\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2000\u201309\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" valign=\"top\"| 3.3%\n|-\n!align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2010\u201317\n|valign=\"top\"| 1.4%\n|-\n!align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" colspan=\"2\"|<small>Source:<ref>[http://www.ipeadata.gov.br/ Average Exchange Rate] Ipea</ref></small>\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Sustainable growth ===\nPortuguese explorers arrived in 1500, but it was only in 1808 that Brazil obtained a permit from the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial government]] to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil became the  eighth largest economy in the world. Originally, its exports were basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84% of exports are of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.\n\nThe period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fagoyinbo|first1=Joseph Babatunde|title=The Armed Forces: Instrument of Peace, Strength, Development and Prosperity|publisher=Author House|isbn=9781477218440|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUdHBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA209|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3%. [[Agribusiness]] (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47% or 3.6% per year, was the most dynamic sector \u2013 even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Sustainable growth] Brazilian Government.

Retrieved on 24 October 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Control and reform ===\nAmong measures recently adopted to [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its social security (state and retirement pensions) and tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating \"windows of opportunity\" for local and international investors and producers.\n\nWith these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesn't import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a [[liquidity crisis]]. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Control and reform] Brazilian Government.

Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on manufactured products tax (IPI), and the investment of $8&nbsp;billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.\n\nThe policy for industry, technology and foreign trade, at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5&nbsp;billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.<ref>[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Consistent policies] Brazilian government.

In Brazil, until 1999, the three Armed Forces remained in independent ministries. However, the quarrel over the creation of a single Ministry of Defense, integrating the Navy, the Army and the Aeronautics is old. The 1946 Constitution already cited the creation of just one Ministry, that resulted in the institution of the E.M.F.A, at the time called General staff. Ex-President of the Republic [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]], defended the thesis of the creation of a Ministry of the Defense. It signed Decree 200, of 25 February 1967, that the Ministry of the Armed Forces foresaw the promotion of studies to elaborate the law project creating. However, the proposal was abandoned. During the Constitutional conventional of 1988, the subject came back to the quarrel and one more time it was filed. Finally in 1992, President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], then candidate to the Presidency, declared that in its plan of government the quarrel for creation of the Ministry of Defense was foreseen.\n\nThe President of the Republic still intended to create a Ministry in his first term. The idea was to optimize the system of national defense, to legalize one politics of sustainable defense and to integrate the three Forces, rationalizing their activities. But only on 10 June 1999, the Ministry of the Defense was officially created, the General staff of the Armed Forces abolished and the [[Aeronautic]]s , Army, and Navy Ministries had been transformed into Service Commands. During the years of 1995/96 the EMFA, responsible for the studies on the Ministry of Defense, evidenced that, amongst 179 countries, only 23 did not have integrated Armed Forces. Of these 23, only three, amongst them Brazil, had dimensions politics to justify its creation, as for example, territorial extension and trained and structuralized Armed Forces. The Ministries of Defense of Germany, Argentina, Chile, Spain, USA, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal had been chosen for deepened analysis because they had some type of identification with Brazil, as territorial extension, population, cash of the Armed Forces, amongst others.\n\nTo give continuity to the creation studies, President Fernando Henrique created the Inter-ministerial Work group that defined the lines of direction for implantation of the Ministry of Defense. Reelected, he nominated senator \u00c9lcio \u00c1lvares, Extraordinary minister of the Defense, on 1 January 1999. The former [[Senate of Brazil|senator]] was the responsible one for the implementation of the agency. The three services are separate from each other, except in three areas: the Armed Forces General Staff (Estado-Maior das For\u00e7as Armadas-EMFA), the National Defense Council (Conselho de Defesa Nacional-CDN), and the Armed Forces High Command (Alto Comando das For\u00e7as Armadas-ACFA). The EMFA, which is involved in planning and coordination, interprets interservice views about policy and comes the closest to functioning as a ministry of defense. It is headed by a four-star general, and the chair rotates among the services. The ACFA is involved with more immediate, day-to-day problems. It is composed of the ministers of the three services, their chiefs of staff, and the EMFA chief.\n\nAccording to Article 91 of the constitution, the CDN is \"the consultative body of the president of the republic in matters related to national sovereignty and the defense of the democratic state.\" The members of the CDN are the president, the vice president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the president of the Senate, the minister of justice, military ministers, the minister of foreign affairs, and the minister of planning. The CDN has authority to \"express an opinion in instances of declaration of war and the celebration of peace\" and to \"express an opinion on the decreeing of a [[state of emergency]], [[state of siege]], or [[federal intervention]].\" In addition, the CDN is authorized to \"propose the criteria and conditions for the use of areas that are vital to the security of the national territory and express an opinion on their continued use, especially in the strip along the borders, and on matters related to the conservation and exploitation of natural resources of any kind.\" The CDN also may \"study, propose, and monitor the progress of initiatives necessary to guarantee national independence and the defense of the democratic state.\"\n\nThe highest level consultative body available to the president is the [[Council of the Republic (Brazil)|Council of the Republic]] (Conselho da Rep\u00fablica). This body does not include any military minister or officer, although the president may call on a military minister to participate if the matter is related to the respective ministry's agenda. According to Article 89 of the constitution, the Council of the Republic has authority to make declarations of federal intervention, a state of emergency, and a state of siege (all security-related issues).<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/mod.htm About Ministry of Defense of Brazil]</ref>\n\n==Joint Staff of the Armed Forces==\n\nJoint Staff of the Armed Forces is an agency of the Ministry of Defense of Brazil, which centralizes the coordination of command of the armed forces: Army, Navy and Air Force. It was created by Complementary Law No. 136 of 25 August 2010, and has in Ordinance No. 1429 its operating guidelines.\n\nAdvising the Minister of Defense in the upper direction of the armed forces, aiming the organization, preparation and employment, in order to fulfill its constitutional mission and its subsidiaries assignments, with the goals strategic planning and the joint use of the military services.\n\nIt is up to JSAF plan together and integrated employment of staff of the Navy, Army and Air Force, optimizing the use of the military and logistical support in the defense of the country and in peacekeeping, humanitarian and rescue operations; border security; and civil defense actions.\n\nThe body has its powers and duties according to the Regimental Structure approved by Decree 7.9744, April 1, 2013.\n\nSince its inception, the JSAF has worked with the Central Administration of the Ministry of Defence, on the Esplanade of Ministries in Brasilia (DF).\n\nThe head of the JSAF is private of a general officer of the last post, active or reserve, designated by the Ministry of Defence and appointed by the president. Their hierarchical level is the same of the military commanders of the Navy, Army and Air Force.\n\nUnder the coordination of the Joint Armed Forces also operates the Committee of Chiefs of Staffs of the military services.\n\nThe current head of JSAF is Admiral-of-Fleet Ademir Sobrinho.\n\n==Brazilian Army==\n{{Main article|Brazilian Army}}\n\n[[File:General_Eduardo_Dias_da_Costa_Villas_B\u00f4as.jpg|thumb|left|250px|General Eduardo Villas B\u00f4as current commander of the Brazilian Army.]]\nAs in most South American nations, the Brazilian Army ({{lang-pt|Ex\u00e9rcito Brasileiro}}, {{IPA-pt|\u025b\u02c8z\u025b\u0281situ b\u027eazi\u02c8lej\u027eu|}}) has been the most influential of the services because of its size, deployment, and historical development. Not only did senior army generals occupy the presidency from 1964 until 1985, but most of the officers who held cabinet posts during that time were from the army. In 1997 the army totaled 200,000 members. Brazil's army has strict up-or-out retirement rules, which were developed in the mid-1960s by President [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]]. The internal command structure determines all promotions through the rank of colonel. The president is involved in the promotions to general and chooses one candidate from a list of three names presented to him by the High Command. Once passed over, the colonel must retire. All colonels must retire at age fifty-nine; and all four-star generals must retire at age sixty-six, or after 12 years as general.\n\nDespite the up-or-out system, under President [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]] the army became top-heavy as generals began to occupy many positions that previously had been reserved for colonels. In 1991 there were 15 four-star, forty three-star, and 110 two-star generals. The figure for four-star generals did not include four who were ministers in the Superior Military Court (Superior Tribunal Militar-STM). Thus, in the mid-1990s the army sought to reduce the number of active-duty generals. Considering the short conscript tour (usually nine to ten months), the army has a high number of conscripts: 125,000. Because of the need for literate and skilled young men to handle modern weapons, the army has served as a training ground for a large reserve force. Its highly professional officer corps serves as a nucleus around which the trained service would be mobilized if required.\n[[File:Cerim\u00f4nia comemorativa do Dia do Soldado e de Imposi\u00e7\u00e3o das Medalhas do Pacificador (QGEx - SMU) (20259054793).jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian troops on the march.]]\n[[File:Astros 2020 (14174731608).jpg|thumb|right|Artillery of the Brazilian Army in action.]]\n[[File:Selva (26817068505).jpg|thumb|left|Battle in the jungle.]]\n[[File:For\u00e7as especiais, Comandos (26686078166).jpg|thumb|right|Special Commands.]]\n[[File:For\u00e7as especiais, Comandos (26439787810).jpg|thumb|left|Paratroopers.]]\n[[File:Tropas_em_Ros%C3%A1rio_do_Sul_-_RS_(9919100966).jpg|thumb|right|Garrison (driver and shooter) of an armored vehicle.]]\n[[File:For\u00e7as especiais, Comandos (26619292102).jpg|thumb|left|Airborne troops.]]\n[[File:Cavalaria (28698736774).jpg|thumb|right|[[M113 APC]]s row.]]\n[[File:Apronto Operacional (14383079792).jpg|thumb|left|Brazilian Army infantry.]]\n[[File:Blindados em Ros\u00e1rio do Sul - RS (9919079464).jpg|thumb|right|Tanks column of the Brazilian Army.]]\n\nThe noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps is not well developed. NCOs have virtually no autonomy or authority. Emphasis on training and professional development is for officers only. The NCOs account for slightly more than one-third of the total army strength. About half of the NCOs are sergeants, who serve as command links between officers and ranks. Some also serve as middle-level technicians. In the early 1990s, the army began to undergo a generational change. The generals of the early 1990s had been junior officers in the early 1960s and had witnessed the military coup in 1964. Their worldview was shaped and influenced by the [[anticommunism]] of that time. These generals were being replaced by colonels who had entered the army in the early 1970s and whose view of the world had been shaped less by [[ideology]] and more by [[pragmatism]]. The United States, particularly through its counterinsurgency doctrines of the early 1960s, was more influential with the older group of [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]s.\n\nThe Army General Staff (Estado-Maior do Ex\u00e9rcito-EME) directs training and operations. The EME has expanded from four sections in 1968 to 15 sections in 1994. It is headed by the EME chief, except in the event of a war. From 1946 through 1985, the army was divided into four numbered armies: the First Army was centered in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Second Army in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the Third Army in [[Porto Alegre]], and the Fourth Army in [[Recife]]. Historically, the First Army was the most politically significant because of Rio de Janeiro's position as the nation's capital through the 1950s. The Third Army was also important because of its shared border with [[Argentina]] (Brazil's traditional rival in Latin America) and [[Uruguay]]. In 1964, for example, close to two-thirds of the Brazilian troops were in the Third Army, and somewhat fewer than one-third were in the First Army. The rest were sprinkled throughout the Second and Fourth Armies. The Planalto Military Command (Comando Militar do Planalto-CMP), comprising the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] and [[Goi\u00e1s]] State, and the [[Amazon Military Command]] (Comando Militar da Amaz\u00f4nia-CMA) supplemented the four armies.\n\nOn January 1, 1986, the army was restructured from four numbered armies and two military commands into seven military commands. The major addition was the Western Military Command (Comando Militar do Oeste-CMO), whose territory encompasses the states of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] (previously under the Second Army territory), and [[Rond\u00f4nia]] (previously under the CMA). Each of the seven military commands has its [[headquarter]]s in a major city: Eastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Leste-CML), Rio de Janeiro; Southeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sudeste-CMSE), S\u00e3o Paulo; Southern Military Command (Comando Militar do Sul-CMS), [[Porto Alegre]]; Northeastern Military Command (Comando Militar do Nordeste-CMN), [[Recife]]; CMO, [[Campo Grande]]; CMP, Bras\u00edlia; and CMA, [[Manaus]]. The CMP and CMO are led by major generals (three-star); the other five are headed by full generals (four-star). The army is divided further into 11 military regions. The CMSE is made up of only one state, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and is in charge of protecting the industrial base of the country.\n\nThe changes were instituted as part of a modernisation campaign to make the army better prepared for rapid mobilisation. The reorganization reflected Brazil's geopolitical drive to \"occupy the [[frontier]]\" and the growing importance of Bras\u00edlia, the Amazon, and western Brazil. In 1997 there were major units around [[Bras\u00edlia]], four jungle brigades, and five jungle battalions extending from [[Amap\u00e1]] to [[Mato Grosso do Sul]]. A tour with jungle units is a coveted assignment and is considered career-enhancing. The move to occupy the Amazon and the short-term political implications of the army's reorganisation should not be overstated. The army's geographic organization and distribution have continued to reflect a concern with internal rather than external defense. In what is perhaps an anachronism, the CML in Rio de Janeiro continues to have some of the best troop units and the most modern equipment. Command of the CML is still a coveted assignment, and the Military Village (Vila Militar), Rio de Janeiro's garrison or military community, is still considered one of the most important centers of military influence in the entire country. Principal army schools are located there or nearby. The CML is also important in countering the trafficking of drugs and armaments.\n\nIn a significant political development, the army established a formal High Command in 1964. Before that time, a clique of generals residing in Rio de Janeiro controlled major decisions of the army. Throughout the authoritarian period, tensions often existed between the High Command and the five generals who served as president. This tension was such that President [[Ernesto Geisel|Geisel]] dismissed Minister of Army Sylvio Frota in 1977. Since the January 1986 restructuring, the High Command has been composed of the seven regional commanders, the chief of staff, and the minister of army. The High Command meets to discuss all issues, including those of a political nature, and is responsible for drawing up the list of generals from which the president chooses those who will be promoted to four stars.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/army.htm Brazilian Army]</ref>\n\n==Brazilian Navy==\n{{Main article|Brazilian Navy}}\n[[File:Almirante_Leal_Ferreira.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Admiral Leal Ferreira current commander of the Brazilian Navy.]]\nThe navy ({{lang-pt|Marinha do Brasil}}, {{IPA-pt|hi du b\u027e\u0250\u02c8ziw|}}) traces its heritage to Admiral Cochrane's mercenary fleet and to the tiny Portuguese ships and crews that protected the earliest coastal colonies from seaborne marauders. The navy is the most aristocratic and conservative of the services and draws a larger share of its officers from the upper middle class and upper class. Although it is involved in \"brown-water\" (riverine and coastal) operations, the navy's primary goal has been to become an effective \"blue-water\" navy, able to project power on the high seas. Given its \"blue-water\" bias, the navy is even less inclined to become involved in counterdrug operations than the army or air force.\n\n[[File:Cougar Brazilian Navy (23552980732).jpg|thumb|right|AS532M1 Cougar Naval aviation]]\n[[File:Brazilian Navy McDonnell Douglas AF-1 Skyhawk (A-4KU) Schleiffert-2.jpg|thumb|right| A-4 Skyhawk in Brazilian Navy]]\nThe total naval strength of 64,700 in 1997 included Naval Aviation with 1,300 members, the Marines Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais-CFN with 14,600 members, and only 2,000 conscripts. Naval operations are directed from the Ministry of Navy in Bras\u00edlia through the Navy General Staff (Estado-Maior da Armada-EMA), six naval districts (five oceanic and one riverine), and two naval commands-Bras\u00edlia Naval Command (Comando Naval de Bras\u00edlia-CNB) and Manaus Naval Command (Comando Naval de [[Manaus]]-CNM).\n\nThe 1st Naval District is located at the country's main naval base in Rio de Janeiro; the 2nd Naval District is in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]; the 3rd Naval District is located in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]; the 4th Naval District is located in [[Bel\u00e9m]]; and the 5th Naval District is located in [[Porto Alegre]]. The 6th Riverine District has its headquarters in [[Lad\u00e1rio]], near [[Corumb\u00e1]] on the [[Paraguay River]].\n[[File:US Navy 110422-N-ZI300-115 The Brazilian navy frigate Bosisio (F 48) fires at an unmanned aerial vehicle during a drone exercise (DRONEX) with ship.jpg|thumb|left|Brazilian frigates in shooting exercise.]]\n[[File:S 31 Submarino Tamoio.jpeg|thumb|left|A submarine of the Brazilian Navy leaving for mission.]]\nUntil the 1980s, the flagship of the ocean-going navy was the aircraft carrier ''Minas Gerais'' (the ex-British HMS ''Vengeance''), which has been in service since 1945. Purchased from Britain in 1956, the ''Minas Gerais'' was reconstructed in the Netherlands in 1960 and refitted extensively in Brazil in the late 1970s, and again in 1993. In 1994 M\u00e1rio C\u00e9sar Flores, a former minister of navy, declared in an interview that the navy would be hard-pressed to defend ''Minas Gerais'' in a conflict.\n[[File:Cv Inha\u00fama (V-30).jpg|thumb|right|Corvettes escort.]]\n[[File:HMS Ocean MOD 45151278.jpg|alt=|thumb|Flagship of the Brazil Navy, port helicopters atl\u00e2ntico]]\nWhile the ''Minas Gerais'' was not considered likely to be replaced until the next century, it was nonetheless decommissioned in 2001 following the purchase of the French aircraft carrier ''Foch''. The ''Foch'' upon entering service with the Brazilian Navy, was renamed the ''S\u00e3o Paulo''. It operates A-4KU. As of July 2002, the fate of the ''Minas Gerais'' was still unknown, with China having reportedly made a surprise bid for its purchase.\n\nThe navy's priority re-equipment plans for the 1990s included the receipt of new Inha\u00fama-class corvettes, the construction of Tupi-class submarines, the refurbishing of the Niter\u00f3i-class frigates, the acquisition of nine new Super Lynx and up to six former [[United States Navy]] Sikorsky SH-3G/H Sea King helicopters, the construction of the conventional SNAC-1 [[submarine]] [[prototype]], and the development of nuclear-propulsion technology. In addition, the navy contracted in late 1994 to acquire four Type 22 British Royal Navy frigates and three River-class minesweepers for delivery in the 1995\u201397 period.\n\nAfter years of intense rivalry between the navy and the air force for the control of [[naval aviation]], President Castelo Branco decreed in 1965 that only the air force would be allowed to operate fixed-wing aircraft and that the navy would be responsible for [[helicopter]]s. According to many critics, such an unusual division of labor caused serious command and control problems. The complement of aircraft carried by ''Minas Gerais'' included at one point six Grumman S-2E antisubmarine planes, in addition to several SH-3D Sea King helicopters and A\u00e9rospatiale Super Puma and HB-350 Esquilo helicopters.\n\nIn accordance with the [[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Castelo Branco]] compromise, the S-2E aircraft were flown by air force pilots and the helicopters by navy pilots. A crew of the ''Minas Gerais'' with full air complement consisted of 1,300 officers and enlisted personnel. As of late 2002, the Navy had reportedly become responsible for flying all aircraft with the rivalry having subsided between the two branches of the armed forces.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/brazil/navy.htm Brazilian Navy]</ref>\n\n==Brazilian Air Force==\n{{Main article|Brazilian Air Force}}\nThe Brazilian Air Force ({{lang-pt|For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea Brasileira}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02ccfo\u0281sa\u02d1\u02c8\u025b\u027ej\u0250 b\u027eazi\u02c8lej\u027e\u0250|}}, also known as ''FAB'', {{IPA-pt|\u02c8fabi|}} or {{IPA-pt|\u02cc\u025bfia\u02c8be|}}) is the 2\u00ba largest air force in America (behind only USA) and has around 70,000 active [[personnel]]. The FAB is subdivided into four operational commands:\n[[File:945622-comaer_0536.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Brigadier Nivaldo Rossato current commander of the Brazilian Air Force.]]\nI FAE (I For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea) Advanced fixed and rotary wings instruction; II FAE (II For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea)\nMaritime patrol, SAR, helicopters transport roles and Navy support; III FAE (III For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea)\nFighter command, it has all first-line combat assets under its control \u2013 fighter, attack and reconnaissance aircraft; IV FAE (IV For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea) \u2013 responsible for transport missions.\n\nThe Aeronautic Ministry was created on January 20, 1941, and absorbed the former Army and Navy aviation under its command. In 1944 the Brazilian Air Force joined Allied forces in Italy and operated there for about seven months, this was the FAB baptism in a real conflict. In 1999 after a creation of the [[Ministry of Defence (Brazil)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD), the Aeronautic Ministry changed its designation to Aeronautic Command, but no big changes happened to the air force structure, it kept almost the same organization it had before.\n[[File:Brazilian Air Force AMX air-to-air refuelling.jpg|thumb|right|A-1 strike fighter.]]\n[[File:CRUZEX 2013 (10798689103).jpg|thumb|right|Two F-5M fighters taking off in aerial alert.]]\n[[File:S\u00e1bado A\u00e9reo 2014 (15101174380).jpg|thumb|right|UH-60L utility helicopter.]]\nThe biggest, and most important, program of the FAB in the last years is the SIPAM (Sistema de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o da Amaz\u00f4nia \u2013 Amazonian Protection System), the operational part of the SIPAM is known by SIVAM (Sistema de Vigil\u00e2ncia da Amaz\u00f4nia \u2013 Amazon Vigilance System). The SIVAM is a huge network of radars, sensors and personnel integrated to guard and protect the [[Amazon Rainforest]] and its resources. In 2002 the Embraer R-99A AEW&C equipped with the Ericsson Erieye Airborne Radar and the R-99B SR (Electronic Intelligence Gathering version) entered service. The R-99 fleet is one of the principal components of the system, the aircraft are based at An\u00e1polis AB near Bras\u00edlia and fly 24 hours a day over the Amazonian region.\n[[File:C105 - RIAT 2008 (2675566776).jpg|thumb|left|CASA C-295 in cargo transport mission.]]\nThe backbone of the Brazilian combat aviation made up of three types, the [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5E/F]], the Embraer/Aermacchi [[AMX International AMX|A-1A/B (AMX)]] and the Embraer A/T-29 [[Super Tucano]]. The F-5s are under a modernisation program called F-5BR program, the aircraft official designation is F-5M. The upgrade is being carried out by Embraer and Elbit; it includes a new avionics suite, a full glass cockpit with three MFDs, HOTAS configuration and a new multimode radar, the Italian Grifo F. The first F-5EM was handed over on September 21, 2005, and it is scheduled at a rate of two aircraft being delivered each month from that date onwards.\n[[File:Aeronave A-29 Super Tucano em voo sobre a Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica.jpg|thumb|left| A-29 Super Tucano patrolling the [[Amazon rainforest]].]]\n[[File:Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o KC-390 (15414135738) (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Embraer KC-390]], new cargo aircraft of the Brazilian Air Force.]]\nThe A-1s are the main attack/ bomber aircraft of the FAB. There are three squadrons operating the A-1, one of them equipped with the RA-1 variant having a reconnaissance function as its primary role, but retaining all attack capabilities of the A-1. The RA-1s are equipped with RAFAEL's RecceLite reconnaissance system. Like the F-5, the A-1 is under a MLU (Mid Life Upgrade) program as well, this upgrade giving a high commonality between the avionics of the A-1M (MLU aircraft designation), the F-5M and the newly introduced Embraer A/T-29.\n\nWith the Mirage III withdrawn, the air defence of Bras\u00edlia and region is done temporarily by a mix of F-5s from 1st GAv and 1st/14th GAv until 10 Mirage 2000Cs and two Mirage 2000B bought from [[French Air Force]] surplus stocks arrive at [[An\u00e1polis]]. The Mirage 2000s are meant to be in service until at least 2015, when the Brazilian Air Force foresee the (postponed) F-X entering in service.\n\nTo replace the Embraer P-95 Bandeirulha in the maritime patrol duties, 12 Lockheed P-3A Orions have been bought from [[US Navy]] surplus and eight (with an option for a ninth) of them are being upgraded by EADS CASA in Spain, the remainder are to be used as spare parts source. On the same day of contract signature for the P-3BR work, 29 April 2005, EADS CASA was also awarded a contract to supply 12 C-295M medium transport aircraft. Deliveries started in 2006 with the first aircraft arriving in October 2006. The first three C-295s, designated C-105A Amazonas in Brazilian service, were commissioned into service in a formal ceremony at Base A\u00e9rea de [[Manaus]] on March 31, 2007. The C-105 replaces the FAB's C-115 Buffalo fleet and will supplement the C-130 Hercules.\n\nThe main heavy transport aircraft is the Lockheed C-130H Hercules and it will not change soon. The \"Herks\" are receiving major upgrades, receiving a full glass cockpit besides many other modifications. The first upgraded C-130 entering operational service recently. There are four Boeing KC-137 used as transport and tankers roles. In 2005 FAB received one [[Airbus]] ACJ, callsign \"Air Force One\" and dubbed as \"Santos Dumont.\" The ACJ is now the main presidential transport and it is assisted by two [[Boeing 737-200]] and one AS-332 Super Puma, with the KC-137 still serving as presidential transport in case of necessity. The basic pilot training is concentrated in [[Pirassununga]] (AFA \u2013 Academia da For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea) and uses the Neiva T-25 and the well known Embraer T-27 Tucano for basic instruction.

Recent studies suggest that deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon could increase sharply in the future as a result of over US$40&nbsp;billion in planned investments in highway paving and major new infrastructure projects in the region.\n\nThese studies have been challenged by several Brazilian ministries, which assert that recent improvements in [[environmental law]]s, enforcement and public attitudes have fundamentally reduced the threat posed to forests by such projects.\n\nAmong tropical nations, Brazil probably has the world's best monitoring of deforestation activity. Estimates are produced by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) for the entire Brazilian [[Legal Amazon]] by visually interpreting satellite imagery from the Landsat Thematic Mapper.

located in the [[Caribbean]], between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], east of [[Puerto Rico]].Its geographic coordinates are {{coord|18|30|N|64|30|W|}}. Map references include [[Central America]] and the Caribbean. The area totals 151&nbsp;km\u00b2 (about 0.9 times the size of [[Washington, DC]]) and comprises 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands; includes the islands of [[Tortola]], [[Anegada]], [[Virgin Gorda]] and [[Jost van Dyke]]. There are no bodies of water on the land.\nThere are no land boundaries. There is 80&nbsp;km of coastline. Maritime claims include {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}} of territorial sea and exclusive a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}} fishing zone. It has a tropical, humid climate, with temperatures moderated by trade winds. Its terrain consists of coral islands, and is relatively flat. It has volcanic islands and is steep and hilly. Its lowest point is the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its highest point is [[Mount Sage]] at {{convert|521|m|ft}} above sea level. Its natural resources are negligible. In terms of land use, it is 20% arable land, 6.67% permanent crops and 73.33% other as of a 2005 figure. Its natural hazards consist of hurricanes and tropical storms from July to October.\nThere is limited natural fresh water resources (except for a few seasonal streams and springs on [[Tortola]], most of the islands' water supply comes from wells and rainwater catchments). It has strong ties to nearby [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n== Climate ==\n<!-- Some body please add info. -->\nThe British Virgin Islands have [[tropical rainforest climate]], moderated by [[trade winds]]. Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, [[Road Town]], typical daily maxima are around {{convert|32|\u00b0C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|29|\u00b0C|1}} in the winter. Typical daily minima are around {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|21|\u00b0C|1}} in the winter. Rainfall averages about {{convert|1150|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March. Hurricanes occasionally hit the islands, with the hurricane season running from June to November.\n\n==References==\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Geography of North America}}\n{{North America topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the British Virgin Islands| ]]", "sha1": "rppais2lat6jrec5qojmx1h1gk38ake"}}, {"title": "Demographics of the British Virgin Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "3650", "revision": {"id": "825807327", "parentid": "825807308", "timestamp": "2018-02-15T15:08:36Z", "contributor": {"username": "Frietjes", "id": "13791031"}, "comment": "/* Religion */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use British English|date=January 2014}}\nThis article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of the [[British Virgin Islands]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and various other aspects.\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref name=\"2001 census\">[http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/BVI.pdf National Population Census Report 2001 - The British Virgin Islands]</ref>\n|title       = Census population and average annual growth rate\n|percentages =\n|1901 | 4908\n|1911 | 5562\n|1921 | 5082\n|1946 | 6505\n|1960 | 7921\n|1970 | 9672\n|1980 | 10985\n|1991 | 16116\n|2001 | 23161\n|2011 | \n}}\n\n==Population==\nA July 2009 estimate placed the population of the British Virgin Islands at 24,491.

It also predicted recurrent expenditure for 2016 at $288,640,000 which was an increase of 3.6% on the preceding year.

Negotiations between Cable & Wireless and CCT Boatphone led to a split of the monopolies, with Cable & Wireless retaining a monopoly over fixed line and internet services, and CCT Boatphone keeping a ''de facto'' monopoly over cellular telephones.\n\nIn 2007 the government abolished the previously existing monopolies under an order made pursuant to the new legislation.  The process proved politically fraught, and the government's Minister for Communications and Works, [[Alvin Christopher]], ended up leaving the government and joining the opposition party as a result of the furore.  The process was also criticised as cumbersome and slow, the initial deregulation having been announced in 2004, and taking no less than three years to come to fruition through delays in legislation and regulation.\n\nAlthough there have been no new entrants into the fixed line industry, the government issued three licences under the new regime to cellular telephone service providers.  The existing provider, CCT Boatphone, obtained one licence.  [[LIME (Cable & Wireless)|''B''mobile]], the cellular arm of Cable & Wireless, obtained a second.  The third licence was obtained by BVI Cable TV, a local cable television service.  The licence in favour of BVI Cable was controversial, as the Regulator had announced in advance that only three licences in total would be issued, and BVI Cable TV had crumbling cable television infrastructure, and was in no position to office cellular telephone services (and to date, has not offered any cellular telephone services, or anything other than simple cable television).  However, ''b''mobile's main regional competitor, [[Digicel]], was rejected for a licence.  The decision was regarded as highly controversial in the local media.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2695 BVI Platinum news, 23 May 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2782 BVI Platinum news, 4 June 2007]</ref>\n\nDigicel then issued court proceedings against the Regulator, arguing that he had acted improperly by imposing an arbitrary limit of three licences (although no complaint was made about the decision to prefer BVI Cable TV's improbable licence over Digicel).  ''B''mobile was joined to the suit as an interested party.  High Court Judge Rita Joseph-Olivetti found in favour of Digicel and quashed the original decision.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2713 BVI Platinum News, 25 May 2007]</ref>  Digicel commenced separate proceedings against [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] (as ''b''mobile's parent company) in the [[Courts of England and Wales|English courts]], claiming that Cable & Wireless has unfairly stifled competition in several Caribbean jurisdictions.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/caribbean/news/story/2007/07/070719_phonewars.shtml BBC World news, 19 July 2007]</ref>  During the intervening period, ''b''mobile has obtained a virtual stranglehold on the cellular telecommunications market in the British Virgin Islands by a combination of low prices and aggressive advertising, as well as significant investment in infrastructure and technology.<ref>[http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2822 BVI Platinum news, 8 June 2007] and [http://www.bviplatinum.com/news.php?page=article&aid=2959 BVI Platinum news, 25 June 2007]</ref>\n\nDigicel was finally granted a licence on 17 December 2007 and started operations in the BVI on 28 November 2008.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/bvi/bvi.php?news_id=5061&start=0&category_id=29 Caribbean Net News: British Virgin Islands<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115212212/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/bvi/bvi.php?news_id=5061&start=0&category_id=29 |date=15 January 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071221/business/business4.html Jamaica Gleaner News - Digicel to take on two new markets - Investing US$15m in BVI roll-out, bids US$80m for Honduras licence - Friday | 21 December 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222205914/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071221/business/business4.html |date=22 February 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.digicelgroup.com/en/media-center/press-releases/achievements/digicel-launches-in-bvi-with-us17million-investment DIGICEL LAUNCHES IN BVI WITH US$17 MILLION INVESTMENT]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{North America topic|Communications in}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Telecommunications In The British Virgin Islands}}\n[[Category:Communications in the British Virgin Islands| ]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications in the Caribbean|British Virgin]]", "sha1": "rw31xg299ctq6hdv4m0qs7myfacb0sd"}}, {"title": "Transport in the British Virgin Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "3654", "revision": {"id": "797571663", "parentid": "797569531", "timestamp": "2017-08-27T23:13:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "AnomieBOT", "id": "7611264"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Dating maintenance tags: {{EngvarB}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{no footnotes|date=January 2013}}\nThe systems of '''transport in the British Virgin Islands''' include 113 kilometres of [[highway]] and a [[harbour]] at [[Road Town]].\n\n== Roads ==\n* total: 200&nbsp;km\n* paved: 200&nbsp;km\n* unpaved: 0&nbsp;km (2007)\n\n==Ports and terminals==\n* [[Road Town]]\n\n==Airports==\n{{Main|List of airports in the British Virgin Islands}}\n\n* 4 (2008)\n\n===Paved runways===\n* total: 2\n**914 to 1,523 m: 1\n** under 914 m: 1 (2008)\n\n===Unpaved runways===\n* total: 2\n**914 to 1,523 m: 2 (2008)\n\n== Merchant Marine ==\n* registered in other countries: 1 (Panama) (2008)\n\n==References==\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{Americas topic|Transport in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Transport In The British Virgin Islands}}\n[[Category:Transport in the British Virgin Islands| ]]\n\n\n{{BritishVirginIslands-stub}}", "sha1": "oqe9ekqtcitq4ldvas9y506a2oju7jm"}}, {"title": "Transnational issues of the British Virgin Islands", "ns": "0", "id": "3656", "redirect": {"title": "British Virgin Islands"}, "revision": {"id": "15901972", "parentid": "184598", "timestamp": "2002-08-30T19:05:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Epopt", "id": "30"}, "comment": "#REDIRECT [[British Virgin Islands]] -- the page had no content", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[British Virgin Islands]]", "sha1": "l80kh1v1ndwpmskw3liwakacvvwk95b"}}, {"title": "Geography of Brunei", "ns": "0", "id": "3658", "revision": {"id": "841672899", "parentid": "816230750", "timestamp": "2018-05-17T08:49:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tony1", "id": "332841"}, "comment": "[[User:Ohconfucius/script|Script]]-assisted fixes: per [[MOS:NUM]], [[MOS:CAPS]], [[MOS:LINK]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2009}}\n<div style=\"float:right\">[[Image:Map of Brunei Demis.png|thumb|150px]]</div>\n\n[[Brunei]] is a country in Southeastern Asia, bordering the [[South China Sea]] and [[East Malaysia]].

It is almost totally supported by exports of [[crude oil]] and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP is high, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing. The government has shown progress in its basic policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 was estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.\n\nBrunei is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, averaging about {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14191.pdf|title=BRUNEI DARUSSALAM|last=International Monetary Fund|date=2014|website=|access-date=}}</ref> It also is the ninth-largest producer of [[liquefied natural gas]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.int/brunei/brunei/country-facts|title=Country Facts {{!}} Brunei Darussalam|website=www.un.int|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Macro-economic trend==\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices estimated<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 |title=International Monetary Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611172746/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}</ref> by the [[International Monetary Fund]] with figures in millions of [[Bruneian dollar]]s.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! year || Gross Domestic Product || US Dollar Exchange || Inflation Index (2000=100)\n|-\n| 1985 || 7,777 || 2.20 Bruneian Dollars || 76\n|-\n| 1990 || 6,509 || 1.81 Bruneian Dollars || 82\n|-\n| 1995 || 7,394 || 1.41 Bruneian Dollars || 95\n|-\n| 2000 || 7,441 || 1.72 Bruneian Dollars || 100\n|-\n| 2005 || 10,401\n || 1.62 Bruneian Dollars || 100\n|}\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1.52 Bruneian dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per [[man-hour]] in 2009.\n\nThe government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it might disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only for short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions, foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government reported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of 5.5%.\n[[File:Brunei Exports Treemap (2009).jpg|thumb|Brunei Exports Treemap (2009)]]\nOil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products other than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be imported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of imports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some transshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries, Japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction equipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was the third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.\n\nBrunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance. BIA's guiding principle is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while pursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States, Japan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.\n\nThe Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting profits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital invested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal income tax or capital gains tax.\n\nOne of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the development of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation, both shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps when tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.\n\nCompanies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private companies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders.

It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister companies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government. BSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of {{convert|10000|oilbbl/d}}. This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.\n\nThe French oil company [[Elf Aquitaine]] became active in petroleum exploration in Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in early 1990. Recently, [[UNOCAL]], partnered with New Zealand's [[Fletcher Challenge]] has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.\n\nBrunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over {{convert|240000|oilbbl/d}}. Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of [[oil reserves]] and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently averaging some {{convert|200000|oilbbl/d}}. Japan has traditionally been the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from 45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South Korea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major customers include [[Taiwan]] (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil exports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.\n\nAlmost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at [[Brunei LNG|Brunei Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant]], which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in the world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-term agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over 5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese company, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei Government in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which together produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has supplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well. In 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the fourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia.\n\nBrunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient until at least 2015, and planned deep sea exploration is expected to find significant new reserves. The government sought in the past decade to diversify the economy with limited success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investasian.com/2015/01/26/bruneis-economy-diversify/|title=Brunei\u2019s Economy to Diversify|work=- InvestAsian|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207152109/http://www.investasian.com/2015/01/26/bruneis-economy-diversify/|archivedate=7 February 2015|df=}}</ref> Oil and gas and government spending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-petroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.\n\nIn 2015, Brunei registered its third year of economic recession, the only ASEAN nation to do so. Declining oil prices and a drop in production due to maintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country\u2019s budget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016-17.<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://investvine.com/brunei-bracing-for-tougher-times-after-oil-joyride/\n| title = Brunei bracing for tougher times after oil joyride {{!}} Investvine\n| last = Maierbrugger\n| first = Arno\n| website = Investvine\n| language = en-US\n| access-date = 2016-03-02\n}}</ref>\n\n==Petrochemical industry==\n\nIn the western part of the country, [[Liang, Belait|Liang]] is currently experiencing a major development with the establishment of SPARK<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mofat.gov.bn/trade/invest/investment_opportunities.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100831180554/http://www.mofat.gov.bn/trade/invest/investment_opportunities.htm |archivedate=2010-08-31 |df= }}</ref>\n, which is a 271 hectare site developed to be a world class [[petrochemical]] hub.

The Brunei Halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the consumption needs of Muslims worldwide.\n\nAs envisioned by the Sultanate, the use of the Brunei Halal brand would signify to Muslim consumers the manufacturers' strict compliance with laws relating to Islamic teachings. Brunei also aims to build confidence in the brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing process, logistics and distribution.\n\nA new company, government-owned Brunei Wafirah Holdings Sdn Bhd, has been established as the owner of the Brunei Halal brand. Wafirah has entered into a joint venture with Brunei Global Islamic Investment and Hong Kong-based logistics firm Kerry FSDA Limited to form Ghanim International Food Corporation Sdn Bhd. Ghanim International manages the use of the Brunei Halal trademark. Producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire the Brunei halal label (or the certification for compliance with accepted manufacturing and slaughtering practices under Islam) through the Department of Syariah Affairs' Halal Food Control Section. They can then approach Ghanim for their application to use the brand.\n\n==Macroeconomic trend==\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices [https://web.archive.org/web/20100611172746/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/data/dbcselm.cfm?G=2001 estimated] by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of [[Bruneian Dollar]]s.\n\nIn the 1970s, Brunei invested sharply increasing revenues from petroleum exports and maintained government spending at a low and constant rate. Consequently, the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest them around the world to help provide for future generations. Part of the reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's annual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased, and government spending has increased. The government has been running a budget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made Brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.\n\nBrunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly in each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.\n\nThis drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in world markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered somewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In recent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an estimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5 billion, well below the 1980 peak.\n\nThe [[Asian financial crisis]] in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in [[Brunei]]'s economy. In addition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy, caused the country to slip into a mild recession.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Brunei topics}}\n{{APEC}}\n{{Asia in topic|Economy of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Brunei}}\n[[Category:Economy of Brunei| ]]\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Brunei]]", "sha1": "55yaf4x7hjgvrqdge4q5ta5g8xz96ud"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Brunei", "ns": "0", "id": "3662", "revision": {"id": "863038331", "parentid": "861141764", "timestamp": "2018-10-08T09:30:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Aisteco", "id": "15804130"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n{{Update|article|inaccurate=y|date=September 2012}}\n}}\n\nThis article covers [[telecommunication]] in [[Brunei]].\n\n==Telecommunications==\n\n===Telephone===\nTelephone service throughout the country is good; international service is good to Southeast Asia, Middle East, Western Europe, and the US<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Main lines in use: 74,213 (2016) <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bx.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref>\n* [[Mobile phones]]: 523,453 (2018) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLanding point for the SEA-ME-WE-3 optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe; the Asia-America Gateway submarine cable network provides new links to Asia and the US; the South-East Asia Japan Cable System linking Brunei, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Philippines and Thailand; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (1 Indian Ocean and 1 Pacific Ocean) (2017) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Internet==\nInternet service in Brunei is OK and could be better Brunei has fast connection speeds to servers in SEA but speeds are however slow to servers located outside of SEA and Asia.

It is known that the Brunei's broadband ranging from 512 kbit/s to 1 Mbit/s is one of the most expensive in the world. The limited market in Brunei means that new developments in the telecommunications sector is stagnant. Currently only about 110,000 users out of a population of 380,000 have any connection to the Internet.\n\nIn 2002, Telekom Brunei was incorporated become Telekom Brunei Berhad (TelBru).

The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases during the second half of summer and produces hot and dry weather.

Meanwhile, [[Zhelyu Zhelev]], a communist-era dissident from the new democratic party - [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (abbreviated in Bulgarian as SDS), was elected President by the Assembly in 1990. In the first years after the change of regime, Bulgarian politics had to (re)establish the foundations of a democratic society in the country after nearly fifty years of de facto totalitarian communism. The so-called period of transition (from a Soviet socialist model to an economic structure focused on development through economic growth) began in the early 1990s. The politics of Bulgaria was aimed at joining the European Union and the NATO fold, as the alliances were recognised to have political agendas similar to the goals of the new Bulgarian democracy.\n\nIn contemporary Bulgaria, the government and its leader - the Prime Minister, have more political influence and significance than the President. Thus, the parliamentary elections set the short-term social and political environment in the country since the cabinet (chosen by the Prime Minister and approved by the parliament) decides how the country is governed while the President can only make suggestions and impose vetoes.\n\nIn the first parliamentary elections held under the new [[constitution of Bulgaria]], in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1991|October 1991]], the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (SDS) party won a plurality of the seats, having won 110 out of the 240 seats, and created a cabinet alone with the support of the [[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]] \u2014 a liberal party  (in Bulgarian abbreviated: DPS) which is widely perceived as a party of the ethnic Turks minority in Bulgaria. Yet, their government collapsed in late 1992, and was succeeded by a technocratic team put forward by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP), which served until 1994 when it also collapsed. The President dissolved the government and appointed a provisional one to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in December.\n\nBSP won convincingly these elections in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1994|December 1994]] with a majority of 125 seats out of the 240. Due to the severe economic crisis in Bulgaria during their government, BSP's cabinet collapsed and in 1997 a caretaker cabinet was appointed by the President, again, to serve until early parliamentary elections could be held in April 1997.\n\nThe [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1997|April 1997]] elections resulted in a landslide victory for the SDS, winning a majority of 137 seats in parliament, and allowing them to form the [[Kostov Government|next government]]. This proved to be the first post-communist government that did not collapse and served its full 4-year term until 2001.\n\nIn [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2001|2001]], the former monarch of Bulgaria [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] returned to power, this time as Prime Minister with his [[National Movement Simeon II]] (in Bulgarian abbreviated: NDSV), having won half (120) of the seats. His party entered a [[Sakskoburggotski Government|coalition]] with the DPS and invited two functionaries of the BSP (who sat as independents). In opposition were the two previously governing parties - the Socialist Party and the Union of Democratic Forces. In the four years in opposition the SDS suffered the defection of numerous splinter groups. The ruling party NDSV itself [[Sakskoburggotski Government#Changes on February 23, 2005|ruptured]] into a pro-right core and a pro-liberal [[New Time (Bulgarian political party)|fringe]] group. Bulgarian entered [[NATO]] in 2004.\n\nIn the aftermath, the BSP won the parliamentary elections in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2005|2005]] with 82 out of the 240 seats, but as it didn't get the majority of the seats, a [[Stanishev Government|coalition government]] was formed by the three biggest parties - BSP, NDSV and DPS. The elections also put in parliament some of the right-wing parties, as well as the extreme-right nationalist coalition led by the party [[Attack (political party)|Ataka]] as an answer to the former coalition government of NDSV with DPS. Bulgarian entered the [[European Union]] in 2007.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections of [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009|2009]] the centre-right party of the mayor of [[Sofia]] won [[GERB]] picking up 117 seats. The party formed a [[First Borisov Government|minority government]] with the support of the right-wing parties. Once the governing party - the [[National Movement Simeon II]] did not amass enough votes to enter the parliament. The austerity measures required in the stagnation of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|Global Financial Crisis]] led to [[2013 Bulgarian protests against the Borisov cabinet|massive protests]] and the resignation of the cabinet in early 2013, months before the end of GERB's term.\n\nIn the early [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2013|elections]] the former leading party GERB received highest vote from the people. This was the first time since 1989 that a ruling party was re-elected; in the past painful and unpopular reforms had to be implemented. However, as GERB received only 97 of the 240 seats, and failed to make a coalition, they refused the mandate, handing it down to the next party BSP.

During the Socialism era, Bulgarian economy continued to be industrialized, although free market trade substantially decreased, as private market initiatives became state-regulated. Still, the Bulgarian economy made significant overall progress in modernizing [[transport infrastructure|road infrastructure]], airline transportation, as well as developing the tourism sector by building tourist resorts along the Black sea coast and the mountain regions.\n\nFrom the end of World War II until the widespread change of regime in [[Eastern Europe]] in November 1989, the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP) exerted complete economic, social and political control in Bulgaria. The party's ascent to power in 1944 had marked the beginning of economic change towards [[planned economy]]. During that time, Bulgaria followed the Soviet model of economic development more closely than any other member of the Eastern Bloc, while becoming one of the first members of [[Comecon]]. The new regime shifted the economy type from a predominantly agrarian one towards an [[industrial economy]], while encouraging the relocation of the labour force from the countryside to the cities, thus providing workers for the newly built large-scale industrial complexes. At the same time, the focus of Bulgarian international trade shifted from Central Europe to Eastern Europe and the USSR.<ref name=csecon>{{cite book|author=William Marsteller|chapter=The Economy|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/93010955/ |title=Bulgaria country study|editor=Glenn E.

Soviet-style centralised planning formed by consecutive five-year plan periods had more immediate benefits there compared to the other Eastern European states where it was first applied in the early 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0058)|title=Economic policies|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> Throughout the postwar period, economic progress was also substantially assisted by a level of internal political stability unseen in other Eastern European countries during the same period. That represented a change on the Bulgarian political scene as political turbulence was common before BCP's ascent to power.<ref name=csecon/>\n\nNonetheless, beginning in the early 1960s, low capital and labour productivity, as well as expensive material inputs, plagued the Bulgarian economy. With disappointing rates of growth came a high degree of economic experimentation. This experimentation took place within the socialist economic framework, although never approaching a market-based economy.<ref name=csecon/>\n\nIn the late 1980s, continuing poor economic performance intensified economic hardship. By that time, the misdirection and irrationality of BCP economic policies had become quite clear.<ref name=csecon /> Bulgaria's economy contracted dramatically after 1987 when Comecon, with which the Bulgarian economy had integrated closely, dissolved. On 10 November 1989, at the November plenum of BCP, [[Todor Zhivkov]] was dismissed from his long-held party leader and head of state positions. The communist regime gave way to democratic elections and government. Unlike the communist parties in most other Eastern European states, the BCP (changing its name to [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]) retained power by winning the first free national elections in June 1990. That was made possible by changes in party leadership, programme, reduction of its power base and other moves which permitted economic re-orientation toward a market system. This difficult transition combined with political vagueness and unpreparedness of the Bulgarian people for social and economic changes led to dramatically worsening economic conditions during the early 1990s.<ref name=csecon/>\n\n===1990\u20132000===\nEconomic performance declined dramatically at the beginning of the 1990s after the disbandment of the [[Comecon]] system and the loss of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Comecon market, to which the country had been entirely tied. Also, as a result of political unrest with the first attempts to re-establish a democratic political system and free [[market economy]] the [[standard of living]] fell by about 40%, and only started to stabilize significantly after 1998 after the fall of [[Jean Videnov]]'s socialist government. It regained pre-1989 levels by June 2004.\n\nFirst signs of recovery showed in 1994 when [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew by 1.4%. This progress continued with a 2.5% rise in 1995. Inflation, which surged to 122% in 1994, fell to normal rates of 32.9% in 1995. During 1996, however, the economy collapsed during Jean Videnov's government. That was due to the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]'s inability to introduce vital economic reforms and failure to set legislative standards for banking and financial institutions, thus forcing an unstable banking system. All this led to an inflation rate of 311%, and the collapse of the [[Bulgarian lev|lev]]. In the spring 1997, the pro-reform [[United Democratic Forces]] coalition came to power with its ambitious economic reform package. The reforms included introduction of a currency board regime, which was agreed to with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], allowed the economy to stabilize. The 2000s saw a steady pace of growth and budget surpluses, but shaky inflation.\n\nSuccessful foreign direct investment and successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning that have contributed greatly to the Bulgarian economy, with a historical growth rate average of 6% a year. Corruption in the public administration and a weak judiciary have continued to be long-term problems, with presence of organized crime remaining very high.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAlthough politicians were giving warranties that the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]] would not hit Bulgaria, the economy suffered a 5.5% GDP decline in that period. Unemployment rose for at least five quarters bringing Bulgaria's worst recession since the early 1980s.  Still, economic circumstances were not too severe when compared to the rest of [[Europe]]. Future prospects are tied to the country's increasingly important integration with the European Union member states.\n\n===Reforms of the 1990s and early 2000s===\nMembers of the government promised to move forward on cash and mass [[privatization]] upon taking office in January 1995 but were slow to act. United Nations sanctions against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Iraq sanctions|Iraq]] (1990\u20132003), two of the country's most significant trading partners, took a heavy toll on the Bulgarian economy. The first signs of recovery emerged in 1994 when the GDP grew and inflation fell. The first round of mass privatisation finally began in January 1996, and auctions began toward the end of that year. The second and third rounds were conducted in Spring 1997 under a new government. In July 1998, the UDF-led government and the IMF reached an agreement on a 3-year loan worth about $800 million, which replaced the 14-month stand-by agreement that expired in June 1998. The loan was used to develop financial markets, improve [[social safety net]] programmes, strengthen the tax system, reform agricultural and energy sectors, and further liberalise trade. The [[European Commission]], in its 2002 country report, recognised Bulgaria as a functioning market economy, acknowledging the progress made by Prime Minister [[Ivan Kostov]]'s government toward market-oriented reforms.\n\n===Rebound from the February 1997 crisis===\nIn April 1997, the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (SDS) won pre-term parliamentary [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 1997|elections]] and introduced an IMF currency board system which succeeded in stabilizing the economy. The triple digit inflation of 1996 and 1997 has given way to an official [[economic growth]], but forecasters predicted accelerated growth over the next several years. The government's structural reform program includes:\n# privatization and, where appropriate, liquidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs);\n# liberalization of agricultural policies, including creating conditions for the development of a land market;\n# reform of the country's social insurance programs; and\n# reforms to strengthen contract enforcement and fight crime and corruption.\nDespite reforms, weak control over privatization led many successful state enterprises to bankruptcy. The SDS government also failed to stop the growing negative account balance, which has since then continued to increase, reaching a negative of $12.65 billion in 2008.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The [[Sakskoburggotski Government|government]] elected in [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2001|2001]] pledged to maintain the fundamental economic policy objectives adopted by its predecessor in 1997, specifically: retaining the Currency Board, implementing sound financial policies, accelerating [[privatisation]], and pursuing structural reforms. Both governments failed to implement sound social policies.\n\nThe economy really took off between 2003 and 2008 and growth figures quickly shot up, fluctuating between figures as high as 6.6% (2004) and 5.0% (2003). Even in the last pre-crisis year, 2008, the Bulgarian economy was growing rapidly at 6.0%, despite significantly slowing down in the last quarter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/06/19/business/EU-FIN-ECO-Bulgaria-Growth.php |title=Bulgaria's economy grew by 6.2 percent on year in 1Q - International Herald Tribune |publisher=Iht.com |date= |accessdate=2 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Part of the European Union===\nOn 1 January 2007 Bulgaria entered the [[European Union]].

Because Bulgarian industry was configured to Soviet markets, the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact caused a severe crisis in the 1990s. After showing its first growth since the communist era in 2000, Bulgaria's industrial sector has grown slowly but steadily in the early 2000s. The performance of individual manufacturing industries has been uneven, however. Food processing and tobacco processing suffered from the loss of Soviet markets and have not maintained standards high enough to compete in Western Europe. Textile processing generally has declined since the mid-1990s, although clothing exports have grown steadily since 2000.<ref name=cp10/>\n\nOil refining survived the shocks of the 1990s because of a continuing export market and the purchase of the Burgas refinery by the Russian oil giant LUKoil. The chemical industry has remained in good overall condition but is subject to fluctuating natural gas prices. Growth in ferrous metallurgy, which is dominated by the Kremikovtsi Metals Combine, has been delayed by a complex privatization process and by obsolete capital equipment. Non-ferrous metallurgy has prospered because the Pirdop copper smelting plant was bought by Union Mini\u00e8re of Belgium and because export markets have been favourable.<ref name=cp10/>\n\nThe end of the Warsaw Pact alliance and the loss of Third World markets were grave blows to the defence industry. In the early 2000s, the industry's plan for survival has included upgrading products to satisfy Western markets and doing cooperative manufacturing with Russian companies. The electronics industry, which also was configured in the 1980s to serve Soviet markets, has not been able to compete with Western computer manufacturers. The industry now relies on contract agreements with European firms and attracting foreign investment. The automotive industry has ceased the manufacture of cars, trucks, and buses. Manufacture of forklifts, a speciality in the communist era, also has stopped. In the early 2000s, shipbuilding has prospered at the major Varna and Ruse yards because of foreign ownership (Ruse) and privatization (Varna).<ref>Bulgaria country profile, p. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\nOnly in recent years electronics and electric equipment production has regained higher levels. The largest centres include [[Sofia]], [[Plovdiv]] and the surrounding area, [[Botevgrad]], [[Stara Zagora]], [[Varna]], [[Pravets]] and many other cities. [[Household appliance]]s, [[computer]]s, [[CD]]s, [[telephone]]s, [[medical equipment|medical]] and scientific equipment are being produced. In 2008 the [[electronics]] industry shipped more than $260 million in exports, primarily of components, computers and consumer electronics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investbg.government.bg/upfs/27/05%20Electronic%20Indusry%20Factsheet%202010.pdf |title=Bulgaria Electronics industry factsheet |date=March 2010 |publisher=Bulgarian National Investment Agency |accessdate=20 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112220001/http://www.investbg.government.bg/upfs/27/05%20Electronic%20Indusry%20Factsheet%202010.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMany factories producing transportation equipment {{As of|2008|alt= currently}} still do not operate at full capacity.

Lovech has an automotive assembly plant. [[Rousse]] serves as the main centre for agricultural machinery. Bulgarian arms production mainly operates in central Bulgaria ([[Kazanlak]], [[Sopot]], [[Karlovo]]).\n\nConstruction output fell dramatically in the 1990s as industrial and housing construction declined, but a recovery began in the early 2000s. The sector, now dominated by private firms, has resumed the foreign building programs that led to prosperity in the communist era. The Glavbolgostroy firm has major building projects in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine as well as domestic contracts.<ref name=cp11>Bulgaria country profile, p. 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the biggest Romanian investments in Bulgaria is in the construction/retail industry, namely the Budmax brand of construction supply stores (owned by [[Arabesque (company)|Arabesque]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.euscoop.com/en/2018/6/12/bulgarian-romanian-trade-relationship|title=Guest Post: Bulgarian-Romanian Commercial Relationship|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Energy=== \n{{main|Energy in Bulgaria|List of power stations in Bulgaria}}\n[[File:Galabovo.jpg|thumb|right|AES Galabovo, part of Maritza Iztok Complex]]\n\nBulgaria relies on imported oil and natural gas (most of which comes from [[Russia]]), together with domestic generation of electricity from coal-powered and hydro plants, and the Kozloduy nuclear plant.

The domestic power-generating industry, which was privatized in 2004 by sales to interests from Europe, Japan, Russia, and the United States, suffers from obsolete equipment and a weak oversight agency. To solve the latter problem, in 2008 the government set up a state-owned energy holding-company ([[Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD]]), composed of gas company [[Bulgargaz]], [[Bulgartransgaz]], power company [[NEK EAD]], Electricity System Operator EAD, [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Kozloduy nuclear power station]], [[Maritsa Iztok Complex|Maritza-Iztok II thermal power station]], the Mini Maritza Iztok (Maritza Iztok mines), and Bulgartel EAD.

Kozloduy, which exported 14 percent of its output in 2006, was expected to cease all exportation in 2007. Construction of the long-delayed Belene nuclear plant resumed in 2006 but will not be complete until at least 2011. Belene, planned in the 1980s but then rejected, was revived by the safety controversy at Kozloduy.<ref name=cp11/>\n\nOil exploration is ongoing offshore in the Black Sea (the Shabla block) and on the Romanian border, but Bulgaria's chief oil income is likely to come as a transfer point on east-west and north-south transit lines. Burgas is Bulgaria's main oil port on the Black Sea. Bulgaria's largest oil refinery, Neftochim, was purchased by Russian oil giant LUKoil in 1999 and underwent modernization in 2005.

The Bulgarian banking system, which was weak in the first post-communist years, was fully reformed in the late 1990s, including stronger oversight from the National Bank of Bulgaria and gradual privatisation. In 2003 the banking system was fully privatised, and substantial consolidation began making the system more efficient in 2004. Several smaller banks grew substantially between 2004 and 2006. These processes increased public confidence in the banks. Although the system still requires consolidation, loan activity to individuals and businesses increased in the early 2000s. The insurance industry has grown rapidly since a market reform in 1997, with the help of foreign firms. An example is the Bulgarian Insurance Group (BIG), a pension-fund and insurance management company owned by the Dutch-Israeli TBI Holding Company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The introduction of health and pension insurance plans has expanded the private insurance industry. A series of reform laws in the early 2000s enabled the Bulgarian Stock Exchange to begin regular operation. As of 2005, stock market activity was limited by lack of transparency, although the growth rate increased beginning in 2004.<ref>Bulgaria country profile, p. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nAfter a decline in the 1990s, in the 21st century the tourism industry has grown rapidly. In 2016 some 10 million foreigners visited Bulgaria, up from 4 million in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2000. This trend is based on a number of attractive destinations, low costs, and restoration of facilities. Most of the industry had been privatised by 2004. Infrastructure items such as recreation facilities and booking services require improvement. Development of Bulgaria's retail sales sector was slow until the early 2000s, when a large number of Western-style outlets began to appear, and Sofia developed as a retail center. By 2006, several major European retail chains had opened stores, and others planned to enter the Bulgarian market.<ref name=cp12>Bulgaria country profile, p. 12.</ref>\n\nBulgaria has attracted considerable investment from foreigners buying property either for their own use or for investment.

In the postcommunist era, the process of restoring agricultural land to private owners in a form that ensures productivity has been slow. Bank investment and insecurity in the land market contributed to slow development in the 1990s. By 2004 some 98 percent of the workforce and output of Bulgaria's agricultural sector was private, including a number of large private cooperative enterprises. A significant amount of food also is produced for direct consumption by non-farmers on small plots, which are an important support for parts of the population. In 2000 and 2003, droughts limited agricultural production, and floods had the same effect in 2005. Bulgaria's main field crops are wheat, corn, and barley. The main industrial crops are sugar beets, sunflowers, and tobacco. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are the most important vegetable exports. Production of apples and grapes, Bulgaria's largest fruit products, has decreased since the communist era, but the export of wine has increased significantly. The most important types of livestock are cattle, sheep, poultry, pigs, and buffaloes, and the main dairy products are yogurt, cow and sheep cheese.<ref name=cp9>Bulgaria country profile, p. 9.</ref> Bulgaria is the world's 13th largest [[sheep milk]] producer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html?lang=en&country=27&year=2005|title=ESS Website ESS : Statistics home|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> and is the 15th largest producer of [[tobacco]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html;jsessionid=94ED2C42780C00C76A89FE1436755D45?lang=en&country=27&year=2005 |title=FAO \u2013 Tobacco production country rank |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> and 13th largest producer of [[raspberry|raspberries]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/es/ess/top/topproduction.html;jsessionid=94ED2C42780C00C76A89FE1436755D45?lang=en&country=27&year=2005 |title=FAO \u2013 Raspberry production country rank |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> in Europe.

About 43% of Bulgaria's land is arable.]]\nIn 2004 an estimated one-third of Bulgaria's land mass was covered by forests, of which about 40 percent was conifers. Between 1980 and 2000, the forested area increased by 4.6 percent. In 2002 a total of 4,800 tons of timber was harvested, 44 percent of which was fuel wood and 20 percent, pulpwood. Although nominal state timber standards are very strict, in 2004 an estimated 45 percent of Bulgaria's timber harvest was logged illegally because of corruption in the forest service. Some 7.5 percent of forests are protected from all uses, and 65 percent are designated for ecological and commercial use. In 2005 about 70 percent of the total forest resource was rated economically viable.<ref name=cp9/>\n\nSince Bulgaria stopped high-seas fishing in 1995, the country has imported increasing amounts of fish. The fish farming industry (particularly sturgeon) has expanded in the early 2000s, and some environmental improvements in the Black Sea and the Danube River, the principal sources of fish, may increase the take in future years. However, the catch from those sources has decreased sharply in recent decades, yielding only a few species of fish for domestic markets in 2004. Between 1999 and 2001, Bulgaria's total fish harvest, wild and cultivated, dropped from 18,600 tons to 8,100 tons, but in 2003 the harvest had recovered to 16,500 tons.<ref name=cp10>Bulgaria country profile, p. 10.</ref>\n\nProduction of the most important crops (according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]) in 2006 (in '000 tons) amounted to: [[wheat]] 3301.9; [[sunflower]] 1196.6; [[maize]] 1587.8; [[grape]]s 266.2; [[tobacco]] 42.0; [[tomato]]es 213.0; [[barley]] 546.3; [[potato]]es 386.1; [[Capsicum|peppers]] 156.7; [[cucumber]]s 61.5; [[Cherry|cherries]] 18.2; [[watermelon]]s 136.0; [[cabbage]] 72.7; [[apple]]s 26.1; [[plum]]s 18.0; [[Strawberry|strawberries]] 8.8.\n\n===Mining and minerals===\nBulgaria's mining industry has declined in the post-communist era. Many deposits have remained underdeveloped because of a lack of modern equipment and low funding. Mining has contributed less than 2 percent of GDP and engaged less than 3 percent of the workforce in the early 2000s. Bulgaria has the following estimated deposits of metallic minerals: 207 million tons of iron ore, 127 million tons of manganese ore, 936 million tons of copper ore, 238 million tons of chromium ore, and 150 million tons of gold ore. Several of Bulgaria's minerals are extracted commercially; 80 percent of mining is done by open-pit excavation. Iron extraction at Kremikovtsi and elsewhere is not sufficient to support the domestic steel industry, but copper, lead, and zinc deposits fully supply the nonferrous metallurgy industries. A British firm has exploratory gold mines at Dikanyite and Gornoseltsi, and a domestic copper and gold mine operates at Chelopech. About 50 nonmetallic minerals are present in significant amounts. Substantial amounts of uranium are present in the Rhodope Mountains, but no extraction has occurred in the last 10 years.<ref name=cp10/>\n\nDespite the poor performance of the mining sector, productivity has increased in recent years.

The unemployment rate has been in double digits throughout the post-communist era, reaching a high point of 19 percent in 2000. Since then, the rate has decreased substantially with the creation of new jobs in private and state enterprises. In 2005 the official figure was 11.5 percent, compared with 16.9 percent at the end of 2002. However, in 2003 an estimated 500,000 Bulgarians were unemployed but not officially counted because they were not seeking work. In January 2005, the government raised the minimum wage by 25 percent, to US$90 per month. The largest labour unions are Podkrepa (Support) and the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria. They represent labour in the National Council for Tripartite Partnership, in which they join government and business representatives to discuss issues of labour, social security, and living standards.

The state debt peaked in 1994, when it reached US$14.4 billion. During 1998-2008 Bulgaria maintained policy of [[Government budget balance|budget surpluses]], which reduced the state debt to 5.07 billion euro. Combined with the economic growth in that period, the state debt dropped to a record low of 13.7% of GDP, one of the lowest in the European Union. In 2008 Bulgaria also maintained 4.286 billion euro fiscal reserve, meaning that net state debt at this moment was only 0.784 billion euro. After the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]] Bulgaria turned to policy of [[Deficit spending|budget deficits]] and at the end of 2013 the state debt rose up to 7.219 billion euro, representing 18.1% of the GDP. In 2015, the debt rate increased further to 26.7% of the GDP, still remaining the third lowest in EU after Estonia and Luxembourg. Part of the increase was driven by the collapse of [[Corporate Commercial Bank]] in 2014, the fourth largest bank in the country, and the subsequent paying out of [[Deposit insurance|guaranteed deposits]].\n\n==Foreign economic relations==\nIn the 1990s, Bulgaria moved gradually away from dependence on markets in the former Soviet sphere, increasing its exports to the European Union (EU). In 1999 Bulgaria joined the Central European Free-Trade Agreement (CEFTA), with whose members (Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; Macedonia was added in 2006) it has established important trade relations. The admission of all but Croatia and Romania to the EU in 2004 reduced the significance of CEFTA trade, however. In 2004 some 54 percent of Bulgaria's import trade and 58 percent of its export trade was with EU member countries. Bulgaria has bilateral free-trade agreements with Albania, Croatia, Estonia, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, and Turkey.<ref name=cp12/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, hydrocarbon fuels remained an important import, although beginning in the late 1990s those commodities\u2019 share of total imports decreased significantly, from 29 percent in 1996 to 13 percent in 2004. During that period, the diversification of imported products\nimproved as the volume of machinery and equipment, consumer products, and automobiles increased. A large percentage of imports is accounted for by raw materials such as cloth, metal ore, and petroleum, which are processed and re-exported. The most important imports in 2005 were machinery and equipment, metals and ores, chemicals and plastics, fuels, and minerals. The major sources of imports, in order of volume, were Germany, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Greece. In 2005 Bulgaria's largest export markets, in order of volume, were Italy, Germany, Turkey,\nGreece, and Belgium. The most important export commodities were clothing, footwear, iron and steel, machinery and equipment, and fuels. In 2005 Bulgaria's exports totaled US$11.7 billion and its imports totaled US$15.9 billion, incurring a trade deficit of US$4.2 billion. The trade deficit is especially severe with Russia, where markets for Bulgarian goods have shrunk drastically in the early 2000s.<ref>Bulgaria country profile, p. 12-13.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of 2006, Bulgaria had a current account deficit of US$2.3 billion, a substantial increase over the deficit for the same period of 2005, which was some US$1.4 billion. Its trade deficit was US$2.78 billion, foreign direct investment totaled US$1.8 billion, and the financial account balance was US$2.29 billion. In mid-2006 the overall balance of payments was US$883 million, compared with US$755 million for the same period of 2005.<ref name=cp13>Bulgaria country profile, p. 13.</ref>\n\nBulgaria's large foreign debt has been an economic burden throughout the postcommunist era. At the end of 2005, Bulgaria reported an external debt of US$15.2 billion, an increase in value but a decrease as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) compared with 2002 and previous years. As a percentage of GDP, the external debt remained constant between 2004 and 2005.<ref name=cp13/>\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, investment from the West and from Russia has contributed significantly to recovery from the economic crisis of 1996\u201397, but the rate of investment has remained lower than that in other countries of Eastern Europe. In 2003 the largest national sources of foreign direct investment, in order of volume, were Austria, Greece, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. In 1997 the Belgian Solve company bought the Deny Soda Combine, and in 1999 LUKoil of Russia bought the Neftochim Oil Refinery at Burgas. Union Mini\u00e8re, a Belgian mining company, bought the large Pirdop copper-smelting plant, giving an important boost to Bulgarian nonferrous metallurgy. A number of foreign companies have invested in the chemical fertilizer and food-processing industries In the early 2000s, China invested in the Bulgarian electronics industry. Some cooperative agreements have been made for manufacture of vehicle components. Daimler-Chrysler of Germany has a contract to update Bulgaria's military transport vehicles between 2003 and 2015. The French Eurocopter company has a bilateral protocol involving a variety of machinery, computer software, and other industrial products. In 2004 Bulgarian oil reserves attracted interest from Melrose Resources of Edinburgh. Russia's natural gas giant, Gazprom, has pledged investment in Bulgaria's natural gas infrastructure in exchange for increased purchase of its product. A three-company Israeli consortium agreed in 2004 to work with the domestic Overgas company (which is half-owned by Gazprom) on a major natural-gas distribution network in Bulgaria. In 2005 three European consortia submitted bids for construction of the Belene nuclear power plant. One such investor is the Italian ENEL energy consortium, which also owns the Maritsa\u2013Iztok\u20133 thermal power plant. In 2006 Russia's Gazprom company bid against several European energy companies for ownership of newly privatized regional heating utilities, and the Austrian Petromaxx Energy Group invested US$120 million in a new oil refinery at Silistra.<ref name=cp13/>\n\nIn December 1996, Bulgaria joined the [[World Trade Organization]]. In the early 1990s Bulgaria's slow pace of privatization, contradictory government tax and investment policies, and bureaucratic red tape kept foreign investment among the lowest in the region. Total direct foreign investment from 1991 through 1996 was $831 million. In the years since 1997, however, Bulgaria has begun to attract substantial foreign investment. In 2004 alone over 2.72 billion Euro (3.47 billion US dollars) were invested by foreign companies. In 2005 economists observed a slowdown to about 1.8 billion euros (2.3 billion US dollars) in [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] which is attributed mainly to the end of the privatization of the major state owned companies. After joining the EU in 2007 Bulgaria registered a peak in foreign investment of about 6 billion euros.\n\n==Miscellaneous data==\n'''Households with access to fixed and mobile telephone access'''<ref name=\"National Statistical Institute\">{{cite web|title =\u0414\u041e\u0421\u0422\u042a\u041f \u041d\u0410 \u0414\u041e\u041c\u0410\u041a\u0418\u041d\u0421\u0422\u0412\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0414\u041e \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041d\u0415\u0422|url=http://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/2808/%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8A%D0%BF-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B4%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82 |publisher=National Statistical Institute}}</ref>\n* ''landline telephone'' - 62% (2009)\n* ''mobile telephone'' - 78% (2009)\n\n'''Broadband penetration rate'''<ref name=\"National Statistical Institute\"/>\n* ''fixed broadband''- 93.8% (2015)\n* ''mobile broadband''- 38.7% (2015)\n\n'''Individuals using computer and internet'''<ref name=\"National Statistical Institute\"/>\n* ''computer'' - 63% (2017)\n* ''internet'' - 67.3% (2017)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Business and economics|Bulgaria|European Union}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-4}}\n* [[Bulgarian National Bank]]\n* [[Bulgarian Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Economy of Europe]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151015203623/http://startbusinessinbulgaria.com/ Starting a Business in Bulgaria]\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-4}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[File:PD-icon.svg|15px|link=|alt=]]&nbsp;''This article incorporates [[public domain|public domain material]] [https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile] (October 2006) from websites or documents of the [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]].\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Economy of Bulgaria}}\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html CIA World Factbook]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080118133410/http://www.acc.bg/en/bulgaria/vat-value-added-tax.html Tax rates and tax revenue]\n\n{{Bulgaria topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Members_of_the_European_Union_(EU)}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{Economy of Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Bulgaria}}\n[[Category:Economy of Bulgaria| ]]\n[[Category:European Union member economies|Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:World Trade Organization member economies|Bulgaria]]", "sha1": "4olnyp6kykjsjuodecg3i2bqq2sl04m"}}, {"title": "Telecommunications in Bulgaria", "ns": "0", "id": "3672", "revision": {"id": "845984158", "parentid": "826065906", "timestamp": "2018-06-15T13:44:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 2 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Vakareltower.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Blaw-Knox tower and two mast antennae, [[Vakarel radio transmitter]]]]\n\n'''Telecommunications in Bulgaria''' include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.\n\n==Radio and television==\n\n* Radio broadcast stations: [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] 31, [[FM broadcasting|FM]] 63, shortwave 2 (2001).\n* Radio broadcast hours: 525,511 (2003).\n* Television broadcast stations: 39 (2001).\n* Television broadcast hours: 498,091 (2003).\n\n==Telephones==\n\n* Main lines in use: 1.6 million (2015 est)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://world.bymap.org/TelephoneLines.html|title=Telephone Lines / Countries of the World|website=world.bymap.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>.\n* [[Mobile phone|Mobile cellular]]: 8.98 million lines (2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/639912/number-of-mobile-cellular-subscriptions-in-bulgaria/|title=Mobile cellular subscriptions in Bulgaria 2000-2016 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>.\n* Telephone system:\n** ''General assessment:'' an extensive but antiquated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era;

As of December 2015, the country had 774 kilometers of [[Highways in Bulgaria|highways]].\n\nBuses play a significant role in long distance public transport, coaches are operated by public and private companies. Sofia has three major national bus terminals, the Central, the Western and the Southern Terminals, and a separate terminal for international routes. In the countryside [[share taxi]]s are in operation between smaller settlements.\n\nRailway systems are mostly outdated, the average speed is very low, however, upgrading projects are underway. The national railways company is [[BD\u017d]], but private freight operators are also present. The [[Sofia Metro]] has two lines, and a third is being built as of 2016.\n\nAir traffic has been growing since the 2000s, which was facilitated by the opening of a second terminal at [[Sofia Airport]], as well as the implementation of new destinations and routes.

The Commander-in-Chief is the [[President of Bulgaria]] (since January 2017 [[Rumen Radev]]). The Ministry of Defence is in charge of political leadership while overall military command remains in the hands of the Defence Staff, headed by the Chief of the Defence (formerly called the Chief of the General Staff). There are three main branches, named literally the Land Forces, the Air Forces and the Naval Forces and the term \"Bulgarian Army\" encompasses them all together.\n\nThroughout history, the Army has played a major role in defending the country's [[sovereignty]]. Only several years after its liberation (1878), Bulgaria became a regional military power and was involved in several major wars \u2013 [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] (1885), [[First Balkan War]] (1912\u201313), [[Second Balkan War]] (1913), [[First World War]] (1915\u20131918) and [[Second World War]] (1941\u20131945), during which the Army gained significant combat experience. During the [[Cold War]] the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] maintained one of the largest militaries in the [[Warsaw Pact]], numbering an estimated 152,000 troops in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0216)|title=Bulgaria \u2013 Military Personnel|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Since the [[Fall of Communism]], the political leadership decided to pursue a pro-[[NATO]] policy, thus reducing military personnel and weaponry. Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on 29 March 2004 and currently maintains a total 776 deployed troops in three countries.\n\nThe [[patron saint]] of the Bulgarian Army is [[St. George]].

In 1883 the military was reorganized in four infantry [[brigade]]s (in Sofia, Pleven, Ruse and Shumen) and one cavalry [[brigade]].\n\n===Serbo-Bulgarian war===\n{{main|Serbo-Bulgarian War}}\nThe Serbo-Bulgarian War was the first armed conflict after [[Liberation of Bulgaria|Bulgaria's liberation]]. It was a result of the [[Bulgarian unification|unification]] with [[Eastern Rumelia]], which happened on 6 September 1885. The unification was not completely recognized, however, and one of the countries that refused to recognize the act was the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] had been expanding its influence in the [[Balkans]] and was particularly opposed. Serbia also feared this would diminish its dominance in the region. In addition, Serbian ruler [[Milan Obrenovi\u0107 IV]] was annoyed that Serbian opposition leaders like [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]], who had escaped persecution after the [[Timok Rebellion]], had found asylum in Bulgaria. Lured by Austria-Hungary's promises of territorial gains from Bulgaria (in return for concessions in the western Balkans), Milan IV declared war on Bulgaria on 14 November 1885.\n\nMilitary strategy relied largely on surprise, as Bulgaria had moved most of its troops near the border with the Ottoman Empire, in the southeast. As it happened, the Ottomans did not intervene and the Serbian army's advance was stopped after the [[Battle of Slivnitsa]]. The main body of the Bulgarian army traveled from the Ottoman border in the southeast to the Serbian border in the northwest to defend the capital, [[Sofia]]. After the defensive battles at Slivnitsa and [[Vidin]], Bulgaria began an offensive that took the city of [[Pirot]]. At this point the Austro-Hungarian Empire stepped in, threatening to join the war on Serbia's side if Bulgarian troops did not retreat. Fighting lasted for only 14 days, from 14\u201328 November. A peace treaty was signed in [[Bucharest]] on 19 February 1886. No territorial changes were made to either country, but Bulgarian unification was recognized by the Great Powers.\n\n===First Balkan War===\n{{main|First Balkan War}}\nInstability in the Balkan region in the early 1900s quickly became a precondition for a new war. Serbia's aspirations towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were thwarted by the [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austrian annexation of the province]] in October 1908, so the Serbs focused their attention onto their historic cradle, Kosovo, and to the south for expansion. Greek officers, [[Goudi coup|revolting]] in August 1909, had secured the appointment of a progressive government under [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], which they hoped would resolve the [[History of Crete#Modern Crete|Cretan issue]] in Greece's favor and reverse their [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|defeat of 1897 by the Ottomans]]. Bulgaria, which had secured Ottoman recognition of its independence in April 1909 and enjoyed the friendship of Russia, also looked to districts of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia for expansion.\n\n[[File:Camels on the way to Catalca, 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A [[camel]] caravan of the Bulgarian 17th Regiment carrying supplies for the [[First Battle of \u00c7atalca|\u00c7atalca operation]], 1912 ]]\n\nIn March 1910 an [[Albanians|Albanian]] insurrection broke out in Kosovo. In August Montenegro followed Bulgaria's precedent by becoming a kingdom. In 1911 Italy launched an [[Italo-Turkish War|invasion of Tripolitania]], which was quickly followed by the occupation of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire greatly influenced the Balkan states to prepare for war against Turkey. Thus, in the spring of 1912 consultations among the various Christian Balkan nations resulted in a network of military alliances that became known as the [[Balkan League]]. The Great Powers, most notably France and Austria-Hungary, reacted to this diplomatic sensation by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed.\n\nIn late September both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. Montenegro was the first to declare war, on 25 September ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/ 8 October. The other three states, after issuing an impossible ultimatum to the Porte on 13 October, declared war on Turkey on 17 October. The Balkan League relied on 700,000 troops, 370,000 of whom were Bulgarians. Bulgaria, often dubbed \"the [[Prussia]] of the Balkans\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/4/4/7/14477/14477-h/14477-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of THE INSIDE STORY OF THE PEACE CONFERENCE, by Dr. E.J.

The Bulgarians also possessed a small navy of six torpedo boats, which were restricted to operations along the country's [[Black Sea]] coast.<ref name=Hall17>{{harvnb|Hall|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bulgarian army adrinople.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Soldiers preparing for an assault against [[Adrianople]], 1912]]\nBulgaria's war aims were focused on [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. For the latter, Bulgaria had a secret agreement with Serbia to divide it between them, signed on 13 March 1912 during the negotiations that led to the establishment of the Balkan League. However, it was not a secret that Bulgaria's target was the fulfillment of the never-materialized [[Treaty of San Stefano]], signed after the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u201378]]. They deployed their main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]], under Gen. [[Vasil Kutinchev]] with three infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of [[Yambol]], with direction of operations along the [[Tundzha]] River. The [[Second Army(Bulgaria)|Second Army]], under Gen. [[Nikola Ivanov]] with two infantry divisions and one infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianople (now [[Edirne]]). According to the plans, the [[Third Army(Bulgaria)|Third Army]], under Gen. [[Radko Dimitriev]], was deployed east of and behind the First and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from the Turkish view. The Third Army had three infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the Stranja mountain and to take the fortress of Lozengrad ([[Kirk Kilisse]]). The 2nd and 7th divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in [[western Thrace]] and eastern Macedonia, respectively.\n\nThe first great battles were at the [[Adrianople]]\u2013[[Kirk Kilisse]] defensive line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 110,000 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (130,000 men) near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The fortress of [[Adrianople]] was [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|besieged]] and [[Battle of Kirk Kelesse|Kirk Kilisse was taken]] without resistance under the pressure of the Bulgarian Third Army. The initial Bulgarian attack by First and Third Army defeated the Turkish forces, numbering some 130,000, and reached the [[Sea of Marmara]]. However, the Turks, with the aid of fresh reinforcements from the Asian provinces, established their third and strongest defensive position at the [[Chataldja]] Line, across the peninsula where [[Constantinople]] is located. New Turkish forces landed at [[Bulair]] and [[\u015eark\u00f6y]], but after heavy fighting they were crushed by the newly formed 4th Bulgarian Army under the command of Gen [[Stiliyan Kovachev]]. The offensive at [[Chataldja]] failed, too. On 11 March the final Bulgarian [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|assault on Adrianople]] began. Under the command of Gen. [[Georgi Vazov]] the Bulgarians, reinforced with two Serb divisions, conquered the \"untakeable\" city. On 17/30 May a peace treaty was signed between Turkey and the Balkan Alliance. The First Balkan War, which lasted from October 1912-May 1913, strengthened Bulgaria's position as a regional military power, significantly reduced Ottoman influence over the Balkans and resulted in the formation of an independent Albanian state.\n\n===Second Balkan War===\n{{main|Second Balkan War}}\nThe peace settlement of the First Balkan War proved unsatisfactory for both Serbia and Bulgaria. Serbia refused to cede a part of the territories in Macedonia, which it occupied and promised to give to Bulgaria according to a secret agreement. Serbia, on its side, was not satisfied with the independence of Albania and sought a secret alliance with Greece. Armed skirmishes between Serbian and Bulgarian troops occurred.\n\nOn 16 June 1913, just a few months after the end of the first war, the Bulgarian government ordered an attack on Serbian and Greek positions in Macedonia, without declaring war. Almost all of Bulgaria's 500,000-man standing army was positioned against these two countries, on two fronts\u2014western and southern\u2014while the borders with Romania and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were left almost unguarded. Montenegro sent a 12,000-strong force to assist the Serbs. Exhausted from the previous war, which took the highest toll on Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army soon turned to the defensive. Romania attacked from the north and northeast and the Ottoman Empire also intervened in [[Thrace]]. Allied numerical superiority was almost 2:1. After a month and two days of fighting, the war ended as a moral disaster for Bulgaria, and at the same time its economy was ruined and its military demoralized.\n\n===First World War===\n{{main|Bulgaria during World War I}}\n[[File:Nikola Todorov Zhekov.jpg|thumb|170px|Gen. [[Nikola Zhekov]], Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgarian Army during World War I]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] participated in World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]] between 15 October 1915, when the country declared war on [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and 29 September 1918, when the [[Armistice with Bulgaria|Armistice of Thessalonica]] was signed. In the aftermath of the [[Balkan Wars]], Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government of [[Vasil Radoslavov]] aligned the country with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. However, Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as its own.\n\nIn 1915 Germany promised to restore the boundaries according to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October of that year. In the First World War Bulgaria decisively asserted its military capabilities. The [[Battle of Doiran (1917)|second Battle of Doiran]], with Gen. [[Vladimir Vazov]] as commander, inflicted a heavy blow on the numerically superior [[British army]], which suffered 12,000 casualties against 2,000 from the opposite side. One year later, during the [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|third battle of Doiran]], the United Kingdom, supported by Greece, once again suffered a humiliating defeat, losing 3,155 men against just about 500 on the Bulgarian side. The reputation of the [[French army]] also suffered badly. The [[Battle of the Red Wall]] was marked by the total defeat of the French forces, with 5,700 out of 6,000 men killed. The 261 Frenchmen who survived were captured by Bulgarian soldiers.\n\nDespite the outstanding victories, Germany was near defeat, which meant that Bulgaria would be left without its most powerful ally. The [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution]] of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. In 1919 Bulgaria officially left the war with the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]].\n\n===The army between the World Wars===\n[[File:Fiat Ansaldo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bulgarian [[L3/33|CV-33]] tankettes, early 1930s]]\nThe Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine proved to be a severe blow to Bulgaria's military. According to the treaty, the country had no right to organize a [[conscription]]-based military. The professional army was to be no more than 20,000 men, including internal forces and border guards. Equipping the army with tanks, submarines, bombers and heavy artillery was strictly prohibited, although Bulgaria managed to get around some of these prohibitions. Nevertheless, on the eve of World War II the Bulgarian army was still well-trained and well-equipped.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main|Bulgaria during World War II}}\n\nThe government of the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] under Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]] declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains, especially in the lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighboring countries after the [[Second Balkan War]] and World War I. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. Turkey had a [[non-aggression pact]] with Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940 Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating a recovery of [[Southern Dobruja]] with the [[Treaty of Craiova]] (see [[Second Vienna Award]]). Southern Dobruja had been part of Romania since 1913. This recovery of territory reinforced hopes for resolving other territorial problems without direct involvement in the war. The country joined the [[Axis Powers]] in 1941, when [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops preparing to invade [[Yugoslavia]] and Greece reached the Bulgarian borders and demanded permission to pass through its territory.\n\n[[File:376bombgroup-bulgaria-01-jun-1944.gif|thumb|right|The [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II]], 1944]]\n\nOn 1 March 1941, Bulgaria signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] officially joined the Axis bloc. After a short period of inaction, the army launched an operation against [[Yugoslavia]] and Greece. The goal of reaching the shores of the [[Aegean sea]] and completely occupying the region of Macedonia was successful. Even though Bulgaria did not send any troops to support the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]], its navy was involved in a number of skirmishes with the [[Soviet Black Sea Fleet]], which attacked Bulgarian shipping. Besides this, Bulgarian armed forces garrisoned in the Balkans battled various resistance groups. The Bulgarian government declared a token war on the United Kingdom and the United States near the end of 1941, an act that resulted in the [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|bombing of Sofia]] and other Bulgarian cities by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft.\n\nSome communist activists managed to begin a guerrilla movement, headed by the underground [[Bulgarian Communist Party]]. A resistance movement called [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Otechestven front]] (Fatherland front, Bulgarian: \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442) was set up in August 1942 by the Communist Party, the [[Zveno]] movement and a number of other parties to oppose the elected government, after a number of Allied victories indicated that the Axis might lose the War. In 1943 Tsar [[Boris III]] died suddenly. In the summer of 1944, after having crushed the Nazi defense around [[Ia\u015fi]] and [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], the [[Soviet Army]] was approaching the Balkans and Bulgaria. On 23 August 1944 Romania quit the Axis Powers, declared war on Germany and allowed Soviet forces to cross its territory to reach Bulgaria. On 26 August 1944 the Fatherland Front made the decision to incite an armed rebellion against the government, which led to the appointment of a new government on 2 September. Support for the government was withheld by the Fatherland Front, since it was composed of pro-Nazi elements, in a desperate attempt to hold on to power. On 5 September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war and invaded Bulgaria.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0054]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015203636/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+bg0054 |date=15 October 2017 }}</ref> On 8 September 1944 the Bulgarian army joined the Soviet Union in its war against Germany.\n\n===Cold War era===\nAs the [[Red Army]] invaded Bulgaria in 1944<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-1832.html|title=Bulgaria - Table A.

Moscow quickly supplied Bulgaria with [[T-34-85]] tanks, [[SU-100]] guns, [[Il-2]] attack planes and other new combat machinery. As the country was a Soviet satellite, it was a part of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and entered the [[Warsaw Pact]] as one of its founders. By this time the army had expanded to over 200,000 men with hundreds of thousands of more reserve troops. Military service was obligatory. A special [[defensive line]], known as the [[Krali Marko defensive line]], was constructed along the entire border with Turkey. It was heavily fortified with concrete walls and turrets of T-34, [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]] tanks.\n\nThe army was involved in a number of border skirmishes from 1948 to 1952, repulsing several Greek attacks, and took part in the suppression of the [[Prague Spring]] events. In the meantime, during the rule of [[Todor Zhivkov]], a significant military-industrial complex was established, capable of producing armored vehicles, self-propelled artillery, small arms and ammunition, as well as aircraft engines and spare parts. Bulgaria provided weapons and military expertise to Algeria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Nicaragua, Egypt and Syria. Some military and medical aid was also supplied to North Korea and [[North Vietnam]] in the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1970s the Air Force was at the apogee of its power, possessing at least 500 modern combat aircraft in its inventory. Training in the Bulgarian People's Army was exhaustive even by Soviet standards; however, it was never seen as a major force within the Warsaw Pact.<ref>[http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/cold-war-country-information.cfm?country=Bulgaria&topic=Army Bulgaria \u2013 Army], Nationalcoldwarexhibition.org</ref> In 1989, when the [[Cold War]] was coming to its end, the army (the combined number of ground, air and naval forces) numbered about 120,000 men, most of them conscripts. There were, however, a number of services which, while falling outside of Ministry of Defense jurisdiction in peacetime, were considered part of the armed forces. These were foremost the Labor Troops (construction forces), the [[Militsiya|People's Militia]] (the police forces of the country, which fell under Ministry of the Interior jurisdiction, but the ministry was itself a militarized structure) and, more importantly, its Interior Troops, the Border Troops\u2014which in different periods fell under either Ministry of Defense or Ministry of the Interior control\u2014Civil Defense Service, the Signals Troops (government communications) and the Transport Troops (mostly railway infrastructure maintenance), which were two separate services under the Postal and Communications Committee (a ministry), etc. The combined strength of the Bulgarian People's Army and all those services reached well over 325,000 troops.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:SF - dismounted patrol.JPG|thumb|right|A Land Forces dismounted patrol in Afghanistan, January 2011]]\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]] and the end of the [[Cold War]], Bulgaria could no longer support a vast military. A rapid reduction in personnel and active equipment was to be carried out in parallel with a general re-alignment of strategic interests. In 1990, Bulgaria had a total of more than 2,400 tanks, 2,000 armored vehicles, 2,500 large caliber artillery systems,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0208)|title=Ground Forces|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> 300 fighter and bomber aircraft, 100 trainer aircraft, more than 40 combat and 40 transport helicopters,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0209)|title=Air and Air Defense Forces|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> 4 submarines, 6 fast missile craft, 2 frigates, 5 corvettes, 6 torpedo boats, 9 patrol craft, 30 minesweepers and 21 transport vessels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0210)|title=Naval Forces|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> Due to the economic crisis that affected most former Eastern bloc countries, a steady reform in the military could not be carried out; much of the equipment fell into disrepair and some of it was smuggled and sold to the international black market. Inadequate payments, fuel and spare part shortages and the disbandment of many capable units led to an overall drop in combat readiness, morale and discipline.\n\nAfter partially recovering from the 1990s crisis, the Bulgarian military became a part of the collective defensive system of [[NATO]].

The most recent overseas operation of the Navy was along the coast of Libya as part of [[Operation Unified Protector]].\n\n===Budget===\nAfter the collapse of the Warsaw pact, Bulgaria lost the ability to acquire cheap fuel and spares for its military. A large portion of its nearly 2,000 [[T-55]] tanks fell into disrepair, and eventually almost all of them were scrapped or sold to other countries. In the early 1990s the budget was so small, that regulars only received token-value payments. Many educated and well-trained officers lost the opportunity to educate younger soldiers, as the necessary equipment and basis lacked adequate funding. Military spending increased gradually, especially in the last 10 years. As of 2005, the budget was no more than $400 mln., while military spending for 2009 amounted to more than $1.3 bln. \u2013 almost a triple increase for 4 years. Despite this growth, the military still does not receive sufficient funds for modernization. An example of bad spending plans is the large-scale purchasing of transport aircraft, while the Air Force has a severe need of new fighters (the [[MiG-29]]s, even though modernized, are nearing their operational limits). The planned procurement of 2\u20134 [[Gowind class corvette]]s has been cancelled. As of 2009, military spending were about 1.98% of GDP. In 2010 the budget is to be only 1.3% due to the international financial crisis.\n\n==Land Forces==\n[[File:Bulgarian T-72 tanks.JPEG|thumb|220px|T-72 tanks advance towards the OPFOR on an exercise]]\n\n{{main|Bulgarian Land Forces}}\nThe Land Forces are functionally divided into '''Deployable''' and '''Reserve Forces'''. Their main functions include deterrence, defence, peace support and [[crisis management]], humanitarian and rescue missions, as well as social functions within Bulgarian society. Active troops in the land forces number about 18,000 men, and reserve troops number about 13,000.<ref name=\"mod.bg\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.bg/en/doc/misc/20110207_AFDP_ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628195116/http://www.mod.bg/en/doc/misc/20110207_AFDP_ENG.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe equipment of the land forces is impressive in terms of numbers, but most of it is nonoperational and scheduled to be scrapped or refurbished and exported to other nations. Bulgaria has a military stockpile of about 5,000,000 small arms, models ranging from World War II-era [[MP 40]] machine pistols to modern [[Steyr AUG]], [[AK-74]], HK [[MP5]], [[HK416]] and AR-M12F assault rifles.\n\n===National guard unit===\n{{main|National guard unit}}\n\nThe National Guard of Bulgaria, founded in 1879, is the successor to the personal guards of [[Knyaz]] [[Alexander I of Bulgaria|Alexander I]]. On 12 July of that year, the guards escorted the Bulgarian [[knyaz]] for the first time; today the official holiday of the National Guard is celebrated on 12 July. Throughout the years the structure of the guards has evolved, going from convoy to squadron, to regiment and, subsequent to 1942, to division. Today it includes military units for army salute and wind orchestra duties.\n\nIn 2001, the National Guard unit was designated an official military unit of the Bulgarian army and one of the symbols of state authority, along with the flag, the coat of arms and the national anthem. It is a formation, directly subordinate to the Minister of Defence and while legally part of the armed forces, it is totally independent from the Defence Staff.\n\n===Statistics and equipment===\n{{main|Modern equipment of the Bulgarian land forces}}\n''Note'': This table represents active equipment only; there are large numbers of equipment in reserve status.<ref>[http://www.mod.bg/en/doc/misc/20110207_AFDP_ENG.pdf Armed Forces Development Plan], Ministry of Defence of Bulgaria</ref> They are not listed here. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f22 style=;\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| '''Statistics'''\n|- \n| Personnel\n| 36,112<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.bg/bg/doc/drugi/20100930_WhiteBook.pdf|title=White Book of the Defense Forces|website=Mod.bg|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Main battle tank]]s \n| '''531''' [[T-72]]M2\n|- \n| Heavy armored vehicles ([[Infantry fighting vehicle|IFV]]s and [[Armoured Personnel Carrier|APCs]])\n| '''674''' ([[BMP-23|BMP-23/A]], [[BMP-1]]P;<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/bulgaria/bulgaria_bulgarian_army_military_equipment_equipment_armoured_vehicle_description_picture.html Bulgarian army] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713034656/http://www.armyrecognition.com/bulgaria/bulgaria_bulgarian_army_military_equipment_equipment_armoured_vehicle_description_picture.html |date=13 July 2009 }} armyrecognition.com</ref> [[BTR-60|BTR-60PB-MD1]], [[MT-LB]], [[MT-LBu]])\n|-\n| Light armored vehicles \n| '''776''' \u2013 [[M1117/Commando Select]] (7/10), [[BRDM-2]] (74), [[HMMWV|M1114 Humvees]] (52),<br> [[Plasan Sand Cat|Sand Cat]] (25), [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|G-class]] (600)\n|-\n| [[Artillery]] pieces over 100&nbsp;mm (excl. mortar)\n| '''500''' ([[BM-21]], [[RM-70 multiple rocket launcher|RM-70]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un-register.org/HeavyWeapons/CountryDetail.aspx?Register_Id=1782|title=Bulgarian arms imports, 2009 calendar year|publisher=[[UNODA]]|accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> [[2S1 Gvozdika|2S1]], [[152 mm towed gun-howitzer M1955 (D-20)|D-20]])\n|-\n| [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]]s\n| '''84''' \u2013 [[SA-10 Grumble]] (10), [[SA-5 Gammon]] (10), [[SA-6 Gainful]] (20),<br> [[SA-8 Gecko]] (24), [[SA-13 Gopher]] (20)\n|-\n| [[Anti-tank missile|ATGM]] systems\n| [[AT-3 Sagger]], [[AT-4 Spigot]], [[AT-5 Spandrel]],<br> [[AT-6 Spiral]], [[AT-7 Saxhorn]], [[BRDM-2]] Konkurs (24 vehicles)\n|-\n| [[MANPADS]]\n| [[SA-7 Grail]], [[SA-14 Gremlin]], [[SA-16 Gimlet]], [[SA-18 Grouse]]\n|-\n| [[OTR-21 Tochka|SS-21 Scarab]]\n| 8 TELs\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Navy==\n{{main|Bulgarian Navy}}\n[[File:41daring.JPG|thumb|right|255px|Bulgarian Fregate Drazki]]\n\nThe Navy has traditionally been the smallest component of the Bulgarian military. Established almost simultaneously with the Ground forces in 1879, initially it consisted of a small fleet of boats on the [[Danube]] river. Bulgaria has a coastline of about 354 kilometers \u2013 thus, naval warfare is not considered a priority.\n\nAfter the downturn in 1990, the Navy was largely overlooked and received almost no funding. No projects for modernization were carried out until 2005, when a [[Wielingen class frigate]] (F912 Wandelaar) was acquired from Belgium. By 2009, Bulgaria acquired two more frigates of the same class. The first of them was renamed ''41 Drazki'' and took part in several operations and exercises, most notably the [[UNIFIL]] Maritime Patrol along the coast of Lebanon in 2006, and [[Operation Active Endeavour]]. It also participated in the enforcement the naval blockade against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s regime off the coast of Libya in 2011 until 2012.\n\nThe equipment is typical for a small navy, consisting mostly of light multi-purpose vessels \u2013 4 [[frigate]]s, 3 [[corvette]]s, 5 minesweepers, 3 fast missile craft and 2 landing ships. Other equipment includes a coastal defence missile battalion armed with locally modified [[P-15 Termit]] missiles, a coastal artillery battery, a naval helicopter airbase and a marine special forces unit.\n\nThe Bulgarian Navy is centered in two main bases \u2013 in [[Varna]] and in [[Burgas]].\n\n==Air Force==\n{{main|Bulgarian Air Force}}\n[[File:Mig29 graf ignatievo.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Bulgarian Air Force|BAF]] [[Mikoyan MiG-29|MiG-29]] at [[Graf Ignatievo Air Base]]]]\n\nIn the past decade Bulgaria has been trying actively to restructure its army as a whole and a lot of attention has been placed on keeping the aging Russian aircraft operational. Currently the attack and defence branches of the Bulgarian air force are mainly [[MiG-21]]s, [[MiG-29]]s and [[Su-25]]s. About 16 [[MiG-29]] fighters have been modernized in order to meet [[NATO]] standards. The first aircraft arrived on 29 November 2007 and final delivery was due in 03/09. In 2006 the Bulgarian government signed a contract with [[Alenia Aeronautica]] for the delivery of five [[C-27J Spartan]] transport aircraft in order to replace the Soviet made [[An-24]] and [[An-26]], although the contract was later changed to only three aircraft. Modern EU-made transport helicopters were purchased in 2005 and a total of 12 [[Eurocopter Cougar]] have been delivered (8 transport and 4 CSAR).3 Eurocopter AS565 Panther for the Bulgarian navy in 2016.\n\nBranches of the airforce include: fighter aviation, assault aviation, intelligence aviation and transportation aviation, aid defence troops, radio-technical troops, communications troops, radio-technical support troops, logistics and medical troops.\n\nThe Bulgarian ministry of defense has announced plans to withdraw and replace the MiG-21 fighters with new ones. Several offers were received from international suppliers \u2013 the United States (offering [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and [[F-18 Super Hornet]]), Sweden [[JAS-39 Gripen]]), Germany ([[Eurofighter Typhoon]]), Italy (second-hand [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]), Russia ([[MiG-29]]) and Israel ([[IAI Kfir]]).<ref>[http://www.otbrana.com/\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438/2011/08/\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442-\u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430-\u0437\u0430-\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430-\u0437\u0430-\u0438\u0437\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435?]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Otbrana.com, 8 August 2011</ref>\n\n===Aircraft inventory===\n{{main|List of active Bulgarian military aircraft}}\nWith the exception of the Navy's small helicopter fleet, the Air Forces are responsible for all military aircraft in Bulgaria.

It lies between the [[Sahara]] desert and the [[Gulf of Guinea]], south of the loop of the [[Niger River]], mostly between latitudes 9\u00b0 and 15\u00b0N (a small area is north of 15\u00b0), and longitudes 6\u00b0W and 3\u00b0E. The land is green in the south, with forests and fruit trees, and desert in the north. Most of central Burkina Faso lies on a [[savanna]] plateau, {{convert|198|-|305|m|ft|0}} above sea level, with fields, brush, and scattered trees.

Tourism is not well developed.\n\n==Area==\nBurkina Faso has a total area of 274,200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 273,800&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land and 400&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> water. Comparatively, it is slightly larger than [[New Zealand]] and [[Colorado]]. Its borders total 3,611&nbsp;km: [[Benin]] 386&nbsp;km, [[Ivory Coast]] 545&nbsp;km, [[Ghana]] 602&nbsp;km, [[Mali]] 1,325&nbsp;km, [[Niger]] 622&nbsp;km, and [[Togo]] 131&nbsp;km. It has no coastline or maritime claims.\n\n=== Extreme points ===\nThis is a list of the extreme points of [[Burkina Faso]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.\n\n* Northernmost point \u2013 unnamed location on the border with [[Mali]], [[Sahel Region]]\n* Easternmost point \u2013 unnamed location on the border with  [[Benin]] immediately south of the Burkina Faso-Benin-Niger [[tripoint]], [[Est Region (Burkina Faso)|Est Region]]\n* Southernmost point \u2013 unnamed location on the border with [[Ivory Coast]] immediately south of the village of [[Kpuere]], [[Sud-Ouest Region, Burkina Faso|Sud-Ouest Region]]\n* Westernmost point - the [[tripoint]] with [[Mali]] and [[Ivory Coast]], [[Cascades Region]]\n\n==Terrain==\nIt is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a Precambrian massif. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a sandstone massif, where the highest peak, T\u00e9nakourou, is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country. Its elevation extremes are a lowest point at the [[Mouhoun River|Mouhoun]] ([[Black Volta]]) River (200 m) and highest point at [[Tena Kourou]] (749 m).\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Burkina_Faso_Provinces.png|thumb|200px|Provinces of Burkina Faso]]\n[[File:Burkina Faso departments.png|thumb|left|200px|Departments of Burkina Faso]]\nThe country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13 administrative regions]]. These regions encompass [[Provinces of Burkina Faso|45 provinces]] and [[Departments of Burkina Faso|351 departments]].\n\n==Hydrography==\nThe country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the Black Volta (or Mouhoun), the White Volta (Nakamb\u00e9) and the Red Volta (Nazinon). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the Komo\u00e9, which flows to the southwest. The basin of the Niger River also drains 27% of the country's surface.\n\nThe Niger's tributaries \u2013 the B\u00e9li, the Gorouol, the Goud\u00e9bo and the Dargol \u2013 are seasonal streams and flow for only four to six months a year. They still, however, can cause large floods. The country also contains numerous lakes \u2013 the principal ones are Tingrela, Bam and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, B\u00e9li, Yomboli and Markoye. Water shortages are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.\n\n==Climate==\n{{See also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}\n[[File:Burkina Faso map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|250px|Burkina Faso map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBurkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between 600 and 900 millimetres (23.6 and 35.4 in) of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] \u2013 a hot dry wind from the Sahara \u2013 blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June to September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The Sahel in the north typically receives less than {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} [13] of rainfall per year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|\u2013|47|C|F|abbr=off}}.\n\nA relatively dry tropical savanna, the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the Horn of Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the Sahara to its north and the fertile region of the Sudan to the South. Situated between 11\u00b03' and 13\u00b05' north latitude, the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|900|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}}[13] of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.\n\n==Resources and environment==\nBurkina Faso's natural resources include manganese, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt and small deposits of [[Mining in Burkina Faso|gold]]. 21.93% of its land is arable, and 0.26% has permanent crops as of 2012. As of 2003, 250&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were irrigated. Its total renewable water resources as of 2011 were 12.5 m<sup>3</sup>{{Clarify|date=December 2015|reason=Should this be \"km\"? Meters is too small.}}, with a total freshwater withdrawal of 0.72&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>/yr (46% domestic, 3% industrial, 51% agricultural; this amounts to a per-capita withdrawal of 54.99 m<sup>3</sup>/yr.\n\nBurkina Faso's fauna and flora are protected in two national parks and several reserves: see [[List of national parks in Africa]], [[Nature reserves of Burkina Faso]].\n\nRecurring [[drought]]s and [[flood]]s are a significant natural hazard.<ref>Heavy floods caused loss of life and widespread damage in 2007 and 2009. See also [[2007 African floods]] and [[2009 West Africa floods#Burkina Faso|2009 West Africa floods]].</ref> Current environmental issues include: recent droughts and [[desertification]] severely affecting agricultural activities, population distribution, and the economy; [[overgrazing]]; [[soil degradation]]; [[deforestation]].\n\nBurkina Faso is party to the following international environmental agreements: [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Marine Life Conservation]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Wetlands]]. It has signed, but not ratified, the [[Law of the Sea]] and the [[Nuclear Test Ban]].<ref>http://www4.unfccc.int/ndcregistry/PublishedDocuments/Burkina%20Faso%20First/INDC%20Burkina_ENG.%20version_finale.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/04_country-information/North-African-regions/burkina-faso.htm</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2010 Sahel famine]]\n*[[:Category:Treaties of Burkina Faso]]\n\n==Line note references==\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Soil Maps of Burkina Faso [http://eusoils.jrc.it/esdb_archive/EuDASM/africa/lists/cbf.htm European Digital Archive on the Soil Maps of the world]\n\n{{Geography of Africa}}\n{{Africa topic|Climate of}}\n{{Burkina Faso topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Geography Of Burkina Faso}}\n[[Category:Geography of Burkina Faso| ]]", "sha1": "f3ee85isnaso4rwgm97t19pge5161lr"}}, {"title": "Demographics of Burkina Faso", "ns": "0", "id": "3678", "revision": {"id": "866584701", "parentid": "866584637", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T07:20:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "ManlyMatt", "id": "26451247"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\nThis article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Burkina Faso]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n[[Image:Burkina-Faso-Demography.png|thumb|300px|right|Demographics of Burkina Faso, Data of [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], year 2005 ; Number of inhabitants in thousands.]]\n[[Burkina Faso]]'s {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Burkina Faso}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people belong to two major West African cultural groups\u2014the [[Gur people|Gur]] (Voltaic) and the [[Mand\u00e9]]. The Voltaic are far more numerous and include the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], who make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso and established an empire that lasted more than 800 years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi are still bound by the traditions of the [[Mogho Naba]], who hold court in [[Ouagadougou]].\n\nAbout 12,000 Europeans reside in Burkina Faso, the majority of whom are French.\n\nMost of Burkina Faso's population is concentrated in the south and center of the country, with a population density sometimes exceeding {{convert|48|PD/km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}. This population density, high for Africa, causes annual migrations of hundreds of thousands of Burkinab\u00e9 to [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Ghana]] for seasonal agricultural work. About a third of Burkinab\u00e9 adhere to traditional African religions. The introduction of Islam to Burkina Faso was initially resisted by the Mossi rulers. Christians, predominantly [[Roman Catholic]]s, are largely concentrated among the urban elite.\n\nFew Burkinab\u00e9 have had formal education. Schooling is free but not compulsory, and only about 29% of Burkina's primary school-age children receive a basic education. The [[University of Ouagadougou]], founded in 1974, was the country's first institution of higher education. The [[Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso]] in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]] was opened in 1995.\n[[File:Vendeuse d'arachides.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Peanut]] seller in [[Ouagadougou]]]]\n\n==Population==\nAccording to {{UN_Population|source}} the total population was {{UN_Population|Burkina Faso}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}, compared to only 4,284,000 in 1950.

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] rated Burkina Faso as a \"[[Democracy Index#Classification definitions|hybrid regime]]\" in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|title=Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit|last=solutions|first=EIU digital|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\n==Political history==\n[[File:Blaise Compaor\u00e9 2014 White House.png|thumb|President [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] ruled Burkina Faso from a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1987 to his resignation in 2014.]]\nIn 1990, the [[Popular Front (Burkina Faso)|Popular Front]] held its first National Congress, which formed a committee to draft a national constitution. The constitution was approved by referendum in 1991. In 1992, [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] was elected president, running unopposed after the opposition boycotted the election because of Compaor\u00e9's refusal to accede to demands of the opposition such as a Sovereign National Conference to set modalities. The opposition did participate in the following year's legislative elections, in which the [[ODP/MT]] won a majority of the seats contested for.\n\nThe government of the Fourth Republic includes a strong presidency, a prime minister, a Council of Ministers presided over by the president, a National Assembly, and the judiciary. The legislature and judiciary are independent but remain susceptible to outside influence.\n\nIn 1995, Burkina held its first multiparty municipal elections since it gained independence. The president's ODP/MT won over 1,100 of some 1,700 councilor seats being contested.\n\nIn February 1996, the ruling ODP/MT merged with several small opposition parties to form the [[Congress for Democracy and Progress]] (CDP). This effectively co-opted much of what little viable opposition to Compaor\u00e9 existed. The remaining opposition parties regrouped in preparation for 1997 legislative elections and the 1998 presidential election. The 1997 legislative elections, which international observers pronounced to be substantially free, fair, and transparent, resulted in a large CDP majority\u2014101 to 111 seats.\n\n==Government==\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{Office-table}}\n|[[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President]]\n|[[Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9]]\n|[[People's Movement for Progress]]\n|29 December 2015\n|-\n|[[List of heads of government of Burkina Faso|Prime Minister]]\n|[[Paul Kaba Thieba]]\n|[[People's Movement for Progress]]\n|13 January 2016\n|}\n\nThe president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term and may serve up to two terms. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the consent of the legislature.\nThe constitution of June 2, 1991, established a semi-presidential government with a parliament (Assembl\u00e9e) which can be dissolved by the President of the Republic, who is elected for a term of 5 years. The year 2000 saw a constitutional amendment reducing the presidential term from 7 to 5 years, which was enforced during the 2005 elections. Another change according to the amendment would have prevented sitting president [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] from being re-elected. However, notwithstanding a challenge by other presidential candidates, in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that because Compaor\u00e9 was already a sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office, thereby clearing the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On November 13 Compaor\u00e9 was reelected in a landslide due to a divided political opposition. In 2010, Compaor\u00e9 was once again re-elected, and the term limit requirement was held to not apply to him. A proposed constitutional amendment in 2014 would have permitted him to run again, but public resistance led to the [[2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising]], and Compaor\u00e9 resigned on 31 October 2014. A transitional government headed by President [[Michel Kafondo]] and Prime Minister [[Isaac Zida]] took power for a one-year mandate. Elections were to have been held in October 2015, but members of the [[Regiment of Presidential Security]] launched [[2015 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]] on 16 September 2015, detaining President Kafando and Prime Minister Zida. RSP commander [[Gilbert Diend\u00e9r\u00e9]] named himself the head of the new [[military junta]], but popular resistance, backed by army and gendarmerie forces not aligned with the RSP, forced his resignation and the restoration of the transitional government a week later.\n\n===Legislative branch===\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Parliament  votes on the law, consents to taxation, and controls the actions of the government under provisions of the constitution. The Parliament, which is made up of the National Assembly and Senate, meets each year in two ordinary sessions, each of which may not exceed ninety days. The first session opens on the first Wednesday of March and the second the last Wednesday of September. If either of these days lands on a holiday, the session opens the next first working day. Each chamber of Parliament meets in extraordinary session on request of the President, demand of the Prime Minister, or of an absolute majority of half of the Deputies or Senators on a specific agenda and closes at the completion of said agenda.\n<ref name=BurkinaFasoConst>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Burkina Faso|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Burkina_Faso_2012.pdf|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Assembly of Burkina Faso|National Assembly]] (''Assembl\u00e9e Nationale'') has 111 members, named Deputies, and are elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]].\n\nThe [[Senate of Burkina Faso|Senate]], as described in the Constitution of Burkina Faso, would consist of representatives from local government divisions, customary and religious authorities, workers, employers, Burkinabes abroad and people appointed by the President of Burkina Faso and serve a term of six years.

Their functions can be terminated during the course of a legislature at the demand of two-fifths and a vote of the absolute majority of the members of the Assembly. In the case of vacancy of the presidency of either chamber of Parliament by death, resignation, or other reason, said chamber elects a new President by the same method. Each chamber has financial autonomy, with the President of the said chamber managing the credits allocated to them for the functioning of the chamber, but with a vote of the absolute majority, the chamber can dismiss the President for incompetence in managing finances.\n<ref name=BurkinaFasoConst />\n\nExcept in the case of [[In flagrante delicto]], any member of Parliament can only be

$790 in 2014. More than 80% of the population relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. Highly variable rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. The [[export]] economy also remains subject to fluctuations in world prices.\n\nThe country has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.\n\nThe Burkinab\u00e9 financial system represents 30% of the country\u2019s GDP and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial system assets. Eleven banks and five [[non-bank financial institution]]s operate in the country.\n\nThe banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.\n\nAs of 2007, the World Bank estimated that 26% of the Burkinab\u00e9 population has access to financial services. The Central Bank of the West African States (BCEAO) reports that about 41 microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate in the country, serving a total of 800,000 customers. Burkina Faso is a member of the regional Bourse Regional des Valeurs Mobili\u00e8res (BRVM) located in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 23% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37% in the Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.\n\nAlthough handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina Faso remains committed to the [[structural adjustment program]] it launched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9%.\n\nMany Burkinab\u00e9 migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina Faso is attempting to improve the economy by developing its [[mineral]] resources, improving its infrastructure, making its [[agriculture|agricultural and livestock sectors]] more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of [[cereal]]s.\n\nThe agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The [[Mossi Plateau]] in north central Burkina Faso faces encroachment from the [[Sahara]]. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited [[water resources]] south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers, living with problems of climate, [[erosion|soil erosion]], and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]], [[maize]], and [[rice]]. The cash crops are [[cotton]], [[peanut|groundnuts]], [[Shea nut|karite (shea nuts)]], and [[sesame]].

Being a landlocked country, Burkina Faso has no [[navy]].\n\nIn 1966 a [[military coup]] deposed the first president of [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lieutenant Colonel [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for 4 years; on June 14, 1970, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a 4-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. After conflict over the 1970 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977, and Lamizana was reelected by open elections in 1978.\n\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions and on November 25, 1980, Colonel [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a bloodless coup. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\n\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later on November 7, 1982, by Major Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). The CSP continued to ban political parties and organisations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.\n\nFactional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and radicals led by Captain [[Thomas Sankara]], who was appointed prime minister in January 1983. The internal political struggle and Sankara's leftist rhetoric led to his arrest and subsequent efforts to bring about his release, directed by Captain [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]]. This release effort resulted in yet another military coup d'\u00e9tat on August 4, 1983. Compaor\u00e9 came to power in a 1987 coup that led to the death of Sankara.\n\nOn February 15, 2011, [[2011 Burkinab\u00e9 protests|soldiers mutinied]] in [[Ouagadougou]] over unpaid housing allowances.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/soldiers-go-on-rampage-over-pay-in-burkina-faso-2268641.html|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Soldiers go on rampage over pay in Burkina Faso|publisher=\"The Independent\"|location=London|date=16 April 2011}}</ref> On April 18, 2011, it was reported that the mutiny had spread to [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]] after demonstrations in [[P\u00f4]] and [[Tenkodogo]].<ref>Stratfor.com, [https://www.stratfor.com/situation-report/burkina-faso-army-mutiny-spreads 'Burkina Faso: Army Mutiny Spreads'], April 18, 2011</ref> On April 29, 2011, the army said the mutiny would end after Compaor\u00e9 promised to improve the military's housing, clothing and food allowances,<ref>[https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE73S1RJ20110429 Burkina president says army vows to end protests]</ref> though there were later protests by soldiers.<ref>Gongo, Simon (25 May 2011).

Unlike the police and security forces, the Army and the People's Militia are organised along Soviet/Chinese models and precepts. The Army is equipped with light wheeled armoured cars, some mounting cannon.\n\nThe [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] estimated in 2011\u201312 that Burkina Faso had 6,400 personnel in the ''Armee de Terre'' in three military regions, one tank battalion (two tank platoons), five infantry regiments that may be under-strength, and an airborne regiment. Artillery and engineer battalions are also listed.<ref>IISS Military Balance 2012, 423\u2013424.</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the United States has begun providing military assistance and training to Burkina Faso's ground forces. It has trained three 750-man battalions for peace support operations in Darfur. During a recent UN inspection, a [[U.S. Department of Defense]] evaluation team found Burkina's ''Laafi'' battalion fit to deploy to Sudan. Using a small Department of Defense International Military Education and Training (IMET) budget, the U.S. Embassy has established English-language courses at an LAT military base, and has brought LAT officers to attend officer basic training courses in the U.S. The government of Burkina Faso has also accepted additional U.S. training assistance in counter-terrorism tactics and humanitarian assistance.

That year, a transient air support base was created with the assistance of the [[French Air Force]]. After acquiring an initial fleet of utility and transport aircraft, the squadron was attached to an inter-army support regiment. In 1970, the ''Escadrille'' was renamed the ''Force A\u00e9rienne de Haute-Volta'', or FAHV, and in 1977 became an autonomous force. In October 1985, the ''Force A\u00e9rienne de Burkina Faso'', or FABF, was officially inaugurated.\n\nThe EHV was initially formed with two [[Douglas C-47]] Skytrain and three [[Max Holste Broussard|MH.1521M Broussard]] aircraft. These were later followed by two [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III SA.316 B]] helicopters, used mostly for liaison purposes, one twin-engined [[Aero Commander 500 family|Aero Commander 500]] light utility aircraft, two [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|Hawker-Siddeley HS.748-2A]] twin turboprop transport aircraft, and two [[A\u00e9rospatiale N 262|Nord 262]] twin turboprop transport aircraft. Two ''escadrilles'' (squadrons) or sub-formations were created: the ''Escadrille de Transport'' (Transport Unit), and the ''Escadrille d'H\u00e9licopt\u00e8res'' (Helicopter Unit). Later, the ''Escadrille d'Entra\u00eenement'' (Training Unit) was added. All squadrons were initially based at Ouagadougou.\n\nIn mid-1984, Libyan military aid brought eight [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] jet fighters, along with two MiG-21U combat trainer versions. These ex-[[Libyan Air Force]]' [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] Fishbed' fighters were based in [[Ouagadougou]], although they were actually operated by the Libyan Air Force on loan by Libya, and were removed in 1985 without seeing combat. A single MiG-17F Fresco that was also operated by the FABF did see combat service in the [[Agacher Strip War]] in 1985\u201386.\nIn 1985, the FABF also acquired two ex-Soviet [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] transport helicopters from an unknown supplier, followed by an additional two Mi-4s. The Mi-4s were operated by the FABF until the late 1980s, when they were taken out of service. Five [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]]/17 transport helicopters were later added to the ''Escadrille d'H\u00e9licopt\u00e8res''. While supervising the ceasefire after the [[Agacher Strip War]], an FABF SA.316B Alouette III crashed at Kouni on 14 January 1986, leaving only one SA.316B still in service with the ''Escadrille d'H\u00e9licopt\u00e8res''.\n\nIn 1986, the FABF formed a new unit, the ''Escadrille de Chasse'' (EdC) (Attack Unit). In mid-1986 six ex-Philippine Air Force [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF.260WP Warrior]] armed trainers/light strike aircraft were acquired from a dealer in Belgium, which offered the FABF a much simpler and less expensive alternative in tactical air support to the expensive MiGs. The Warriors were not only used for pilot training, but also as light strike aircraft, and a number of them were employed by the FABF's ''Escadrille de Chasse'' (EdC). Four additional SF.260WPs were subsequently bought directly from Italy. The six ex-Philippine SF.260WP aircraft were taken out of service in 1993 and returned to their previous owner, although the four newly built SF.260WP aircraft were retained in service, and stationed at Bobo Dioulasso air base.\n\nMost of the other light aircraft acquired by the FABF in the 1970s and 1980s have also now been retired along with the Mi-4 helicopters, but some recent acquisitions have been made, including a [[Beech Aircraft|Beechcraft]] ''[[Beechcraft King Air|King Air]]'', a Piper [[Piper PA-34 Seneca|PA-34 ''Seneca'']], a [[Apex Aircraft|CEAPR]] ''Robin'' light training aircraft, and a single [[Air Tractor]] ''[[Air Tractor AT-802|AT-802]]'' aerial sprayer aircraft for spraying insecticides, purchased after the northern part of the country suffered heavy crop damage from a 2004 invasion of swarming [[Migratory locust|locusts]]. In 2009, two Xenon Gyroplane autogyros were purchased for use by police and security forces.\n\nIn late 2005, the FABF acquired two [[Mil Mi-35]] 'Hind' attack helicopters from Russia in apparent response by moves by neighbouring [[Ivory Coast]] to bolster its own air attack capabilities during the [[First Ivorian Civil War|Ivorian Civil War]].\n\n===Aircraft===\n\n[[File:SIAI-Marchetti SF-260WL Warrior (modified).jpg|thumb|An SF 260C of the Burkina Faso Air Force]]\n[[File:Roundel of Burkina Faso.svg|thumb|right| The [[roundel]] used by the Air Force]]\n==== Current inventory ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|Aircraft\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Origin\n! style=\"text-align:l center; background:#acc;\"|Type\n! style=\"text-align:left; background:#acc;\"|Variant\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#acc;\"|In service\n! style=\"text-align: center; background:#acc;\"|Notes\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Military aircraft#Combat aircraft|Combat Aircraft]]\n|-\n| [[Embraer EMB 314 Super Tucano|Embraer EMB-314]]\n| [[Brazil]]\n| light attack \n|\n| 3<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\">{{cite web |last = |first = |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/asset/21905/waf/|title = World Air Forces 2018 |work= |publisher= Flightglobal Insight |year= 2018 |doi = |accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> \n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Military transport aircraft |Transport]]\n|-\n| [[Beechcraft Super King Air| Super King Air]]\n| [[United States]]\n| transport\n| [[Beechcraft Super King Air#Variants|200]]\n| 1<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n| [[CASA/IPTN CN-235]]\n| [[Spain]] / [[Indonesia]]\n| transport\n|\n| 1<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Helicopters]]\n|-\n| [[Mil Mi-17]]\n| [[Russia]]\n| utility\n|\n| 3<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n| [[Mil Mi-24]]\n| [[Russia]]\n| attack\n|[[Mil Mi-24 variants|Mi-35]]\n| 2<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n| [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Bell UH-1]]\n| [[United States]] \n| utility\n| [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois variants#UH-1H|UH-1H]]\n| 2<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n| donated by the Government of [[Taiwan]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cherisey, de|first1=Erwan|title=Burkina Faso receives Taiwanese Hueys|url=http://www.janes.com/article/71282/|website=IHS Jane's 360|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/2Lr5R|archivedate=12 June 2017|location=Paris|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Eurocopter AS350]]\n| [[France]]\n| utility \n|\n|1<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n|\n|-\n! style=\"align: center; background: lavender;\" colspan=\"7\" | [[Trainer (aircraft)|Trainer Aircraft]]\n|-\n|[[SIAI-Marchetti SF.260]]\n| [[Italy]]\n| basic trainer \n|\n|4<ref name=\"World Air Forces 2018\"/>\n| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*''World aircraft information files Brightstar publishing London File 338 sheet 4\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category}}\n*Alan Bryden, Boubacar N'Diaye, 'Security Sector Governance in Francophone West Africa: Realities and Opportunities,' DCAF/Lit Verlag, 2011.\n*Cooper, Tom & Weinert, Peter (2010).

Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young \"revolutions\" in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.<ref name=\"cs\">Owusu, Maxwell. \"Burkina\".

In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina are to promote continued [[democratization]] and greater respect for human rights and to encourage sustainable economic development. Although the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) closed its office in [[Ouagadougou]] in 1995, about $18&nbsp;million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations. The largest is a [[Food for Peace]] school lunch program administered by [[Catholic Relief Services]]. Burkina has been the site of several development success stories. U.S. leadership in building food security in the [[Sahel]] after the 1968\u201374 drought has been successful in virtually eliminating famine, despite recurrent drought years. [[River blindness]] has been eliminated from the region. In both cases, the U.S. was the main donor to inter-African organizations headquartered in Ouagadougou which through sustained efforts have achieved and consolidated these gains. In 2005, Burkina Faso and the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC) signed a $12&nbsp;million Threshold Country Program to build schools and increase girls' enrollment rates. In November 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Burkina Faso as eligible to submit a proposal for Millennium Challenge Account assistance for fiscal year 2006, making it one of only two countries eligible for threshold as well as compact funding. The Government of Burkina Faso is working closely with MCC staff to finalize its compact submission.\n|}\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of diplomatic missions in Burkina Faso]]\n* [[List of diplomatic missions of Burkina Faso]]\n* [[List of current ambassadors of Burkina Faso]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{fr icon}}[http://www.mae.gov.bf/SiteMae/index.jsp Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Burkina Faso]\n\n{{Foreign relations of Burkina Faso}}\n{{Africa in topic|Foreign relations of}}\n{{Burkina Faso topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Foreign Relations Of Burkina Faso}}\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Burkina Faso| ]]", "sha1": "7gp3zgo5csssae6ayfzabol0sjh1r1c"}}, {"title": "Burma/Geography", "ns": "0", "id": "3686", "redirect": {"title": "Geography of Myanmar"}, "revision": {"id": "676053042", "parentid": "184601521", "timestamp": "2015-08-14T10:44:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[Geography of Myanmar]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Geography of Myanmar]]", "sha1": "e9hfvzwy8faa8i5q7k2p347jmaq73ue"}}, {"title": "Burma/Economy", "ns": "0", "id": "3689", "redirect": {"title": "Economy of Myanmar"}, "revision": {"id": "676052842", "parentid": "162531836", "timestamp": "2015-08-14T10:42:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[Economy of Myanmar]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Economy of Myanmar]]", "sha1": "qota27fhlz0wi46xjhfjfagmnpl0x59"}}, {"title": "Burma/Communications", "ns": "0", "id": "3690", "redirect": {"title": "Telecommunications in Myanmar"}, "revision": {"id": "676052879", "parentid": "276471798", "timestamp": "2015-08-14T10:42:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "AvicBot", "id": "11952314"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Bot: Fixing double redirect to [[Telecommunications in Myanmar]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Telecommunications in Myanmar]]", "sha1": "lh5hpl5ph0878i2shy5ymoxvvvwexs2"}}, {"title": "Geography of Burundi", "ns": "0", "id": "3695", "revision": {"id": "860582129", "parentid": "841672950", "timestamp": "2018-09-21T17:18:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "Clinamental", "id": "26093074"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Lake Tanganika ---> Lake Tanganyika", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{ref improve|date=February 2013}}\n{{Infobox country geography\n|name = Burundi\n|map = [[File:Burundi map OMC.png|250px]]<br><br>[[File:LocationBurundi.svg|240px]]\n|map size = \n|continent = Africa<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/by.html CIA World Factbook]</ref>\n|region = Central Africa\n|coordinates = {{coord|3|30|S|30|0|E|}}\n|area ranking = 142nd\n|km area = 27830\n|percent land = 92.2\n|percent water = 12.8\n|km coastline = 0\n|borders = 1,140 km (DRC 236&nbsp;km, Rwanda 315&nbsp;km, Tanzania 589&nbsp;km)\n|highest point = [[Mount Heha]] 2670 m\n|lowest point = [[Lake Tanganyika]] 772 m\n|longest river =\n|largest lake = Lake Tanganyika\n}}\n{{MapLibrary|Burundi_sat.png|Burundi}}\n[[Image:Burundi Topography.png|thumb|Topography of Burundi]]\n'''Burundi''' is located in central Africa, to the east of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], at the co-ordinates {{coord|3|30|S|30|0|E|}}.\n\n==Physical geography==\n[[Burundi]] occupies an area equal to {{convert|27830|km2}}  in size, of which {{convert|25680|km2}} is land.  The country has {{convert|1140|km}} of land border: {{convert|236|km}} of which is shared with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{convert|315|km}} with [[Rwanda]] and {{convert|589|km}} with [[Tanzania]].  As a landlocked country, Burundi possesses no coastline. It straddles the crest of the [[Congo-Nile Divide]] which separates the basins of the [[Congo River|Congo]] and [[Nile]] rivers. The farthest headwaters of the Nile, the [[Ruvyironza River]], has its source in Burundi.\n\n===Climate===\nBurundi in general has a tropical highland climate, with a considerable daily temperature range in many areas. Temperature also varies considerably from one region to another, chiefly as a result of differences in altitude. The central plateau enjoys pleasantly cool weather, with an average temperature of {{convert|20|\u00b0C}}. The area around [[Lake Tanganyika]] is warmer, averaging {{convert|23|\u00b0C|1}}; the highest mountain areas are cooler, averaging {{convert|16|\u00b0C|1}}. [[Bujumbura]]\u2019s average annual temperature is {{convert|23|\u00b0C|1}}. Rain is irregular, falling most heavily in the northwest. Dry seasons vary in length, and there are sometimes long periods of drought. However, four seasons can be distinguished: the long dry season (June\u2013August), the short wet season (September\u2013November), the short dry season (December\u2013January), and the long wet season (February\u2013May). Most of Burundi receives between {{convert|1300|and|1600|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year. The [[Ruzizi Plain]] and the northeast receive between {{convert|750|and|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n\n===Terrain===\n[[File:Haut plateau.jpg|thumb|left|Plateau of Burundi]]\nThe terrain of Burundi is hilly and mountainous, dropping to a plateau in the east.  The southern and eastern [[plain]]s have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as part of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion.\n\nThe lowest point in the country is at [[Lake Tanganyika]], at {{convert|772|m}}, with the highest point being on [[Mount Heha]], at {{convert|2684|m}}.<ref>[http://www.countriesquest.com/africa/burundi/land_and_resources.htm Burundi, land and resources]</ref> Natural hazards are posed in Burundi by flooding and landslides.\n\n===Natural resources===\nBurundi possesses reserves of: [[nickel]], [[uranium]], rare earth oxides, [[peat]], [[cobalt]], copper, [[platinum]] (not yet exploited), [[vanadium]], [[niobium]], [[tantalum]], gold, [[tin]], [[tungsten]], [[kaolin]], and [[limestone]].  There is also arable land and the potential for hydropower.  Burundi has {{convert|214.3|km2}} of land that is irrigated.

Other issues include: deforestation, due to the uncontrolled cutting-down of trees for fuel; and habitat loss threatens wildlife populations.\n\n===International agreements===\nBurundi is a party to the following international agreements that relate to the environment: Biodiversity, Climate Change, [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes and Ozone Layer Protection.

[[Kirundi]] is the common language. Intermarriage takes place frequently between the Hutus and Tutsis. The terms \"[[pasture|pastoralist]]\" and \"[[agriculture|agriculturist]]\", often used as ethnic designations for Watusi and Bahutu, respectively, are only occupational titles which vary among individuals and groups.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the two chambers of parliament, the [[Senate of Burundi|Senate]] and the [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]].\n\n==Political landscape after the civil war==\nThe political landscape of Burundi has been dominated in recent years by the [[civil war]] and a long [[Peacebuilding|peace process]] and move to [[democracy]].  The current [[President of Burundi]] is [[Pierre Nkurunziza]], a former rebel leader of the [[Hutu]] [[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy]] who was [[Burundian presidential election, 2005|elected unopposed]] as the new [[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President of Burundi]] by the [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] on 19 August 2005.  Nkurunziza was the first president chosen through democratic means since the start of the [[Burundi Civil War|civil war]] in 1993 and was sworn in on 26 August, replacing transitional president [[Domitien Ndayizeye]].\n\nIn November 1995, the presidents of [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zaire]] (currently [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]) announced a regional initiative for a negotiated peace in Burundi facilitated by former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. In July 1996, former Burundian President [[Pierre Buyoya|Buyoya]] returned to power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless coup]]. He declared himself president of a transitional republic, even as he suspended the National Assembly, banned opposition groups, and imposed a nationwide curfew. Widespread condemnation of the coup ensued, and regional countries imposed economic sanctions pending a return to a constitutional government. Buyoya agreed in 1996 to liberalize political parties. Nonetheless, fighting between the army and [[Hutu]] militias continued. In June 1998, Buyoya promulgated a transitional constitution and announced a partnership between the government and the opposition-led National Assembly. After facilitator Julius Nyerere's death in October 1999, the regional leaders appointed [[Nelson Mandela]] as [[Facilitator]] of the [[Arusha]] peace process. Under Mandela the peace process has revived and important progress has taken place.\n\nIn April 2015 the [[2015 Burundian unrest]] broke out after the ruling party announced President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] would seek a third term in office. Protests in the capital lasted over a week, and while President Nkurunziza was in Tanzania for talks at resolving the situation, Major General [[Godefroid Niyombare]] declared a coup, leading to gun battles in the capital for control of key locations.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{office-table}}\n|[[Rulers and heads of state of Burundi|President]]\n|[[Pierre Nkurunziza]]\n|[[National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy|CNDD-FDD]]\n|26 August 2005\n|-\n|rowspan=2 valign=top|[[Vice-President of Burundi|Vice-presidents]]\n|[[Th\u00e9rence Sinunguruza]]\n|[[Union for National Progress|UPRONA]]\n|29 August 2010\n|-\n|[[Gervais Rufyikiri]]\n|\n|29 August 2010 \n|}\nThe president is elected by the people. He nominates two vice-presidents, who form together with the [[Ministers of the Burundian Government|Council of Ministers]] the executive branch.\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe '''[[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]]''' (''Assembl\u00e9e nationale'') has 118 members, elected for a five-year term by [[proportional representation]] with a 2% barrier. The '''[[Senate of Burundi|Senate]]''' (''S\u00e9nat'') has 49 members, elected for a five-year term by electoral colleges of communal councilors. Extra seats in both chambers can be added to ensure that ethnic and gender quotas are met. Burundi has a [[multi-party]] system, with two or three strong parties and a third party that is electorally successful.

The mainstay of the Burundian economy is [[agriculture]], accounting for 32.9% of [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2008. Agriculture supports more than 70% of the labour force, the majority of whom are subsistence farmers. Although Burundi is potentially self-sufficient in food production, the ongoing civil unrest, [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], and [[soil erosion]] have contributed to the contraction of the [[subsistence economy]] by 25% in recent years. Large numbers of [[internally displaced person]]s have been unable to produce their own food and are largely dependent on international humanitarian assistance. Burundi is a net food importer, with food accounting for 17% of imports in 1997.\n\n==Industry==\nLittle industry exists except for the processing of agricultural exports. Although potential wealth in [[petroleum]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], and other natural resources is being explored, the uncertain security situation has prevented meaningful investor interest. Industrial development also is hampered by Burundi's distance from the sea and high transport costs. [[Lake Tanganyika]] remains an important trading point. The trade [[embargo]], lifted in 1999, negatively impacted trade and industry. Since October 1993 the nation has suffered from massive ethnic-based violence which has resulted in the death of perhaps 250,000 people and the displacement of about 800,000 others. Foods, medicines, and electricity remain in short supply.\n\nBurundi is heavily dependent on bilateral and multilateral aid, with external debt totaling $1.247 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (1.247 G$) in 1997. A series of largely unsuccessful 5-year plans initiated in July 1986 in partnership with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund attempted to reform the foreign exchange system, liberalize imports, reduce restrictions on international transactions, diversify exports, and reform the coffee industry.\n\n[[File:Karuzi Burundi goats.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Goat rearing has been promoted as a source of income for rural-dwelling Burundians.]]IMF structural adjustment programs in Burundi were suspended following the outbreak of the crisis in 1993. The World Bank has identified key areas for potential growth, including the productivity of traditional crops and the introduction of new exports, light manufactures, industrial mining, and services. Other serious problems include the state's role in the economy, the question of governmental transparency, and debt reduction.\n\nTo protest the [[1996 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat|1996 coup]] by President [[Pierre Buyoya]], neighboring countries imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never officially ratified by the [[United Nations Security Council]], most countries refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the [[United States]] also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi. The regional embargo was lifted on January 23, 1999, based on progress by the government in advancing national reconciliation through the Burundi peace process.\n\nIn an article titled \"The Blood Cries Out,\" ''[[Foreign Policy]] (FP)'' reported that the Burundian [[population growth rate]] is 2.5 percent per year, more than double the average global pace, and that a Burundian woman has on average 6.3 children, nearly triple the international [[fertility rate]].  ''FP'' further reported that \"The vast majority of Burundians rely on subsistence farming, but under the weight of a booming population and in the long-standing absence of coherent policies governing land ownership, many people barely have enough earth to sustain themselves.\" In 2014, the average size for a farm was about one acre. ''FP'' added that \"The consequence is remarkable scarcity: In the 2013 Global Hunger Index, Burundi had the severest hunger and malnourishment rates of all 120 countries ranked.\"<ref>Jillian Keenan, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/27/the-blood-cries-out-burundi-land-conflict/ The Blood Cries Out]. \"In one of Africa\u2019s most densely populated countries, brothers are killing brothers over the right to farm mere acres of earth.
