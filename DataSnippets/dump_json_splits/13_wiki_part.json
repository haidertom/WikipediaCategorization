By the 19th century [[orchestral music]] in [[Europe]] had standardized the string section into the following homogeneous instrumental groups: first [[violin]]s, second violins (the same instrument as the first violins, but typically playing an [[accompaniment]] or [[harmony part]] to the first violins, and often at a lower pitch), [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[double bass]]es. The string section in a multi-sectioned orchestra is referred sometimes to as the \"string choir.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Samuel|title=The Study Of Orchestration|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|pages=111}}</ref>\n\nThe [[harp]] is also a stringed instrument, but is not a member of nor homogeneous with the violin family and is not considered part of the string choir. [[Samuel Adler (composer)|Samuel Adler]] classifies the harp as a plucked string instrument in the same category as the [[guitar]] ([[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] or [[Electric guitar|electric]]), [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], or [[zither]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Samuel|title=The Study Of Orchestration|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|pages=89}}</ref>  Like the harp these instruments do not belong to the violin family and are not [[homogeneous]] with the string choir. In modern arranging these instruments are considered part of the rhythm section. The [[electric bass]] and upright string bass\u2014depending on the circumstance\u2014can be treated by the arranger as either string section or [[rhythm section]] instruments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sebesky|first=Don|title=The Contemporary Arranger|year=1975|publisher=Alfred Pub.|location=New York|pages=117}}</ref>\n\nA group of instruments in which each member plays a unique part\u2014rather than playing in unison with other like instruments\u2014is referred to as a [[Chamber music|chamber ensemble]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oxford Music Online|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/05379?q=chamber+music&hbutton_search.x=0&hbutton_search.y=0&hbutton_search=search&source=omo_epm&source=omo_t237&source=omo_gmo&source=omo_t114&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>  A chamber ensemble made up entirely of strings of the violin family is referred to by its size. A [[string trio]] consists of three players, a [[string quartet]] four, a [[string quintet]] five, and so on.\n\nIn most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one [[homogeneous]] unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than [[Musical improvisation|improvise]].\n\nA string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/string-orchestra |title=String orchestra |work=Collins English Dictionary | edition=11th | accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref>  or in conjunction with any of the other instrumental sections. More than one string orchestra can be utilized.\n\nA standard string section (vln., vln 2., vla., vcl, cb.) with each section playing unison allows the arranger to create a five-part texture. Often an arranger will divide each violin section in half or thirds to achieve a denser texture. It is possible to carry this division to its logical extreme in which each member of the string section plays his or her own unique part.\n\n====Size of the string section====\nArtistic, budgetary and logistical concerns will determine the size and instrumentation of a string section. The [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[West Side Story]], in 1957, was booked into the Winter Garden theater; composer [[Leonard Bernstein]] disliked the playing of \"house\" viola players he would have to use there, and so he chose to leave them out of the show's instrumentation; a benefit was the creation of more space in the pit for an expanded percussion section.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burton|first=Humphrey|title=Leonard Bernstein by Humphrey Burton, Chapter 26|url=http://www.westsidestory.com/site/level2/archives/bibliography/bibliography.html|accessdate=22 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629180202/http://www.westsidestory.com/site/level2/archives/bibliography/bibliography.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n[[George Martin]], [[Producer (music)|producer]] and arranger for [[The Beatles]], warns arrangers about the [[Intonation (music)|intonation]] problems when only two like instruments play in unison: \"After a string quartet, I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line . . . as a rule two stringed instruments together create a slight 'beat' which does not give a smooth sound.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=George|title=Making Music: the Guide to Writing, Performing & Recording|year=1983|publisher=W.

The [[Latin]] name of the creed, ''Quicunque vult'', is taken from the [[Incipit|opening words]], \"Whosoever wishes\". The creed has been used by Christian churches since the sixth century. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated. It differs from the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene-Constantinopolitan]] and [[Apostles' Creed]]s in the inclusion of [[anathema]]s, or condemnations of those who disagree with the creed (like the [[Nicene Creed#The original Nicene Creed of 325|original Nicene Creed]]).\n\nWidely accepted among [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]], including the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and some [[Anglican Communion|Anglican churches]], [[Lutheran church]]es (it is considered part of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] confessions in the [[Book of Concord]]), and ancient, [[liturgical]] churches generally, the Athanasian Creed has been used in public worship less and less frequently, but part of it can be found as an \"Authorized Affirmation of Faith\" in the recent (2000) Common Worship liturgy of the Church of England [Main Volume page 145].<ref>{{harvnb|Morin|1911}}</ref><ref name=\"Kantorowicz1957\">{{harvnb|Kantorowicz|1957|p=17}}</ref> \n\nIt was designed to distinguish [[Nicene Christianity]] from the heresy of [[Arianism]]. Liturgically, this Creed was recited at the Sunday Office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] in the Western Church; it is not in common use in the Eastern Church. The creed has never gained acceptance in liturgy among [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] since it was considered as one of many unorthodox fabrications that contained the [[Filioque]] clause. Today, the Athanasian Creed is rarely used even in the Western Church. When used, one common practice is to use it once a year on [[Trinity Sunday]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxwiki.org/Athanasian_Creed|title=Athanasian Creed \u2013 OrthodoxWiki|author=|date=|website=orthodoxwiki.org|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n\n[[File:Shield-Trinity-Scutum-Fidei-compact.svg|thumb|The [[Shield of the Trinity]], a visual representation of the doctrine of the Trinity, derived from the Athanasian Creed.  The Latin reads: \"The Father is God, The Son is God, The Holy Spirit is God; God is the Father, God is the Son, God is the Holy Spirit; The Father is not the Son, The Son is not the Father, The Father is not the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit is not the Father, The Son is not the Holy Spirit, The Holy Spirit is not the Son.\"]]\n\nA medieval account credited [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], the famous defender of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene theology]], as the author of the Creed. According to this account, Athanasius composed it during his exile in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and presented it to [[Pope Julius I]] as a witness to his orthodoxy. This traditional attribution of the Creed to Athanasius was first called into question in 1642 by Dutch Protestant theologian [[Gerhard Johann Vossius|G. J. Voss]].<ref>{{harvnb|O'Carroll|1987}}</ref> \n\nIt has since been widely accepted by modern scholars that the creed was not authored by Athanasius,<ref name=\"Norris1997\">{{harvnb|Norris|1997}}</ref> that it was not originally called a creed at all,<ref>{{harvnb|Richardson|Hopkins|1967|p=483}}</ref> nor was Athanasius' name originally attached to it.<ref>{{harvnb|Faulkner|1910|p=427}}</ref> Athanasius' name seems to have become attached to the creed as a sign of its strong declaration of Trinitarian faith.  The reasoning for rejecting Athanasius as the author usually relies on a combination of the following:\n\n# The creed originally was most likely written in Latin, while Athanasius composed in Greek.\n# Neither Athanasius nor his contemporaries ever mention the Creed.\n# It is not mentioned in any records of the [[ecumenical councils]].\n# It appears to address theological concerns that developed after Athanasius died (including the [[filioque]]).\n# It was most widely circulated among [[Western Christianity|Western Christians]].<ref name=\"Kantorowicz1957\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Bente|2008|p=13}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the creed in a sermon by [[Caesarius of Arles]], as well as a theological resemblance to works by [[Vincent of L\u00e9rins]], point to Southern [[Gaul]] as its origin.<ref name=\"Norris1997\" /> The most likely time frame is in the late fifth or early sixth century AD \u2013 at least 100 years after Athanasius. The [[Christian theology|theology]] of the creed is firmly rooted in the [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian tradition]], using exact terminology of Augustine's ''On the Trinity'' (published 415 AD).<ref>{{harvnb|Schaff|1990}}</ref>{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}} In the late 19th century, there was a great deal of speculation about who might have authored the creed, with suggestions including [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Venantius Fortunatus]], and [[Hilary of Poitiers]], among others.<ref>See {{harvtxt|Jackson|1966}} for examples of various theories of authorship.</ref> \n\nThe 1940 discovery of a lost work by [[Vincent of L\u00e9rins]], which bears a striking similarity to much of the language of the Athanasian Creed, have led many to conclude that the creed originated either with Vincent or with his students.<ref>{{harvnb|Mahajan|Sampaolo|2012}}</ref> For example, in the authoritative modern monograph about the creed, [[J. N. D. Kelly]] asserts that Vincent of L\u00e9rins was not its author, but that it may have come from the same milieu, namely the area of L\u00e9rins in southern Gaul.<ref>{{harvnb|Kelly|1964}}</ref> The oldest surviving manuscripts of the Athanasian Creed date from the late 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Chazelle|1997|p=1056}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\n{{listen|title=Athanasian Creed|filename=Athanasian Creed.ogg|description=Recording of the Athanasian Creed in English}}\nThe Athanasian Creed is usually divided into two sections: lines 1\u201328 addressing the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], and lines 29\u201344 addressing the doctrine of [[Christology]].<ref>See {{harvtxt|Schaff|1877a}} for an example of this division.</ref> Enumerating the three persons of the Trinity (i.e., [[God the Father#Christianity|Father]], the [[Christian views of Jesus|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]]), the first section of the creed ascribes the [[divine attribute]]s to each individually. Thus, each person of the Trinity is described as uncreated (''increatus''), limitless (''Immensus''), eternal (''\u00e6ternus''), and omnipotent (''omnipotens'').<ref>Athanasian Creed, lines 8,9,10, and 13, respectively. See the side by side English and Latin in {{harvtxt|Schaff|1877b|pp=66\u201371}}</ref> \n\nWhile ascribing the divine attributes and divinity to each person of the Trinity, thus avoiding [[subordinationism]], the first half of the Athanasian Creed also stresses the unity of the three persons in the one Godhead, thus avoiding a theology of [[tritheism]]. Furthermore, although one God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from each other. For the Father is neither made nor begotten; the Son is not made but is begotten from the Father; the Holy Spirit is neither made nor begotten but proceeds from the Father \u2013 Western churches include \"and the Son\" ([[filioque]]), a concept which Eastern and Oriental Orthodox reject.\n\nThe text of the Athanasian Creed is as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:75%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! in Latin\n!

Aequalis Patri secundum divinitatem: minor Patre secundum humanitatem. Qui licet Deus sit et homo, non duo tamen, sed unus est Christus. Unus autem non conversione divinitatis in carnem, sed assumptione humanitatis in Deum. Unus omnino, non confusione substantiae, sed unitate personae. Nam sicut anima rationalis et caro unus est homo: ita Deus et homo unus est Christus. Qui passus est pro salute nostra: descendit ad inferos: tertia die resurrexit a mortuis. Ascendit ad [in] caelos, sedet ad dexteram [Dei] Patris [omnipotentis]. Inde venturus [est] judicare vivos et mortuos. Ad cujus adventum omnes homines resurgere habent cum corporibus suis; Et reddituri sunt de factis propriis rationem. Et qui bona egerunt, ibunt in vitam aeternam: qui vero mala, in ignem aeternum. Haec est fides catholica, quam nisi quisque fideliter firmiterque crediderit, salvus esse non poterit.''\n| style=\"width:51.4%\"|\nWhosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith.\nWhich faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.\nAnd the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence.\nFor there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost.\nBut the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal.\nSuch as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost.\nThe Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated.\nThe Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited.\nThe Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal.\nAnd yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal.\nAs also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite.\nSo likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty.\nAnd yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty.\nSo the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God.\nAnd yet they are not three Gods; but one God.\nSo likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord.\nAnd yet not three Lords; but one Lord.\nFor like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord;\nSo are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords.\nThe Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten.\nThe Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten.\nThe Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding.\nSo there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts.\nAnd in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another.\nBut the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal.\nSo that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped.\nHe therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nFor the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;\nGod, of the Substance [Essence] of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance [Essence] of his Mother, born in the world.\nPerfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting.\nEqual to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood.\nWho although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ.\nOne; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God.\nOne altogether; not by confusion of Substance [Essence]; but by unity of Person.\nFor as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ;\nWho suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead.\nHe ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead.\nAt whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works.\nAnd they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.\nThis is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.\n|}\n\nThe Christology of the second section is more detailed than that of the Nicene Creed, and reflects the teaching of the [[First Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the definition of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). The Athanasian Creed uses the term ''substantia'' (a Latin translation of the Nicene ''[[homoousios]]'': 'same being' or 'consubstantial') not only with respect to the relation of the Son to the Father according to his divine nature, but also says the Son is ''substantia'' of his mother Mary according to his human nature.\n\nThe Creed's wording thus excludes not only [[Sabellianism]] and [[Arianism]], but the Christological heresies of [[Nestorianism]] and [[Eutychianism]]. A need for a clear confession against Arianism arose in western Europe when the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]], who had Arian beliefs, invaded at the beginning of the 5th century.\n\nThe final section of this Creed also moved beyond the Nicene (and Apostles') Creeds in making negative statements about the people's fate: \"They that have done good shall go into life everlasting: and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.\" This caused considerable debate in England in the mid-nineteenth century, centred on the teaching of [[Frederick Denison Maurice]].\n\n== Uses ==\n\n[[Image:Trinity knight shield.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a manuscript illustration depicting a knight carrying the \"Shield of the Trinity.\"]]\n\nComposed of 44 rhythmic lines, the Athanasian Creed appears to have been intended as a liturgical document \u2013 that is, the original purpose of the creed was to be spoken or sung as a part of worship. The creed itself uses the language of public worship, speaking of the worship of God rather than the language of belief (\"Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God\").  In the [[Catholic Church]] in medieval times, this creed was recited following the Sunday sermon or at the Sunday Office of [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]].<ref name=\"Pfatteicher1990\">{{harvnb|Pfatteicher|1990|p=444}}</ref> The creed was often set to music and used in the place of a Psalm.\n\nEarly [[Protestantism|Protestants]] inherited the late medieval devotion to the Athanasian Creed, and it was considered to be authoritative in many Protestant churches.  The statements of Protestant belief (confessional documents) of various Reformers commend the Athanasian Creed to their followers, including the [[Augsburg Confession]], the [[Formula of Concord]], the [[Second Helvetic Confession]], the [[Belgic Confession]], the Bohemian Confession and the [[Thirty-nine Articles]].<ref>See {{harvtxt|Melanchthon|1530}}, {{harvtxt|Andre\u00e4|Chemnitz|Selnecker|Chytraeus|1577}}, {{harvtxt|Bullinger|1564}}, {{harvtxt|de Bres|Junius|1562}}, {{harvtxt|Church of England|1563}}</ref>  A [[meter (hymn)|metric]] version titled \"Quicumque vult\", with a musical setting, was published in ''The Whole Booke of Psalmes'' printed by [[John Day (printer)|John Day]] in 1562.  Among modern Lutheran and Reformed churches adherence to the Athanasian Creed is prescribed by the earlier confessional documents, but the creed does not receive much attention outside of occasional use \u2013 especially on [[Trinity Sunday]].<ref name=\"Pfatteicher1990\" />\n\nIn Reformed circles, it is included (for example) in the Christian Reformed Churches of Australia's Book of Forms (publ. 1991). However, it is rarely recited in public worship.\n\nIn the successive Books of Common Prayer of the reformed Church of England, from 1549 to 1662, its recitation was provided for on 19 occasions each year, a practice which continued until the nineteenth century, when vigorous controversy regarding its statement about 'eternal damnation' saw its use gradually decline. It remains one of the three Creeds approved in the Thirty-Nine Articles, and is printed in several current Anglican prayer books (e.g. A Prayer Book for Australia (1995)). As with Roman Catholic practice, its use is now generally only on Trinity Sunday or its octave. The Episcopal Church based in the United States has never provided for its use in worship, but added it to its Book of Common Prayer for the first time in 1979, where it is included in small print in a reference section entitled \"Historical Documents of the Church.\"<ref>=\"Hatchett 1980, p. 584\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] churches, it was traditionally said at [[Prime (liturgy)|Prime]] on Sundays when the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Office]] was of the Sunday. The 1911 reforms reduced this to Sundays after Epiphany and Pentecost, and on [[Trinity Sunday]], except when a commemoration of a Double feast or a day within an Octave occurred. The 1960 reforms further reduced its use to once a year, on Trinity Sunday. It has been effectively dropped from the Catholic liturgy since the [[Second Vatican Council]]. It is however maintained in the ''Forma Extraordinaria'', per the decree [[Summorum Pontificum]], and also in the rite of exorcism, both in the ''Forma Ordinaria'' and the ''Forma Extraordinaria'' of the Roman Rite.\n\nIn [[Lutheranism]], the Athanasian Creed is\u2014along with the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']] and [[Nicene Creed]]s\u2014one of the three [[ecumenical creeds]] placed at the beginning of the 1580 [[Book of Concord]], the historic collection of authoritative doctrinal statements (confessions) of the Lutheran Church. It is still used in the liturgy on [[Trinity Sunday]].\n\nA common visualisation of the first half of the Creed is the [[Shield of the Trinity]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References

The first tribes of [[hunter-gatherer]]s moved down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC. Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of [[Mount Benacantil]]. By 1000 BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Phoenicia]]n traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron and the pottery wheel. The Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]] established the fortified settlement  of ''Akra Leuka'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 \u039b\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03ae}}, meaning \"White Mountain\" or \"White Point\"), in the mid-230s BC, which is generally presumed to have been on the site of modern Alicante.\n[[File:Tossal-plantagral.jpg|thumb|left|Archeological site of Tossal de Manises, ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]]\u2013[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]\u2013[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of \"Akra-Leuke\" or \"[[Lucentum]]\"]]\n\nAlthough the Carthaginians conquered much of the land around Alicante, the Romans would eventually rule [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] for over 700 years. By the 5th century AD, Rome was in decline and the Roman predecessor town of Alicante, known as ''[[Lucentum]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]), was more or less under the control of the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] warlord [[Theudimer]] and thereafter under Visigothic rule from 400 to 700 A.D. The Goths did not put up much resistance to the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab conquest]] of ''Medina Laqant'' in the beginning of the 8th century. The Moors ruled southern and eastern Spain until the 13th century ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest). Alicante was finally taken in 1247 by the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] king [[Alfonso X]], but it passed soon and definitively to the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] in 1296 with King [[James II of Aragon]]. It gained the status of Royal Village (''Vila Reial'') with representation in the medieval [[Corts Valencianes|Valencian Parliament]] (''Corts Valencianes'').\n\n[[File:Alacant, gravat d'Alfred Guesdon (1808-1876), ca. 1832.jpg|thumb|Alicante around year 1832. Engraving by Alfred Guesdon]]\nAfter several decades of being the battlefield where the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Crown of Aragon]] clashed, Alicante became a major Mediterranean trading station exporting rice, wine, olive oil, oranges and wool. But between 1609 and 1614 [[Philip III of Spain|King Felipe III]] expelled thousands of [[Morisco]]s who had remained in Valencia after the Reconquista, due to their cooperation with [[Barbary pirates]] who continually attacked coastal cities and caused much harm to trade. This act cost the region dearly; with so many skilled artisans and agricultural labourers gone, the feudal nobility found itself sliding into bankruptcy. Things got worse in the early 18th century; after the [[War of Spanish Succession]], Alicante went into a long, slow decline, surviving through the 18th and 19th centuries by making shoes and growing agricultural produce such as oranges and almonds, and thanks to its fisheries. The end of the 19th century witnessed a sharp recovery of the local economy with increasing international trade and the growth of the city harbour leading to increased exports of several products (particularly during World War I when Spain was a neutral country).\n\n[[File:Alicante.jpg|thumb|left|Monjas-Santa Faz Square]]\nDuring the early 20th century, Alicante was a minor capital that enjoyed the benefit of Spain's neutrality during World War I, and that provided new opportunities for local industry and agriculture. The [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in the 1920s saw numerous ''alicantinos'' drafted to fight in the long and bloody campaigns in the former Spanish protectorate (Northern Morocco) against the Rif rebels. The political unrest of the late 1920s led to the victory of Republican candidates in local council elections throughout the country, and the abdication of [[King Alfonso XIII]]. The proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was much celebrated in the city on 14 April 1931. The [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out on 17 July 1936. Alicante was the last city loyal to the Republican government to be occupied by General Franco's troops on 1 April 1939, and its harbour saw the last Republican government officials fleeing the country. Vicious air bombings were targeted on Alicante during the three years of civil conflict, most notably the bombing by the Italian ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' of the [[Mercado Central de Alicante|Mercado de Abastos]] on 25 May 1938 in which more than 300 civilians perished.\n\n[[File:Luceros3.jpg|thumb|Luceros Square]]\nThe late 1950s and early 1960s saw the onset of a lasting transformation of the city by the tourist industry. Large buildings and complexes rose in nearby [[Albufereta]] (e.g. [[El Barco, Alicante|El Barco]]) and [[Playa de San Juan]], with the benign climate being the biggest draw to attract prospective buyers and tourists who kept the hotels reasonably busy. New construction benefited the whole economy, as the development of the tourism sector also spawned new businesses such as restaurants, bars and other tourist-oriented enterprises. Also, the old airfield at Rabassa was closed and air traffic moved to the new [[El Altet Airport]], which made a more convenient and modern facility for charter flights bringing tourists from northern European countries.\n\nWhen Franco died in 1975, his successor [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] played his part as the living symbol of the transition of Spain to a democratic constitutional monarchy. The governments of regional communities were given constitutional status as ''[[Nationalities and regions of Spain|nationalities]]'', and their governments were given more autonomy, including that of the Valencian region, the ''[[Generalitat Valenciana]]''.\n\nThe [[Port of Alicante]] has been reinventing itself since the [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] the city suffered in the 1980s (with most mercantile traffic lost to Valencia's harbour). In recent years, the Port Authority has established it as one of the most important ports in Spain for cruises, with 72 calls to port made by cruise ships in 2007 bringing some 80,000 passengers and 30,000 crew to the city each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not226759.htm |title=El puerto de Alicante registrar\u00e1 72 escalas de cruceros durante 2007 |work=Diariocr\u00edtico de la Comunidad Valenciana |language=Spanish |date=16 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720143417/http://www.panorama-actual.es/noticias/not226759.htm |archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref> The moves to develop the port for more tourism have been welcomed by the city and its residents, but the latest plans to develop an [[industrial park|industrial estate]] in the port have caused great controversy.\n\n{{wide image|Vista de Alicante, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-07-04, DD 71-75 PAN.JPG|1200px|alt=Panorama of Alicante}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Vista de Alicante, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-07-04, DD 77.JPG|thumb|left|Port of Alicante]]\nUntil the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global recession which started in 2008]], Alicante was one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain. The boom depended partly on tourism directed to the beaches of the [[Costa Blanca]] and particularly on the second residence-construction boom which started in the 1960s and revived again by the late 1990s. [[Tertiary sector|Services]] and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy. The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union. The construction surge was the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike. The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national and European regulations. (See [[Port of Alicante]] for details).\n\n[[File:Vista aerea ciudad luz.jpg|thumb|right|Ciudad de la Luz]]\nThe city serves as the headquarters of the [[European Union Intellectual Property Office]] and a sizeable population of European public workers live there.\n\nThe campus of the [[University of Alicante]] lies in [[San Vicente del Raspeig]], bordering the city of Alicante to the north. More than 27,000 students attend the University.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://memoria.ua.es/es/comunidad-universitaria/alumnado.html |title=Annual Report for academic year 2010\u201311 |work=University of Alicante |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005 [[Ciudad de la Luz]], one of the largest film studios in Europe, has had its base in Alicante. The studio has shot Spanish and international movies such as [[Asterix at the Olympic Games (film)|''Asterix at the Olympic Games'']] by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and [[Manolete (film)|''Manolete'']] by [[Menno Meyjes]].\n\n==Government==\n\n[[Gabriel Ech\u00e1varri]] is the Mayor of the city. He was elected for the post on June 13, 2015, following the [[Spanish local and regional elections, 2015|municipal elections]] on May 24, 2015. He was supported by the votes from his own group (6), plus those from leftist parties [[Guanyar Alacant]] (6) and [[Comprom\u00eds]] (3), as well as from centre-right party [[Ciudadanos]] (6). The [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (''Partido Popular'', PP), with only 8 elected seats, lost the majority.\n\nIn the previous [[Spanish local and regional elections, 2011|municipal elections]] of May 2011, [[Sonia Castedo]] of People's Party won the elections with an [[absolute majority]], but resigned in December 2014 due to her involvement in several corruption scandals, at present being under investigation. Her fellow party member [[Miguel Valor]] went on to become mayor up until Ech\u00e1varri's election.\n\nAt the foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building (''[[Ayuntamiento]]'') is the zero point (''cota cero''), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea in Alicante.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alicante-ayto.es/cultura/edificios_singulares/ayuntamiento_alicante.html |title=Ayuntamiento de Alicante, Edificios Singulares |work=alicante-ayto.es |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190844/http://www.alicante-ayto.es/cultura/edificios_singulares/ayuntamiento_alicante.html |archivedate=10 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nAlicante enjoys mild winter temperatures, hot summers and little rain, concentrated in equinoctial periods.

The tower (''La Torreta'') at the top, is the oldest part of the castle, while part of the lowest zone and the walls were constructed later in the 18th century.\n\n[[File:Explanada de Espa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|Explanada de Espa\u00f1a]]\nThe promenade ''Explanada de Espa\u00f1a'', lined by palm trees, is paved with 6.5 million marble floor tiles creating a wavy form and is one of the most lovely promenades in Spain. The Promenade extends from the Port of Alicante to the Gran V\u00eda and ends at the famous statue of Mark Hersch. For the people of Alicante, the promenade is the meeting place for the traditional Spanish ''paseo'', or stroll along the waterfront in the evenings, and a venue for outdoor musical concerts. At the end of the promenade is a monument by the artist Ba\u00f1uls of the 19th century.\n\n''Barrio de la Santa Cruz'' is a colourful quarter of the old city, situated on the south-west of [[Castle of Santa B\u00e1rbara|Santa B\u00e1rbara castle]]. Its small houses climb up the hill leading to the walls and the castle, through narrow streets decorated with flags and tubs of flowers.\n\n''L'Ereta Park'' is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Benacantil]], on the way to the castle. It runs from the Santa B\u00e1rbara castle down to the old part of Alicante and consists of several levels, routes, decks and rest stops which offer a panoramic view overlooking the city.\n\n''El Palmeral Park'' is one of the favorite parks of Alicante's citizens. It includes walking trails, children's playgrounds, ponds and brooks, picnic tables and an auditorium for concerts.\n\nJust a few kilometers from Alicante on the Mediterranean Sea lies [[Tabarca]] island. What was once a haven for [[Barbary pirates]] is now a beautiful tourist attraction.\n\n[[File:Bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda, Alicante, Espa\u00f1a, 2014-07-04, DD 40.JPG|thumbnail|Basilica of St Mary.]]\nOther sights include:\n* [[Basilica of Santa Maria, Alicante|Basilica of Santa Mar\u00eda]] (14th\u201316th centuries), built in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style over the former main mosque.

On exhibition at the [[Archaeological Museum of Alicante]] (MARQ) are local artifacts dating from 100,000 years ago till the early 20th century. The collection is divided into different rooms representing three divisions of archaeological methodology: ground, urban and underwater archaeology, with [[dioramas]], audiovisual and interactive zones. The archaeological museum won the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 2004. [[Gravina Museum of Fine Arts]] presents a number of paintings and sculptures from the 16th century to the 19th century. [[Asegurada Museum of Contemporary Art]] houses a major collection of twentieth-century art, composed mainly of works donated by [[:es:Eusebio Sempere|Eusebio Sempere]].\n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:Castillo Sta Barbara.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Castle of Santa B\u00e1rbara]] and Postiguet beach at the final night of [[Bonfires of Saint John|Bonfires of Saint John's festival]]]]\n\nThe most important festival, the ''[[Bonfires of Saint John]]'' (''Fogueres de Sant Joan''), takes place during the summer [[solstice]]. This is followed a week later by seven nights of firework and pyrotechnic contests between companies on the urban beach ''Playa del Postiguet''.

The area was under attack from [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] tribes. While the Mughal artillery and muskets were a formidable force, so too were the skirmishing skills of their opponents. The two sides were in stalemate and Aurangzeb discovered that his army could not live off the land, which was devastated by war. With the onset of winter, he and his father had to make a largely unsatisfactory deal with the Uzbeks, giving away territory in exchange for nominal recognition of Mughal sovereignty. The Mughal force suffered still further with attacks by Uzbeks and other tribesmen as it retreated through the snow to [[Kabul]].

Aurangzeb regretted this and harboured feelings that Shikoh had manipulated the situation to serve his own ends. Aurangbad's two ''[[jagir]]s'' (land grants) were moved there as a consequence of his return and, because the Deccan was a relatively impoverished area, this caused him to lose out financially. So poor was the area that grants were required from [[Malwa]] and Gujarat in order to maintain the administration and the situation caused ill-feeling between father and son.

As an adjunct to resolving the financial difficulties, the proposal would also extend Mughal influence by accruing more lands.

Realising that his recalled Bihar forces would not arrive at Agra in time to resist the emboldened Aurangzeb's advance, Dara scrambled to form alliances in order but found that Aurangzeb had already courted key potential candidates. When Dara's disparate, hastily concocted army clashed with Aurangzeb's well-disciplined, battle-hardened force at the [[Battle of Samugarh]] in late May, neither Dara's men nor his generalship were any match for Aurangzeb.

In the first volume of his Pulitzer Prize winning book series, historian Will Durant<ref>Durant, Will 1935, p.475.</ref> stated the following:\n\n{{quote|Aurangzeb cared nothing for art, destroyed its \"heathen\" monuments with coarse bigotry, and fought, through a reign of half a century, to eradicate from India almost all religions but his own. He issued orders to the provincial governors, and to his other subordinates, 'to raze to the ground all the temples of either Hindus or Christians, to smash every idol, and to close every Hindu school. In one year (1679\u201380) sixty-six temples were broken to pieces in Amber alone, sixtythree at Chitor, one hundred and twenty-three at Udaipur; and over the site of a Benares temple especially sacred to the Hindus he built, in deliberate insult, a Mohammedan mosque. He forbade all public worship of the Hindu faiths, and laid upon every unconverted Hindu a heavy capitation tax.\n\nAs a result of his fanaticism, thousands of the temples which had represented or housed the art of India through a millennium were laid in ruins. We can never know, from looking at India today, what grandeur and beauty she once possessed. Aurangzeb converted a handful of timid Hindus to Islam, but he wrecked his dynasty and his country. A few Moslems worshiped him as a saint, but the mute and terrorized millions of India looked upon him as a monster, fled from his tax-gatherers, and prayed for his death. During his reign the Mogul empire in India reached its height, extending into the Deccan; but it was a power that had no foundation in the affection of the people, and was doomed to fall at the first hostile and vigorous touch. The Emperor himself, in his last years, began to realize that by the very narrowness of his piety he had destroyed the heritage of his fathers.}}\n\nAurangzeb changed the name of one of Hinduism's holiest cities, [[Varanasi|Benaras]], to ''Muhammadabad''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DDjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT149&dq=aurangzeb+benaras#v=onepage&q=aurangzeb%20benaras&f=false|title=The Saffron Book|first=Prafull|last=Goradia|year=2016|isbn=9788128816628}}</ref> Among the Hindu temples he demolished were three of the most sacred, the [[Kashi Vishwanath temple]], [[Kesava Deo temple]], and [[Somnath temple]], and built large mosques in their place.<ref name=\"Mukhiapp25-26\"/> In 1679, he ordered destruction of several prominent temples that had become associated with his enemies, including those of Khandela, Udaipur, Chittor and Jodhpur.\n\nOther scholars point out that Aurangzeb also built many temples.

He further writes how \"Artisans manufacture of silk, fine brocade, and other fine muslins, of which are made turbans, robes of gold flowers, and tunics worn by females, so delicately fine as to wear out in one night, and cost even more if they were well embroidered with fine needlework\".<ref name=\"saudiaramcoworld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         Mughal Maal|publisher=saudiaramcoworld.com|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe also explains the different techniques employed to produce such complicated textiles such as ''Himru'' (whose name is Persian for \"brocade\"), ''Paithani'' (whose pattern is identical on both sides), ''Mushru'' (satin weave) and how ''Kalamkari'', in which fabrics are painted or block-printed, was a technique that originally came from Persia.

Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebels and partially suppressed the revolt, although they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n{{See also|Tomb of Aurangzeb}}\n[[File:Biwi ka Maqbara.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Bibi Ka Maqbara]], the mausoleum of Aurangzeb's wife [[Dilras Banu Begum]], was commissioned by him]]\n[[File:TOMB aURANGAZEB.JPG|thumb|225px|Aurangzeb's tomb in [[Khuldabad]].]]\n\nBy 1689, almost all of [[Southern India]] was a part of the Mughal Empire and after the conquest of Golconda, Mughal victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4&nbsp;million square kilometres,<ref name=\"Taagepera\"/> with a population estimated to be over 158&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"borocz\"/> But this supremacy was short-lived.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mughal Empire |series=The New Cambridge History of India |volume=5 |first=John F. |last=Richards |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=9780521566032 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC&pg=PA1 |page=1 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> Jos Gommans, Professor of Colonial and Global History at the [[University of Leiden]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hum.leiden.edu/history/staff/gommans.html |title=Prof.dr.

The top of his coffin was to be covered with a plain piece of canvas. To the poor he left three hundred rupees earned by copying the Koran. He died at the age of eighty-nine, having long outstayed his welcome on the earth. Within seventeen years of his death his empire was broken into fragments. The support of the people, so wisely won by Akbar, had been forfeited by the cruelty of Jehangir, the wastefulness of Jehan, and the intolerance of Aurangzeb. The Moslem minority, already enervated by India's heat, had lost the military ardor and physical vigor of their prime, and no fresh recruits were coming from the north to buttress their declining power.

The line's name derives from its use in the Medieval French ''[[Roman d'Alexandre]]'' of 1170, although it had already been used several decades earlier in ''[[Le P\u00e8lerinage de Charlemagne]]''.{{sfn|Peureux|2012|p=35}} The foundation of most alexandrines consists of two [[hemistich]]s (half-lines) of six [[syllable]]s each, separated by a [[caesura]] (a word break, though often realized as a stronger syntactic break):\n\n o o o o o o | o o o o o o\n \n o=any syllable; |=caesura\n\nHowever, no tradition remains this simple. Each applies additional constraints (such as obligatory stress or nonstress on certain syllables) and options (such as a permitted or required additional syllable at the end of one or both hemistichs).

Moreover, it equally encourages the very different rhythms of iambic hexameter and dactyllic tetrameter to emerge by preserving the constants of both measures:\n\n iambic hexameter:    s S <u>s S s</u> S | s S <u>s S s</u> S <u>(s)</u>\n dactylic tetrameter: S s <u>s S s</u> s | S s <u>s S s</u> s <u>(s)</u>\n Czech alexandrine:   o o <u>s S s</u> o | o o <u>s S s</u> o <u>(s)</u>\n\n==Modern references==\nIn the comic book ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', the author Goscinny inserted a pun about alexandrines: when the Druid Panoramix (\"Getafix\" in the English translation)  meets his Alexandrian (Egyptian) friend the latter exclaims ''Je suis, mon cher ami, || tr\u00e8s heureux de te voir'' at which Panoramix observes ''C'est un Alexandrin'' (\"That's an alexandrine!\"/\"He's an Alexandrian!\"). The pun can also be heard in the theatrical adaptations.

In contrast, [[digital computer]]s represent varying quantities symbolically, as their numerical values change. As an analog computer does not use discrete values, but rather continuous values, processes cannot be reliably repeated with exact equivalence, as they can with [[Turing Machine|Turing machines]]. Unlike [[digital signal processing]], analog computers do not suffer from the [[quantization noise]], but are limited by [[Noise (electronics)|analog noise]].\n\nAnalog computers were widely used in scientific and industrial applications where digital computers of the time lacked sufficient performance. Analog computers can have a very wide range of complexity. [[Slide rule]]s and [[nomogram]]s are the simplest, while naval gunfire control computers and large hybrid digital/analog computers were among the most complicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/gears-of-war-when-mechanical-analog-computers-ruled-the-waves/|title=Gears of war: When mechanical analog computers ruled the waves|publisher=}}</ref> Systems for [[process control]] and [[protective relay]]s used analog computation to perform control and protective functions.\n\nThe advent of digital computing made simple analog computers obsolete as early as the 1950s and 1960s, although analog computers remained in use in some specific applications, like the [[flight computer]] in [[aircraft]], and for teaching [[control system]]s in universities. More complex applications, such as [[synthetic aperture radar]], remained the domain of analog computing well into the 1980s, since digital computers were insufficient for the task.<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPfU_powAgAC&lpg=PA90&q=%22through%20the%201980s%22 | title=Holographic Visions: A History of New Science | publisher=OUP Oxford | author=Johnston, Sean F. | year=2006 | pages=90 | isbn=0191513881}}</ref>\n\n==Setup==\nSetting up an analog computer required scale factors to be chosen, along with initial conditions\u2014that is, starting values. Another essential was creating the required network of interconnections between computing elements. Sometimes it was necessary to re-think the structure of the problem so that the computer would function satisfactorily. No variables could be allowed to exceed the computer's limits, and differentiation was to be avoided, typically by rearranging the \"network\" of interconnects, using integrators in a different sense.\n\nRunning an electronic analog computer, assuming a satisfactory setup, started with the computer held with some variables fixed at their initial values. Moving a switch released the holds and permitted the problem to run. In some instances, the computer could, after a certain running time interval, repeatedly return to the initial-conditions state to reset the problem, and run it again.\n\n==Timeline of analog computers==\n{{See also|History of computing hardware}}\n\n===Precursors===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing hardware before 1950}}\n\nThis is a list of examples of early computation devices which are considered to be precursors of the modern computers.

Aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving time\u2013distance problems in light aircraft.\n\nThe [[tide-predicting machine]] invented by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters. It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.\n\nThe [[differential analyser]], a mechanical analog computer designed to solve [[differential equation]]s by [[integral|integration]], used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration. In 1876 [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]] had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the [[ball-and-disk integrator]]s.<ref>Ray Girvan, [http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html \"The revealed grace of the mechanism: computing after Babbage\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094710/http://www.scientific-computing.com/scwmayjun03computingmachines.html |date=November 3, 2012 }}, ''Scientific Computing World'', May/June 2003</ref> In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The [[torque amplifier]] was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, [[Vannevar Bush]] and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Analog Computing Machine GPN-2000-000354.jpg|thumb| Analog computing machine at the [[Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory]] circa 1949.]]\n[[File:Heathkit Analog Computer.jpg|thumb|Heathkit EC-1 educational analog computer]]\nThe [[Dumaresq]] was a mechanical calculating device invented around 1902 by Lieutenant [[John Saumarez Dumaresq|John Dumaresq]] of the [[Royal Navy]].  It was an analog computer which related vital variables of the fire control problem to the movement of one's own ship and that of a target ship.  It was often used with other devices, such as a [[Vickers range clock]] to generate range and deflection data so the gun sights of the ship could be continuously set. A number of versions of the Dumaresq were produced of increasing complexity as development proceeded.\n\nBy 1912 [[Arthur Pollen]] had developed an electrically driven mechanical analog computer for [[fire-control system]]s, based on the differential analyser. It was used by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nStarting in 1929, [[Network analyzer (AC power)|AC network analyzers]] were constructed to solve calculation problems related to electrical power systems that were too large to solve with [[numerical method]]s at the time.<ref>Thomas Parke Hughes ''Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880-1930'' JHU Press, 1993 {{ISBN|0-8018-4614-5}} page 376</ref> These were essentially scale models of the electrical properties of the full-size system. Since network analyzers could handle problems too large for analytic methods or hand computation, they were also used to solve problems in nuclear physics and in the design of structures. More than 50 large network analyzers were built by the end of the 1950s.\n\n[[World War II]] era gun [[Director (military)|directors]], [[gun data computer]]s, and [[bomb sight]]s used mechanical analog computers.

The relative resistance of the potentiometer was then equivalent to the formula of the equation being solved. Multiplication or division could be performed depending on which dials were considered inputs and which was the output. Accuracy and resolution was limited and a simple slide rule was more accurate; however, the unit did demonstrate the basic principle.\n\nIn industrial [[process control]], thousands of analog loop controllers were used to automatically regulate temperature, flow, pressure, or other process conditions. The technology of these controllers ranged from purely mechanical integrators, through vacuum-tube and solid-state devices, to emulation of analog controllers by microprocessors.\n\n==Electronic analog computers==\n[[Image:AKAT-1.JPG|thumb|250px|Polish analog computer [[AKAT-1]]]]\n\nThe similarity between linear mechanical components, such as [[spring (device)|spring]]s and [[dashpot]]s (viscous-fluid dampers), and electrical components, such as [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, and [[resistor]]s is striking in terms of mathematics. They can be modeled using equations of the same form.\n\nHowever, the difference between these systems is what makes analog computing useful. If one considers a simple mass\u2013spring system, constructing the physical system would require making or modifying the springs and masses. This would be followed by attaching them to each other and an appropriate anchor, collecting test equipment with the appropriate input range, and finally, taking measurements. In more complicated cases, such as suspensions for racing cars, experimental construction, modification, and testing is both complicated and expensive.\n\nThe electrical equivalent can be constructed with a few [[operational amplifier]]s (op amps) and some passive linear components; all measurements can be taken directly with an [[oscilloscope]]. In the circuit, the (simulated) 'stiffness of the spring', for instance, can be changed by adjusting the parameters of a [[capacitor]]. The electrical system is an analogy to the physical system, hence the name, but it is less expensive to construct, generally safer, and typically much easier to modify.\n\nAs well, an electronic circuit can typically operate at higher frequencies than the system being simulated. This allows the simulation to run faster than real time (which could, in some instances, be hours, weeks, or longer). Experienced users of electronic analog computers said that they offered a comparatively intimate control and understanding of the problem, relative to digital simulations.\n\nThe drawback of the mechanical-electrical analogy is that electronics are limited by the range over which the variables may vary. This is called [[dynamic range]]. They are also limited by [[noise (physics)|noise levels]]. Floating-point digital calculations have a comparatively huge dynamic range.\n\nThese electric circuits can also easily perform a wide variety of simulations. For example, [[voltage]] can simulate [[water pressure]] and [[electric current]] can simulate [[Volumetric flow rate|rate of flow]] in terms of cubic metres per second. An integrator can provide the total accumulated volume of liquid, using an input current proportional to the (possibly varying) flow rate.\n\nAnalog computers are especially well-suited to representing situations described by differential equations. Occasionally, they were used when a differential equation proved very difficult to solve by traditional means.\n\nThe accuracy of an analog computer is limited by its computing elements as well as quality of the internal power and electrical interconnections. The precision of the analog computer readout was limited chiefly by the precision of the readout equipment used, generally three or four significant figures. The precision of a digital computer is limited by the word size; [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]], while relatively slow, provides any practical degree of precision that might be needed.\n\nMany small computers dedicated to specific computations are still part of industrial regulation equipment, but from the 1950s to the 1970s, general-purpose analog computers were the only systems fast enough for real time simulation of dynamic systems, especially in the aircraft, military and aerospace field.\n\nIn the 1960s, the major manufacturer was [[Electronic Associates]] of  [[Princeton, New Jersey]], with its 231R Analog Computer (vacuum tubes, 20 integrators) and subsequently its 8800 Analog Computer (solid state operational amplifiers, 64 integrators). Its challenger was [[Applied Dynamics]] of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].\n\nAlthough the basic technology for analog computers is usually operational amplifiers (also called \"continuous current amplifiers\" because they have no low frequency limitation), in the 1960s an attempt was made in the French [[ANALAC]] computer to use an alternative technology: medium frequency carrier and non dissipative reversible circuits.\n\nIn the 1970s every big company and administration concerned with problems in dynamics had a big analog computing center, for example:\n* ''In the USA'': [[NASA]] (Huntsville, Houston), [[Martin Marietta]] (Orlando),  [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], [[Hughes Aircraft]]\n* ''In Europe'': CEA ([[French Atomic Energy Commission]]), [[MATRA]], [[Aerospatiale]], BAC ([[British Aircraft Corporation]]).\n\n== Analog\u2013digital hybrids ==\nAnalog computing devices are fast, digital computing devices are more versatile and accurate, so the idea is to combine the two processes for the best efficiency. An example of such hybrid elementary device is the hybrid multiplier where one input is an analog signal, the other input is a digital signal  and the output is analog. It acts as an analog potentiometer upgradable digitally.  This kind of hybrid technique is mainly used for fast dedicated real time computation when computing time is very critical as signal processing for radars and generally for controllers in [[embedded system]]s.\n\nIn the early 1970s analog computer manufacturers tried to tie together their analog computer with a digital computer to get the advantages of the two techniques.  In such systems, the digital computer controlled the analog computer, providing initial set-up, initiating multiple analog runs, and automatically feeding  and collecting data. The digital computer may also participate to the calculation itself using [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s.\n\nThe largest manufacturer of [[hybrid computer]]s was Electronics Associates. Their hybrid computer model 8900 was made of a digital computer and one or more analog consoles. These systems were mainly dedicated to large projects such as the [[Apollo program]] and Space Shuttle at NASA, or Ariane in Europe, especially during the integration step where at the beginning everything is simulated, and progressively real components replace their simulated part.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOnly one company was known as offering general commercial computing services on its hybrid computers, [[CISI (French company)|CISI]] of France, in the 1970s.\n\nThe best reference in this field is the 100,000 simulations runs for each certification of the automatic landing systems of [[Airbus]] and [[Concorde]] aircraft.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nAfter 1980, purely digital computers progressed more and more rapidly and were fast enough to compete with analog computers.\nOne key to the speed of analog computers was their fully parallel computation, but this was also a limitation. The more equations required for a problem, the more analog components were needed, even when the problem wasn't time critical. \"Programming\" a problem meant interconnecting the analog operators; even with a removable wiring panel this was not very versatile. Today there are no more big hybrid computers, but only hybrid components.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n== Implementations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\n\n=== Mechanical analog computers ===\nWhile a wide variety of mechanisms have been developed throughout history, some stand out because of their theoretical importance, or because they were manufactured in significant quantities.\n\nMost practical mechanical analog computers of any significant complexity used rotating shafts to carry variables from one mechanism to another. Cables and pulleys were used in a Fourier synthesizer, a [[tide-predicting machine]], which summed the individual harmonic components. Another category, not nearly as well known, used rotating shafts only for input and output, with precision racks and pinions. The racks were connected to linkages that performed the computation. At least one US Naval sonar fire control computer of the later 1950s, made by Librascope, was of this type, as was the principal computer in the Mk. 56 Gun Fire Control System.\n\nOnline, there is a remarkably clear illustrated reference (OP 1140) that describes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maritime.org/doc/op1140/index.htm|title=Basic Fire Control Mechanisms|website=maritime.org}}</ref> the fire control computer mechanisms.\nFor adding and subtracting, precision miter-gear differentials were in common use in some computers; the Ford Instrument [[Mark I Fire Control Computer]] contained about 160 of them.\n\nIntegration with respect to another variable was done by a rotating disc driven by one variable. Output came from a pickoff device (such as a wheel) positioned at a radius on the disc proportional to the second variable. (A carrier with a pair of steel balls supported by small rollers worked especially well. A roller, its axis parallel to the disc's surface, provided the output. It was held against the pair of balls by a spring.)\n\nArbitrary functions of one variable were provided by cams, with gearing to convert follower movement to shaft rotation.\n\nFunctions of two variables were provided by three-dimensional cams. In one good design, one of the variables rotated the cam. A hemispherical follower moved its carrier on a pivot axis parallel to that of the cam's rotating axis. Pivoting motion was the output. The second variable moved the follower along the axis of the cam. One practical application was ballistics in gunnery.\n\nCoordinate conversion from polar to rectangular was done by a mechanical resolver (called a \"component solver\" in US Navy fire control computers). Two discs on a common axis positioned a sliding block with pin (stubby shaft) on it. One disc was a face cam, and a follower on the block in the face cam's groove set the radius. The other disc, closer to the pin, contained a straight slot in which the block moved. The input angle rotated the latter disc (the face cam disc, for an unchanging radius, rotated with the other (angle) disc; a differential and a few gears did this correction).\n\nReferring to the mechanism's frame, the location of the pin corresponded to the tip of the vector represented by the angle and magnitude inputs. Mounted on that pin was a square block.\n\nRectilinear-coordinate outputs (both sine and cosine, typically) came from two slotted plates, each slot fitting on the block just mentioned. The plates moved in straight lines, the movement of one plate at right angles to that of the other. The slots were at right angles to the direction of movement. Each plate, by itself, was like a [[Scotch yoke]], known to steam engine enthusiasts.\n\nDuring World War II, a similar mechanism converted rectilinear to polar coordinates, but it was not particularly successful and was eliminated in a significant redesign (USN, Mk. 1 to Mk. 1A).\n\nMultiplication was done by mechanisms based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trigonometric terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse, the adjacent side was fixed by construction. One variable changed the magnitude of the opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the hypotenuse could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.\n\nTypically, a pinion-operated rack moving parallel to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the hypotenuse. A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At the other end of the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side.\n\nAt any distance along the adjacent side, a line perpendicular to it intersects the hypotenuse at a particular point. The distance between that point and the adjacent side is some fraction that is the product of ''1'' the distance from the vertex, and ''2'' the magnitude of the opposite side.\n\nThe second input variable in this type of multiplier positions a slotted plate perpendicular to the adjacent side. That slot contains a block, and that block's position in its slot is determined by another block right next to it. The latter slides along the hypotenuse, so the two blocks are positioned at a distance from the (trig.) adjacent side by an amount proportional to the product.\n\nTo provide the product as an output, a third element, another slotted plate, also moves parallel to the (trig.) opposite side of the theoretical triangle. As usual, the slot is perpendicular to the direction of movement. A block in its slot, pivoted to the hypotenuse block positions it.\n\nA special type of integrator, used at a point where only moderate accuracy was needed, was based on a steel ball, instead of a disc. It had two inputs, one to rotate the ball, and the other to define the angle of the ball's rotating axis. That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.\n\nA pair of rollers \"above\" and \"below\" the pickoff plane were mounted in rotating holders that were geared together. That gearing was driven by the angle input, and established the rotating axis of the ball. The other input rotated the \"bottom\" roller to make the ball rotate.\n\nEssentially, the whole mechanism, called a component integrator, was a variable-speed drive with one motion input and two outputs, as well as an angle input. The angle input varied the ratio (and direction) of coupling between the \"motion\" input and the outputs according to the sine and cosine of the input angle.\n\nAlthough they did not accomplish any computation, electromechanical position servos were essential in mechanical analog computers of the \"rotating-shaft\" type for providing operating torque to the inputs of subsequent computing mechanisms, as well as driving output data-transmission devices such as large torque-transmitter synchros in naval computers.\n\nOther non-computational mechanisms included internal odometer-style counters with interpolating drum dials for indicating internal variables, and mechanical multi-turn limit stops.\n\nConsidering that accurately controlled rotational speed in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, there was a motor with its average speed controlled by a balance wheel, hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).\n\n=== Electronic analog computers ===\nElectronic analog computers typically have front panels with numerous jacks (single-contact sockets) that permit patch cords (flexible wires with plugs at both ends) to create the interconnections which define the problem setup. In addition, there are precision high-resolution potentiometers (variable resistors) for setting up (and, when needed, varying) scale factors. In addition, there is likely to be a zero-center analog pointer-type meter for modest-accuracy voltage measurement. Stable, accurate voltage sources provide known magnitudes.\n\nTypical electronic analog computers contain anywhere from a few to a hundred or more [[operational amplifier]]s (\"op amps\"), named because they perform mathematical operations. Op amps are a particular type of feedback amplifier with very high gain and stable input (low and stable offset). They are always used with precision feedback components that, in operation, all but cancel out the currents arriving from input components. The majority of op amps in a representative setup are summing amplifiers, which add and subtract analog voltages, providing the result at their output jacks. As well, op amps with capacitor feedback are usually included in a setup; they integrate the sum of their inputs with respect to time.\n\nIntegrating with respect to another variable is the nearly exclusive province of mechanical analog integrators; it is almost never done in electronic analog computers. However, given that a problem solution does not change with time, time can serve as one of the variables.\n\nOther computing elements include analog multipliers, nonlinear function generators, and analog comparators.\n\nElectrical elements such as inductors and capacitors used in electrical analog computers had to be carefully manufactured to reduce non-ideal effects.  For example, in the construction of [[Network analyzer (AC power)|AC power network analyzers]], one motive for using higher frequencies for the calculator (instead of the actual power frequency) was that higher-quality inductors could be more easily made. Many general-purpose analog computers avoided the use of inductors entirely, re-casting the problem in a form that could be solved using only resistive and capacitive elements, since high-quality capacitors are relatively easy to make.\n\nThe use of electrical properties in analog computers means that calculations are normally performed in [[real-time computing|real time]] (or faster), at a speed determined mostly by the frequency response of the operational amplifiers and other computing elements. In the history of electronic analog computers, there were some special high-speed types.\n\n[[Nonlinear]] functions and calculations can be constructed to a limited precision (three or four digits) by designing [[function generator]]s\u2014special circuits of various combinations of resistors and diodes to provide the nonlinearity. Typically, as the input voltage increases, progressively more diodes conduct.\n\nWhen compensated for temperature, the forward voltage drop of a transistor's base-emitter junction can provide a usably accurate logarithmic or exponential function. Op amps scale the output voltage so that it is usable with the rest of the computer.\n\nAny physical process which models some computation can be interpreted as an analog computer. Some examples, invented for the purpose of illustrating the concept of analog computation, include using a bundle of [[spaghetti]] as [[Spaghetti sort|a model of sorting numbers]]; a board, a set of nails, and a rubber band as a model of finding the [[convex hull]] of a set of points; and strings tied together as a model of finding the shortest path in a network. These are all described in [[Alexander Dewdney|Dewdney]] (1984).\n\n== Components ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\n[[Image:NewmarkAnalogueComputer.jpg|thumb|A 1960 Newmark analogue computer, made up of five units. This computer was used to solve [[differential equation]]s and is currently housed at the Cambridge Museum of Technology.]]\n\nAnalog computers often have a complicated framework, but they have, at their core, a set of key components which perform the calculations, which the operator manipulates through the computer's framework.\n\nKey hydraulic components might include pipes, valves and containers.\n\nKey mechanical components might include rotating shafts for carrying data within the computer, [[miter gear]] [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]s, disc/ball/roller integrators, [[cam]]s (2-D and 3-D), mechanical resolvers and multipliers, and torque servos.\n\nKey electrical/electronic components might include:\n* Precision resistors and capacitors\n* [[operational amplifier]]s\n* [[Analog multiplier|Multipliers]]\n* [[potentiometer]]s\n* fixed-[[function generator]]s\n\nThe core mathematical operations used in an electric analog computer are:\n* [[addition]]\n* [[Integral|integration]] with respect to time\n* [[additive inverse|inversion]]\n* [[multiplication]]\n* [[exponentiation]]\n* [[logarithm]]\n* [[Division (mathematics)|division]]\n\nIn some analog computer designs, multiplication is much preferred to division. Division is carried out with a multiplier in the feedback path of an Operational Amplifier.\n\nDifferentiation with respect to time is not frequently used, and in practice is avoided by redefining the problem when possible. It corresponds in the frequency domain to a high-pass filter, which means that high-frequency noise is amplified; differentiation also risks instability.\n\n== Limitations ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}\nIn general, analog computers are limited by non-ideal effects. An [[analog signal]] is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, [[noise floor]], [[non-linearity|non-linearities]], [[temperature coefficient]], and [[Microelectronics|parasitic effects]] within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always [[figures of merit]].\n\n== Decline==\nIn the 1950s to 1970s, digital computers based on first vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits and then micro-processors became more economical and precise. This led digital computers to largely replace analog computers. Even so, some research in analog computation is still being done. A few universities still use analog computers to teach [[Control theory|control system theory]]. The American company Comdyna manufactured small analog computers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comdyna.com/ |title={title} |access-date=2008-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031302/http://www.comdyna.com/ |archive-date=2017-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> At Indiana University Bloomington, [http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~jwmills/ANALOG.NOTEBOOK/klm/klm.html Jonathan Mills] has developed the Extended Analog Computer based on sampling voltages in a foam sheet.

Glenn's chip contains 16 macros, in which there are 25 analog computing blocks, namely integrators, multipliers, fanouts, few nonlinear blocks. Ning's chip contains one macro block, in which there are 26 computing blocks including integrators, multipliers, fanouts, ADCs, SRAMs and DACs. Arbitrary nonlinear function generation is made possible by the ADC+SRAM+DAC chain, where the SRAM block stores the nonlinear function data. The experiments from the related publications revealed that VLSI analog/hybrid computers demonstrated about 1\u20132 orders magnitude of advantage in both solution time and energy while achieving accuracy within 5%, which points to the promise of using analog/hybrid computing techniques in the area of energy-efficient approximate computing.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In 2016, a team of researchers developed a compiler to solve [[differential equation]]s using analog circuits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mit.edu/2016/analog-computing-organs-organisms-0620|title=Analog computing returns|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Practical examples==\n[[File:X-15 Analog computer.jpg|thumb|[[North American X-15|X-15]] simulator analog computer]]\nThese are examples of analog computers that have been constructed or practically used:\n{{div col}}\n* [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] Central Fire Control System\n* [[Deltar]]\n* [[Kerrison Predictor]]\n* [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]]'s Analogue Calculating Machines based on \"fusee sans fin\"\n* [[Librascope]], aircraft weight and balance computer\n* [[Mechanical computer]]\n* Mechanical [[integrator]]s, for example, the [[planimeter]]\n* [[Nomogram]]\n* [[Norden bombsight]]\n* [[Rangekeeper]] and related fire control computers\n* [[Scanimate]]\n* [[Torpedo Data Computer]]\n* [[Torquetum]]\n* [[Water integrator]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Analog synthesizer|Analog (audio) synthesizer]]s can also be viewed as a form of analog computer, and their technology was originally based in part on electronic analog computer technology.

Since one degree is {{sfrac|1|360}} of a [[turn (geometry)|turn]] (or complete rotation), one minute of arc is {{sfrac|1|{{val|21,600}}}} of a turn. A minute of arc is {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|10,800}}}} of a [[radian]]. A '''second of arc''', '''arcsecond''' (arcsec), or '''arc second''' is {{sfrac|1|60}} of an arcminute, {{sfrac|1|{{val|3,600}}}} of a degree, {{sfrac|1|{{val|1,296,000}}}} of a turn, and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|{{val|648,000}}}} (about {{sfrac|1|{{val|206,265}}}}) of a radian. These units originated in [[Babylonian astronomy]] as [[sexagesimal]] subdivisions of the degree; they are used in fields that involve very small angles, such as [[astronomy]], [[optometry]], [[ophthalmology]], [[optics]], [[navigation]], [[land surveying]], and [[marksmanship]].\n\nTo express even smaller angles, standard [[SI prefix]]es can be employed; the '''milliarcsecond''' (mas) and '''microarcsecond''' (\u03bcas), for instance, are commonly used in astronomy.\n\nThe number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is <math>4 \\pi \\left(\\frac{10\\,800}{\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{466\\,560\\,000}{\\pi} \\approx </math> {{val|148,510,660}} square arcminutes (the surface area of a unit sphere in square units divided by the solid angle area subtended by a square arcminute, also in square units - so that the final result is a dimensionless number).\n\n==Symbols and abbreviations==\nThe standard<ref name=\"ASME Y14.5-2009 Dimension PDF\">{{cite web |url=http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~far/ME481/Dimensioing%20Rules%20From%20Standard.pdf |title=ASME Y14.5-2009 Dimensioning |format=PDF |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> symbol for marking the arcminute is the [[prime (symbol)|prime]] (\u2032) (U+2032), though a single quote (') (U+0027) is commonly used where only [[ASCII]] characters are permitted.

For example, if the \"Moon: max.\" circle is 10&nbsp;cm wide on a monitor, viewing it from 10.3&nbsp;m away will show true representation of the sizes.]]\n\nSince antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in [[astronomy]]. In the [[ecliptic coordinate system]], latitude (\u03b2) and longitude (\u03bb); in the [[Horizontal coordinate system|horizon system]], altitude (Alt) and [[azimuth]] (Az); and in the [[equatorial coordinate system]], [[declination]] (\u03b4), are all measured in degrees, arcminutes and arcseconds. The principal exception is [[right ascension]] (RA) in equatorial coordinates, which is measured in time units of hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nThe arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets (e.g. the angular diameter of Venus which varies between 10\u2033 and 60\u2033), the [[proper motion]] of stars, the separation of components of [[binary star system]]s, and [[parallax]], the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the Earth rotates. These small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds (mas), or thousandths of an arcsecond. The unit of distance, the [[parsec]], named from the ''par''allax of one arc ''sec''ond, was developed for such parallax measurements. It is the distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.\n\nThe ESA [[astrometry|astrometric]] space probe [[Gaia mission|Gaia]], launched in 2013, can approximate star positions to 7 microarcseconds (\u00b5as).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37355154|title=Celestial mapper plots a billion stars|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|date=2016-09-14|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nApart from the Sun, the star with the largest [[angular diameter]] from Earth is [[R Doradus]], a red [[supergiant]] with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond.{{efn|Some studies have shown a larger angular diameter for [[Betelgeuse]]. Various studies have produced figures of between 0.042 and 0.069 arcseconds for the star's diameter. The variability of Betelgeuse and difficulties in producing a precise reading for its angular diameter make any definitive figure conjectural.}} Because of the effects of atmospheric [[astronomical seeing|seeing]], ground-based [[telescope]]s will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond; in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more. The dwarf planet [[Pluto]] has proven difficult to resolve because its [[angular diameter]] is about 0.1 arcsecond.<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/plutofact.html NASA.gov] Pluto Fact Sheet</ref>{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\nSpace telescopes are not affected by the Earth's atmosphere but are [[Diffraction limit#Diffraction limit of telescopes|diffraction limited]]. For example, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1\u2033. Techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground. [[Adaptive optics]], for example, can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10&nbsp;m class telescope.\n\n===Cartography===\n\nMinutes (\u2032) and seconds (\u2033) of arc are also used in [[cartography]] and [[navigation]]. At [[sea level]] one minute of arc along the [[equator]] or a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] (indeed, any [[great circle]]) equals exactly one [[geographical mile]] along the Earth's equator or approximately one [[nautical mile]] (1852 meters, or \u22481.15078 [[statute mile]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oceannavigator.com/January-February-2003/Nautical-mile-approximates-an-arcminute/ |title=Nautical mile approximates an arcminute |date=January 1, 2003 |first=George H. |last=Kaplan |magazine=Ocean Navigator |publisher=Navigator Publishing |access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref> A second of arc, one sixtieth of this amount, is roughly 30 meters or 100 feet. The exact distance varies along [[meridian arc]]s because the [[figure of the Earth]] is slightly [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] (bulges a third of a percent at the equator).\n\nPositions are traditionally given using degrees, minutes, and seconds of arcs for [[latitude]], the arc north or south of the equator, and for [[longitude]], the arc east or west of the [[Prime Meridian]]. Any position on or above the Earth's [[reference ellipsoid]] can be precisely given with this method. However, when it is inconvenient to use  [[radix|base]]-60 for minutes and seconds, positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision. Degrees given to three decimal places ({{sfrac|1|{{val|1000}}}} of a degree) have about {{sfrac|1|4}} the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds ({{sfrac|1|{{val|3600}}}} of a degree) and specify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.\n\n===Property cadastral surveying===\n\nRelated to cartography, property boundary [[surveying]] using the [[metes and bounds]] system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines' angles in reference to [[cardinal direction]]s. A boundary \"mete\" is described with a beginning reference point, the cardinal direction North or South followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction, and a linear distance. The boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point, the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction. For example, ''North&nbsp;65\u00b0&nbsp;39\u2032 18\u2033 West&nbsp;85.69&nbsp;feet'' would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65\u00b0 39\u2032 18\u2033 (or 65.655\u00b0) away from north toward the west.\n\n===Firearms===\n[[File:Ballistic table for 7.62x51 mm NATO (mil and moa).png|thumb|right|Example ballistic table for a given [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] load. Bullet drop and wind drift are shown both in [[milliradian|mil]] and minute of angle.]]\n\nThe arcminute is commonly found in the [[firearm]]s industry and literature, particularly concerning the accuracy of [[rifle]]s, though the industry refers to it as '''minute of angle''' (MOA). It is especially popular with shooters familiar with the [[imperial measurement system]] because 1&nbsp;MOA is [[subtend]]ed by a sphere with a diameter of 1.047 [[inch]]es at 100 [[yard]]s (2.908&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m), a traditional distance on U.S. [[Shooting range|target ranges]]. The subtension is linear with the distance, for example, at 500 yards, 1&nbsp;MOA is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 5.235 inches, and at 1000 yards 1&nbsp;MOA is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 10.47 inches. \nSince many modern [[telescopic sight]]s are adjustable in half ({{sfrac|1|2}}), quarter ({{sfrac|1|4}}), or eighth ({{sfrac|1|8}}) MOA increments, also known as ''clicks'', zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2, 4 and 8 clicks per MOA respectively.\n\nFor example, if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards (which for instance could be measured by using a [[spotting scope]] with a calibrated reticle), the scope needs to be adjusted 3 MOA down, and 1.5 MOA right. Such adjustments are trivial when the scope's adjustment dials have a MOA scale printed on them, and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that ''click'' in fractions of MOA. This makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:\n\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|2}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 clicks down and 1.5 x 2 = 3 clicks right\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|4}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 4 = 12 clicks down and 1.5 \u00d7 4 = 6 clicks right\n* To adjust a {{frac|1|8}} MOA scope 3 MOA down and 1.5 MOA right, the scope needs to be adjusted 3 x 8 = 24 clicks down and 1.5 \u00d7 8 = 12 clicks right\n\nAnother common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the [[milliradian]]. Zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with [[decimal|base ten]] systems. The most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is {{sfrac|1|10}} mil (which approximates {{frac|1|3}} MOA).\n\n* To adjust a {{sfrac|1|10}} mil scope 0.9 mil down and 0.4 mil right, the scope needs to be adjusted 9 clicks down and 4 clicks right (which equals approximately 3 and 1.5 MOA respectively).\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that some MOA scopes, including some higher-end models,{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 MOA on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards, rather than the mathematically correct 1.047\". This is commonly known as the Shooter's MOA (SMOA) or Inches Per Hundred Yards (IPHY). While the difference between one true MOA and one SMOA is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards,<ref>{{cite web|last=Mann |first=Richard |url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/6227/mil-moa-or-inches/ |title=Mil, MOA or inches? |publisher=Shooting Illustrated |date=2011-02-18 |accessdate=2015-04-13}}</ref> this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 20-30 MOA to compensate for the bullet drop. If a shot requires an adjustment of 20 MOA or more, the difference between true MOA and SMOA will add up to 1 inch or more. In competitive target shooting, this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.\n\nThe physical group size equivalent to ''m'' minutes of arc can be calculated as follows: group size = tan({{sfrac|''m''|60}})&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;distance. In the example previously given, for 1 minute of arc, and substituting 3,600&nbsp;inches for 100 yards, 3,600 tan({{sfrac|1|60}}) \u2248 1.047&nbsp;inches. In [[metric units]] 1 MOA at 100 meters \u2248 2.908 centimeters.\n\nSometimes, a precision firearm's accuracy will be measured in MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind, match-grade ammo, clean barrel, and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error, the gun is capable of producing a [[shot grouping|group of shots]] whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a ''1 MOA rifle'' should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example, Remington's [[M24 Sniper Weapon System]] is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better, or be rejected.\n\nRifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as ''sub-MOA'', meaning it shoots under 1 MOA. This means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards, or the average of several groups, will measure less than 1 MOA between the two furthest shots in the group, i.e. all shots fall within 1 MOA. If larger samples are taken (i.e., more shots per group) then group size typically increases, however this will ultimately average out. If a rifle was truly a 1 MOA rifle, it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 MOA apart. For 5 shot groups, based on 95% [[confidence interval|confidence]] a rifle that normally shoots 1 MOA can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 MOA and 1.47 MOA, although the majority of these groups will be under 1 MOA. What this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches this is not statistically abnormal.<ref>{{cite web|first=Robert E. |last=Wheeler |date= |title=Statistical notes on rifle group patterns |url=http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926154900/http://www.bobwheeler.com/guns/GroupStat.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Denton |last=Bramwell |date=January 2009 |title=Group Therapy The Problem: How accurate is your rifle? |url=http://www.longrangehunting.com/articles/accurate-rifle-groups-1.php |journal=Varmint Hunter |volume=69 |accessdate=21 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Metric system|Metric System]] counterpart of the MOA is the [[milliradian]] or '''mil''', being equal to one 1000th of the target range, laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius. The number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 \u00d7 {{pi}} \u00d7 1000, regardless the target range. Therefore, 1 MOA \u2248 0.2908 mil. This means that an object which spans 1 mil on the [[reticle]] is at a range that is in meters equal to the object's size in millimeters (e.g. an object of 100&nbsp;mm @ 1 mrad is 100 meters away). So there is no conversion factor required, contrary to the MOA system.  A reticle with markings (hashes or dots) spaced with a one mil apart (or a fraction of a mil) are collectively called a mil reticle. If the markings are round they are called '''mil-dots'''.\n\nIn the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact (e.g. 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100 meters), while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.\n\n[[File:Mil and moa comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of [[milliradian]] (mil) and minute of arc (moa).]]\n\n{{Conversion between common sight adjustments based on milliradian and minute of arc}}\n\n* 1\u2032 at 100 yards equals 22619/ 21600 = 1.04717593 in<ref>[http://dexadine.com/WhatMOA.htm Dexadine Ballistics Software - ballistic data for shooting and reloading]</ref> \u2248 1.047 inches\n* 1\u2032 \u2248 0.291&nbsp;mil (or 2.91&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m, approximately  3&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m)\n* 1&nbsp;mil \u2248 3.44\u2032, so {{sfrac|1|10}}&nbsp;mil \u2248 {{sfrac|1|3}}\u2032\n* 0.1&nbsp;mil equals exactly 1&nbsp;cm at 100&nbsp;m, or approximately 0.36 inches at 100 yards\n\n===Human vision===\nIn humans, [[Normal vision|20/20 vision]] is the ability to resolve a [[spatial pattern]] separated by a [[visual angle]] of one minute of arc.\nA 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.\n\n===Materials===\nThe deviation from parallelism between two surfaces, for instance in [[optical engineering]], is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.\nIn addition, arcseconds are sometimes used in [[rocking curve]] (\u03c9-scan) [[x ray diffraction]] measurements of high-quality [[epitaxy|epitaxial]] thin films.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nSome measurement devices make use of arcminutes and arcseconds to measure angles when the object being measured is too small for direct visual inspection.

Beginning in 1922, he lived and worked mainly in [[Paris]] but regularly visited his hometown [[Borgonovo]] to see his family and work on his art.\n\nGiacometti was one of the most important sculptors of the [[20th century]]. His work was particularly influenced by artistic styles such as [[Cubism]] and [[Surrealism]]. [[Philosophy|Philosophical]] questions about the [[human condition]], as well as [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] debates played a significant role in his work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolis.ch/cosmo29/alberto_giacometti.htm|title=Alberto Giacometti|last=Gerber|first=Louis|website=www.cosmopolis.ch|access-date=2018-02-01}}</ref> Around 1935 he gave up on his Surrealistic influences in order to pursue a more deepened analysis of [[Figurative art|figurative]] compositions. Giacometti wrote texts for periodicals and exhibition catalogues and recorded his thoughts and memories in notebooks and diaries. His self-critical nature led to great doubts about his work and his ability to do justice to his own artistic ideas but acted as a great motivating force.<ref>[https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1010067077 ''Fondation Beyeler.

In: Angela Schneider: ''Giacometti,'' p. 26</ref>\n\nIn Giacometti's whole body of work, his painting constitutes only a small part.

He was a descendant of Protestant refugees escaping the [[Italian Inquisition|inquisition]]. Coming from an artistic background, he was interested in art from an early age. Alberto attended the [[Geneva]] School of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]]. His brothers [[Diego Giacometti|Diego]] (1902\u20131985) and [[Bruno Giacometti|Bruno]] (1907\u20132012) would go on to become artists and architects as well. Additionally, [[Zaccaria Giacometti]], later professor of constitutional law and chancellor of the [[University of Zurich]], grew up together with them, having been orphaned at the age of 12 in 1905.<ref>Andreas Kley: ''Von Stampa nach Z\u00fcrich.

It was there that Giacometti experimented with [[Cubism]] and [[Surrealism]] and came to be regarded as one of the leading Surrealist sculptors. Among his associates were [[Joan Mir\u00f3|Mir\u00f3]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Bror Hjorth]], and [[Balthus]].\n\nBetween 1936 and 1940, Giacometti concentrated his sculpting on the human head, focusing on the sitter's gaze. He preferred models he was close to\u2014his sister and the artist [[Isabel Rawsthorne]] (then known as Isabel Delmer). This was followed by a phase in which his statues of Isabel became stretched out; her limbs elongated.<ref>New York Times article on ''The Women of Giacometti'' exhibition, Pace Wildenstein Gallery 2005 [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/20/arts/design/20kino.html?pagewanted=all]</ref> Obsessed with creating his sculptures exactly as he envisioned through his unique view of reality, he often carved until they were as thin as nails and reduced to the size of a pack of cigarettes, much to his consternation. A friend of his once said that if Giacometti decided to sculpt you, \"he would make your head look like the blade of a knife\". \n\nDuring WWII Giacometti took refuge in Switzerland. There in 1946 he met Annette Arm, a secretary for the Red Cross; they married in 1949. <ref name=\"annette\">https://www.fondation-giacometti.fr/en/article/303/tribute-to-annette-giacometti</ref>\n\nAfter his marriage his tiny sculptures became larger, but the larger they grew, the thinner they became. For the remainder of Giacometti's life, Annette was his main female model.<ref name=\"annette\" /> His paintings underwent a parallel procedure. The figures appear isolated and severely attenuated, as the result of continuous reworking. \n\nSubjects were frequently revisited: one of his favorite models was his younger brother Diego.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=5141&searchid=8724 Tate Collection: Seated Man by Alberto Giacometti] Retrieved July 13, 2007.</ref>\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:'Cat' by Giacometti, 1954, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|left|''Cat'', 1954, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|234x234px]]In 1958 Giacometti was asked to create a monumental sculpture for the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] building in New York, which was beginning construction. Although he had for many years \"harbored an ambition to create work for a public square\",<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=5075599 Christie's, Impressionist And Modern Art Evening Sale, New York, Rockefeller Plaza, 6 May 2008]</ref> he \"had never set foot in New York, and knew nothing about life in a rapidly evolving metropolis.

The commission was never completed, however, because Giacometti was unsatisfied by the relationship between the sculpture and the site, and abandoned the project.\n\nIn 1962, Giacometti was awarded the grand prize for sculpture at the [[Venice Biennale]], and the award brought with it worldwide fame. Even when he had achieved popularity and his work was in demand, he still reworked models, often destroying them or setting them aside to be returned to years later. The prints produced by Giacometti are often overlooked but the catalogue raisonn\u00e9, ''Giacometti \u2013 The Complete Graphics and 15 Drawings by Herbert Lust'' (Tudor 1970), comments on their impact and gives details of the number of copies of each print. Some of his most important images were in editions of only 30 and many were described as rare in 1970.\n\nIn his later years Giacometti's works were shown in a number of large exhibitions throughout Europe. Riding a wave of international popularity, and despite his declining health, he traveled to the United States in 1965 for an exhibition of his works at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. As his last work he prepared the text for the book ''Paris sans fin'', a sequence of 150 [[lithographs]] containing memories of all the places where he had lived.\n\n== Death ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = CHF100 8 front.jpg\n | width1    = 140\n | caption1  = Current 100 [[Swiss franc]] banknote, front\n | alt1      = A banknote with portrait of Giacometti\n | image2    = CHF100 8 back.jpg\n | width2    = 138\n | caption2  = Current 100 Swiss franc banknote, back\n | alt2      = A banknote with image of sculpture of Giacometti\n}}\nGiacometti died in 1966 of heart disease ([[pericarditis]]) and [[chronic bronchitis]] at the Kantonsspital in [[Chur]], Switzerland.

For this I had to make (quickly I thought; in passing), one or two studies from nature, just enough to understand the construction of a head, of a whole figure, and in 1935 I took a model. This study should take, I thought, two weeks and then I could realize my compositions...I worked with the model all day from 1935 to 1940...Nothing was as I imagined.  A head, became for me an object completely unknown and without dimensions.\"<ref name=MOMA />\n\nSince Giacometti achieved exquisite realism with facility when he was executing busts in his early adolescence, Giacometti's difficulty in re-approaching the figure as an adult is generally understood as a sign of existential struggle for meaning, rather than as a technical deficit.\n\nGiacometti was a key player in the [[Surrealist]] art movement, but his work resists easy categorization. Some describe it as formalist, others argue it is expressionist or otherwise having to do with what [[Deleuze]] calls \"blocs of sensation\" (as in Deleuze's analysis of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]). Even after his excommunication from the Surrealist group, while the intention of his sculpting was usually imitation, the end products were an expression of his emotional response to the subject. He attempted to create renditions of his models the way he saw them, and the way he thought they ought to be seen. He once said that he was sculpting not the human figure but \"the shadow that is cast\".\n\nScholar [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] in ''Irrational Man: A Study in Existential Philosophy'' (1962), argues that the attenuated forms of Giacometti's figures reflect the view of 20th century [[modernism]] and [[existentialism]] that modern life is increasingly empty and devoid of meaning. \"All the sculptures of today, like those of the past, will end one day in pieces...So it is important to fashion one's work carefully in its smallest recess and charge every particle of matter with life.\"\n\nA 2011-2012 exhibition  at the [[Pinacoth\u00e8que de Paris]] focussed on showing how Giacometti was inspired by [[Etruscan art]].<ref>[http://www.pinacotheque.com/index.php?id=718 ''Giacometti and The Etruscans'', La Pinacoth\u00e8que de Paris]</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nPaolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Venezia, 1962) - BEIC 6328561.jpg\nPaolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Venezia, 1962) - BEIC 6356049.jpg\nPaolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Venezia, 1962) - BEIC 6363726.jpg\nPaolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Venezia, 1962) - BEIC 6328565.jpg\n</gallery>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\nArtworks by Giacometti at the 31\u00b0 [[Venice Biennale]] in 1962, photographed by [[Paolo Monti]]\n</div>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nGiacometti's work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including [[Pera Museum]], Istanbul (2015) [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow (2008); \u201cThe Studio of Alberto Giacometti: Collection of the Fondation Alberto et Annette Giacometti\u201d, [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris (2007\u20132008); Kunsthal Rotterdam (2008);  [[Fondation Beyeler]], Basel (2009), Buenos Aires (2012); [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] (2013), and the [[High Museum of Art]], Atlanta (1970).\n\nThe [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]'s first solo exhibition of Giacometti's work, ''Pure Presence'' opened to five star reviews on 13 October 2015 (to January 10, 2016, in honour of the fiftieth anniversary of the artist's death).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Jonathan|title=Giacometti: Pure Presence review \u2013 the most profound, universal art of the past 75 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/13/giacometti-pure-presence-review-national-portrait-gallery|accessdate=13 October 2015|work=Guardian online|date=13 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Luke|first1=Ben|title=Giacometti: Pure Presence, exhibition review: Profound portrait of the artist\u2019s progress|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/exhibitions/giacometti-pure-presence-exhibition-review-profound-portrait-of-the-artist-s-progress-a3089201.html|accessdate=13 October 2015|work=Evening Standard online|date=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Public collections ===\nGiacometti's work is displayed in numerous public collections, including:\n* [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\n* [[Art Institute of Chicago]]\n* [[Baltimore Museum of Art]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]]\n* [[Bechtler Museum of Modern Art]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n* [[Berggruen Museum]], Berlin\n* [[Botero Museum]], [[Bogot\u00e1, Colombia]]\n* [http://www.buendner-kunstmuseum.ch/ B\u00fcndner Kunstmuseum], Chur, Switzerland\n* [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], [[Pittsburgh]]\n* [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]\n* [[Beyeler Foundation|Fondation Beyeler]], Basel\n* [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], Washington D.C.\n* [[J.

Originally, and in [[music theory]] and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred [[choral music|choral work]] (still frequently seen in [[Sacred Harp]] and other types of [[shape note]] singing) and still more particularly to a specific form of [[Anglican church music]].\n\n{{anchor|Word|Name}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Anthem'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1}} (''ant\u00edph\u014dna'') via [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|antefn}}. Both words originally referred to [[antiphon]]s, a [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] style of singing.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The adjectival form is \"anthemic\".\n\n==History==\nAnthems were originally a form of [[liturgical music]]. In the [[Church of England]], the [[rubric]] appoints them to follow the third [[collect]] at morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation service]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The words are selected from [[Holy Scripture]] or in some cases from the [[Liturgy]] and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of [[psalm]] or [[hymn tune]]s.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Being written for a trained [[choir]] rather than the congregation, the Anglican anthem is analogous to the [[motet]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Lutheran Church]]es but represents an essentially English [[musical form]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Anthems may be described as \"[[verse anthem|verse]]\", \"full\", or \"full with verse\", depending on whether they are intended for [[solo (music)|solo]]ists, the [[choir|full choir]], or both. Another way of describing an anthem is that it is a piece of music written specifically to fit a certain accompanying text, and it is often difficult to make any other text fit that same melodic arrangement. It also often changes melody and/or meter, frequently multiple times within a single song, and is sung straight through from start to finish, without repeating the melody for following verses like a normal song (although certain sections may be repeated when marked). An example of an anthem with multiple meter shifts a, fuguing, and repeated sections is \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhQIKXmsohA Claremont]\", or \"Vital Spark of Heav'nly Flame\". [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhQIKXmsohA]. Another  well known example is [[William Billings|William Billing]]'s ''Easter Anthem'',<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nccHbHJaGLg</ref> also known as \"The Lord Is Risen Indeed!\" after the opening lines. This anthem is still one of the more popular songs in the Sacred harp tune book.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}\n\nThe anthem developed as a replacement for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] \"votive antiphon\" commonly sung as an appendix to the main [[Liturgy of the Hours|office]] to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] or [[saint (Christianity)|other saints]]. During the [[Elizabethan period]], notable anthems were composed by [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], Tye, and Farrant{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} but they were not mentioned in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] until 1662 when the famous [[rubric]] \"In quires and places where they sing here followeth the Anthem\" first appears. Early anthems tended to be simple and [[homophony|homophonic]] in texture, so that the words could be clearly heard. During the 17th century, notable anthems were composed by [[Orlando Gibbons]], [[Henry Purcell]], and [[John Blow]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} with the [[verse anthem]] becoming the dominant musical form of the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the 18th century, famed anthems were composed by Croft, Boyce, [[James Kent]], [[James Nares]], [[Benjamin Cooke]], and [[Samuel Arnold (composer)|Samuel Arnold]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} In the 19th, [[Samuel Sebastian Wesley]] wrote anthems influenced by contemporary [[oratorio]] which stretch to several [[movement (music)|movements]] and last twenty minutes or longer. Later in the century, [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] used symphonic techniques to produce a more concise and unified structure. Many anthems have been composed since this time, generally by [[organist]]s rather than professional [[composer]]s and often in a conservative style. Major composers have usually composed anthems in response to commissions and for special occasions. Examples include [[Edward Elgar]]'s 1912 \"Great is the Lord\" and 1914 \"Give unto the Lord\" (both with orchestral accompaniment), [[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1943 ''[[Rejoice in the Lamb]]'' (a modern example of a multi-movement anthem, today heard mainly as a concert piece), and, on a much smaller scale, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s 1952 \"O Taste and See\" written for the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. With the relaxation of the rule, in [[England]] at least, that anthems should be only in English, the repertoire has been greatly enhanced by the addition of many works from the Latin repertoire.\n\n==Types==\nThe word \"anthem\" is commonly used to describe any celebratory song or composition for a distinct group, as in [[national anthem]]s. Many [[Pop music|pop song]]s are used as [[sports anthem]]s, notably including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" and \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", and some sporting events have their own anthems, most notably including [[UEFA Champions League Anthem|UEFA Champions League]]. Further, some songs are artistically styled as anthems, whether or not they are used as such, including [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s \"[[Irresponsible Hate Anthem]]\", [[Silverchair]]'s \"[[Anthem for the Year 2000]]\", and [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s \"Child's Anthem\".\n\n===National anthem===\n{{main|National anthem}}\n\n=== Shared anthems ===\nAlthough anthems are used to distinguish states and territories, there are instances of shared anthems. \"[[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]\" became a [[pan-African]] liberation anthem and was later adopted as the national anthem of five countries in [[Africa]] including [[Zambia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] after independence. Zimbabwe and Namibia have since adopted new national anthems. Since 1997, the [[South Africa]]n national anthem has been a hybrid song combining new English lyrics with extracts of \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\" and the former anthem \"[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika]]\".\n\n\"[[Hymn to Liberty]]\" is the longest national anthem in the world by length of text.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/greece-hymn-to-liberty/ | title=Greece \u2013 Hymn to Liberty | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2 November 2011 }}</ref> In 1865, the first three stanzas and later the first two officially became the national anthem of [[Greece]] and later also that of the [[Republic of Cyprus]].\n\n\"[[Forged from the Love of Liberty]]\" was composed as the national anthem for the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]] (1958\u20131962) and was adopted by [[Trinidad and Tobago]] when it became independent in 1962.<ref>{{Citation | title = Understanding our national anthem | publisher = FIRST Magazine | year = 2012 | url = http://www.firstmagazine.com/DownloadSpecialistPublicationDetail.647.ashx | access-date = 2013-03-05 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130928035953/http://www.firstmagazine.com/DownloadSpecialistPublicationDetail.647.ashx | archive-date = 2013-09-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref>\n\n\"[[Esta \u00c9 a Nossa P\u00e1tria Bem Amada]]\" is the national anthem of [[Guinea-Bissau]] and was also the national anthem of [[Cape Verde]] until 1996.\n\n\"[[Oben am jungen Rhein]]\", national anthem of [[Liechtenstein]] is set to the tune of ''God Save the Queen''.

Its first lyrics were written in 1834 under the title ''Hey, Slovaks'' (''Hej, Slov\u00e1ci'') by [[Samuel Tom\u00e1\u0161ik]] and it has since served as the anthem of the [[Pan-Slavic]] movement, the anthem of the [[Sokol]] physical education and political movement, the anthem of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] and the transitional anthem of the State Union of [[Serbia and Montenegro]]. The song is also considered to be the second, unofficial anthem of the Slovaks. Its melody is based on [[Mazurek Dabrowskiego|Mazurek D\u0105browskiego]], which has been also the anthem of [[Poland]] since 1926, but the Yugoslav variation is much slower and more accentuated.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ1SUCpekyM&feature=related|title=Mazurek D\u0105browskiego & Hej Slaveni|date=2 March 2011|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994 ''[[De\u0219teapt\u0103-te, rom\u00e2ne!]]'' was the anthem of both [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], but was replaced by the current Moldovan anthem, ''[[Limba noastr\u0103]]''.\n\nThe modern national anthem of [[Germany]], ''[[Deutschlandlied|Das Lied der Deutschen]]'',<ref>Translates from German as ''The Song of the Germans''</ref> uses the same tune as the 19th and early 20th-century [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] anthem ''[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]''.<ref>Translates from German as ''God save Emperor Francis''</ref>\n\nThe ''[[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|Hymn of the Soviet Union]]'',<ref>Russian: ''\u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420''; transliterated as ''Gosudarstvenniy Gimn SSSR''</ref> used until its dissolution in 1991, which was given new words and [[National anthem of Russia|adopted]] by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] in 2000 to replace the unpopular instrumental anthem it had introduced in 1993.<ref name='rianovosti'>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/symbols/20070607/66606928.html|title=National Anthem|accessdate=20 December 2009|date=7 June 2007|work=Russia's State Symbols|publisher=RIA Novosti}}</ref><ref name=zolotov>{{cite news | first=Andrei | last=Zolotov |title=Russian Orthodox Church Approves as Putin Decides to Sing to a Soviet Tune | date=1 December 2000 | publisher=Christianity Today International | url =http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/decemberweb-only/57.0.html | work =Christianity Today Magazine | accessdate = 19 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n''[[Bro Gozh ma Zado\u00f9]]'', the anthem of [[Brittany]] and, ''[[Bro Goth Agan Tasow]]'', the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] anthem, are sung to the same tune as that of Wales, ''[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]'', with similar words.\n\n===For parts of states===\nThe former [[Soviet Union]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]], amongst others, are held to be unions of many nations by various definitions. Each of the different nations may have their own national anthem and these songs may be officially recognized.\n\nFourteen of the fifteen [[republics of the Soviet Union]] had their own official song which was used at events connected to that republic, and also written and sung in that republic's own language. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] used the Soviet state's national anthem until 1990. Some republics retained the melodies of those songs after the dissolution of the Soviet regime (see the article [[National anthems of the Soviet Union and Union Republics]]).\n\nThe United Kingdom's national anthem is \"God Save the Queen\" but [[Countries of the United Kingdom|its constituent countries]] and [[Crown Dependencies]] also have their own anthems which have varying degrees of official recognition. [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], and [[Northern Ireland]], as well as [[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]] and the [[Isle of Man]], each has a number of anthems which are played at occasions such as sports matches and official events.<ref>Johnson, H. (2015). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299135674_Anthem_for_Jersey_Music_Media_and_Politics_in_an_Island_Setting MEDIANZ, 15(1), 96-118.].</ref> The song usually [[National anthem of England|used as an anthem for England]] is \"God Save the Queen\", though sometimes \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", \"[[I Vow To Thee, My Country]]\" and \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\" may be played instead. Scotland has adopted \"[[Flower of Scotland]]\" as its unofficial national anthem, while Wales has sung \"[[Mae Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]\" since 1856 when it was written by father and son [[Evan James (poet)|Evan]] and [[James James]]; the translation and music were adopted by [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] as its national anthem. Hen Wlad fy Nhadau was sometimes accompanied by the hymn, \"[[Cwm Rhondda|Guide Me, O thou Great Redeemer]]\", especially at rugby matches. Northern Ireland has used \"God Save the Queen\" though \"[[Londonderry Air]]\" is also used.\n\nIn [[Germany]], many of the [[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]] have their own anthems, some of which predate the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871. A prominent example is the [[Bayernhymne|Hymn of Bavaria]], which also has the status of an official anthem (and thus enjoys legal protection). There are also several regional, unofficial anthems, like the [[Badnerlied]] or the [[Niedersachsenlied]].\n\nIn [[Austria]], the situation is similar to that in Germany. The anthem of [[Upper Austria]], the \"Hoamatgsang\" (chant of the homeland), is notable in the way that it is the only (official) German-language anthem written \u2013 and sung \u2013 entirely in dialect.\n\nIn [[Spain]], the situation is similar to that in Austria and Germany. Unlike the national anthem, most of the [[Anthems of the autonomous communities of Spain|anthems of the autonomous communities]] have words. All are official. Three prominent examples are \"[[Els Segadors]]\" of [[Catalonia]], \"[[Eusko Abendaren Ereserkia]]\" of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and \"[[Os Pinos]]\" of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], all written and sung in the local languages.\n\nIn the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], each of the republics (except the [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) had the right to its own national anthem, but only the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]] had an anthem of its own, later joined by the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]] on the brink of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] did not officially use an anthem, even though one was proclaimed during the [[World War II]] by [[ASNOM]].\n\nIn [[Belgium]], [[Wallonia]] uses \"[[Le Chant des Wallons]]\" and Flanders uses \"[[De Vlaamse Leeuw]]\".\n\n[[Czechoslovakia]] used to have an anthem composed of two parts, the [[Kde domov m\u016fj?|Czech]] and the [[Nad Tatrou sa bl\u00fdska|Slovak one]]. After the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], the [[Czech Republic]] adopted the first part as its own anthem, [[Slovakia]] adopted the second part with slightly changed lyrics and an additional stanza.\n\nAlthough the United States of America has \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" as its official national anthem, each individual state and territory also has its own [[List of U.S. state songs|state anthem or song]], along with the [[District of Columbia]], with the sole exception of [[New Jersey]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe Canadian province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], having been the independent [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] before 1949, also has its own anthem from its days as a dominion and British colony, the \"[[Ode to Newfoundland]]\". It was the only Canadian province with its own anthem until 2010, when [[Prince Edward Island]] adopted the 1908 song \"[[The Island Hymn]]\" as its provincial anthem.\n\nIn [[Mexico]], after the national anthem was established in 1854, most of the states of the federation adopted local anthems, which often emphasize heroes, virtues or particular landscapes.\n\nAll the individual states of [[Malaysia]] have local anthems.\n\n=== International organizations ===\nLarger entities also sometimes have anthems, in some cases known as 'international anthems'. ''Lullaby'' is the official anthem of [[UNICEF]] composed by [[Steve Barakatt]].<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/canada_51822.html A musical call to action: \u2018Lullaby: The UNICEF Anthem\u2019] UNICEF Website, 19 November 2009</ref> ''[[The Internationale]]'' is the anthem of the [[socialism|socialist]] movement and the [[communism|communist]] movement. Before March 1944, it was also the anthem of the Soviet Union and the [[Comintern]]. [[ASEAN Way]] is the official anthem of [[ASEAN]]. The tune of the ''[[Ode to Joy]]'' from [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 9]] is the official [[Anthem of Europe|anthem of the European Union]] and of the [[Council of Europe]].  Let's All Unite and Celebrate is the official anthem of the African Union<ref>[http://www.africa-union.org/AU%20symbols/ausymblos.htm AU Symbols] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304021240/http://www.africa-union.org/AU%20symbols/ausymblos.htm |date=2005-03-04 }}.</ref> (''[[Let Us All Unite and Celebrate Together]]'').\n\nThe Olympic Movement also has its own [[Olympic Hymn|anthem]]. [[Esperanto]] speakers at meetings often use the song ''[[La Espero]]'' as their anthem. The first [[South Asian Anthem]] by poet-diplomat [[Abhay K]] may inspire [[SAARC]] to come up with an official [[SAARC Anthem]].<ref>[http://aninews.in/newsdetail4/story142658/indian-poet-diplomat-pens-s-asian-anthem-after-earth-anthem-success.html Indian poet-diplomat pens S.Asian anthem after Earth anthem success] ANI, 27 November 2013</ref>\n\n''[[Ireland's Call]]'' was commissioned as the anthem of both the [[Ireland national rugby union team]] and the [[Ireland national rugby league team]], which are composed of players from both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, in response to dissatisfaction among Northern Ireland [[Ulster unionism|unionist]]s with the use of the [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|Republic of Ireland's anthem]]. ''Ireland's Call'' has since been used by some other all-island bodies.\n\nAn International Anthem also unifies a group of organizations sharing the same appellation such as the International Anthem of the Royal Golf Clubs composed by [[Steve Barakatt]].\n\n===Global anthem ===\n{{main article|Earth Anthem}}\nVarious artists have created \"[[Earth Anthem]]s\" for the entire planet, typically extolling the ideas of [[planetary consciousness]].

Along with [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Wolf Huber]] he is regarded to be the main representative of the so-called [[Danube School]] setting biblical and historical subjects against landscape backgrounds of expressive colours. As an artist also making small intricate engravings he is seen to belong to the Nuremberg [[Little Masters]].\n\n==Biography==\nAltdorfer was born in [[Regensburg]] or [[Altdorf, Lower Bavaria|Altdorf]] around 1480.\n\nHe acquired an interest in art from his father, Ulrich Altdorfer, who was a painter and miniaturist. At the start of his career, he won public attention by creating small, intimate modestly scaled works in unconventional media and with eccentric subject matter. He settled in the [[free imperial city]] of Regensburg, a town located on the [[Danube River]] in 1505, eventually becoming the town architect and a town councillor. His first signed works date to c. 1506, including engravings and drawings such the ''Stygmata of St. Francis'' and ''St. Jerome''. His models were [[niello]]s and copper engravings from the workshops of [[Jacopo de Barbari]] and [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].\n\nAround 1511 or earlier, he travelled down the river and south into the Alps, where the scenery moved him so deeply that he became the first [[Landscape painting|landscape painter]]  in the modern sense,<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Linda|title=The High Renaissance and Mannerism|year=1967|publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd.|location=London, England|isbn=0-500-20162-5|pages=246\u2013247}}</ref> making him the leader of the [[Danube School]], a circle that pioneered landscape as an independent genre, in southern [[Germany]]. From 1513 he was at the service of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in [[Innsbruck]], where he received several commissions from the imperial court. During the turmoil of the [[Protestant Reformation]], he dedicated mostly to architecture; paintings of the period, showing his increasing attention to architecture, include the ''[[Nativity of the Virgin (Altdorfer)|Nativity of the Virgin]]''.\n\nIn 1529 he executed ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' for Duke [[William IV of Bavaria]]. In the 1520s he returned to Regensburg as a wealthy man, and became a member of the city's council. He was also responsible for the fortifications of Regensburg.\n\nIn that period his works are influenced by artists such as [[Giorgione]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], as shown by his ''[[Crucifixion (Altdorfer)|Crucifixion]]''. In 1535 he was in [[Vienna]]. He died at [[Regensburg]] in 1538.\n\nThe remains of Altdorfer's surviving work comprises 55 panels, 120 drawings, 125 woodcuts, 78 engravings, 36 etchings, 24 paintings on parchment, and fragments from a mural for the bathhouse of the Kaiserhof in Regensburg. This production extends at least over the period 1504\u20131537. He  signed and dated each one of his works.\n\n==Painting==\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer, Christ Taking Leave of His Mother (probably 1520).jpg|thumb|''Christ taking Leave of his Mother'']]\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 032.jpg|thumb|Albrecht Altdorfer: Sebastian Altar in St. Florian's Priory, Upper Austria]]\n\nAltdorfer was the pioneer painter of pure landscape, making them the subject of the painting, as well as compositions dominated by their landscape; these [[List of landscapes by Albrecht Altdorfer|comprise much of his oeuvre]]. He believed that the human figure should not disrupt nature, but rather participate in it or imitate its natural processes. Taking and developing the landscape style of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], he shows the hilly landscape of the [[Danube]] valley with thick forests of drooping and crumbling firs and larches hung with moss, and often dramatic colouring from a rising or setting sun.  His ''[[Landscape with Footbridge]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]) of 1518\u20131520 is claimed to be the first pure landscape in oil. In this painting, Altdorfer places a large tree that is cut off by the margins at the center of the landscape, making it the central axis and focus within the piece. He uses [[Anthropomorphize|anthropomorphism]] to give the tree human qualities such as the drapery of its limbs. He also made many fine finished drawings, mostly landscapes, in pen and [[watercolour]] such as the ''Landscape with the Woodcutter'' in 1522. The drawing opens at ground level on a clearing surrounding an enormous tree that is placed in the center, dominating the picture. It poses and gesticulates as if it was human, splaying its branches out in every corner. Halfway up the tree trunk, hangs a gabled shrine. At the time, a shrine like this might shelter an image of the Crucifixion or the Virgin Mary, but since it is turned away from the viewer, we are not sure what it truly is. At the bottom of the tree, a tiny figure of a seated man, crossed legged, holds a knife and axe, declaring his status in society/occupation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Christopher W.|title=Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}</ref>\n\nAlso, he often painted scenes of historical and biblical subjects, set in atmospheric landscapes. His best religious scenes are intense, with their glistening lights and glowing colours sometimes verging on the expressionistic. They often depict moments of intimacy between Christ and his mother, or various saints. His sacral masterpiece and one of the most famous religious works of art of the later [[Middle Ages]] is ''The Legend of [[St. Sebastian]]'' and ''The [[Passion of Christ]]'' of the so-called  ''Sebastian Altar'' in ''[[St. Florian's Priory]]'' (''Stift Sankt Florian'') near [[Linz]], [[Upper Austria]]. When closed   the altarpiece displayed the four panels of the legend of St. Sebastian's Martyrdom, while the opened wings displayed the [[Stations of the Cross]]. Today the altarpiece is dismantled and the [[predella]]s depicting the two final scenes, ''[[Entombment]]'' and ''[[Resurrection]]'' were sold to [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]] in 1923 and 1930. Both these paintings share a similar formal structure that consists of an open landscape that is seen beyond and through the opening of a dark grotto.  The date of completion on the resurrection panel is 1518.\n\nAltdorfer often distorts perspective to subtle effect. His donor figures are often painted completely out of scale with the main scene, as in paintings of the previous centuries. He also painted some portraits; overall his painted oeuvre was not large. In his later works, Altdorfer moved more towards mannerism and began to depict the human form to the conformity of the Italian model, as well as dominate the picture with frank colors.\n\n==Paintings in Munich==\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer, The Battle of Alexander at Issus.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'', 1529,  <br />Wood, 158.4 \u00d7 120.3 cm Alte Pinakothek, Munich]]\n\nHis rather atypical ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus|Battle of Issus]]'' (or of ''[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'') of 1529 was commissioned by [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria]] as part of a series of eight historical battle scenes destined to hang in the Residenz in Munich. Albrecht Altdorfer's depiction of the moment in 333 BCE when Alexander the Great routed Darius III for supremacy in Asia Minor is vast in ambition, sweeping in scope, vivid in imagery, rich in symbols, and obviously heroic\u2014the Iliad of painting, as literary critic Friedrich Schlegel suggested<ref name=AltdorfWS>{{cite news|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H.|title=An Epic Poem in Paint: The story of 'The Battle of Issus' and Albrecht Altdorfer|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 8, 2010}}</ref>  In the painting, a swarming cast of thousands of soldiers surround the central action: Alexander on his white steed, leading two rows of charging cavalrymen, dashes after a fleeing Darius, who looks anxiously over his shoulder from a chariot. The opposing armies are distinguished by the colors of their uniforms: Darius' army in red and Alexander's in blue. The upper half of ''The Battle of Alexander'' expands with unreal rapidity into an arcing panorama comprehending vast coiling tracts of globe and sky. The victory also lies on the planar surface; The sun outshone the moon just as the Imperial and allied army successfully repel the Turks.<ref  name=AltdorfWS/>\nBy making the mass number of soldiers blend within the landscape/painting, it shows that he believed that the usage and depiction of landscape was just as significant as a historical event, such as a war. He renounced the office of ''Mayor of Regensburg'' to accept the commission. Few of his other paintings resemble this apocalyptic scene of two huge armies dominated by an extravagant landscape seen from a very high viewpoint, which looks south over the whole Mediterranean from modern Turkey to include the island of [[Cyprus]] and the mouths of the [[Nile]] and the [[Red Sea]] (behind the isthmus to the left) on the other side.  However his style here is a development of that of a number of miniatures of battle-scenes he had done much earlier for [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in his [[illuminated manuscript]] ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' in 1512-14.  It is thought to be the earliest painting to show the curvature of the Earth from a great height.\n\nThe ''Battle'' is now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], which has the best collection of Altdorfer's paintings, including also his small ''St. George and the Dragon'' (1510), in oil on [[parchment]], where the two figures are tiny and almost submerged in the lush, dense forest that towers over them. Altdorfer seems to exaggerate the measurements of the forest in comparison to the figures: the leaves appear to be larger than the horse, showing the significance of nature and landscape. He also emphasizes line within the work, by displaying the upward growth of the forest with the vertical and diagonal lines of the trunks. There is a small opening of the forest on the lower right hand corner that provides a rest for your eyes. It serves to create depth within the painting and is the only place you can see the characters. The human form is completely absorbed by the thickness of the forest. Fantastic light effects provide a sense of mystery and dissolve the outline of objects. Without the contrast of light, the figures would blend in with its surrounding environment. Altdorfer's figures are invariably the complement of his romantic landscapes; for them he borrowed [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s inventive iconography, but the panoramic setting is personal and has nothing to do with the fantasy landscapes of the Netherlands<ref>{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Linda|title=The High Renaissance and Mannerism|year=1967|publisher=Thames & Hudson, Ltd.|location=London, England|isbn=0-500-20162-5}}</ref> A ''[[:de:Susanna und die beiden Alten (Altdorfer)|Susanna in the Bath and the Stoning of the Elders]]'' (1526) set outside an Italianate skyscraper of a palace shows his interest in architecture.  Another small oil on parchment, ''Danube Landscape with Castle W\u00f6rth'' (c. 1520) is one of the earliest accurate topographical paintings of a particular building in its setting, of a type that was to become a clich\u00e9 in later centuries.\n\n==Printmaking==\n[[File:Altdorfer Landscape with a city.jpg|thumb|Altdorfer's etching ''Landscape with a city by the lake'' (1520s), [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]\n\nAltdorfer was a significant [[printmaker]], with numerous [[engraving]]s and about ninety-three [[woodcut]]s. These included some for the ''Triumphs of Maximilian'', where he followed the overall style presumably set by [[Hans Burgkmair]], although he was able to escape somewhat from this in his depictions of the more disorderly baggage-train, still coming through a mountain landscape.  However most of his best [[Old master print|prints]] are [[etching]]s, many of landscapes; in these he was able most easily to use his drawing style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/intg/ho_1993.1097.htm |title=Albrecht Altdorfer: Landscape with a Double Spruce in the Foreground (1993.1097) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=2013-09-04 |accessdate=2013-12-21}}</ref>  He was one of the most successful early etchers, and was unusual for his generation of German printmakers in doing no book illustrations.

He was considered to be an outstanding politician of his day. In 1517 he was a member of the \"Ausseren Rates\", the council on external affairs, and in this capacity was involved in the expulsion of the Jews, the destruction of the [[Regensburg Synagogue|synagogue]] and in its place the construction of a church and shrine to the Sch\u00f6ne Maria that occurred in 1519.

It is also known as the '''House of Anhalt''', which refers to its longest-held possession, [[Principality of Anhalt|Anhalt]].\n\nThe Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, known as ''Schloss Askanien'' in German, which was located near and named after [[Aschersleben]]. The castle was the seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Schloss Ballenstedt, Hofseite.JPG|thumb|[[Ballenstedt]] Castle]]\n[[File:Map of Anhalt (1747-1793).svg|thumb|Map of Anhalt (1747-1793)]]\nThe earliest known member of the house, [[Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt]], first appears in a document of 1036. He is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of [[Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark]]. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the [[Saxon Eastern March]].\n\nEsiko's grandson was [[Otto, Count of Ballenstedt]], who died in 1123. By Otto's marriage to [[Eilika of Saxony|Eilika]], daughter of [[Magnus, Duke of Saxony]], the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of [[Billung]], former dukes of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]].\n\nOtto's son, [[Albert the Bear]], became, with the help of his mother's inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. However, he soon lost control of Saxony to the rival [[House of Guelph]]. \n\nAlbert inherited the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] in 1157 from its last [[Wends|Wendish]] ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], and he became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in [[Christianity|Christianizing]] and [[Germanisation|Germanizing]] the lands. As a borderland between German and [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures, the country was known as a [[marches|march]].\n\nIn 1237 and 1244, two towns, [[C\u00f6lln]] and Berlin, were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear. Later, they were united into one city, [[Berlin]]. The emblem of the House of Ascania, a red eagle and bear, became the heraldic emblems of Berlin. In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.\n\nAfter the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe.\n\nIn the 13th century, the [[Principality of Anhalt]] was split off from the Duchy of Saxony. Later, the remaining state was split into [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] and [[Saxe-Wittenberg]]. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until the monarchy was abolished in 1918.\n\n[[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]], Empress of Russia from 1762\u20131796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of [[Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst]].\n\n==List of states ruled by the House of Ascania==\n{{Ducal Family of Anhalt}}\n* County, Principality, and Duchy of [[Principality of Anhalt|Anhalt]]: c. 1100\u20131918\n* [[Duchy of Saxony|Duchy]] and [[Electorate of Saxony]]: 1112, 1139\u20131142, 1180\u20131422\n* County of [[Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde]]: 1112\u20131486\n* [[Margravate of Brandenburg]]: 1157\u20131320\n* [[Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg]]: 1269\u20131689\n* [[Principality of L\u00fcneburg]]: 1369\u20131388\n* Principality and Duchy of [[Anhalt-Bernburg]]: 1252\u20131468 and 1603\u20131863\n* [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst]]: 1252\u20131396 and 1544\u20131796\n* [[Principality of Anhalt-Aschersleben]]: 1252\u20131315\n* Principality and Duchy of [[Anhalt-K\u00f6then]]: 1396\u20131561 and 1603\u20131847\n* Principality and Duchy of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] 1396\u20131561 and 1603\u20131863\n* [[Principality of Anhalt-Pl\u00f6tzkau]] 1544\u20131553 and 1603\u20131665\n* Principality of [[Anhalt-Harzgerode]] 1635\u20131709\n* Principality of Anhalt-M\u00fchlingen: 1667\u20131714\n* [[Principality of Anhalt-Dornburg]]: 1667\u20131742\n* Principality of [[Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]]: 1718\u20131812\n* [[Russian Empire]]: 1762\u20131796\n\n==References==\n* [http://susi.e-technik.uni-ulm.de:8080/Meyers2/seite/werk/brockhaus/band/50/seite/0992/brockhaus_b50_s0992.html ''Askanien'', Meyers Konversationslexikon, 1888]\n* Trillmich, Werner, ''Kaiser Konrad II. und seine Zeit'', Bonn, 1991\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|House of Ascania}}\n*[http://www.anhalt-askanien.de/ Ducal Family of Anhalt (House of Ascania)]] - official website\n*[http://www.europeanheraldry.org/germany/princely-houses/house-ascania/ European Heraldry page]\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/ascania/ascan1.html |title= GENEALOGY.EU: House of Ascania |publisher= Genealogy.EU}} (first page of a series)\n*[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/continent/bb/brandenburg1.php#top Stirnet: Brandenburg1] {{subscription required}} (genealogy of the Houses of Ascania and Brandenburg, including the most likely ancestry of the 11th-century House of Ascania)\n*[http://www.stirnet.com/genie/data/ancient/ae/ascania1.php#top Stirnet: Ascania1] {{subscription required}} (an alternate possible ancestry of the 11th-century House of Ascania)\n\n{{Royal houses of Europe}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ascania, House Of}}\n[[Category:House of Ascania|*]]\n[[Category:European royal families]]\n[[Category:Saxon nobility]]", "sha1": "03s04npx807e8td67b19tmg3o2se94r"}}, {"title": "Acceleration", "ns": "0", "id": "2443", "revision": {"id": "865993652", "parentid": "865820272", "timestamp": "2018-10-27T15:20:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Purgy Purgatorio", "id": "22035051"}, "comment": "/* Circular motion */ revised", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|acceleration in physics|other uses|Acceleration (disambiguation)|and|Accelerate (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox physical quantity\n| name = Acceleration\n| image = Gravity gravita grave.gif\n| caption = {{longitem|In the absence of [[Drag (physics)|air resistance]] and thus [[terminal velocity]], a falling ball would continue to accelerate.}}\n| symbols = '''a'''\n| unit = [[Metre per second squared|m/s{{sup|2}}, m\u00b7s{{sup|\u22122}}, m&nbsp;s{{sup|\u22122}}]]\n| dimension = '''L''' '''T''' <sup>-2</sup>\n}}\n{{Classical mechanics |Fundamentals |width=20.5em}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time.

If the car turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction. In this example, we can call the forward acceleration of the car a \"linear acceleration\", which passengers in the car might experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, we might call this \"non-linear acceleration\", which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction from the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called '''deceleration'''.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Raymond A.

In this case it is said to be undergoing ''centripetal'' (directed towards the center) acceleration.\n\n[[Proper acceleration]], the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an [[accelerometer]].\n\nIn [[classical mechanics]], for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net [[force]] vector (i.e. sum of all forces) acting on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]):\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} \\quad \\to \\quad \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{F}/m</math>\nwhere '''F''' is the net force acting on the body, ''m'' is  the [[mass]] of the body, and '''a''' is the center-of-mass acceleration.

The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the [[gravitational field]] strength ''[[standard gravity|g]]'' (also called ''acceleration due to gravity'').

The derivative of the location of a point on a curve with respect to time, i.e. its velocity, turns out to be always exactly tangential to the curve, respectively orthogonal to the radius in this point. Since in uniform motion the velocity in the tangential direction does not change, the acceleration must be in radial direction, pointing to the center of the circle. This acceleration constantly changes the direction of the velocity to be tangent in the neighboring point, thereby rotating the velocity vector along the circle. For a given speed <math>v</math>, the magnitude of this geometrically caused acceleration is inversely proportional to the radius <math>r</math> of the circle, and increases as the square of this speed:\n\n:<math> \\textrm{a} = v^2 \\cdot\\frac {1} {r}\\;.</math>\n\nExpressing this vector in polar components, where <math>\\mathbf{r} </math> is a vector from the centre of the circle to the particle with magnitude equal to this distance, and considering the orientation of the acceleration towards the center, yields\n\n:<math> \\mathbf {a}= -\\frac{v^2}{|\\mathbf {r}|}\\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf {r}}{|\\mathbf {r}|}\\;. </math>\n\nAs usual in rotations, the speed <math>v</math> of a particle may be expressed as an [[angular velocity|''angular speed'']] with respect to a point at the distance <math>r</math> as\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\frac {v}{r}.</math>\n\nThus <math> \\mathbf {a}= -\\omega^2  \\mathbf {r}\\;. </math>\n\nThis acceleration and the mass of the particle determine the necessary [[centripetal force]], directed ''toward'' the centre of the circle, as the net force acting on this particle to keep it in this uniform circular motion. The so-called '[[centrifugal force]]', appearing to act outward on the body, is a so called [[pseudo force]] experienced in the [[frame of reference]] of the body in circular motion, due to the body's [[linear momentum]], a vector tangent to the circle of motion.\n\nIn a nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path is changing, the acceleration has a non-zero component tangential to the curve, and is not confined to the [[Principal normal vector|principal normal]], which directs to the center of the osculating circle, that determines the radius <math>r</math> for the centripetal acceleration. The tangential component is given by the angular acceleration <math>\\alpha</math>, i.e., the rate of change <math>\\alpha = \\dot\\omega</math> of the angular speed <math>\\omega</math> times the radius <math>r</math>. That is,\n\n:<math> a = r \\alpha.</math>\n\nThe sign of the tangential component of the acceleration is determined by the sign of the [[angular acceleration]] (<math>\\alpha</math>), and the tangent is of course always directed at right angles to the radius vector.\n\n== Relation to relativity ==\n\n===Special relativity===\n{{main article|Special relativity|Acceleration (special relativity)}}\nThe special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum. [[Newtonian mechanics]] is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.\n\nAs speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed [[asymptotically]], but never reach it.\n\n===General relativity===\n{{main article|General relativity}}\nUnless the state of motion of an object is known, it is impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to [[gravity]] or to acceleration\u2014gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. [[Albert Einstein]] called this the [[equivalence principle]], and said that only observers who feel no force at all\u2014including the force of gravity\u2014are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.<ref>Brian Greene, ''[[The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality]]'', page 67.

Conservation of cultural heritage can be described as a type of ethical [[stewardship]].\n\nConservation of cultural heritage applies simple ethical guidelines:\n* Minimal intervention;\n* Appropriate materials and reversible methods;\n* Full documentation of all work undertaken.\n\nOften there are compromises between preserving appearance, maintaining original design and material properties, and ability to reverse changes. Reversibility is now emphasized so as to reduce problems with future treatment, investigation, and use.\n\nIn order for conservators to decide upon an appropriate conservation strategy and apply their professional expertise accordingly, they must take into account views of the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]], the [[Values (heritage)|values]] and [[Preservation of meaning|meaning]] of the work, and the physical needs of the material.\n\nCesare Brandi in his ''Theory of Restoration'', describes restoration as \"the methodological moment in which the work of art is appreciated in its material form and in its historical and aesthetic duality, with a view to transmitting it to the future\".<ref>[Cesare Brandi, ''Teoria del restauro''; Rome: Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura, 1963: reprint, Turin: G.

Caring for the Past: Issues in Conservation for Archaeology and Museums. London: James and James</ref> Until the early 20th century, artists were normally the ones called upon to repair damaged artworks. During the 19th century, however, the fields of science and art became increasingly intertwined as scientists such as [[Michael Faraday]] began to study the damaging effects of the environment to works of art. [[Louis Pasteur]] carried out scientific analysis on paint as well.<ref>Stoner, Joyce Hill. 2005. p. 41.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</ref> However, perhaps the first organized attempt to apply a theoretical framework to the conservation of cultural heritage came with the founding in the [[United Kingdom]] of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in 1877. The society was founded by [[William Morris]] and [[Philip Webb]], both of whom were deeply influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]]. During the same period, a French movement with similar aims was being developed under the direction of [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]], an architect and theorist, famous for his restorations of medieval buildings.\n\n[[File:Bixi stele (wrapped), Harvard University, Cambridge, MA - IMG 4607.JPG|thumb|Since 1998, [[Harvard University]] wraps some of the valuable statues on its campus, such as this \"[[Harvard Bixi|Chinese stele]]\", with waterproof covers every winter, in order to protect them from erosion caused by [[acid rain]].<ref>\"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]\", Harvard Magazine, March\u2013April 2000</ref>]]\nConservation of cultural heritage as a distinct field of study initially developed in Germany, where in 1888 [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became the first [[chemist]] to be employed by a [[Museum]], the Koniglichen Museen, Berlin ([[Royal Museum (Berlin)|Royal Museums of Berlin]]). He not only developed a scientific approach to the care of objects in the collections, but disseminated this approach by publishing a Handbook of Conservation in 1898.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gilberg, Mark.|year=1987|title= Friedrich Rathgen: The Father of Modern Archaeological Conservation|journal= Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=26|issue= 2|pages=105\u2013120 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/coolaic/jaic/articles/jaic26-02-004_2.html|doi=10.2307/3179459}}</ref> The early development of conservation of cultural heritage in any area of the world is usually linked to the creation of positions for chemists within museums. In the United Kingdom, pioneering research into painting materials and conservation, ceramics, and stone conservation was conducted by [[Arthur Pillans Laurie]], academic chemist and Principal of [[Heriot-Watt University]] from 1900. Laurie's interests were fostered by [[William Holman Hunt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |title=Brief biography of Professor AP Laurie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714201324/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P1161.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}</ref> In 1924 the chemist [[Dr Harold Plenderleith]] began to work at the [[British Museum]] with Dr. Alexander Scott in the recently created Research Laboratory, although he was actually employed by the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]] in the early years. Plenderleith's appointment may be said to have given birth to the conservation ''profession'' in the UK, although there had been craftsmen in many museums and in the commercial art world for generations.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_science/history.aspx History]. British Museum (2012-06-14). Retrieved on 2012-06-29.</ref> This department was created by the museum to address the deteriorating condition of objects in the collection, damages which were a result of their being stored in the [[London Underground]] tunnels during the [[First World War]]. The creation of this department moved the focus for the development of conservation theory and practice from Germany to Britain, and made the latter a prime force in this fledgling field. In 1956 Plenderleith wrote a significant handbook called The Conservation of Antiquities and Works of Art, which supplanted Rathgen's earlier tome and set new standards for the development of art and [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]].\n\nIn the [[United States]], the development of conservation of cultural heritage can be traced to the [[Fogg Art Museum]], and Edward Waldo Forbes, its director from 1909 to 1944. He encouraged technical investigation, and was Chairman of the Advisory Committee for the first technical journal, Technical Studies in the Field of the Fine Arts, published by the Fogg from 1932 to 1942. Importantly he also brought onto the museum staff chemists. [[Rutherford John Gettens]] was the first of usch in the US to be permanently employed by an art museum. He worked with [[George L. Stout]], the founder and first editor of Technical Studies. Gettens and Stout co-authored Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia in 1942, reprinted in 1966. This compendium is still cited regularly. Only a few dates and descriptions in Gettens' and Stout's book are now outdated.<ref name=\"Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003\">Stoner, Joyce Hill. \"Changing Approaches in Art Conservation: 1925 to the present\".

Oliver Brothers is believed to be the first and the oldest continuously operating art restoration company in the United States.\n\nThe focus of conservation development then accelerated in Britain and America, and it was in Britain that the first International Conservation Organisations developed. [[International Institute for Conservation|The International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC)]] was incorporated under British law in 1950 as \"a permanent organization to co-ordinate and improve the knowledge, methods, and working standards needed to protect and preserve precious materials of all kinds.\"<ref name=\"Stoner, Joyce Hill 2003\"/> The rapid growth of conservation professional organizations, publications, journals, newsletters, both internationally and in localities, has spearheaded the development of the conservation profession, both practically and theoretically. Art historians and theorists such as [[Cesare Brandi]] have also played a significant role in developing conservation science theory. In recent years ethical concerns have been at the forefront of developments in conservation. Most significantly has been the idea of [[preventive conservation]]. This concept is based in part on the pioneering work by [[Garry Thomson]] [[CBE]], and his book the Museum Environment, first published in 1978.<ref>Museum Environment (2nd Edition), 1986, by Garry Thomson CBE {{ISBN|978-0-7506-2041-3}}</ref> Thomson was associated with the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in London; it was here that he established a set of guidelines or environmental controls for the best conditions in which objects could be stored and displayed within the museum environment. Although his exact guidelines are no longer rigidly followed, they did inspire this field of conservation.\n\n==Ethics==\nThe conservator's work is guided by ethical standards. These take the form of [[applied ethics]]. Ethical standards have been established across the world, and national and international ethical guidelines have been written. One such example is:\n\n* [[American Institute for Conservation]] Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice <ref>[http://www.conservation-us.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&pageid=858 AIC \u2013 Code of Ethics].

Retrieved 2017-05-29.</ref> including examples of codes of ethics and guidelines for professional conduct in conservation and allied fields; and charters and treaties pertaining to ethical issues involving the preservation of cultural property.\n\nAs well as standards of practice conservators deal with wider ethical concerns, such as the debates as to whether all art is worth preserving.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weil|first=Stephen E.|date=October 1989|title=Too much Art?|journal=[[ArtNews]]|page=232|issn=0004-3273}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image|image1=Krnov castle b.jpg|footer=Castle gate of [[Krnov]] before (2001) and after (2009) restoration |image2=Krnov castle - entrance.jpg}}\n[[File:Beirut 002.jpg|thumb|Preserved historical quarter in [[Beirut Central District]]]]\n\n==Caring for cultural heritage==\n\n===Collections care===\n{{Main article|Collections care}}\nMany cultural works are sensitive to environmental conditions such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]] and exposure to [[light|visible light]] and [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]]. These works must be protected in controlled environments where such variables are maintained within a range of damage-limiting levels. For example, [[watercolour painting|watercolour paintings]] usually require shielding from sunlight to prevent fading of [[pigment]]s.\n\nCollections care is an important element of museum policy. It is an essential responsibility of members of the museum profession to create and maintain a protective environment for the collections in their care, whether in store, on display, or in transit. A museum should carefully monitor the condition of collections to determine when an artifact requires conservation work and the services of a qualified conservator.\n\n[[Image:Preventive Conservation - Serra da Capivara.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Work of preventive conservation in a rock wall with prehistoric paintings at the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]]. The work consists of filling the cracks to prevent the fragmentation of the wall.]]\n\n===Interventive conservation===\n[[File:FurnitureConservation2.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Furniture conservation \u2013 Re-glueing loose element of solid nut marriage chest (probably Italy, 19th century)]]\nA principal aim of a cultural conservator is to reduce the rate of deterioration of an object. Both non-interventive and interventive methodologies may be employed in pursuit of this goal. Interventive conservation refers to any direct interaction between the conservator and the material fabric of the object. Interventive actions are carried out for a variety of reasons, including aesthetic choices, stabilization needs for structural integrity, or cultural requirements for intangible continuity. Examples of interventive treatments include the removal of discolored varnish from a painting, the application of wax to a sculpture, and the washing and rebinding of a book. Ethical standards within the field require that the conservator fully justify interventive actions and carry out documentation before, during, and after the treatment.\n\nOne of the guiding principles of conservation of cultural heritage has traditionally been the idea of reversibility, that all interventions with the object should be fully reversible and that the object should be able to be returned to the state in which it was prior to the conservator's intervention. Although this concept remains a guiding principle of the profession, it has been widely critiqued within the conservation profession<ref>[[William Andrew Oddy|Andrew Oddy]] and Sara Carroll (eds). 1999. Reversibility \u2013 Does it Exist? British Museum Occasional Paper Number 135. London: British Museum.</ref> and is now considered by many to be \"a fuzzy concept.\"<ref>p. 185.

The modern conservation laboratory uses equipment such as [[microscope]]s, [[spectrometer]]s, and various [[x-ray]] regime instruments to better understand objects and their components. The data thus collected helps in deciding the conservation treatments to be provided to the object.\n\n==Country by country look==\n\n===United States===\nHeritage Preservation, in partnership with the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]], a U.S. federal agency, produced The Heritage Health Index.

The report made four recommendations:\n* Institutions must give priority to providing safe conditions for the collections they hold in trust.\n* Every collecting institution must develop an emergency plan to protect its collections and train staff to carry it out.\n* Every institution must assign responsibility for caring for collections to members of its staff.\n* Individuals at all levels of government and in the private sector must assume responsibility for providing the support that will allow these collections to survive.<ref>[http://www.heritagepreservation.org/HHI/ Heritage Health Index].

However, it is more common in the field of conservation today that the training required to become a practicing conservator comes from a recognized university course in conservation of cultural heritage.<ref name=\"AIC training\" >[http://www.conservation-us.org/training AIC \u2013 Becoming a Conservator]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.</ref>\n\nThe University can rarely provide all the necessary training in first hand experience that an apprenticeship can, and therefore in addition to graduate level training the profession also tends towards encouraging conservation students to spend time as an [[intern]].\n\nConservation of cultural heritage is an [[interdisciplinary]] field as conservators have backgrounds in the [[fine arts]], sciences (including [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and [[materials science]]), and closely related disciplines, such as [[art history]], [[archaeology]], [[studio art]], and [[anthropology]]. They also have design, fabrication, artistic, and other special skills necessary for the practical application of that knowledge.\n\nWithin the various schools that teach conservation of cultural heritage, the approach differs according to the educational and vocational system within the country, and the focus of the school itself. This is acknowledged by the [[American Institute for Conservation]] who advise \"Specific admission requirements differ and potential candidates are encouraged to contact the programs directly for details on prerequisites, application procedures, and program curriculum\".<ref name=\"AIC training\" />\n\nIn France, training for heritage conservation is taught by the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). \n\n==Associations and professional organizations==\n{{main article|Conservation associations and professional organizations}}\nSocieties devoted to the care of cultural heritage have been in existence around the world for many years. One early example is the founding in 1877 of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in Britain to protect the built heritage, this society continues to be active today.<ref>[http://www.spab.org.uk/html/what-is-spab/history-of-the-spab/ History of the SPAB]. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.</ref>\n\nThe built heritage was at the forefront of the growth of member based organizations in the [[United States]]. [[Preservation Virginia]], founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1889 as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.<ref>[http://www.apva.org/ APVA Preservation Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613122322/http://www.apva.org/ |date=2008-06-13 }}. Apva.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.</ref>\n\nToday, professional conservators join and take part in the activities of numerous conservation associations and professional organizations with the wider field, and within their area of specialization.\n\nThese organizations exist to \"support the conservation professionals who preserve our cultural heritage\".<ref>[http://www.conservation-us.org/about About AIC \u2013 Overview]. Conservation-us.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-29.</ref>\n\nThis involves upholding professional standards, promoting research and publications, providing educational opportunities, and fostering the exchange of knowledge among cultural conservators, allied professionals, and the public.\n\n==International cultural heritage documents==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Where the tune is familiar and the end emphatic\u2014lovers united, villains discomfited, intrigues exposed\u2014as it is in most [[Victorian literature|Victorian fiction]], we can scarcely go wrong, but where the tune is unfamiliar and the end a note of interrogation or merely the information that they went on talking, as it is in Tchekov, we need a very daring and alert sense of literature to make us hear the tune, and in particular those last notes which complete the harmony.<ref>Woolf, Virginia, ''The Common Reader: First Series, Annotated Edition'', Harvest/HBJ Book, 2002, {{ISBN|0-15-602778-X}}, 172.</ref>}}\n\nWhile a Professor of Comparative Literature at Princeton University, Michael Goldman presented his view on defining the elusive quality of Chekhov's comedies stating: \"Having learned that Chekhov is comic&nbsp;... Chekhov is comic in a very special, paradoxical way. His plays depend, as comedy does, on the vitality of the actors to make pleasurable what would otherwise be painfully awkward \u2013 inappropriate speeches, missed connections, ''faux pas'', stumbles, childishness \u2013 but as part of a deeper pathos; the stumbles are not pratfalls but an energized, graceful dissolution of purpose.\"<ref>Michael Goldman, ''The Actor's Freedom: Towards a Theory of Drama'', p72.</ref>\n\n[[Alan Twigg]], the chief editor and publisher of the Canadian book review magazine ''[[B.C.

[[Laurence Olivier]]'s final effort as a film director was a 1970 adaption of ''[[Three Sisters (1970 film)|Three Sisters]]'' in which he also played a supporting role. His work has also served as inspiration or been referenced in numerous films. In [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s 1975 film [[The Mirror (1975 film)|''The Mirror'']], characters discuss his short story \"[[Ward No. 6]]\". Woody Allen has been influenced by Chekhov and reference to his works are present in many of his films including ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975), ''[[Interiors]]'' (1978) and ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986). Plays by Chekhov are also referenced in [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s 1980 drama film ''[[The Last Metro]]'', which is set in a theatre. A portion of a stage production of ''Three Sisters'' appears in the 2014 drama film ''[[Still Alice]]''.\n\n== Publications ==\n{{main|Anton Chekhov bibliography}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Literature|Biography}}\n* [[Ann Dunnigan]], English-language translator\n* [[Jean-Claude van Itallie]], English-language translator\n* [[Maria Chekhova]]\n* [[Chekhov Monument in Rostov-on-Don]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Allen, David, ''Performing Chekhov'', Routledge (UK), 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-415-18934-7}}\n* Bartlett, Rosamund, and Anthony Phillips (translators), ''Chekhov: A Life in Letters'', Penguin Books, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044922-8}}\n* Bartlett, Rosamund, ''Chekhov: Scenes from a Life'', Free Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-7432-3074-2}}\n* Benedetti, Jean (editor and translator), ''Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov'', Methuen Publishing Ltd, 1998 edition, {{ISBN|978-0-413-72390-1}}\n* Benedetti, Jean, ''Stanislavski: An Introduction'', Methuen Drama, 1989 edition, {{ISBN|978-0-413-50030-4}}\n* Borny, Geoffrey, ''Interpreting Chekhov'', ANU Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-920942-68-8}}, [https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/interpreting-chekhov/download free download]\n* Chekhov, Anton, ''About Love and Other Stories'', translated by Rosamund Bartlett, Oxford University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-19-280260-6}}\n* Chekhov, Anton, ''The Undiscovered Chekhov: Fifty New Stories'', translated by [[Peter Constantine]], Duck Editions, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7156-3106-5}}\n* Chekhov, Anton, ''Easter Week'', translated by Michael Henry Heim, engravings by Barry Moser, Shackman Press, 2010\n* Chekhov, Anton, ''Forty Stories'', translated and with an introduction by [[Pierre Stephen Robert Payne|Robert Payne]], New York, Vintage, 1991 edition, {{ISBN|978-0-679-73375-1}}\n* Chekhov, Anton, ''Letters of Anton Chekhov to His Family and Friends with Biographical Sketch'', translated by [[Constance Garnett]], Macmillan, 1920.

Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Alfred Kastler]] served as the organization's first chairman.\n\nThe group initially provided assistance to [[Afghanistan refugees|Afghan refugees]] in [[Pakistan]], famine-stricken [[Ugandan]] communities, and [[Cambodia]]n refugees in [[Thailand]]. It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger's Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[F-100 (food)|F100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat [[acute malnutrition]]. As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Definition and evaluation of therapeutic food for severely malnourished children in  situations of humanitarian emergencies| pmid=10188315 | volume=182 | journal=Bull Acad Natl Med| pages=1679\u201390; discussion 1691\u20135 | last1 = Desjeux | first1 = JF | last2 = Briend | first2 = A | last3 = Prudhon | first3 = C | last4 = Greletty | first4 = Y | last5 = Golden | first5 = MH}}</ref> A few years later, therapeutic milk was repackaged as ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), a peanut-based paste packaged like a power bar. These bars allow for the treatment of malnutrition at home, and do not require any preparation or refrigeration.\n\nThe international network currently has headquarters in five countries \u2013 [[France]], [[Spain]], [[United States|the United States]], [[Canada]], and [[United Kingdom|the UK]]. Its four main areas of work include nutrition, food security, water and sanitation, and advocacy.<ref>http://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/fr/nos-missions</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nAction Against Hunger saves lives by preventing, detecting and treating severe acute malnutrition, particularly in emergency and conflicts situations. The organisation has an integrated approach with various sectors of intervention:\n* Nutrition and Health\n* Water, Sanitation and Hygiene\n* Food Security & Livelihoods\n* Emergency Response\n\n===Restaurants Against Hunger===\nAction Against Hunger partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to global hunger.

In order to maximize efficiency and coherence, these three operational headquarters work under the principle of one headquarter per country of intervention.\n* Action Against Hunger-UK focuses on research, monitoring and evaluation, notably with Hunger Watch. This UK headquarters also plays an intermediary role with DFID.\n* Action Against Hunger Canada raises public and private funds in North America and plays an increasing role on the national level.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/ Action Against Hunger US website]\n*[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org.uk/ Action Against Hunger UK website]\n*[http://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/ Action Contre la Faim France website]\n*[http://www.accioncontraelhambre.org/ Acci\u00f3n Contra el Hambre Spain website]\n*[http://www.actioncontrelafaim.ca/ Action Contre la Faim Canada website]\n*[http://www.aktiongegendenhunger.de/ Aktion gegen den Hunger Germany website] {{de icon}}\n*[http://www.azionecontrolafame.it/ Azione contro la Fame Italy website] {{it icon}}\n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Development charities based in France]]\n[[Category:International charities]]\n[[Category:Hunger relief organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Paris]]", "sha1": "e5jgiuf1csyx66xksop5uqnj6l0s585"}}, {"title": "AW", "ns": "0", "id": "2452", "revision": {"id": "854723860", "parentid": "839865459", "timestamp": "2018-08-13T10:22:44Z", "contributor": {"ip": "88.130.126.205"}, "comment": "/* Other uses */ min.ed.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{wiktionary|aw}}\n{{selfref|For the Article Wizard, see [[Wikipedia:Article Wizard]].}}\n'''A&W''', '''AW''', '''Aw''', '''aW''' or '''aw''' may refer to:\n\n{{TOC right}}\n==People==\n* [[Aw (surname)]], a Cantonese surname\n* [[A.

In addition to its importance as a biological phenomenon, defective apoptotic processes have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Excessive apoptosis causes [[atrophy]], whereas an insufficient amount results in uncontrolled cell proliferation, such as [[cancer]].\nSome factors like [[Fas receptor]]s and caspases promote apoptosis, while some members of the [[Bcl-2 family]] of proteins inhibit apoptosis.\n\n==Discovery and etymology==\n{{Main|History of apoptosis research}}\n\nGerman scientist [[Karl Vogt]] was first to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist [[Walther Flemming]] delivered a more precise description of the process of programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, [[John Kerr (pathologist)|John Foxton Ross Kerr]] at the University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr JF | title = A histochemical study of hypertrophy and ischaemic injury of rat liver with special reference to changes in lysosomes | journal = The Journal of Pathology and Bacteriology | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 419\u201335 | date = October 1965 | pmid = 5849603 | doi = 10.1002/path.1700900210 }}</ref> Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join [[Alastair Currie|Alastair R.

Two discoveries brought cell death from obscurity to a major field of research: identification of components of the cell death control and effector mechanisms, and linkage of abnormalities in cell death to human disease, in particular cancer.\n\nThe 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] was awarded to [[Sydney Brenner]], Horvitz and [[John Sulston|John E. Sulston]] for their work identifying genes that control apoptosis.  The genes were identified by studies in the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' and homologues of these genes function in humans to regulate apoptosis.\n[[File:John Sulston.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Sulston|John E.

Several caspases, in addition to [[APAF1]] and [[FADD]], have been mutated to determine the new phenotype.  In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704\u20135364 was removed from the gene.  This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing.  TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities.  However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels.  Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis.  Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse.  This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion.  When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain.  In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes.  APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation.  A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.\n\nThe caspase proteins are integral parts of the apoptosis pathway, so it follows that knock-outs made have varying damaging results.  A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation.  A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality.  However, with the use of cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure.  These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli.  Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation.  A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.\n\n==Methods for distinguishing apoptotic from necrotic (necroptotic) cells==\nIn order to perform analysis of apoptotic versus necrotic (necroptotic) cells, one can do analysis of morphology by [[time-lapse microscopy]], [[flow cytometry|flow fluorocytometry]], and [[transmission electron microscopy]].

In a living organism, this can have disastrous effects, often in the form of disease or disorder. A discussion of every disease caused by modification of the various apoptotic pathways would be impractical, but the concept overlying each one is the same: The normal functioning of the pathway has been disrupted in such a way as to impair the ability of the cell to undergo normal apoptosis. This results in a cell that lives past its \"use-by-date\" and is able to replicate and pass on any faulty machinery to its progeny, increasing the likelihood of the cell's becoming cancerous or diseased.\n\nA recently described example of this concept in action can be seen in the development of a lung cancer called [[NCI-H460]].<ref name=\"h460\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang L, Mashima T, Sato S, Mochizuki M, Sakamoto H, Yamori T, Oh-Hara T, Tsuruo T | title = Predominant suppression of apoptosome by inhibitor of apoptosis protein in non-small cell lung cancer H460 cells: therapeutic effect of a novel polyarginine-conjugated Smac peptide | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 831\u20137 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12591734 | doi =  | url = http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12591734 }}</ref> The ''X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein'' ([[XIAP]]) is [[Gene expression|overexpressed]] in cells of the H460 [[cell line]].

As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-\u03baB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs.

It was originally believed that the associated accumulation of cells was due to an increase in cellular proliferation, but it is now known that it is also due to a decrease in cell death. The most common of these diseases is cancer, the disease of excessive cellular proliferation, which is often characterized by an overexpression of [[inhibitor of apoptosis|IAP]] family members. As a result, the malignant cells experience an abnormal response to apoptosis induction: Cycle-regulating genes (such as p53, ras or c-myc) are mutated or inactivated in diseased cells, and further genes (such as bcl-2) also modify their expression in tumors.

For instance, treatments aim to restore apoptosis to treat diseases with deficient cell death, and to increase the apoptotic threshold to treat diseases involved with excessive cell death. To stimulate apoptosis, one can increase the number of death receptor ligands (such as TNF or TRAIL), antagonize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 pathway, or introduce Smac mimetics to inhibit the inhibitor (IAPs). The addition of agents such as Herceptin, Iressa, or Gleevec works to stop cells from cycling and causes apoptosis activation by blocking growth and survival signaling further upstream. Finally, adding p53-[[MDM2]] complexes displaces p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Many different methods can be used either to stimulate or to inhibit apoptosis in various places along the death signaling pathway.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boehm I | title = Apoptosis in physiological and pathological skin: implications for therapy | journal = Current Molecular Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 375\u201394 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16900661 | doi = 10.2174/156652406777435390 }}</ref>\n\nApoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death programme that is inherent in every cell of the body.

In a healthy individual, the number of CD4+ lymphocytes is in balance with the cells generated by the bone marrow; however, in HIV-positive patients, this balance is lost due to an inability of the bone marrow to regenerate CD4+ cells.  In the case of HIV, CD4+ lymphocytes die at an accelerated rate through uncontrolled apoptosis, when stimulated.\nAt the molecular level, hyperactive apoptosis can be caused by defects in signaling pathways that regulate the Bcl-2 family proteins. Increased expression of apoptotic proteins such as BIM, or their decreased proteolysis, leads to cell death, and can cause a number of pathologies, depending on the cells where excessive activity of BIM occurs.

Instead of an immune response, the dying cell synthesizes substances to break itself down and places them in a [[vacuole]] that ruptures as the cell dies.

McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral\u2013anal sex, manual\u2013anal sex, or anal sex toy use.<ref name=\"McBride and Fortenberry\"/> The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.<ref name=\"McBride and Fortenberry\"/> The review added that because \"relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners\", this means that it is \"quite rare\" to have research \"that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus.\"<ref name=\"McBride and Fortenberry\"/>\n\nAccording to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18\u201349 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.

In 1976 divers in the Aare found part of a seven-meter wide wooden bridge from the late Roman times.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Aarau rore-turm.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rore Tower]]\nAarau was founded around AD 1240 by the counts of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]].<ref name=EB/> Aarau is first mentioned in 1248 as ''Arowe''. Around 1250 it was mentioned as ''Arowa''. However the first mention of a city sized settlement was in 1256.<ref name=HDS>{{harvnb|L\u00fcthi|2009}}</ref> The town was ruled from the \"Rore\" tower, which has been incorporated into the modern city hall.\n\nIn 1273 the counts of Kyburg died out. Agnes of Kyburg, who had no male relations, sold the family's lands to King [[Rudolf I]] von [[Habsburg]]. He granted Aarau its city rights in 1283.<ref name=Colliers/> In the 14th century the city was expanded in two stages, and a second defensive wall was constructed. A deep ditch separated the city from its \"suburb;\" its location is today marked by a wide street named \"Graben\" (meaning Ditch).\n\nIn 1415 Bern invaded lower Aargau with the help of Solothurn. Aarau capitulated after a short resistance, and was forced to swear allegiance to the new rulers.<ref name=Colliers/> In the 16th century, the rights of the lower classes were abolished.\nIn March 1528 the citizens of Aarau allowed the introduction of Protestantism at the urging of the Bernese. A growth in population during the 16th Century led to taller buildings and denser construction methods. Early forms of industry developed at this time; however, unlike in other cities, no guilds were formed in Aarau.\n\nOn 11 August 1712, the [[Peace of Aarau]] was signed into effect. This granted each [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] the right to choose their own religion thereby ending [[Catholicism]]'s control.<ref>{{harvnb|Luck|1985|p=227}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|1991|p=134}}</ref> Starting in the early 18th century, the textile industry was established in Aarau. German immigration contributed to the city's favorable conditions, in that they introduced the cotton and silk factories. These highly educated immigrants were also responsible for educational reform and the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]], revolutionary spirit that developed in Aarau.\n\n===1798: Capital of the Helvetic Republic===\nOn 27 December 1797, the last [[Tagsatzung]] of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] was held in Aarau. Two weeks later a French envoy continued to foment the revolutionary opinions of the city. The contrast between a high level of education and a low level of political rights was particularly great in Aarau, and the city refused to send troops to defend the Bernese border. By Mid-March 1798 Aarau was occupied by French troops.\n\nOn 22 March 1798 Aarau was declared the capital of the [[Helvetic Republic]].<ref name=Cohen/> It is therefore the first capital of a unified Switzerland. Parliament met in the city hall. On 20 September, the capital was moved to [[Lucerne]].\n\n===Aarau as canton capital===\nIn 1803, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] ordered the fusion of the cantons of Aargau, Baden and Fricktal. Aarau was declared the capital of the new, enlarged canton of Aargau. In 1820 the city wall was torn down, with the exception of the individual towers and gates, and the defensive ditches were filled in.\n\nThe wooden bridge, dating from the Middle Ages, across the Aare was destroyed by floods three times in thirty years, and was replaced with a steel suspension bridge in 1851. This was replaced by a concrete bridge in 1952. The city was linked up to the [[Swiss Central Railway]] in 1856.\n\nThe textile industry in Aarau broke down in about 1850 because of the protectionist tariff policies of neighboring states. Other industries had developed by that time to replace it, including the production of [[mathematical instrument]]s, shoes and cement. Beginning in 1900, numerous electrical enterprises developed. By the 1960s, more citizens worked in service industries or for the canton-level government than in manufacturing. During the 1980s many of the industries left Aarau completely.\n\nIn 1802 the Canton School was established; it was the first non-parochial high school in Switzerland. It developed a good reputation, and was home to Nobel Prize winners [[Albert Einstein]], [[Paul Karrer]], and [[Werner Arber]], as well as several Swiss politicians and authors.\n\nThe purchase of a manuscript collection in 1803 laid the foundation for what would become the Cantonal Library, which contains a Bible annotated by [[Huldrych Zwingli]],<ref name=Ogr/> along with the manuscripts and incunabula.<ref name=Colliers/> More newspapers developed in the city, maintaining the revolutionary atmosphere of Aarau. Beginning in 1820, Aarau has been a refuge for political refugees.\n\nThe urban educational and cultural opportunities of Aarau were extended through numerous new institutions. A Theatre and Concert Hall was constructed in 1883, which was renovated and expanded in 1995\u201396. The Aargau Nature Museum opened in 1922. A former cloth warehouse was converted into a small theatre in 1974, and the alternative culture center KIFF (Culture in the fodder factory) was established in a former animal fodder factory.\n\n==Origin of the name==\nThe earliest use of the place name was in 1248 (in the form Arowe), and probably referred to the settlement in the area before the founding of the city. It comes, along with the name of the River Aare (which was called Arula, Arola, and Araris in early times), from the German Au, meaning [[floodplain]].\n\n===Old town===\n[[File:Aarauer Giebel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Painted Gable]]\nThe historic old town forms an irregular square, consisting of four parts (called ''St\u00f6cke''). To the south lies the [[Laurenzenvorstadt]], that is, the part of the town formerly outside the city wall. One characteristic of the city is its painted [[gable]]s, for which Aarau is sometimes called the \"City of beautiful Gables\". The old town, Laurenzenvorstadt, government building, cantonal library, state archive and art museum are all listed as [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]].<ref name = SWS>{{harvnb|Swiss Confederation|2009|p=33}}</ref>\n\nThe buildings in the old city originate, on the whole, from building projects during the 16th century, when nearly all the Middle Age period buildings were replaced or expanded. The architectural development of the city ended in the 18th century, when the city began to expand beyond its (still existing) wall. Most of the buildings in the \"suburb\" date from this time.\n\nThe \"Schl\u00f6ssli\" (small Castle), Rore Tower and the upper gate tower have remained nearly unchanged since the 13th century. The \"Schl\u00f6ssli\" is the oldest building in the city. It was already founded at the time of the establishment of the city shortly after 1200; the exact date is not known. City hall was built around Rore Tower in 1515.\n\n[[File:Aarau1612.jpg|thumb|right|View of Aarau from 1612]]\nThe upper gate tower stands beside the southern gate in the city wall, along the road to Lucerne and Bern. The jail has been housed in it since the Middle Ages. A [[Carillon]] was installed in the tower in the middle of the 20th century, the bells for which were provided by the centuries-old bell manufacturers of Aarau.\n\nThe town church was built between 1471 and 1478. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], in 1528, its twelve altars and accompanying pictures were destroyed. The \"Justice fountain\" (Gerechtskeitbrunnen) was built in 1634, and is made of French [[limestone]]; it includes a statue of Lady Justice made of [[sandstone]], hence the name. It was originally in the street in front of city hall, but was moved to its present location in front of the town church in 1905 due to increased traffic.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Kunsthaus Aarau.jpg|thumb|right|Kunsthaus Museum]]\n{{as of|2007|In 2007}}, Aarau had an unemployment rate of 2.35%.  {{as of|2005}}, there were 48 people employed in the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary economic sector]] and about 9 businesses involved in this sector. 4,181 people are employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] and there are 164 businesses in this sector. 20,186 people are employed in the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]], with 1,461 businesses in this sector.<ref name=SFSO/> This is a total of over 24,000 jobs, since Aarau's population is about 16,000 it draws workers from many surrounding communities.  {{as of|2000}} there were 8,050 total workers who lived in the municipality. Of these, 4,308 or about 53.5% of the residents worked outside Aarau while 17,419 people commuted into the municipality for work. There were a total of 21,161 jobs (of at least 6 hours per week) in the municipality.<ref name=agch>{{harvnb|Department of Finance and Resources|2013}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe largest employer in Aarau is the cantonal government, the offices of which are distributed across the entire city at numerous locations. One of the two head offices of the ''[[Aargauer Zeitung]]'', Switzerland's fifth largest newspaper, is located in Aarau, as are the Tele M1 television channel studios, and several radio stations.\n\n[[Kern & Co.]], founded in 1819, was an internationally known [[Geodesy|geodetic]] instrument manufacturer based in Aarau. However, it was taken over by Wild Leitz in 1988, and was closed in 1991.\n\nMore than half of the workers in Aarau live in the city's suburbs, or farther away in the surrounding area. This leads to a busy rush hour, and regular traffic jams. Statistically, Aarau has the most jobs per capita of any Swiss city.\n\nThe small scale of Aarau causes it to continually expand the borders of its growth. The urban center lies in the middle of the \"Golden Triangle\" between [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]], and [[Basel]], and Aarau is having increasing difficulty in maintaining the independence of its economic base from the neighboring large cities. The idea of merging Aarau with its neighboring suburbs has been recently discussed in the hope of arresting the slowly progressing losses.\n\nManufacture include bells, mathematical instruments, electrical goods, cotton textiles, cutlery, chemicals, shoes, and other products. Aarau is famous for the quality of their instruments, cutlery and their bells.<ref name=Colliers/><ref name=Cohen/><ref name=Ogr>{{harvnb|Ogrizek|Rufenacht|1949|p=43}}</ref>\n\n===Markets and fairs===\nEvery Saturday morning there is a vegetable market in the ''Graben'' at the edge of the Old City. It is supplied with regional products. In the last week of September the MAG (Market of Aarauer Tradesmen) takes place there, with regional companies selling their products. The \"R\u00fceblim\u00e4rt\" is held in the same place on the first Wednesday in November, which is a Carrot fair. The Aarau fair is held at the ice skating rink during the Spring.\n\n==Transport==\n[[Aarau railway station]] is a terminus of the [[S-Bahn Z\u00fcrich]] on the line [[S3 (ZVV)|S3]].\n\nThe town is also served with public transport provided by [[Busbetrieb Aarau AG]].\n\n==Population==\nThe population of Aarau grew continuously from 1800 until about 1960, when the city reached a peak population of 17,045, more than five times its population in 1800. However, since 1960 the population has fallen by 8%. There are three reasons for this population loss: firstly, since the completion of Telli (a large apartment complex), the city has not had any more considerable land developments. Secondly, the number of people per household has fallen; thus, the existing dwellings do not hold as many people. Thirdly, population growth was absorbed by neighboring municipalities in the regional urban area, and numerous citizens of Aarau moved into the countryside. This trend might have stopped since the turn of the 21st century. Existing industrial developments are being used for new purposes instead of standing empty.\n\nAarau has a population (as of {{Swiss populations date|CH-AG}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-AG|4001}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-AG}}  {{as of|2008}}, 19.8% of the population was made up of foreign nationals.<ref name=AG_pop>{{harvnb|Department of Finance and Resources|2013a}}</ref> Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 1%.

It is situated by the lower course of the [[Aare]], which is why the canton is called Aar-[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]] (meaning ''Aare province''). It is one of the most densely populated regions of Switzerland.<ref name=Colliers>{{harvnb|Van Valkenburg|1997|p=3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe area of Aargau and the surrounding areas were controlled by the [[Helvetians]], a member of the [[Celts]], as far back as 200&nbsp;BC,<ref name=oR/> eventually being occupied by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and then by the 6th century, the [[Franks]].<ref name=Cohen/> The Romans built a major settlement called [[Vindonissa]], near the present location of [[Brugg]].<ref name=oR>{{harvnb|Ogrizek|Rufenacht|1949|p=4}}</ref>\n\n===Medieval Aargau===\n{{See also|List of castles and fortresses in Switzerland#Aargau}}\n[[File:Aarau Altstadt.jpg|thumb|left|Aarau]]\nIn early medieval times, the Aargau was a disputed border region between the duchies of [[Alamannia]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. A line of the von [[Wetterau]] ([[Conradines]]) intermittently held the countship of Aargau from 750 until about 1030, when they lost it (having in the meantime taken the name [[von]] [[Tegerfelden]]). From the extinction in 1254 of the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] dynasty until 1415, the area was ruled by the [[Habsburgs]],{{refn|group=nb|The Habsburgs were probably from the canton of Aargau originally.<ref>{{harvnb|Farbkarte|2002|p=283}}</ref>}} and many castles from that time still stand (examples include [[Habsburg Castle|Habsburg]], [[Schloss Lenzburg|Lenzburg]], Tegerfelden, Bobikon, Stin and Wildegg).<ref>{{harvnb|Ogrizek|Rufenacht|1949|p=43}}</ref> The Habsburgs founded a number of monasteries (with some structures enduring, e.g., in [[Wettingen Abbey|Wettingen]] and [[Muri Abbey|Muri]]), the closing of which by the government in 1841 was a contributing factor to the outbreak of the Swiss civil war \u2013 the \"[[Sonderbund War]]\" \u2013 in 1847.\n\n===Under the Swiss Confederation===\n[[File:Historische Karte CH 1416.png|thumb|Switzerland in 1416, showing the part of the Aargau under Bernese control, the county of Baden and the Freie \u00c4mter.]]\nWhen [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick IV of Habsburg]] sided with [[Antipope John XXIII]] at the [[Council of Constance]], [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] placed him under the [[Imperial ban]].{{refn | group = nb | The Imperial Ban outlawed all possessions of that person or family, in this case th Habsburgs. Thereafter, the Habsburg lands were open to the taking.<ref name=Luck>{{harvnb|Luck|1985|p=98}}</ref>}} In July 1414, the Pope visited [[Bern]] and received assurances from them, that they would move against the Habsburgs.<ref name=Luck/> A few months later the [[Swiss Confederation]] denounced the [[Treaty of 1412]]. Shortly thereafter in 1415, [[Bern]] and the rest of the Swiss Confederation used the ban as a pretext to invade the Aargau. The Confederation was able to quickly conquer the towns of Aarau, Lenzburg, Brugg and Zofingen along with most of the Habsburg castles. [[Bern]] kept the southwest portion ([[Zofingen]], [[Aarburg]], [[Aarau]], [[Lenzburg]], and [[Brugg]]), northward to the confluence of the [[Aare (river)|Aare]] and [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]].<ref name=Luck/> The important city of [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] was taken by a united Swiss army and governed by all 8 members of the Confederation.<ref name=Luck/> Some districts, named the ''[[Freie \u00c4mter]]'' (''free bailiwicks'') \u2013 [[Mellingen]], [[Muri]], [[Villmergen]], and [[Bremgarten (district)|Bremgarten]], with the [[County of Baden|countship of Baden]] \u2013 were governed as \"subject lands\" by all or some of the Confederates. Shortly after the conquest of the Aargau by the Swiss, [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick]] humbled himself to the Pope. The Pope reconciled with him and ordered all of the taken lands to be returned. The Swiss refused and years later after no serious attempts at re-acquisition, the Duke officially relinquished rights to the Swiss.<ref name=Luck1>{{harvnb|Luck|1985|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Unteraargau or Berner Aargau===\n[[File:Berner Aargau.png|thumb|upright|Districts in Bernese controlled Unteraargau]]\nBern's portion of the Aargau came to be known as the [[Unteraargau]], though can also be called the Berner or Bernese Aargau. In 1514 Bern expanded north into the [[Canton of Jura|Jura]] and so came into possession of several strategically important mountain passes into the Austrian [[Fricktal]]. This land was added to the Unteraargau and was directly ruled from Bern. It was divided into seven rural [[bailiwick]]s and four administrative cities, Aarau, Zofingen, Lenzburg and Brugg. While the Habsburgs were driven out, many of their minor nobles were allowed to keep their lands and offices, though over time they lost power to the Bernese government. The bailiwick administration was based on a very small staff of officials, mostly made up of Bernese citizens, but with a few locals.<ref name=HDS_BA>{{harvnb|Sauerl\u00e4nde|2002}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bern converted during the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1528, the Unteraargau also converted. At the beginning of the 16th century a number of [[anabaptist]]s migrated into the upper Wynen and Rueder valleys from [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Despite pressure from the Bernese authorities in the 16th and 17th centuries anabaptism never entirely disappeared from the Unteraargau.<ref name=HDS_BA/>\n\nBern used the Aargau bailiwicks mostly as a source of grain for the rest of the city-state. The administrative cities remained economically only of regional importance. However, in the 17th and 18th centuries Bern encouraged industrial development in Unteraargau and by the late 18th century it was the most industrialized region in the city-state. The high industrialization led to high population growth in the 18th century, for example between 1764 and 1798, the population grew by 35%, far more than in other parts of the canton. In 1870 the proportion of farmers in Aarau, Lenzburg, Kulm, and Zofingen districts was 34\u201340%, while in the other districts it was 46\u201357%.<ref name=HDS_BA/>\n\n===Freie \u00c4mter===\n[[File:Landvogtei Freie Aemter.png|thumb|upright|Map of the Freie \u00c4mter, including the 1712 line dividing the Upper and Lower Freie \u00c4mter]]\nThe rest of the [[Freie \u00c4mter]] were collectively administered as subject territories by the rest of the Confederation. Muri ''Amt'' was assigned to Z\u00fcrich, Lucerne, [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], while the ''\u00c4mter'' of Meienberg, Richensee and [[Villmergen]] were first given to Lucerne alone. The final boundary was set in 1425 by an arbitration tribunal and Lucerne had to give the three ''\u00c4mter'' to be collectively ruled.<ref name=HDS_FA>{{harvnb|Wohle|2006}}</ref> The four ''\u00c4mter'' were then consolidated under a single Confederation [[bailiff]] into what was known in the 15th century as the ''Waggental'' Bailiwick ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Vogt]]ei im Waggental}}). In the 16th century, it came to be known as the ''Vogtei der Freien \u00c4mter''. While the ''Freien \u00c4mter'' often had independent lower courts, they were forced to accept the Confederation's sovereignty. Finally, in 1532, the canton of Uri became part of the collective administration of the Freien \u00c4mter.<ref>{{harvnb|Gasser|Keller|1932|p=82}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the majority of the \u00c4mter converted to the new faith. In 1529, a wave of [[iconoclasm]] swept through the area and wiped away much of the old religion. After the defeat of Z\u00fcrich in the second [[Battle of Kappel]] in 1531, the victorious five Catholic cantons marched their troops into the Freie \u00c4mter and reconverted them to Catholicism.<ref name=HDS_FA/>\n\nIn the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712, the Freie \u00c4mter became the staging ground for the warring Reformed and Catholic armies. While the peace after the 1656 war did not change the status quo, the fourth Peace of Aarau in 1712 brought about a reorganization of power relations. The victory gave Z\u00fcrich the opportunity to force the Catholic cantons out of the government in the [[county of Baden]] and the adjacent area of the Freie \u00c4mter. The Freie \u00c4mter were then divided in two by a line drawn from the gallows in [[Fahrwangen]] to the [[Oberlunkhofen]] church steeple. The northern part, the so-called Unteren Freie \u00c4mter (lower Freie \u00c4mter), which included the districts of Boswil (in part) and Hermetschwil and the Niederamt, were ruled by Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Glarus. The southern part, the Oberen Freie \u00c4mter (upper Freie \u00c4mter), were ruled by the previous seven cantons but Bern was added to make an eighth.<ref name=HDS_FA/>\n\nDuring the [[Helvetic Republic]] (1798\u20131803), the county of Baden, the Freie \u00c4mter and the area known as the [[Kelleramt]] were combined into the [[canton of Baden]].\n\n===County of Baden===\n[[File:Grafschaft Baden.png|thumb|upright|County of Baden]]\nThe [[County of Baden]] was a shared [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the entire [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. After the Confederacy conquest in 1415, they retained much of the Habsburg legal structure, which caused a number of problems. The local nobility had the right to hold the [[High, middle and low justice|low court]] in only about one fifth of the territory. There were over 30 different nobles who had the right to hold courts scattered around the surrounding lands. All these overlapping jurisdictions caused numerous conflicts, but gradually the Confederation was able to acquire these rights in the County. The cities of Baden, [[Bremgarten, Aargau|Bremgarten]] and [[Mellingen]] became the administrative centers and held the high courts. Together with the courts, the three administrative centers had considerable local autonomy, but were ruled by a governor who was appointed by the ''Acht Orte'' every two years. After the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Protestant]] victory at the [[Toggenburg War|Second Battle of Villmergen]], the administration of the County changed slightly. Instead of the ''Acht Orte'' appointing a bailiff together, Z\u00fcrich and Bern each appointed the governor for 7 out of 16 years while [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] appointed him for the remaining 2 years.<ref name=HDS_CB>{{harvnb|Steigmeier|2002}}</ref>\n\nThe chaotic legal structure and fragmented land ownership combined with a tradition of dividing the land among all the heirs in an inheritance prevented any large scale reforms. The governor tried in the 18th century to reform and standardize laws and ownership across the County, but with limited success. With an ever-changing administration, the County lacked a coherent long-term economic policy or support for reforms. By the end of the 18th century there were no factories or mills and only a few small [[Cottage industry#Cottage industry|cottage industries]] along the border with Z\u00fcrich. Road construction first became a priority after 1750, when Z\u00fcrich and Bern began appointing a governor for seven years.<ref name=HDS_CB/>\n\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation]], some of the municipalities converted to the new faith. However, starting in 1531, some of the old parishes were [[Counter-Reformation|converted back to the old faith]]. The governors were appointed from both Catholic and Protestant cantons and since they changed every two years, neither faith gained a majority in the County.<ref name=HDS_CB/>\n\nThe County was the only federal condominium in the 17th century where Jews were tolerated. In 1774, they were restricted to just two towns, [[Endingen, Switzerland|Endingen]] and [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]]. While the rural upper class tried several times to finally expel the Jews, the financial interests of the authorities prevented this. The Jews were directly subordinate to the governor starting in 1696 when they were forced to buy a protecting and shielding letter every 16 years from the governor.<ref name=HDS_CB/>\n\nAfter the French invasion, on 19 March 1798, the governments of Z\u00fcrich and Bern agreed to the creation of the short lived [[canton of Baden]] in the [[Helvetic Republic]]. With the [[Act of Mediation]] in 1803, the canton of Baden was dissolved. Portions of the lands of the former County of Baden now became the District of Baden in the newly created canton of Aargau. After World War II, this formerly agrarian region saw striking growth and became the district with the largest and densest population in the canton (110,000 in 1990, 715 persons per km<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=HDS_CB/>\n\n===Forming the canton of Aargau===\n[[File:Karte Helvetik 3.png|thumb|Helvetic Republic c. 1798/99, with the newly created cantons of Aargau and Baden]]\n[[File:Karte Mediation.png|thumb|Swiss Confederation following the 1803 Act of Mediation, with the modern canton of Aargau formed]]\nThe contemporary canton of Aargau was formed in 1803, a canton of the [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]] as a result of the [[Act of Mediation]]. It was a combination of three short-lived cantons of the [[Helvetic Republic]]: Aargau (1798\u20131803), Baden (1798\u20131803) and Fricktal (1802\u20131803). Its creation is therefore rooted in the [[Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Napoleonic era]]. In the year 2003, the canton of Aargau celebrated its 200th anniversary.\n\nFrench forces occupied the Aargau from 10 March to 18 April 1798; thereafter the Bernese portion became the canton of Aargau and the remainder formed the [[canton of Baden]]. Aborted plans to merge the two halves came in 1801 and 1802, and they were eventually united under the name Aargau,<ref name=Colliers/><ref>{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}</ref> which was then admitted as a full member of the reconstituted Confederation following the Act of Mediation. Some parts of the canton of Baden at this point were transferred to other cantons: the ''Amt'' of [[Hitzkirch]] to Lucerne, whilst [[H\u00fcttikon]], [[Oetwil an der Limmat]], [[Dietikon]] and [[Schlieren, Z\u00fcrich|Schlieren]] went to Z\u00fcrich. In return, Lucerne's ''Amt'' of [[Merenschwand]] was transferred to Aargau (district of Muri).\n\nThe [[Fricktal]], ceded in 1802 by [[Austria]] via Napoleonic France to the Helvetic Republic, was briefly a separate canton of the Helvetic Republic (the [[canton of Fricktal]]) under a ''[[Statthalter]]'' ('Lieutenant'), but on 19 March 1803 (following the Act of Mediation) was incorporated into the canton of Aargau.\n\nThe former cantons of Baden and Fricktal can still be identified with the contemporary [[Districts of Switzerland#Aargau|districts]] \u2013 the [[canton of Baden]] is covered by the districts of Zurzach, Baden, Bremgarten, and Muri (albeit with the gains and losses of 1803 detailed above); the [[canton of Fricktal]] by the districts of Rheinfelden and Laufenburg (except for [[Hottwil]] which was transferred to that district in 2010).\n\n===Chief magistracy===\nThe chief magistracy of Aargau changed its style repeatedly:\n* first two consecutive ''[[Regierungsstatthalter]]'' :\n** April 1798 \u2013 November 1801 Jakob Emmanuel Feer (1754\u20131833)\n** 1802\u20131803 Johann Heinrich Rothpletz (1766\u20131833)\n* Presidents of the Government Commission\n** 10 March 1803 \u2013 26 April 1803 Johann Rudolf Dolder (1753\u20131807)\n** 26 April 1803 \u2013 1815 a 'Small Council' (president rotating monthly)\n* annual ''[[Amtsb\u00fcrgermeister]]'' 1815\u20131831\n* annual ''[[Landamm\u00e4nner]]'' since 1815\n\n===Jewish history in Aargau===\n[[File:Lengau AG 5644.jpg|thumb|upright|Two separate doors (one for Jews and one for Christians) on a house in Lengnau]]\nIn the 17th century, Jews were banished from Switzerland. However, a few families were permitted to live in two villages, [[Endingen, Switzerland|Endingen]] and [[Lengnau, Aargau|Lengnau]], in Aargau which became the Jewish ghetto in Switzerland. During this period, Jews and Christians were not allowed to live under the same roof, neither were Jews allowed to own land or houses. They were taxed at a much higher rate than others and, in 1712, the Lengnau community was \"pillaged.\"<ref name=is/> In 1760, they were further restricted regarding marriages and procreation. This remained the case until the 19th century. In 1799, all special tolls were abolished, and, in 1802, the poll tax was removed.<ref name=is/>  On 5 May 1809, they were declared citizens and given broad rights regarding trade and farming. They were still restricted to Endingen and Lengnau until 7 May 1846, when their right to move and reside freely within the canton of Aargau was granted. On 24 September 1856, the [[Swiss Federal Council]] granted them full political rights within Aargau, as well as broad business rights; however the majority Christian population did not abide by these new liberal laws fully. The time of 1860 saw the canton government voting to grant suffrage in all local rights and to give their communities autonomy.

These horses of the west included herds of [[feral]] animals known as [[Mustang (horse)|Mustangs]], as well as horses domesticated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], including the [[Comanche]], [[Shoshoni]] and [[Nez Perce (tribe)|Nez Perce]] tribes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  As the colonial Quarter Horse was crossed with these western horses, the pioneers found that the new crossbred had innate \"cow sense\", a natural instinct for working with cattle, making it popular with cattlemen on [[ranch]]es.<ref name=Colonial193>Mackay-Smith ''Colonial Quarter Race Horse'' p. 193</ref>\n\n===Development as a distinct breed===\n{{See also|American Quarter Horse Association|American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame}}\n[[File:Petermccuewithcaudell.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of Peter McCue, taken in Oklahoma around 1905.]]\nEarly  [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sires]] of Quarter horse type included [[Steel Dust]], foaled 1843; Shiloh (or Old Shiloh), foaled 1844; Old Cold Deck (1862); Lock's Rondo, one of many \"Rondo\" horses, foaled in 1880; Old Billy\u2014again, one of many \"Billy\" horses\u2014foaled circa 1880; [[Traveler (horse)|Traveler]], a stallion of unknown breeding, known to have been in Texas by 1889;<ref name=\"Legends 2\">Close, ''Legends 2: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares.''</ref> and [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]], foaled 1895, registered as a [[Thoroughbred]] but of disputed pedigree.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/><ref name=\"Legends 2\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/quarter/|title= Quarter Horse|accessdate=2008-06-11 |author = Oklahoma State University|website= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080622082036/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/quarter/| archivedate= 22 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe main duty of the ranch horse in the American West was working cattle.  Even after the invention of the automobile, horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range. Thus, major Texas cattle [[ranch]]es, such as the [[King Ranch]], the 6666 (Four Sixes) Ranch, and the [[Waggoner Ranch]] played a significant role in the development of the modern Quarter Horse. The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the [[rodeo]], a contest which began with informal competition between [[cowboy]]s and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west.  To this day, the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-13-78|pmid = 22340285|pmc = 3309927|title = Whole-Genome sequencing and genetic variant analysis of a quarter Horse mare|journal = BMC Genomics|volume = 13|pages = 78|year = 2012|last1 = Doan|first1 = Ryan|last2 = Cohen|first2 = Noah D|last3 = Sawyer|first3 = Jason|last4 = Ghaffari|first4 = Noushin|last5 = Johnson|first5 = Charlie D|last6 = Dindot|first6 = Scott V}}</ref>\n\nHowever, sprint races were also popular weekend entertainment and racing became a source of economic gain for breeders as well.

Horses listed in the appendix may be entered in competition, but offspring are not initially eligible for full AQHA registration.

It is characterized by uncontrollable muscle twitching and substantial muscle weakness or paralysis among affected horses.  Because it is a dominant gene, only one parent has to have the gene for it to be transmitted to offspring.  There is a DNA test for HYPP, which is required by the [[AQHA]]. Since 2007, the AQHA bars registration of horses who possess the homozygous form (H/H) of the gene,<ref>[http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/hypp.html Details on AQHA HYP rules for registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120043813/http://www.aqha.com/association/registration/hypp.html |date=2009-01-20 }}</ref> and though [[heterozygous]] (H/N) horses are still eligible for registration, altering that status is currently being discussed. Additionally all Quarter Horses born 2007 or later that are confirmed to be descendants of Impressive must carry a note about the risks of HYPP on their registration papers. Due to HYPP, the halter classes are undergoing significant changes.  [[Halter (horse show)|Halter]] classes are dominated by the [[Impressive (horse)|Impressive]] bloodline.  Impressive, a very prolific halter horse, brought to the stock breeds the muscle mass that is popular in halter competition today.  This muscle mass is linked to HYPP, and as the condition is reduced within the breed, the style of horse in halter classes is also likely to change.  Already there have been rule changes, including the creation of a \"Performance Halter class\" in which a horse must possess a Register of Merit  in performance or racing before it  can compete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://services2.aqha.com/iphonedev/www/sections/sectionIV/rules/448.html |title=AQHA Handbook, Section 448 Halter Classes, (j) Performance Halter |accessdate=30 September 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*[[Malignant hyperthermia]].

This is caused by an [[autosome|autosomal]] [[recessive gene]], and thus, unlike HYPP, HERDA can only be transmitted if both parents carry the gene.  When a horse has this disease, there is a collagen defect that results in the layers of skin not being held firmly together. Thus, when the horse is ridden under saddle or suffers trauma to the skin, the outer layer often splits or separates from the deeper layer, or it can tear off completely. It rarely heals without disfiguring scars. Sunburn can also be a concern. In dramatic cases, the skin can split along the back and even roll down the sides, with the horse literally being skinned alive.  Most horses with HERDA are euthanized for humane reasons between the age of two and four years.  The very hotly debated and controversial theory, put forth by researchers at [[Cornell University]] and [[Mississippi State University]] is that the sire line of the great foundation stallion [[Poco Bueno]] is implicated as the origin of the disease.  As of May 9, 2007, Researchers working independently at Cornell University and at the [[University of California, Davis]] announced that a DNA test for HERDA has been developed.

There is a DNA test for this condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php |title= Horse Coat Color Tests| author= University of California \u2013 Davis|website=Veterinary Genetics Laboratory|publisher=University of California at Davis |accessdate=2008-03-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080219095454/http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolorhorse.php| archivedate= 19 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quarab]]\n*[[Quarter pony]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |author =American Quarter Horse Association |title=Official Stud Book and Registry Combined Books 1-2-3-4-5|location= Amarillo, TX |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |year=1961}}\n* {{cite journal |author = Church, Stephanie L.|date=2006-09-14|title= ACVIM 2006: Prevalence of PSSM in Quarter Horses|journal= The Horse Online News|url= http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=7628|accessdate=2008-06-12|issue= # 7628| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080606212010/http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=7628| archivedate= 6 June 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}\n* {{cite book  | last = Close| first = Pat| title = Legends 2: Outstanding Quarter Horse Stallions and Mares| publisher = Western Horseman| year = 1994| location = Colorado Springs|isbn=978-0-911647-30-3}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Quarter Running Horse: America's Oldest Breed |last=Denhardt |first=Robert M. |year=1979 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=Norman, OK |isbn=978-0-8061-1500-9}}\n* {{cite book |author =Mackay-Smith, Alexander |title=The Colonial Quarter Race Horse |publisher=Whittet & Shepperson|location=Richmond, VA |year=1983 }}\n* {{cite journal |author = Sellnow, Les|date=2007-05-28| title= HERDA: DNA Tests Available for Disfiguring Skin Disease|journal= The Horse Online News|url= http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx?ID=9687|accessdate=2007-05-07}}\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Valberg SJ, Mickelson JR, Gallant EM, MacLeay JM, Lentz L, de la Corte F |date=July 1999|title= Exertional rhabdomyolysis in quarter horses and thoroughbreds: one syndrome, multiple aetiologies|journal= Equine Vet Journal Supplement|volume= 30 |pmid= 10659313 |pages= 533\u20138}}\n* {{cite book |title= The Great American Speedhorse: A Guide to Quarter Racing |last= Wiggins |first= Walt |year= 1978 |publisher= Sovereign Books |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-671-18340-0 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book  | last = Denhardt| first = Robert Moorman| title = Foundation Sires of the American Quarter Horse| publisher = University of Oklahoma Press| year = 1997|isbn=978-0-8061-2947-1}}<!--This book isn't referenced in the article...if it becomes referenced at some point, move up to the references section.

They are oblong in shape with a deltoid base.<ref name=bail2/> They grow in succession. The petioles grow to at least {{convert|1|ft|cm}} in length.<ref name=bail2/> When the plant is mature, the flower stalk grows up inside the pseudostem.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''abaddon'' is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d0\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc (''[[Sheol]]''), meaning the realm of the dead. \n\nIn the New Testament [[Book of Revelation]], an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of [[locust]]s; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11&mdash;\"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, The Angel of Death.\") as {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03b2\u03b1\u03b4\u03b4\u1f7c\u03bd}}, and then translated (\"which in Greek means the Destroyer\", {{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd}}, ''Apollyon''). The Latin [[Vulgate]] and the [[Douay Rheims Bible]] have additional notes (not present in the Greek text), \"in Latin Exterminans\", ''exterminans'' being the Latin word for \"destroyer\".\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to the [[Brown Driver Briggs]] lexicon, the Hebrew ''abaddon'' ({{lang-he|\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3\u05d5\u05df}}; ''abaddon'') is an [[intensive word form|intensive]] form of the [[Semitic root]] and verb stem ''abad'' ({{lang|he|\u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05d3}})<ref>In modern and liturgical Hebrew, the Hebrew letter ''beit'' in some situations is pronounced like an English \"v,\" and so ''abad'' and ''abaddon'', as they would usually be transliterated, would be pronounced as ''avad'' and ''avadon.'' The consistent transliteration of ''[[beth (letter)|]]'' as ''b'' simply follows modern scholarly norms in sources discussing biblical Hebrew, and does not imply a position on the pronunciation of the letter and ''b'' or ''v'' in biblical times.</ref> \"perish\" (transitive \"destroy\"), which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible.

The area is famous for its [[Abadeh rug]]s.\n\nAn interesting fact is that Abadeh is closer, road-distance-wise to 4 provincial capitals of [[Isfahan]] (193&nbsp;km), [[Yasuj]] (197&nbsp;km), [[Yazd]] (217&nbsp;km), and [[Shahrekord]] (237&nbsp;km) compared to the distance to the provincial capital of its corresponding province, [[Shiraz]] (260&nbsp;km).\n\n{{Historical populations\n| title = Abadeh Historical population\n| type  = Iran\n|align       = right\n| width       =\n| state       =\n| shading     =\n| percentages =\n| footnote    =<ref>[http://citypopulation.de/Iran-Cities.html]</ref><br><ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abada \u0100B\u0100DA, Encyclopaedia Iranica]</ref>\n|1958|15888\n|1976|23383\n|1991|44967\n|1996|48882\n|2006|55143\n|2011|55758\n}}\n\n==Landmarks and crafts==\nAbadeh historical monuments include Emirate Kolah Farangi, Tymcheh Sarafyan and Khaje tomb, located in the Khoja mountains.\nAbadeh crafts can be embroidered in cotton. The town also produces [[Abadeh rug]]s.\n\nThe rugs tend to be based on a cotton warp and have a thin, tightly knotted pile. Most Abadeh rugs are closely cut making them very flat. Although some of the older Abadehs vary in style, many of the new designs are easily recognisable. These new designs, known as Heybatlu consist of a single diamond shaped medallion in the centre with smaller medallions on each corner. The pattern is typically geometrical flowers or animals and the main colours are light reds or burnt orange on top of a dark blue background with strong green details. The corners or borders are generally ivory in colour. Although some Abadeh and Shiraz rugs appear similar Abadeh can normally be differentiated by their higher knot counts as well as the fact that the warp is invariably cotton. The rugs are almost always exclusively medium in size and the KPSI of an average Abadeh is around 90. As always in the rug-world you get what you pay for however in general Abadeh are well made and fairly popular items, particularly in modern interiors or those with a Mediterranean or North African style.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n'''[[Road 65 (Iran)|Expressway 65]]''' passes through Abadeh. This situation helps Abadeh to improve its capabilities compared to the neighboring city, [[Eqlid]]. [[Road 78 (Iran)|Road 78]] makes connections from Abadeh to [[Abarkuh]], [[Yazd]] [[Eqlid]] and [[Yasuj]]. It has a junction with [[Road 65 (Iran)|Abadeh Shiraz Expressway]] 24&nbsp;km south of the city. A road starts from Abadeh Ring Road to [[Soqad]] and [[Semirom]], [[Road 55 (Iran)|Road 55]].\n\nThe railroad from [[Isfahan]] to [[Shiraz]] passes Abadeh and there are train services at Abadeh Railway Station to Shiraz, Esfahan, Tehran and Mashad. [[Abadeh Airport]] (OISA) was planned to be built in the mid 1990s.\n\n==Sport==\nAbadeh's main sport is [[Football (Soccer)|Football]], like the rest of the country. The main stadium is [[Takhti Stadium (Abadeh)|Takhti Stadium]] located in Mo'allem Square. The main team in Abadeh is [[Behineh Rahbar Abadeh F.C.]] which is currently playing in [[Iran Football's 3rd Division]] after finishing first in [[Fars Provincial League]] (FPL) last year. It played in [[Hazfi Cup 2010-11]] reaching the fourth round.\n\n==Air Defense Base==\nIn 2012 Iran announced it had started the construction an air defense site in city of Abadeh, the site is planned

It was rebuilt by [[Hadrian]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2011|p=1}}</ref> Hadrian caused a smaller temple to be built near the ruins of the former one. In the new temple there were three ancient statues in brass of Apollo, [[Leto]], and [[Artemis]], which had been dedicated by the Abaei, and had perhaps been saved from the former temple. The ancient [[agora]] and the ancient theatre still existed in the town in the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]. According to the statement of [[Aristotle]], as preserved by [[Strabo]], [[Thracians]] from the Phocian town of Abae emigrated to [[Euboea]], and gave to the inhabitants the name of Abantes.<ref>{{Cite Pausanias|10|35|1}} ''et seq.''</ref><ref>{{Cite Herodotus|1.46, 8.134, 33.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Diodorus|16.530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Strabo|pp. 423, 445}}</ref><ref name=Stephanus/>\n\n==Oracle==\n[[File:\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.jpg|thumb|400px|Remains of the sancutary at [[Kalapodi]]]]\nDespite destruction of the town, the oracle was still consulted, e.g. by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebans]] before the [[Battle of Leuctra]] in 371 BCE.<ref name=p2>{{harvnb|Pausanias|1898|p=439}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Henderson|2000|p=351}}</ref> The temple, along with the village of the same name, may have escaped destruction during the [[Third Sacred War]] (355\u2013346 BCE), due to the respect given to the inhabitants;<ref>{{harvnb|Henderson|2000a|p=381}}</ref> however it was in a very dilapidated state when seen by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in the 2nd century CE,<ref name = PausX>{{harvnb|Pausanias|1898|p=440}}</ref> though some restoration, as well as the building of a new temple, was undertaken by Emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=7}}</ref>\n\nThe sanctity of the shrine ensured certain privileges to the people of Abae,<ref>{{harvnb|Bilco|1882|p=172}}</ref> and these were confirmed by the Romans.

It is thus the first site where the archaeology confirms the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion, which has been inferred from the [[List of Mycenaean deities|presence of the names]] of Classical Greek divinities on [[Linear B]] texts from [[Pylos]] and [[Knossos]].{{refn | group = nb |See reports of the excavations of the German Archaeological Institute in Archaeological Reports for 2008/9 43-45, Archaeological Reports for 2007/8 47-49, Archaeological Reports for 2006/7 41-43, Archaeological Reports for 2005/6 68-69, Archaeological Reports for 2004/5 55-56.}}\n\nThe fortified site described below, originally identified as Abae by Colonel [[William Leake]] in the 19th century, is much more likely to be that of the Sanctuary of Artemis at [[Hyampolis]].\n\nThe [[polygon]]al walls of the acropolis may still be seen in a fair state of preservation on a circular hill standing about {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the little plain of [[Exarcho]]; one gateway remains, and there are also traces of town walls below. The temple site was on a low spur of the hill, below the town. An early terrace wall supports a precinct in which are a [[stoa]] and some remains of temples; these were excavated by the [[British School at Athens]] in 1894, but little was found.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist | group = nb }}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | editor-last = Avery | editor-first = Catherine A. | encyclopedia = The New Century Classical Handbook | publisher = Appleton-Century-Crofts, Inc. | location = New York, NY | year = 1962 | lccn = 62-10069 | title = Abae | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Bell | first = Robert E. | title = Place-Names in Classical Mythology | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | year = 1989 | location = Santa Barbara, CA | isbn = 978-0874365078 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite journal | last = Bilco | first = J. | journal = Bulletin de Correspondance Hell\u00e9nique | title = Lettre du roi Philippe aux habitants d'Abae | volume = 6 | pages = 171\u2013175 | year = 1882 | doi = 10.3406/bch.1882.4191 | url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bch_0007-4217_1882_num_6_1_4191 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | editor-last = Henderson | editor-first = Jeffrey | title = Pausanian Description of Greece | year = 2000 | orig-year = 1926 | translator = W.

When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists in 1941\u20131945, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely [[Han Dynasty]] era (206 BCE\u2013220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L.A.&nbsp;Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of [[Li Ling]], a Chinese general who had been defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 99&nbsp;BCE, and defected to them as a result.<ref>{{harvnb|Yevtyukhova|1954}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}</ref> While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well. More recently, for example, it was claimed by A.A.&nbsp;Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang ([[:zh:\u5362\u82b3|\u76e7\u82b3]]), a Han throne pretender from the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu]] era.<ref>{{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007|p=148}}</ref>\n\n===Lithuanian exiles===\nIn the late 18th and during the 19th century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830\u20131831, and 1863 rebellions against Russian rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of [[labor camp|camp]]s was established where prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines.

[[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] at the center of [[Place Charles de Gaulle]], formerly named ''Place de l'\u00c9toile'' \u2014 the ''\u00e9toile'' or \"star\" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. \n\nThe Arc de Triomphe should not be confused with a smaller arch, the [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], which stands west of the [[Louvre Palace|Louvre]]. The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the [[Arc de Triomphe#Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from World War I.\n\nAs the central cohesive element of the ''[[Axe historique]]'' (historic axis, a sequence of monuments and grand thoroughfares on a route running from the courtyard of the Louvre to the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense]]), the Arc de Triomphe was designed by [[Jean Chalgrin]] in 1806, and its [[Iconography|iconographic]] program pits [[Heroic nudity|heroically nude]] French youths against bearded [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors in [[mail (armour)|chain mail]]. It set the tone for public monuments with triumphant patriotic messages.\n\nInspired by the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], the Arc de Triomphe has an overall height of {{Convert|50|m|ft|0}}, width of {{Convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and depth of {{Convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while its large vault is {{Convert|29.19|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{Convert|14.62|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.

Three weeks after the Paris victory parade in 1919 (marking the end of hostilities in World War I), [[Charles Godefroy]] flew his [[Nieuport]] biplane under the arch's primary vault, with the event captured on newsreel.<ref>Melville Wallace, ''La vie d'un pilote de chasse en 1914\u20131918'', Flammarion, Paris, 1978.

La Grande Arche in La Defense near Paris is 110 metres high. Although it is not named an Arc de Triomphe, it has been designed on the same model and in the perspective of the Arc de Triomphe.

Postcard, c.1920]]\nThe Arc is located on the right bank of the [[Seine]] at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon I|Emperor Napoleon]] at the peak of his fortunes. Laying the foundations alone took two years and, in 1810, when Napoleon entered Paris from the west with his bride Archduchess [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie-Louise]] of Austria, he had a wooden mock-up of the completed arch constructed. The architect, [[Jean Chalgrin]], died in 1811 and the work was taken over by [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]]. During the [[Bourbon Restoration]], construction was halted and it would not be completed until the reign of [[Louis Philippe I|King Louis-Philippe]], between 1833 and 1836, by the architects Goust, then Huyot, under the direction of [[Louis-\u00c9tienne H\u00e9ricart de Thury|H\u00e9ricart de Thury]]. On 15 December 1840, brought back to France from [[Saint Helena]], Napoleon's remains passed under it on their way to the Emperor's final resting place at the [[Invalides]].<ref>[http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ H\u00f4tel des Invalides website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725104448/http://www.paris.org/Musees/Invalides/ |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref> Prior to burial in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], the body of [[Victor Hugo]] was displayed under the Arc during the night of 22 May 1885.\n\nThe sword carried by the ''Republic'' in the ''Marseillaise'' relief broke off on the day, it is said, that the [[Battle of Verdun]] began in 1916. The relief was immediately hidden by [[tarpaulin]]s to conceal the accident and avoid any undesired ominous interpretations.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.placesinfrance.com/history_arc_de_triomphe.html| title =History of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris |publisher =Places in France| accessdate = 28 December 2013}}</ref>\nOn 7 August 1919, [[Charles Godefroy]] successfully flew his biplane under the Arc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histoire-image.org/site/oeuvre/analyse.php?i=260&d=441 |title=Les d\u00e9buts de l'aviation : Charles Godefroy \u2013 L'Histoire par l'image |publisher=Histoire-image.org |date= |accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> [[Jean Navarre]] was the pilot who was tasked to make the flight, but he died on 10 July 1919 when he crashed near [[Villacoublay]] while training for the flight.\n\nFollowing its construction, the ''Arc de Triomphe'' became the rallying point of French troops parading after successful military campaigns and for the annual [[Bastille Day Military Parade]]. Famous victory marches around or under the Arc have included the [[German Empire|Germans]] in 1871, the French in 1919, the [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1940, and the [[Liberation of Paris|French and Allies]] in 1944<ref>[http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&provider_id=38&ptp_photo_id=79689 Image of Liberation of Paris parade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011119/http://pictopia.com/perl/get_image?size=457x275_mb&provider_id=38&ptp_photo_id=79689 |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> and 1945. A United States [[postage stamp]] of 1945 shows the ''Arc de Triomphe'' in the background as victorious American troops march down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and U.S. airplanes fly overhead on 29 August 1944. After the interment of the Unknown Soldier, however, all military parades (including the aforementioned post-1919) have avoided marching through the actual arch. The route taken is up to the arch and then around its side, out of respect for the tomb and its symbolism. Both [[Hitler]] in 1940 and de Gaulle in 1944 observed this custom.\n\nBy the early 1960s, the monument had grown very blackened from coal soot and automobile exhaust, and during 1965\u20131966 it was cleaned through [[bleaching]].\n\nIn the prolongation of the [[Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], a new arch, the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense]], was built in 1982, completing the line of monuments that forms Paris's ''Axe historique''. After the ''Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel'' and the ''Arc de Triomphe de l'\u00c9toile'', the ''Grande Arche'' is the third arch built on the same perspective.\n\nIn 1995, the [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria]] placed a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe which wounded 17 people as part of a [[1995 Paris M\u00e9tro and RER bombings|campaign of bombings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/18/world/bomb-near-arc-de-triomphe-wounds-17.html |title=Bomb Near Arc De Triomphe wounds 17 |publisher=New York Times |date= |accessdate=8 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:ParisPlaceEtoile.jpg|right|thumb|Avenues radiate from the Arc de Triomphe in [[Place Charles de Gaulle]], the former Place de l'\u00c9toile.]]\n[[File:Champs-Elys\u00e9es, vue de la Concorde \u00e0 l'Etoile.jpg|thumb|right|The Arc de Triomphe is located on Paris's [[Axe historique]], a long perspective that runs from the [[Louvre]] to the [[Grande Arche|Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense]].]][[File:Arc de triomphe 1989.png|thumb|Arc de triomphe 1989]]\nThe [[astylar]] design is by [[Jean Chalgrin]] (1739\u20131811), in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] version of ancient [[Roman architecture]] (see, for example, the triumphal [[Arch of Titus]]). Major [[academy|academic]] sculptors of France are represented in the sculpture of the ''Arc de Triomphe'': [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]]; [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]]; [[Antoine \u00c9tex]]; [[James Pradier]] and [[Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire]]. The main sculptures are not integral [[frieze]]s but are treated as independent trophies applied to the vast [[ashlar]] masonry masses, not unlike the gilt-bronze [[appliqu\u00e9]]s on [[Empire (style)|Empire furniture]]. The four sculptural groups at the base of the Arc are ''The Triumph of 1810'' (Cortot), ''Resistance'' and ''Peace'' (both by Antoine \u00c9tex) and the most renowned of them all, ''Departure of the Volunteers of 1792'' commonly called ''[[La Marseillaise]]'' (Fran\u00e7ois Rude). The face of the allegorical representation of France calling forth her people on this last was used as the belt buckle for the honorary rank of [[Marshal of France]]. Since the fall of Napoleon (1815), the sculpture representing ''Peace'' is interpreted as commemorating the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Peace of 1815]].\n\nIn the attic above the richly sculptured frieze of soldiers are 30 shields engraved with the names of major French victories in the [[Wars of the French Revolution|French Revolution]] and [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]].<ref>The [[Battle of Fuentes de O\u00f1oro]] is inscribed as a French victory, instead of the tactical draw that it actually was.</ref> The inside walls of [[Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe|the monument list the names of 660 people]], among which are 558 French generals of the [[First French Empire]];<ref>Among the generals are at least two foreign generals, Venezuelan [[Francisco de Miranda]] and German born [[Nicolas Luckner]].</ref> The names of those generals killed in battle are underlined. Also inscribed, on the shorter sides of the four supporting columns, are the names of the major French victories in the Napoleonic Wars. The battles that took place in the period between the [[Hundred Days|departure of Napoleon from Elba to his final defeat at Waterloo]] are not included.\n\nFor four years from 1882 to 1886, a monumental sculpture by [[Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re]] topped the arch.  Titled ''Le triomphe de la R\u00e9volution'' (\"The Triumph of the Revolution\"), it depicted a chariot drawn by horses preparing \"to crush Anarchy and Despotism\". It remained there only four years before falling in ruins.\n\nInside the monument, a permanent exhibition conceived by the artist [[Maurice Benayoun]] and the architect Christophe Girault opened in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arc-de-triomphe.org/ |title=Between War and Peace |accessdate=15 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216184504/http://arc-de-triomphe.org/ |archivedate=16 December 2014}}</ref> The steel and new media installation interrogates the symbolism of the national monument, questioning the balance of its symbolic message during the last two centuries, oscillating between war and peace.\n\n==Tomb of the Unknown Soldier==\n[[File:Soldat inconnu 14 07 2006.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] beneath the Arc de Triomphe, [[Paris]]]]\n\nBeneath the Arc is the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] from [[World War I]].

It burns in memory of the dead who were never identified (now in both world wars).\n\nA ceremony is held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier every 11 November on the anniversary of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice]] signed by the Entente Powers and Germany in 1918. It was originally decided on 12 November 1919 to bury the unknown soldier's remains in the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris|Panth\u00e9on]], but a public letter-writing campaign led to the decision to bury him beneath the Arc de Triomphe. The coffin was put in the chapel on the first floor of the Arc on 10 November 1920, and put in its final resting place on 28 January 1921. The slab on top bears the inscription <small>ICI REPOSE UN SOLDAT FRAN\u00c7AIS MORT POUR LA PATRIE 1914\u20131918</small> (\"Here lies a French soldier who died for the fatherland 1914\u20131918\").\n\nIn 1961, American President [[John F. Kennedy]] and First Lady [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]] paid their respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, accompanied by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. After the 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Mrs Kennedy remembered the eternal flame at the Arc de Triomphe and requested that an eternal flame be placed next to her husband's grave at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in Virginia. President Charles de Gaulle went to Washington to attend the state funeral, and witnessed Jacqueline Kennedy lighting the eternal flame that had been inspired by her visit to France.\n\n==Details==\n* The four main sculptural groups on each of the Arc's pillars are:\n** ''Le D\u00e9part de 1792'' (or ''[[La Marseillaise]]''), by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rude]]. The sculptural group celebrates the cause of the [[French First Republic]] during the [[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August uprising]]. Above the volunteers is the winged personification of Liberty. This group served as a recruitment tool in the early months of [[World War I]] and encouraged the French to invest in war loans in 1915\u201316.<ref>{{cite book | last = Forrest | first =| title = The Legacy of the French Revolutionary Wars| publisher =Cambridge University Press| page = 38 | isbn =1139489240}}</ref>\n** ''Le Triomphe de 1810'', by [[Jean-Pierre Cortot]] celebrates the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]].

Another 46 steps remain to climb in order to reach the top, the ''terrasse'', from where one can enjoy a panoramic view of Paris.{{citation needed|date = July 2015}}\n\n[[File:ArcTriompheParis.jpg|thumb|center|797px|Paris seen from the top of the Arc de triomphe]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Paris}}\n* [[Bastille Day military parade]]\n* [[Galerie des Batailles]]\n* [[List of works by James Pradier]]\n* [[Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q64436|c=Category:Arc de Triomphe de l'\u00c9toile|s=no|wikt=no|b=no|v=no|q=no|n=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no|voy=Paris/8th_arrondissement}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050306125604/http://www.parisrama.com/thematiques/thematique_arcdetriomphe.htm Inscriptions on the Arc de Triomphe]\n* [http://perso.wanadoo.fr/arnauld.divry/arc_de_triomphe.htm The names of 660 persons inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe]\n* [http://arcdetriompheparis.com/history Clarification of history of Arc de Triomphe]\n* [http://www.arc-de-triomphe.org/ The permanent exhibition inside the Arc de Triomphe]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_wyyfmCZuo View from the Arc de Triomphe]\n{{8th arrondissement of Paris}}\n{{Visitor attractions in Paris}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arc De Triomphe}}\n[[Category:Arc de Triomphe| ]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1836]]\n[[Category:Monuments and memorials in Paris]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Paris]]\n[[Category:Triumphal arches in France]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the 8th arrondissement of Paris]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the 16th arrondissement of Paris]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the 17th arrondissement of Paris]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in France]]\n[[Category:Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]]\n[[Category:Terminating vistas in Paris]]\n<!-- [[Category:Tombs in France]] and [[Category:Tombs of Unknown Soldiers]] not needed, due to new redirect ([[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (France)]] -->", "sha1": "ospekmgmxfok9lfdt5ifsk7nhb1q8j5"}}, {"title": "April 21", "ns": "0", "id": "2483", "revision": {"id": "865073461", "parentid": "864643392", "timestamp": "2018-10-21T15:15:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "Toddst1", "id": "4288359"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/Bumblebesam|Bumblebesam]] ([[User talk:Bumblebesam|talk]]) to last version by 2A02:587:2910:2B00:5C40:ED3C:CD89:43F4", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{calendar}}\n{{This date in recent years}}\n{{Day}}\n\n==Events==\n* [[753 BC]] &ndash; [[Romulus]] founds Rome ([[founding of Rome|traditional date]]).\n* [[43 BC]] &ndash; [[Battle of Mutina]]: [[Mark Antony]] is again defeated in battle by [[Aulus Hirtius]], who is killed.

See also p. 98,</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rudolf Steiner]]]]\n\nThe early work of the founder of anthroposophy, [[Rudolf Steiner]], culminated in his ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (also translated as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'' and ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''). Here, Steiner developed a concept of [[free will]] based on inner experiences, especially those that occur in the creative activity of independent thought.<ref name=\"Essential\"/>\n\nBy the beginning of the twentieth century, Steiner's interests turned to explicitly spiritual areas of research. His work began to interest others interested in spiritual ideas; among these was the [[Theosophical Society]]. From 1900 on, thanks to the positive reception given to his ideas, Steiner focused increasingly on [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|his work with the Theosophical Society]], becoming the [[General Secretary|secretary]] of its section in Germany in 1902. During the years of his leadership, membership increased dramatically, from a few individuals to sixty-nine Lodges.<ref name=\"ahern2edAnthSec\">Of these, 55 Lodges \u2013 about 2,500 people \u2013 were to secede with Steiner to form his new Anthroposophical Society, at the end of 1912. Geoffrey Ahern, ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com/  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, {{ISBN|978-0-227-17293-3}}, p. 43</ref>\n\nBy 1907, a split between Steiner and the mainstream Theosophical Society had begun to become apparent. While the Society was oriented toward an [[Orient|Eastern]] and especially [[India]]n approach, Steiner was trying to develop a path that embraced [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]].<ref name=\"Lachman\">Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', New York:Tarcher/Penguin {{ISBN|978-1-58542-543-3}}</ref> The split became irrevocable when [[Annie Besant]], then president of the Theosophical Society, began to present the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] Christ. Steiner strongly objected and considered any comparison between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense; many years later, Krishnamurti also repudiated the assertion. Steiner's continuing differences with Besant led him to separate from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]; he was followed by the great majority of the membership of the Theosophical Society's German Section, as well as members of other national sections.<ref name=\"ahern2edAnthSec\"/><ref name=\"Lachman\"/>\n\nBy this time, Steiner had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher.<ref>Ahern, Geoffrey. (1984): Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the Western esoteric tradition</ref> He spoke about what he considered to be his direct experience of the [[Akashic Records]] (sometimes called the \"Akasha Chronicle\"), thought to be a spiritual chronicle of the history, pre-history, and future of the world and mankind.  In a number of works,<ref>especially ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' and ''An Outline of Esoteric Science''</ref> Steiner described a path of inner development he felt would let anyone attain comparable spiritual experiences. Sound vision could be developed, in part, by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration, and meditation; in particular, a person's moral development must precede the development of spiritual faculties.<ref name=\"Essential\"/>\n\n[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Second [[Goetheanum]], seat of the Anthroposophical Society]]\nIn 1912, the Anthroposophical Society was founded. After [[World War I]], the Anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Projects such as [[Waldorf education|schools]], [[Camphill Movement|centers for those with special needs]], organic farms and [[anthroposophical medicine|medical clinics]] were established, all inspired by anthroposophy.\n\nIn 1923, faced with differences between older members focusing on inner development and younger members eager to become active in the social transformations of the time, Steiner refounded the Society in an inclusive manner and established a School for Spiritual Science. As a spiritual basis for the refounded movement, Steiner wrote a \"[[wikisource:Foundation Stone Meditation|Foundation Stone Meditation]]\" which remains a central meditative expression of anthroposophical ideas.\n\nSteiner died just over a year later, in 1925. The Second World War temporarily hindered the anthroposophical movement in most of Continental Europe, as the Anthroposophical Society and most of its daughter movements (e.g. Steiner/Waldorf education) were banned by the [[National Socialist]]s (Nazis);<ref>Inge Hansen-Schaberg and Bruno Schonig (eds.), ''Waldorf-P\u00e4dogogik'', {{ISBN|3-8340-0042-6}}</ref> virtually no anthroposophists ever joined the National Socialist Party.<ref name=Zander>Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', {{ISBN|978-3-525-55452-4}}</ref>{{rp|250}}\n\nBy 2007, national branches of the Anthroposophical Society had been established in fifty countries, and about 10,000 institutions around the world were working on the basis of anthroposophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&L=1 |title=Goetheanum |publisher=Goetheanum |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> In the same year, the Anthroposophical Society was called the \"most important [[esoteric]] society in European history.\"<ref name=Grote>Tom Grote, [http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/kulturinterview/655387/ \"Kosmische Wirkkr\u00e4fte\"], German Radio interview 8 August 2007</ref>\n\n===Etymology and earlier uses of the word===\n''Anthroposophy'' is an amalgam of the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|\u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2]]}} (''anthropos'' = \"human\") and {{lang|grc|[[Sophia (wisdom)|\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1]]}} (''sophia'' = \"wisdom\").

The work describes anthroposophy (as well as theosophy) variously as an understanding of goodness, nature, or human affairs. In 1648, the Welsh philosopher [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] published his ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' <ref>Thomas Vaughan (Eugenius Philalethes): ''Anthroposophia Theomagica, or a discourse of the nature of man and his state after death.'' Oxford 1648</ref>\n\nThe term began to appear with some frequency in philosophical works of the mid- and late-nineteenth century.<ref>The term was used for example in a [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&seq=1&size=1&id=nq.1863.5.9.3.71.x.373 discussion of Boehme] in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', May 9, 1863, p. 373</ref> In the early part of that century, [[Ignaz Paul Vitalis Troxler|Ignaz Troxler]] used the term \"anthroposophy\" to refer to philosophy deepened to self-knowledge, which he suggested allows deeper knowledge of nature as well. He spoke of human nature as a mystical unity of God and world. [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to \"rigorous human self-knowledge,\" achievable through thorough comprehension of the human spirit and of the working of God in this spirit, in his 1856 work ''Anthropology: The Study of the Human Soul''. In 1872, the philosopher of religion [[Gideon Spicker]] used the term ''anthroposophy'' to refer to self-knowledge that would unite God and world: \"the true study of the human being is the human being, and philosophy's highest aim is self-knowledge, or Anthroposophy.\" <ref>''Die Philosophie des Grafen von Shaftesbury'', 1872</ref>\n\nIn 1882, the philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]] published the treatise, \"An Outline of Anthroposophy: Proposal for a System of Idealism on a Realistic Basis,\" proposing that idealistic philosophy should employ logical thinking to extend empirical experience.<ref>''Anthroposophie im Umri\u00df.

This requires developing new faculties of objective spiritual perception, which Steiner maintained was possible for humanity today. The steps of this process of inner development he identified as consciously achieved ''[[imagination]]'', ''[[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]]'' and ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider\">Peter Schneider, Einf\u00fchrung in die Waldorfp\u00e4dogogik, {{ISBN|3-608-93006-X}}</ref> Steiner believed results of this form of spiritual research should be expressed in a way that can be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of natural science:<ref name=\"Willmann\"/> \"The anthroposophical schooling of thinking leads to the development of a non-sensory, or so-called supersensory consciousness, whereby the spiritual researcher brings the experiences of this realm into ideas, concepts, and expressive language in a form which people can understand who do not yet have the capacity to achieve the supersensory experiences necessary for individual research.\"<ref name=\"Schneider20\"/>\n\nSteiner hoped to form a spiritual movement that would free the individual from any external authority: \"The most important problem of all human thinking is this: to comprehend the human being as a personality grounded in him or herself.\"<ref name=\"Schneider20\">Peter Schneider, ''Einf\u00fchrung in die Waldorfp\u00e4dogogik'', pp. 20-1; Schneider quotes here from Steiner's dissertation, ''Truth and Knowledge''</ref> For Steiner, the human capacity for [[rationality|rational]] thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority.<ref name=\"Schneider20\"/>\n\nSteiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional [[mysticism]], which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and [[natural science]], which he considered arbitrarily limited to investigating the outer world.\n\n===Nature of the human being===\n[[File:Representative of humanity.gif|thumb|upright|''The Representative of Humanity'', detail of a sculpture in wood by Rudolf Steiner and [[Edith Maryon]].<ref>Paull, John (2018) [http://www.academia.edu/37021855/A_Portrait_of_Edith_Maryon_Artist_and_Anthroposophist A Portrait of Edith Maryon: Artist and Anthroposophist], Journal of Fine Arts, 1(2):8-15.</ref>]]\n\nIn ''Theosophy'', Steiner suggested that human beings unite a physical body of substances gathered from (and that ultimately return to) the inorganic world; a life body (also called the [[etheric body]]), in common with all living creatures (including plants); a bearer of [[sentience]] or [[consciousness]] (also called the [[astral body]]), in common with all [[animal]]s; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.\n\nAnthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human consciousness. Early stages of human evolution possess an intuitive perception of reality, including a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] perception of spiritual realities. Humanity has progressively evolved an increasing reliance on [[intellect]]ual faculties and a corresponding loss of intuitive or clairvoyant experiences, which have become atavistic. The increasing intellectualization of consciousness, initially a progressive direction of evolution, has led to an excessive reliance on [[abstraction]] and a loss of contact with both natural and spiritual realities. However, to go further requires new capacities that combine the clarity of intellectual thought with the imagination, and beyond this with consciously achieved inspiration and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] insights.<ref name=RAMcD>Robert A. McDermott, \"Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy\", in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', {{ISBN|0-8245-1444-0}}, p. 299&ndash;301; 288ff</ref>\n\nAnthroposophy speaks of the reincarnation of the human spirit: that the human being passes between stages of existence, incarnating into an earthly body, living on earth, leaving the body behind and entering into the spiritual worlds before returning to be born again into a new life on earth. After the [[death]] of the physical body, the human spirit recapitulates the past life, perceiving its events as they were experienced by the objects of its actions. A complex transformation takes place between the review of the past life and the preparation for the next life. The individual's [[karmic]] condition eventually leads to a choice of parents, physical body, disposition, and capacities that provide the challenges and opportunities that further development requires, which includes karmically chosen tasks for the future life.<ref name=RAMcD/>\n\nSteiner described some conditions that determine the interdependence of a person's lives, or [[karma]].<ref>Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy, {{ISBN|0-85440-269-1}}</ref><ref>Rudolf Steiner, An Outline of Esoteric Science, {{ISBN|0-88010-409-0}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution====\nThe anthroposophical view of [[evolution]] considers all [[animals]] to have evolved from an early, unspecialized form. As the least specialized animal, human beings have maintained the closest connection to the archetypal form;<ref>{{cite book|last=Verhulst|first=Jos|title=Developmental Dynamics|year=2003|publisher=Adonis Press|location=Ghent, NY|isbn=978-0-932776-28-0|pages=24\u201325}}</ref> contrary to the Darwinian conception of human evolution, all other animals ''devolve'' from this archetype.<ref>George Trevelyan ''Operation Redemption'' 1981, pp. 117-118</ref> The spiritual archetype originally created by spiritual beings was devoid of physical substance; only later did this descend into material existence on Earth.<ref>Steiner, ''Man as Symphony of the Creative Word'' and ''Occult Science''</ref> In this view, human evolution has accompanied the Earth's evolution throughout the existence of the Earth.\n\n{{quote|The evolution of man, Steiner said, has consisted in the gradual incarnation of a spiritual being into a material body. It has been a true \"descent\" of man from a spiritual world into a world of matter. The evolution of the animal kingdom did not precede, but rather ''accompanied'' the process of human incarnation. Man is thus not the end result of the evolution of the animals, but is rather in a certain sense their ''cause''. In the succession of types which appears in the fossil record-the fishes, reptiles, mammals, and finally fossil remains of man himself \u2014 the stages of this process of incarnation are reflected.<ref>John Waterman ''Evolution and The Image of Man'' in A. C. Harwood ''The faithful thinker: Centenary essays on the work and thought of Rudolf Steiner'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1961, p. 45</ref>}}\n\nAnthroposophy adapted [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]'s complex system of cycles of world development and human evolution. The evolution of the world is said to have occurred in cycles. The first phase of the world consisted only of heat. In the second phase, a more active condition, light, and a more condensed, gaseous state separate out from the heat. In the third phase, a fluid state arose, as well as a sounding, forming energy. In the fourth (current) phase, solid physical matter first exists. This process is said to have been accompanied by an evolution of consciousness which led up to present human culture.\n\n===Ethics===\nThe anthroposophical view is that good is found in the balance between two polar influences on world and human evolution. These are often described through their mythological embodiments as spiritual adversaries which endeavour to tempt and corrupt humanity, [[Lucifer]] and his counterpart [[Ahriman]]. These have both positive and negative aspects. Lucifer is the light spirit, which \"plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity\", but also motivates [[creativity]] and [[spirituality]]; Ahriman is the dark spirit that tempts human beings to \"...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [[materialism|entirely on the material plane]]\", but that also stimulates intellectuality and [[technology]]. Both figures exert a negative effect on humanity when their influence becomes misplaced or one-sided, yet their influences are necessary for human freedom to unfold.<ref name=\"Essential\"/><ref name=\"Willmann\"/>\n\nEach human being has the task to find a balance between these opposing influences, and each is helped in this task by the mediation of the ''Representative of Humanity'', also known as the Christ being, a spiritual entity who stands between and harmonizes the two extremes.<ref name=\"Willmann\"/>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Flowform Vortex Garten Darmstadt.jpg|thumb|Flowforms in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]]]]\n{{further|Rudolf Steiner#Breadth of activity}}\nThe applications of anthroposophy to practical fields include:\n\n===Steiner/Waldorf education===\n{{Main|Waldorf education}}\nThis is a pedagogical movement with over 1000 [[Waldorf education|Steiner or Waldorf schools]] (the latter name stems from the first such school, founded in Stuttgart in 1919)<ref>Paull, John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9168722/Rudolf_Steiner_and_the_Oxford_Conference_The_birth_of_Waldorf_education_in_Britain Rudolf Steiner and the Oxford Conference: The Birth of Waldorf Education in Britain].

Steiner was a sharp critic of [[nationalism]], which he saw as outdated, and a proponent of achieving social solidarity through individual freedom.<ref name=\"Essential\"/> A petition proposing a radical change in the German constitution and expressing his basic social ideas (signed by [[Herman Hesse]], among others) was widely circulated. His main book on social reform is ''Toward Social Renewal''.<ref name=\"Essential\"/>\n\nAnthroposophy continues to aim at reforming society through maintaining and strengthening the independence of the spheres of [[culture|cultural life]], [[human rights]] and the [[economy]]. It emphasizes a particular ideal in each of these three realms of society:<ref name=\"Essential\"/>\n# Freedom in cultural life\n# [[Equality before the law|Equality]] of [[rights]], the sphere of [[legislation]]\n# [[:wikt:fraternity|Fraternity]] in the [[economy|economic sphere]]\n\n==Esoteric path==\n\n===Paths of spiritual development===\nAccording to Steiner, a real [[supernatural|spiritual]] world exists, evolving along with the material one. Steiner held that the spiritual world can be researched in the right circumstances through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[self-discipline]]. Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book ''How To Know Higher Worlds''. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>\n\n{{quote|Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe\u2026. Anthroposophists are those who experience, as an essential need of life, certain questions on the nature of the human being and the universe, just as one experiences hunger and thirst.<ref>Steiner, ''Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts'' (1924)</ref>}}\n\nSteiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience. He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development. He consistently emphasised that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/> Steiner distinguished between what he considered were true and false paths of spiritual investigation.<ref>''True and False Paths in Spiritual Investigation'', first English edition 1927 (online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA243/English/RSP1969/TruFal_index.html]), 2010 edition Kessinger Publishing Company {{ISBN|9781162592510}}</ref>\n\nIn anthroposophy, artistic expression is also treated as a potentially valuable bridge between spiritual and material reality.<ref name=Lindenberg/>{{rp|97}}\n\n===Prerequisites to and stages of inner development===\n{{quote|A person seeking inner development must first of all make the attempt to give up certain formerly held inclinations. Then, new inclinations must be acquired by constantly holding the thought of such inclinations, virtues or characteristics in one's mind. They must be so incorporated into one's being that a person becomes enabled to alter his soul by his own will-power. This must be tried as objectively as a chemical might be tested in an experiment. A person who has never endeavored to change his soul, who has never made the initial decision to develop the qualities of endurance, steadfastness and calm logical thinking, or a person who has such decisions but has given up because he did not succeed in a week, a month, a year or a decade, will never conclude anything inwardly about these truths.|Rudolf Steiner|\"On the Inner Life\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/InnDev_index.html |title=The Inner Development of Man |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Rsarchive.org |date=1904-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>}}\n\nSteiner's stated prerequisites to beginning on a spiritual path include a willingness to take up serious cognitive studies, a respect for factual evidence, and a responsible attitude. Central to progress on the path itself is a harmonious cultivation of the following qualities:<ref name=\"Willmann_path\">[[Carlo Willmann]], ''Waldorfp\u00e4dagogik'', {{ISBN|3-412-16700-2}}, pp. 10&ndash;13</ref>\n* Control over one's own thinking\n* Control over one's will\n* Composure\n* Positivity\n* Impartiality\n\nSteiner sees meditation as a concentration and enhancement of the power of thought. By focusing consciously on an idea, feeling or intention the meditant seeks to arrive at pure thinking, a state exemplified by but not confined to pure mathematics. In Steiner's view, conventional sensory-material knowledge is achieved through relating perception and concepts. The anthroposophic path of esoteric training articulates three further stages of supersensory knowledge, which do not necessarily follow strictly sequentially in any single individual's spiritual progress.<ref name=\"Willmann_path\"/><ref name=Stein>Stein, W. J., ''Die moderne naturwissenschaftliche Vorstellungsart und die Weltanschauung Goethes, wie sie Rudolf Steiner vertritt'', reprinted in Meyer, Thomas, ''W.J. Stein / Rudolf Steiner'', pp. 267&ndash;75; 256&ndash;7.</ref>\n* By focusing on symbolic patterns, images, and poetic mantras, the meditant can achieve consciously directed Imaginations that allow sensory phenomena to appear as the expression of underlying beings of a soul-spiritual nature.\n* By transcending such imaginative pictures, the meditant can become conscious of the meditative activity itself, which leads to experiences of expressions of soul-spiritual beings unmediated by sensory phenomena or qualities.  Steiner calls this stage Inspiration.\n* By intensifying the will-forces through exercises such as a chronologically reversed review of the day's events, the meditant can achieve a further stage of inner independence from sensory experience, leading to direct contact, and even union, with spiritual beings (\"Intuition\") without loss of individual awareness.<ref name=\"Willmann_path\"/>\n\n===Spiritual exercises===\n{{Main|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}\n\nSteiner described numerous exercises he believed would bring spiritual development; other anthroposophists have added many others. A central principle is that \"for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development.\" According to Steiner, moral development reveals the extent to which one has achieved control over one's inner life and can exercise it in harmony with the spiritual life of other people; it shows the real progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception. It also guarantees the capacity to distinguish between false perceptions or illusions (which are possible in perceptions of both the outer world and the inner world) and true perceptions: i.e., the capacity to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements (i.e., viewpoint) and objective reality.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>\n\n==Place in Western philosophy==\nSteiner built upon [[Goethe]]'s conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature). Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes. \"The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception.\"<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>\n\nThus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it. In this connection, Steiner examines the step from thinking determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. He characterizes thoughts he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds. Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.<ref name=\"Schneider\"/>\n\nSome of the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom]].<ref>Ellen Pifer, \"Saul Bellow Against the Grain\", University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990; see also Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''</ref> In his early works, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of the human being as a natural-supernatural entity, that is: natural in that humanity is a product of nature, supernatural in that through our conceptual powers we extend nature's realm, allowing it to achieve a reflective capacity in us as philosophy, art and science.<ref name=\"Tarnas\">Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', {{ISBN|0-7126-7332-6}}</ref> Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in [[Western thought]].<ref name=\"Tarnas\"/> Though not well known among philosophers, his philosophical work was taken up by [[Owen Barfield]] (and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], an [[Oxford]] group of Christian writers that included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]]).<ref>Doris T. Myers, \"C.S.

Thus it becomes clear to us through spiritual science that the being whom we call Christ is to be recognized as the center of life on earth, that the Christian religion is the ultimate religion for the earth's whole future. Spiritual science shows us particularly that the pre-Christian religions outgrow their one-sidedness and come together in the Christian faith. It is not the desire of spiritual science to set something else in the place of Christianity; rather it wants to contribute to a deeper, more heartfelt understanding of Christianity.<ref>Rudolf Steiner,[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html \"Anthroposophy and Christianity\"]</ref>}}\n\nThus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith. This being is, according to Steiner, not only the Redeemer of [[the Fall of Man|the Fall from Paradise]], but also the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and of human history.<ref name=\"Willmann\"/> To describe this being, Steiner periodically used terms such as the \"Representative of Humanity\" or the \"good spirit\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The foundations of human experience|year=1996|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|isbn=0-88010-392-2|page=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=A Chapter of Occult History|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19081216p01.html|date=December 16, 1908}}</ref> rather than any denominational term.\n\n===Divergence from conventional Christian thought===\nSteiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostism|gnostic]] elements:\n\n* One central point of divergence is Steiner's views on [[reincarnation]] and karma.\n* Steiner differentiated three contemporary paths by which he believed it possible to arrive at [[Christ]]:\n** Through heart-filled experiences of the [[Gospels]]; Steiner described this as the historically dominant path, but becoming less important in the future.\n** Through inner experiences of a spiritual reality; this Steiner regarded as increasingly the path of spiritual or religious seekers today.\n** Through [[initiation|initiatory experiences]] whereby the reality of Christ's death and resurrection are experienced; Steiner believed this is the path people will increasingly take.<ref name=\"Willmann\"/>\n* Steiner also believed that there were two different [[Jesus]] children involved in the [[Incarnation]] of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref name=\"Essential\"/> (The genealogies given in the two gospels diverge some thirty generations before Jesus' birth, and 'Jesus' was a common name in biblical times.)\n* His view of [[the second coming]] of Christ is also unusual; he suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life for increasing numbers of people beginning around the year 1933.<ref>Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ReapChrist/19100125p01.html \"The Appearance of Christ in the Etheric World\"]</ref>\n* He emphasized his belief that in the future humanity would need to be able to recognize the ''Spirit of Love'' in all its genuine forms, regardless of what name would be used to describe this being. He also warned that the traditional name of the ''Christ'' might be misused, and the true essence of this being of love ignored.\n\n===Judaism===\nRudolf Steiner wrote and lectured on Judaism and Jewish issues over much of his adult life. He was a fierce opponent of popular antisemitism, but asserted that there was no justification for the existence of Judaism and Jewish culture in the modern world, a radical assimilationist perspective which saw the Jews completely integrating into the larger society.<ref>Jan-Erik Ebbestad Hansen, [https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8831 The Jews - Teachers of the Nazis?] In: NORDEUROPAforum.

Only the Eurasian subspecies survived until recent times.\n* The Eurasian aurochs (''B. p. primigenius'') once ranged across the [[steppe]]s and [[taiga]]s of Europe, [[Siberia]] and Central Asia, and East Asia. It is noted as part of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and declined in numbers along with other megafauna species by the end of Pleistocene. The Eurasian aurochs were domesticated into modern taurine cattle breeds around the sixth millennium BC in the Middle East, and possibly also at about the same time in the Far East. Aurochs were still widespread in Europe during the time of the [[Roman Empire]], when they were widely popular as a battle beast in [[Amphitheatre#Roman amphitheatres|Roman arenas]]. Excessive hunting began and continued until the species was nearly extinct. By the 13th century, aurochs existed only in small numbers in [[Eastern Europe]], and the hunting of aurochs became a privilege of nobles, and later royal households. The aurochs were not saved from extinction, and the last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktor\u00f3w Forest, Poland, from natural causes. Aurochs were found to have lived on the island of [[Sicily]], having migrated via a [[land bridge]] from Italy.

The work by [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] is a copy of a painting owned by a merchant in [[Augsburg]], which may date to the 16th century.

The size of an aurochs appears to have varied by region; in Europe, northern populations were bigger on average than those from the south. For example, during the [[Holocene]], aurochs from Denmark and Germany had an average height at the shoulders of {{convert|155|\u2013|180|cm|in|abbr=on}} in bulls and {{Convert|135|-|155|cm|in|abbr=on}} in cows, while aurochs populations in Hungary had bulls reaching {{convert|155|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=kysel /> The body mass of aurochs appears to have shown some variability. Some individuals were comparable in weight to the wisent and the banteng, reaching around {{convert|700|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, whereas those from the late-middle Pleistocene are estimated to have weighed up to {{convert|1500|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, as much as the largest [[gaur]] (the largest extant bovid).<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> The [[sexual dimorphism]] between bulls and cows was strongly expressed, with the cows being significantly shorter than bulls on average.\n\n[[File:Aurochsfeatures.jpg|thumb|Restoration of the aurochs based on a bull skeleton from Lund and a cow skeleton from Cambridge, with chart of characteristic external features of the aurochs]]\n\n=== Horns ===\nBecause of the massive horns, the [[frontal bones]] of aurochs were elongated and broad. The horns of the aurochs were characteristic in size, curvature, and orientation. They were curved in three directions: upwards and outwards at the base, then swinging forwards and inwards, then inwards and upwards. Aurochs horns could reach {{Convert|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and between {{Convert|10|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Frisch\" /> The horns of bulls were larger, with the curvature more strongly expressed than in cows. The horns grew from the skull at a 60\u00b0 angle to the muzzle, facing forwards.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n\n=== Body shape ===\nThe proportions and body shape of the aurochs were strikingly different from many modern cattle breeds.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> For example, the legs were considerably longer and more slender, resulting in a shoulder height that nearly equalled the trunk length. The skull, carrying the large horns, was substantially larger and more elongated than in most cattle breeds. As in other wild bovines, the body shape of the aurochs was athletic, and especially in bulls, showed a strongly expressed neck and shoulder musculature. Therefore, the fore hand was larger than the rear, similar to the wisent, but unlike many domesticated cattle.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Even in carrying cows, the udder was small and hardly visible from the side; this feature is equal to that of other wild bovines.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n[[File:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|Aurochs in a [[cave painting]] in [[Lascaux]], [[France]]]]\n\n=== Coat colour{{anchor|Coat colour}} ===\nThe coat colour of the aurochs can be reconstructed by using historical and contemporary depictions. In his letter to [[Conrad Gesner]] (1602), [[Anton Schneeberger]] describes the aurochs, a description that agrees with cave paintings in [[Lascaux]] and [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]]. Calves were born a chestnut colour. Young bulls changed their coat colour at a few months old to a very deep brown or black, with a white [[eel stripe]] running down the spine. Cows retained the reddish-brown colour. Both sexes had a light-coloured muzzle.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Some North African engravings show aurochs with a light-coloured \"saddle\" on the back,<ref name=\"Frisch\" /> but otherwise  no evidence of variation in coat colour is seen throughout its range. A passage from Mucante (1596), describing the \u201cwild ox\u201d as gray, but is ambiguous and may refer to the wisent. Egyptian grave paintings show cattle with a reddish-brown coat colour in both sexes, with a light saddle, but the horn shape of these suggest that they may depict domesticated cattle.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Remains of aurochs hair were not known until the early 1980s.<ref name=doi />\n\n=== Colour of forelocks ===\nSome primitive cattle breeds display similar coat colours to the aurochs, including the black colour in bulls with a light eel stripe, a pale mouth, and similar sexual dimorphism in colour. A feature often attributed to the aurochs is blond forehead hairs. Historical descriptions tell that the aurochs had long and curly forehead hair, but none mentions a certain colour for it. Cis van Vuure (2005) says that, although the colour is present in a variety of primitive cattle breeds, it is probably a discolouration that appeared after domestication. The gene responsible for this feature has not yet been identified.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Zebu breeds show lightly coloured inner sides of the legs and belly, caused by the so-called zebu-tipping gene. It has not been tested if this gene is present in remains of the wild form of the zebu, the Indian aurochs.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\n[[File:Long horned european wild ox.jpg|thumb|A painting by [[Heinrich Harder]] showing an aurochs fighting off a [[wolf]] pack]]\nLike many bovids, aurochs formed herds for at least a part of the year. These probably did not number much more than 30. If aurochs had social behaviour similar to their descendants, social status was gained through displays and fights, in which cows engaged as well as bulls.<ref name=\"Frisch\" /> Indeed, aurochs bulls were reported to often have had severe fights.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> As in other wild cattle, [[ungulate]]s that form unisexual herds, considerable [[sexual dimorphism]] was expressed. Ungulates that form herds containing animals of both sexes, such as [[horse]]s, have more weakly developed sexual dimorphism.<ref name=mess2 />\n\nDuring the mating season, which probably took place during the late summer or early autumn,<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> the bulls had severe fights, and evidence from the forest of Jaktor\u00f3w shows these could lead to death. In autumn, aurochs fed up for the winter and got fatter and shinier than during the rest of the year, according to Schneeberger.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Calves were born in spring. According to Schneeberger, the calf stayed at the cow's side until it was strong enough to join and keep up with the herd on the feeding grounds.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n\nCalves were vulnerable to [[gray wolf|wolves]] and, to an extent, [[bear]]s, while healthy adult aurochs probably did not have to fear these predators.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> In prehistoric Europe, North Africa, and Asia, [[big cat]]s, such as lions and tigers, and hyenas were additional predators that probably preyed on aurochs.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n\nHistorical descriptions, like Caesar\u2019s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' or Schneeberger, tell that aurochs were swift and fast, and could be very aggressive. According to Schneeberger, aurochs were not concerned when a man approached, but when teased or hunted, an aurochs could get very aggressive and dangerous, and throw the teasing person into the air, as he described in a 1602 letter to Gesner.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n[[File:Elsbruch Saarmund.JPG|thumb|Floodplain forests like this one in Germany were the aurochs' last refuge during its final centuries of existence.]]\nNo consensus exists concerning the habitat of the aurochs. While some authors think that the habitat selection of the aurochs was comparable to the [[African forest buffalo]], others describe the species as inhabiting open grassland and helping maintain open areas by grazing, together with other large herbivores.<ref name=beutl /><ref name=druke /> With its [[hypsodont]] jaw, the aurochs was probably a grazer and had a food selection very similar to domesticated cattle.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> It was not a browser like many [[deer]] species, nor a semi-intermediary feeder like the wisent.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" /> Comparisons of the isotope levels of Mesolithic aurochs and domestic cattle bones showed that aurochs probably inhabited wetter areas than domestic cattle.<ref name=lynch /> Schneeberger describes that during winter, the aurochs ate twigs and acorns in addition to grasses.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Common Era, the habitat of aurochs became more fragmented because of the steadily growing human population. During the last centuries of its existence, the aurochs was limited to remote regions, such as floodplain forests or marshes, with no competing domestic herbivores and less hunting pressure.\n\n== Relationship with humans ==\n\n=== Domestication ===\n[[File:Bos primigenius Vig uroksen.jpg|thumb|left|The Vig-aurochs, one of two very well-preserved aurochs skeletons found in Denmark. The circles indicate where the animal was wounded by arrows.]]\nThe aurochs, which ranged throughout much of [[Eurasia]] and [[Northern Africa]] during the [[late Pleistocene]] and early [[Holocene]], is the wild ancestor of modern cattle. Archaeological evidence shows that domestication occurred independently in the [[Near East]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, giving rise to the two major domestic taxa observed today: humpless ''[[Bos taurus]]'' (taurine) and humped ''[[Bos indicus]]'' (zebu), respectively. This is confirmed by genetic analyses of matrilineal [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences, which reveal a marked differentiation between modern ''B. taurus'' and ''B. indicus'' [[haplotype]]s, demonstrating their derivation from two geographically and genetically divergent wild populations.<ref name=\"Edwards 2010\" /> A third domestication event possibly occurred from another form of the aurochs in Africa. The [[sanga cattle]], a zebu-like cattle with no back hump, is commonly believed to originate from crosses between humped zebus with taurine cattle breeds. However, some archaeological evidence indicates these cattle were domesticated independently in Africa and that bloodlines of taurine and zebu cattle were introduced only within the last few hundreds years.<ref name=grigson />\n\nDomestication of the aurochs began in the southern [[Caucasus]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]] from about the sixth millennium BC.

The last recorded live aurochs, a female, died in 1627 in the Jaktor\u00f3w Forest, Poland, from natural causes.

This bone, which is also present in domesticated cattle, contributed to the mystique of the animal and magical powers have been attributed to it.<ref name=\"vVuure05\" />\n[[File:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms of Moldavia]] from 1481]]\n[[File:Enichires.jpg|thumb|left|A 16th-century illustration by [[Teodoro Ghisi]], believed to show an aurochs, although the horns and muzzle differ from those of an aurochs.]]\nIn eastern Europe, where it survived until nearly 400 years ago, the aurochs has left traces in fixed expressions. In [[Russia]], a drunken person behaving badly was described as \"behaving like an aurochs\", whereas in Poland, big, strong people were characterized as being \"a bloke like an aurochs\".<ref name=vuure />\n\nIn Central Europe, the aurochs features in toponyms and heraldic coats of arms. For example, the names [[Ursenbach]] and [[Aurach am Hongar]] are derived from the aurochs. An aurochs head, the traditional arms of the German region [[Mecklenburg]], figures in the [[coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. The aurochs ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''bour'', from Latin ''b\u016bbalus'') was also the symbol of [[Moldavia]]; nowadays, they can be found in the coat of arms of both [[Coat of arms of Romania|Romania]] and [[Coat of arms of Moldova|Moldova]]. An aurochs head is featured on an 1858 series of Moldavian stamps, the so-called [[Moldavian Bull's Heads|Bull's Heads]] (''cap de bour'' in Romanian), renowned for their rarity and price among collectors. In Romania there are still villages named [[Boureni (disambiguation)|Boureni]], after the Romanian word for the auroch. The horn of the aurochs is a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] of the coat of arms of [[Taurag\u0117]], Lithuania, (the name of Taurag\u0117 is a compound of ''ta\u0169ras'' \"auroch\" and ''ragas'' \"horn\"). It is also present in the emblem of [[Kaunas]], Lithuania, and was part of the emblem of [[Bukovina]] during its time as an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] ''[[Cisleithania|Kronland]]''. The Swiss [[Canton of Uri]] is named after the aurochs; its yellow flag shows a black aurochs head. East Slavic surnames Turenin, Turishchev, Turov, and [[Cyril of Turaw|Turovsky]] originate from the Slavic name of the species ''tur''.<ref name=fedos /> In [[Slovakia]],  toponyms such as [[Turany]], Tur\u00ed\u010dky, [[Turie]], Turie Pole, [[Tur\u00edk]], [[Turov\u00e1]] (villages), [[Turiec]] (river and region), Tursk\u00e1 dolina (valley) and others are used. [[Turopolje]], a large lowland floodplain south of the [[Sava]] River in [[Croatia]], got its name from the once-abundant aurochs (Croatian: {{lang|hr|tur}}). The ancient name of the [[Estonia]]n town of [[Rakvere]], ''Tarwanpe'' or ''Tarvanpea'', probably derives from \"Aurochs head\" (''Tarvan pea'') in ancient [[Estonian language|Estonian]].\n\nIn 2002, a 3.5-m-high and 7.1-m-long statue of an aurochs was erected in Rakvere, Estonia, for the town's 700th birthday. The sculpture, by artist [[Tauno Kangro]], has become a symbol of the town.<ref name=rakve />\n\nAurochs are frequently mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of [[fantasy]] novels by [[George R. R. Martin]]; in particular, roasted aurochs are sometimes served at banquets.\n\nIn the 2012 movie ''[[Beasts of the Southern Wild]]'', the six-year-old main character imagines aurochs, though the fantasy creatures are portrayed by \"costumed\" [[Vietnamese Pot-bellied]] piglets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n\n{{portal|Paleontology}}\n* [[Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal#Assyrian lion hunts|Ashurnasirpal II's hunting of \"wild oxen\"]]\n* [[Chillingham cattle]]\n* [[Ur (rune)]]\n* [[American bison]] (''Bison bison'')\n* [[Beefalo]]\n* ''[[Bison antiquus]]''\n* ''[[Bison bonasus]]'' (European bison)\n* ''[[Bison latifrons]]'' ([[giant bison]]) (longhorn bison)\n* ''[[Bison priscus]]'' (steppe bison)\n* [[Bison]]\n* [[Bovid hybrid]]\n* [[Wood bison]]\n* [[Yak]]\n* [[\u017bubro\u0144]]\n\n{{colend}}\n\n== Notes ==\nThis article incorporates [[Creative Commons license]] CC BY-2.5 text from reference.<ref name=\"Edwards 2010\">{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = C.J. | last2 = Magee | first2 = D.A. | last3 = Park | first3 = S.D.E. | last4 = McGettigan | first4 = P.A. | last5 = Lohan | first5 = A.J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title = A Complete Mitochondrial Genome Sequence from a Mesolithic Wild Aurochs (''Bos primigenius'')\". | url = | journal = [[PLoS ONE]] | volume = 5 | issue = 2| page = e9255 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009255 | pmid=20174668 | pmc=2822870}}</ref>\n{{Reflist|33em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"IUCN\">{{Cite journal | author = Tikhonov, A. | title = ''Bos primigenius'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2008 | page = e.T136721A4332142 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2008 | url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/136721/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T136721A4332142.en | access-date = 11 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=iczn>{{cite web|url=http://iczn.org/content/biodiversity-studies |title=ICZN, Biodiversity Studies BZN Volume 63, Part 3, General Articles & Nomenclatural Notes |publisher= |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=ahd4>AHD4, s.vv. \"aurochs\", \"urus\", \"wisent\".</ref>\n\n<ref name=mwu>MWU, s.vv. \"aurochs\", \"urus\", \"wisent\".</ref>\n\n<ref name=anh>{{Cite journal\n| last1 = Pyle | first1 = C.

Additionally, It was designed for networks that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic (e.g., file transfers), and [[Real-time computing|real-time]], [[Latency (engineering)|low-latency]] content such as voice and video. The reference model for ATM approximately maps to the three lowest layers of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-[[OSI model|OSI reference model]]: [[network layer]], [[data link layer]], and [[physical layer]].<ref name=\"McDysan-Spohn\" >McDysan, David E. and Spohn, Darrel L., ''ATM : Theory and Application'', {{ISBN|0-07-060362-6}}, McGraw-Hill series on computer communications, 1995, page 563.</ref>  ATM is a core protocol used over the [[SONET/SDH]] backbone of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) and [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN), but its use is declining in favour of [[all IP]].\n\nATM provides functionality that is similar to both [[circuit switching]] and [[packet switching]] networks: ATM uses [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous]] [[time-division multiplexing]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-I.150-199902-I!!PDF-E&type=items|title=Recommendation I.150, B-ISDN Asynchronous Transfer Mode functional characteristics |publisher=ITU}}</ref><ref name=\"McDysan 1999 287\">McDysan (1999), p. 287.</ref> and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [[Network packet|packets]] (ISO-OSI [[Frame (networking)|frames]]) called ''cells.'' This differs from approaches such as the [[Internet Protocol]] or [[Ethernet]] that use variable sized packets and frames. ATM uses a [[connection-oriented]] model in which a [[virtual circuit]] must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.<ref name=\"McDysan 1999 287\"/> These virtual circuits may be \u201cpermanent\u201d, i.e. dedicated connections that are usually preconfigured by the service provider, or \u201cswitched\u201d, i.e. set up on a per-call basis using [[Signaling (telecommunications)|signaling]] and disconnected when the call is terminated.\n\nUse of ATM technology was eventually largely superseded by [[Internet Protocol]] (IP)-only technology. Wireless and mobile ATM never established a significant foothold.\n\n[[File:IBM Turboways ATM 155.jpg|340px|thumb|right|[[IBM]] Turboways ATM 155 [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] network interface card]]\n[[File:ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM Network Interface (1).jpg|340px|thumb|right|[[Marconi Company|Marconi]] ForeRunnerLE 25 ATM [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] network interface card]]\n\n==Layer 2 \u2013 datagrams==\nIn the ISO-OSI reference model data link layer (layer 2), the basic transfer units are generically called [[Frame (networking)|frames]]. In ATM these frames are of a fixed (53 [[Octet (computing)|octets]] or [[byte]]s) length and specifically called \"cells\".\n\n=== Cell size===\nIf a speech signal is reduced to packets, and it is forced to share a link with bursty data traffic (traffic with some large data packets) then no matter how small the speech packets could be made, they would always encounter full-size data packets. Under normal queuing conditions the cells might experience maximum queuing delays. To avoid this issue, all ATM packets, or \"cells,\" are the same small size. In addition, the fixed cell structure means that ATM can be readily switched by hardware without the inherent delays introduced by software switched and routed frames.\n\nThus, the designers of ATM utilized small data cells to reduce [[jitter]] (delay variance, in this case) in the multiplexing of data streams. Reduction of jitter (and also end-to-end round-trip delays) is particularly important when carrying voice traffic, because the conversion of digitized voice into an analogue audio signal is an inherently [[real time computing|real-time]] process, and to do a good job, the [[codec|decoder]] (codec) that does this needs an evenly spaced (in time) stream of data items. If the next data item is not available when it is needed, the codec has no choice but to produce silence or guess \u2014 and if the data is late, it is useless, because the time period when it should have been converted to a signal has already passed.\n\nAt the time of the design of ATM, 155 Mbit/s [[synchronous digital hierarchy]] (SDH) with 135 Mbit/s payload was considered a fast optical network link, and many [[plesiochronous digital hierarchy]] (PDH) links in the digital network were considerably slower, ranging from 1.544 to 45 Mbit/s in the USA, and 2 to 34 Mbit/s in Europe.\n\nAt 155 Mbit/s, a typical full-length 1,500 byte (12,000-bit) data packet, sufficient to contain a [[maximum transfer unit|maximum]]-sized [[Internet Protocol|IP packet]] for [[Ethernet]], would take 77.42 [[microsecond|\u00b5s]] to transmit. In a lower-speed link, such as a 1.544 Mbit/s [[T1 line]], the same packet would take up to 7.8 milliseconds.\n\nA [[queuing delay]] induced by several such data packets might exceed the figure of 7.8 ms several times over, in addition to any packet generation delay in the shorter speech packet. This was clearly unacceptable for speech traffic, which needs to have low jitter in the data stream being fed into the codec if it is to produce good-quality sound. A packet voice system can produce this low jitter in a number of ways:\n\n* Using a playback buffer between the network and the codec, one large enough to tide the codec over almost all the jitter in the data. This allows smoothing out the jitter, but the delay introduced by passage through the buffer require [[echo cancellation|echo canceller]]s even in local networks; this was considered too expensive at the time. Also, it increased the delay across the channel, and made conversation difficult over high-delay channels.\n* Using a system that inherently provides low jitter (and minimal overall delay) to traffic that needs it.\n* Operate on a 1:1 user basis (i.e., a dedicated pipe).\n\nThe design of ATM aimed for a low-jitter network interface. However, \"cells\" were introduced into the design to provide short queuing delays while continuing to support [[datagram]] traffic. ATM broke up all packets, data, and voice streams into 48-byte chunks, adding a 5-byte routing header to each one so that they could be reassembled later. The choice of 48 bytes was political rather than technical.<ref>D. Stevenson, \"Electropolitical Correctness and High-Speed Networking, or, Why ATM is like a Nose\", [https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0306444860 Proceedings of TriCom '93], April 1993.</ref> When the [[ITU-T|CCITT]] (now ITU-T) was standardizing ATM, parties from the United States wanted a 64-byte payload because this was felt to be a good compromise in larger payloads optimized for data transmission and shorter payloads optimized for real-time applications like voice; parties from Europe wanted 32-byte payloads because the small size (and therefore short transmission times) simplify voice applications with respect to echo cancellation. Most of the European parties eventually came around to the arguments made by the Americans, but France and a few others held out for a shorter cell length. With 32 bytes, France would have been able to implement an ATM-based voice network with calls from one end of France to the other requiring no echo cancellation. 48 bytes (plus 5 header bytes = 53) was chosen as a compromise between the two sides. 5-byte headers were chosen because it was thought that 10% of the payload was the maximum price to pay for routing information.<ref name=\"bisdn\">{{cite web |last=Ayanoglu |first=Ender |title=B-ISDN (Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network) |url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/cpcc/2/ |publisher=Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing, UC Irvine|accessdate=3 June 2011|author2=Akar, Nail}}</ref> ATM multiplexed these 53-byte cells instead of packets which reduced worst-case cell contention jitter by a factor of almost 30, reducing the need for echo cancellers.\n\n=== Structure of an ATM cell ===\nAn ATM cell consists of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload. The payload size of 48 bytes was chosen as described above.\n\nATM defines two different cell formats: [[user\u2013network interface]] (UNI) and [[network-to-network interface|network\u2013network]] (NNI).

The GFC field was designed to give the User-Network Interface (UNI) 4 bits in which to negotiate multiplexing and flow control among the cells of various ATM connections. However, the use and exact values of the GFC field have not been standardized, and the field is always set to 0000.<ref>{{cite web|title=ATM Cell Structure|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc976978.aspx|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n: VPI = [[Virtual path identifier]] (8 bits UNI, or 12 bits NNI)\n: VCI = [[Virtual channel identifier]] (16 bits)\n: PT = Payload type (3 bits)\n:: PT bit 3 (msbit): Network management cell.  If 0, user data cell and the following apply:\n:: PT bit 2: Explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI); 1 = [[network congestion]] experienced\n:: PT bit 1 (lsbit): ATM user-to-user (AAU) bit.  Used by AAL5 to indicate packet boundaries.\n: CLP = Cell loss priority (1-bit)\n: HEC = [[CRC-based framing|Header error control]] (8-bit CRC, polynomial = X<sup>8</sup> + X<sup>2</sup> + X + 1)\n\nATM uses the PT field to designate various special kinds of cells for [[operations, administration and management]] (OAM) purposes, and to delineate packet boundaries in some [[ATM adaptation layer]]s (AAL).  If the [[most significant bit]] (MSB) of the PT field is 0, this is a user data cell, and the other two bits are used to indicate network congestion and as a general purpose header bit available for ATM adaptation layers. If the MSB is 1, this is a management cell, and the other two bits indicate the type.  (Network management segment, network management end-to-end, resource management, and reserved for future use.)\n\nSeveral ATM link protocols use the HEC field to drive a [[CRC-based framing]] algorithm, which allows locating the ATM cells with no overhead beyond what is otherwise needed for header protection. The 8-bit CRC is used to correct single-bit header errors and detect multi-bit header errors. When multi-bit header errors are detected, the current and subsequent cells are dropped until a cell with no header errors is found.\n\nA UNI cell reserves the GFC field for a local [[flow control (data)|flow control]]/submultiplexing system between users. This was intended to allow several terminals to share a single network connection, in the same way that two [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN) phones can share a single basic rate ISDN connection. All four GFC bits must be zero by default.\n\nThe NNI cell format replicates the UNI format almost exactly, except that the 4-bit GFC field is re-allocated to the VPI field, extending the VPI to 12 bits. Thus, a single NNI ATM interconnection is capable of addressing almost 2<sup>12</sup> VPs of up to almost 2<sup>16</sup> VCs each (in practice some of the VP and VC numbers are reserved).\n\n=== Cells in practice ===\nATM supports different types of services via AALs. Standardized AALs include AAL1, AAL2, and AAL5, and the rarely used{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} AAL3 and AAL4. AAL1 is used for constant bit rate (CBR) services and circuit emulation. Synchronization is also maintained at AAL1. AAL2 through AAL4 are used for [[variable bitrate]] (VBR) services, and AAL5 for data. Which AAL is in use for a given cell is not encoded in the cell. Instead, it is negotiated by or configured at the endpoints on a per-virtual-connection basis.\n\nFollowing the initial design of ATM, networks have become much faster. A 1500 byte (12000-bit) full-size [[Ethernet frame]] takes only 1.2 \u00b5s to transmit on a 10 Gbit/s network, reducing the need for small cells to reduce jitter due to contention. Some consider that this makes a case for replacing ATM with Ethernet in the network backbone. However, it should be noted that the increased link speeds by themselves do not alleviate jitter due to queuing. Additionally, the hardware for implementing the service adaptation for IP packets is expensive at very high speeds. Specifically, at speeds of [[OC-3]] and above, the cost of segmentation and reassembly (SAR) hardware makes ATM less competitive for IP than [[Packet over SONET/SDH|Packet Over SONET]] (POS){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}; because of its fixed 48-byte cell payload, ATM is not suitable as a data link layer ''directly'' underlying IP (without the need for SAR at the data link level) since the OSI layer on which IP operates must provide a [[maximum transmission unit]] (MTU) of at least 576 bytes. SAR performance limits mean that the fastest IP router ATM interfaces are STM16 - STM64 which actually compares, while {{As of|2004|lc=on}} POS can operate at OC-192 (STM64) with higher speeds expected in the future.\n\nOn slower or congested links (622 Mbit/s and below), ATM does make sense, and for this reason most [[asymmetric digital subscriber line]] (ADSL) systems use ATM as an intermediate layer between the physical link layer and a Layer 2 protocol like [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]] or Ethernet.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAt these lower speeds, ATM provides a useful ability to carry multiple logical circuits on a single physical or virtual medium, although other techniques exist, such as [[Point-to-Point Protocol#Multiclass PPP|Multi-link PPP]] and [[Ethernet]] [[VLAN]]s, which are optional in [[VDSL]] implementations. [[DSL]] can be used as an access method for an ATM network, allowing a DSL termination point in a telephone central office to connect to many internet service providers across a wide-area ATM network. In the United States, at least, this has allowed DSL providers to provide DSL access to the customers of many internet service providers. Since one DSL termination point can support multiple ISPs, the economic feasibility of DSL is substantially improved.\n\n=== Reasons for virtual circuits === <!--[[Virtual channel identifier]] and [[Virtual path identifier]] redirect here-->\nATM operates as a channel-based transport layer, using [[virtual circuit]]s (VCs). This is encompassed in the concept of the virtual paths (VP) and virtual channels. Every ATM cell has an 8- or 12-bit virtual path identifier (VPI) and 16-bit virtual channel identifier (VCI) pair defined in its header.<ref name=\"cisco-atm\">Cisco Systems [https://indigothemes.com/wikipedia-contribution/techgd.pdf ''Guide to ATM Technology''] (2000). Section \"Operation of an ATM Switch\". Retrieved 2 June 2011.</ref> The VCI, together with the VPI, is used to identify the next destination of a cell as it passes through a series of ATM switches on its way to its destination. The length of the VPI varies according to whether the cell is sent on the user-network interface (on the edge of the network), or if it is sent on the network-network interface (inside the network).\n\nAs these cells traverse an ATM network, switching takes place by changing the VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent from one end of the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit ''is'' consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others).<ref name=\"cisco-atm-cell\">Cisco Systems [https://indigothemes.com/wikipedia-contribution/techgd.pdf ''Guide to ATM Technology''] (2000). Section \"ATM Cell Header Formats\". Retrieved 2 June 2011.</ref> ATM switches use the VPI/VCI fields to identify the [[Virtual Channel Link|virtual channel link]] (VCL) of the next network that a cell needs to transit on its way to its final destination. The function of the VCI is similar to that of the [[data link connection identifier]] (DLCI) in [[frame relay]] and the logical channel number and logical channel group number in [[X.25]].\n\nAnother advantage of the use of virtual circuits comes with the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, [[frame relay]], n* 64 channels, IP). The VPI is useful for reducing the switching table of some virtual circuits which have common paths.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Using cells and virtual circuits for traffic engineering ===\nAnother key ATM concept involves the [[traffic contract]]. When an ATM circuit is set up each switch on the circuit is informed of the traffic class of the connection.\n\nATM traffic contracts form part of the mechanism by which \"[[quality of service]]\" (QoS) is ensured. There are four basic types (and several variants) which each have a set of parameters describing the connection.\n\n# CBR - Constant bit rate: a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) is specified, which is constant.\n# VBR - Variable bit rate: an average or Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR) is specified, which can peak at a certain level, a PCR, for a maximum interval before being problematic.\n# ABR - Available bit rate: a minimum guaranteed rate is specified.\n# UBR - Unspecified bit rate: traffic is allocated to all remaining transmission capacity.\n\nVBR has real-time and non-real-time variants, and serves for \"bursty\" traffic. Non-real-time is sometimes abbreviated to vbr-nrt.\n\nMost traffic classes also introduce the concept of Cell-delay variation tolerance (CDVT), which defines the \"clumping\" of cells in time.\n\n==== Traffic policing ====\nTo maintain network performance, networks may apply [[Traffic policing (communications)|traffic policing]] to virtual circuits to limit them to their traffic contracts at the entry points to the network, i.e. the [[user\u2013network interface]]s (UNIs) and [[network-to-network interface]]s (NNIs): [[UPC and NPC|usage/network parameter control]] (UPC and NPC).<ref name=\"UPC_NPC\" >ITU-T, ''Traffic control and congestion control in B ISDN'', Recommendation I.371, International Telecommunication Union, 2004, page 17</ref> The reference model given by the ITU-T and ATM Forum for UPC and NPC is the [[generic cell rate algorithm]] (GCRA),<ref name=\"ITU-T-GCRA\" >ITU-T, ''Traffic control and congestion control in B ISDN'', Recommendation I.371, International Telecommunication Union, 2004, Annex A, page 87.</ref><ref name=\"ATMF-GCRA\" >ATM Forum, The User Network Interface (UNI), v. 3.1, {{ISBN|0-13-393828-X}}, Prentice Hall PTR, 1995.</ref> which is a version of the [[Leaky bucket#The Leaky Bucket Algorithm as a Meter|leaky bucket]] algorithm. CBR traffic will normally be policed to a PCR and CDVt alone, whereas VBR traffic will normally be policed using a dual leaky bucket controller to a PCR and CDVt and an SCR and Maximum Burst Size (MBS). The MBS will normally be the [[Network packet|packet]] ([[Segmentation and Reassembly|SAR]]-[[Service data unit|SDU]]) size for the VBR VC in cells.\n\nIf the traffic on a virtual circuit is exceeding its traffic contract, as determined by the GCRA, the network can either drop the cells or mark the [[Cell Loss Priority]] (CLP) bit (to identify a cell as potentially redundant). Basic policing works on a cell by cell basis, but this is sub-optimal for encapsulated packet traffic (as discarding a single cell will invalidate the whole packet). As a result, schemes such as partial packet discard (PPD) and early packet discard (EPD) have been created that will discard a whole series of cells until the next packet starts. This reduces the number of useless cells in the network, saving bandwidth for full packets. EPD and PPD work with AAL5 connections as they use the end of packet marker: the ATM user-to-ATM user (AUU) indication bit in the payload-type field of the header, which is set in the last cell of a SAR-SDU.\n\n==== Traffic shaping ====\n[[Traffic shaping]] usually takes place in the [[network interface controller|network interface card]] (NIC) in user equipment, and attempts to ensure that the cell flow on a VC will meet its traffic contract, i.e. cells will not be dropped or reduced in priority at the UNI. Since the reference model given for traffic policing in the network is the GCRA, this algorithm is normally used for shaping as well, and single and dual leaky bucket implementations may be used as appropriate.\n\n=== Types of virtual circuits and paths ===\nATM can build virtual circuits and virtual paths either statically or dynamically. Static circuits (permanent virtual circuits or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) require that the circuit is composed of a series of segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes.\n\nPVPs and PVCs, though conceptually simple, require significant effort in large networks. They also do not support the re-routing of service in the event of a failure. Dynamically built PVPs (soft PVPs or SPVPs) and PVCs (soft PVCs or SPVCs), in contrast, are built by specifying the characteristics of the circuit (the service \"contract\") and the two end points.\n\nATM networks create and remove switched virtual circuits (SVCs) on demand when requested by an end piece of equipment. One application for SVCs is to carry individual telephone calls when a network of telephone switches are inter-connected using ATM. SVCs were also used in attempts to replace local area networks with ATM.\n\n=== Virtual circuit routing ===\nMost ATM networks supporting SPVPs, SPVCs, and SVCs use the Private Network Node Interface or the [[Private Network-to-Network Interface]] (PNNI) protocol. PNNI uses the same shortest-path-first algorithm used by [[Open Shortest Path First|OSPF]] and [[IS-IS]] to route IP packets to share topology information between switches and select a route through a network. PNNI also includes a very powerful summarization mechanism to allow construction of very large networks, as well as a [[Call Admission Control|call admission control]] (CAC) algorithm which determines the availability of sufficient bandwidth on a proposed route through a network in order to satisfy the service requirements of a VC or VP.\n\n=== Call admission and connection establishment ===\nA network must establish a connection before two parties can send cells to each other. In ATM this is called a [[virtual circuit]] (VC). It can be a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), which is created administratively on the end points, or a switched virtual circuit (SVC), which is created as needed by the communicating parties. SVC creation is managed by [[signalling (telecommunications)|signaling]], in which the requesting party indicates the address of the receiving party, the type of service requested, and whatever traffic parameters may be applicable to the selected service. \"Call admission\" is then performed by the network to confirm that the requested resources are available and that a route exists for the connection.\n\n=== Reference model ===\nATM specifies the following three layers: <ref>{{cite web|publisher=Cisco Systems |title=Guide to ATM Technology for the Catalyst 8540 MSR, Catalyst 8510 MSR, and LightStream 1010 ATM Switch Routers |year=2000 |work=Customer Order Number: DOC-786275 |url=https://www.cisco.com/application/pdf/en/us/guest/products/ps1891/c2001/ccmigration_09186a00800f4b5d.pdf |accessdate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n* [[ATM adaptation layer]] (AAL)\n* ATM layer 2, roughly corresponding to the [[OSI model|OSI]] [[data link layer]]\n* physical layer, equivalent to the OSI [[physical layer]]\n\n== Deployment ==\nATM became popular with telephone companies and many computer makers in the 1990s.

[[Monotreme]] mammals also have a cloaca, which is thought to be a feature inherited from the earliest [[amniote]]s via the [[therapsid]]s. [[Marsupial]]s have a single orifice for excreting both solids and liquids and, in females, a separate [[vagina]] for reproduction. Female [[placental]] mammals have completely separate orifices for [[defecation]], [[urination]], and reproduction; males have one opening for defecation and [[External urethral orifice (male)|another for both urination and reproduction]], although the channels flowing to that orifice are almost completely separate.\n\nThe development of the anus was an important stage in the evolution of multicellular animals. It appears to have happened at least twice, following different paths in [[protostome]]s and [[deuterostome]]s. This accompanied or facilitated other important evolutionary developments: the [[bilaterian|bilaterian body plan]], the [[coelom]], and [[Metamerism (biology)|metamerism]], in which the body was built of repeated \"modules\" which could later specialize, such as the heads of most [[arthropods]], which are composed of fused, specialized segments.\n\n==Development==\n{{main article|Protostome|Deuterostome}}\nIn animals at least as complex as an [[earthworm]], the [[embryo]] forms a dent on one side, the [[blastopore]], which deepens to become the [[archenteron]], the first phase in the growth of the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]].

The protostomes were so named because it was thought that in their embryos the dent formed the mouth first (''[[wikt:proto-|proto\u2013]]'' meaning \"first\") and the anus was formed later at the opening made by the other end of the gut. More recent research, however, shows that in protostomes the edges of the dent close up in the middle, leaving openings at the ends which become the mouth and anus.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Evolution of the bilaterian larval foregut | author=Arendt, D. | author2=Technau, U. | author3=Wittbrodt, J. | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Nature | volume=409 | pages=81\u201385 | date=4 January 2001 | doi=10.1038/35051075 | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6816/full/409081a0.html | accessdate=2008-07-14 | pmid=11343117 | issue=6816}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anal canal]]\n* [[Imperforate anus]]; a [[birth defect]].\n* [[Anorectal manometry]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Anus}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Digestive system]]\n[[Category:Anus| ]]", "sha1": "orcoz19nzmmpidvqikp5j3zjdckoffb"}}, {"title": "Appendix", "ns": "0", "id": "2501", "revision": {"id": "860115820", "parentid": "860115791", "timestamp": "2018-09-18T13:00:54Z", "contributor": {"username": "KH-1", "id": "21857263"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/217.181.28.1|217.181.28.1]] ([[User talk:217.181.28.1|talk]]) to last version by Bkonrad", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary|appendix}}\n'''Appendix''' may refer to:\n\n{{tocright}}\n==In documents==\n*[[Addendum]], an addition made to a document by its author after its initial printing or publication\n*[[Bibliography]], a systematic list of books and other works\n*[[Index (publishing)]], a list of words or phrases with pointers to where related material can be found in a document\n\n==Anatomy==\n*[[Appendix (anatomy)]], a part of the human digestive system\n*[[Appendix of the epididymis]], a detached efferent duct of the epididymis\n*[[Appendix testis]], a vestigial remnant of the M\u00fcllerian duct\n*[[Epiploic appendix]], one of several small pouches of fat on the peritoneum along the colon and rectum\n**[[Appendix of the laryngeal ventricle]], a sac that extends from the laryngeal ventricle\n*[[Mesoappendix]], the portion of the mesentery that connects the ileum to the vermiform appendix\n\n==Arts and media==\n*[[Appendix (band)]], a Finnish punk rock group\n*''[[The Appendix]]'', a quarterly journal of history and culture\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appendicitis]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "rnw2slm5pc1tt4x3s144rhfiy09tos4"}}, {"title": "Acantharea", "ns": "0", "id": "2502", "revision": {"id": "861946790", "parentid": "852177877", "timestamp": "2018-10-01T04:39:37Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v2.0beta9)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2011}}\n{{taxobox\n| image = Haeckel_Acanthometra.jpg\n| image_caption = ''Acantharea'' species\n| domain = [[Eukaryota]]\n| unranked_regnum = [[SAR supergroup|SAR]]\n| unranked_subregnum = [[Rhizaria]]\n| phylum = [[Retaria]]\n| subphylum = [[Radiolaria]]\n| classis = Acantharea\n| classis_authority = [[Haeckel]], 1881, ''emend.''

On 8 April 1960, the administration of [[Charles Robberts Swart]], banned the ANC and forced the party to leave South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Africa Bans African National Congress|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/south-africa-bans-african-national-congress|website=African American Registry|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> After the ban, the ANC formed the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilizing [[guerrilla warfare]] and sabotage.

It can be said that the SANNC had its origins in a pronouncement by [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]] who said in 1911, \"Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation.\" The SANNC was founded the following year on 8 January 1912.<ref>[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs/misc/2010/umzabalazo.html The African National Congress]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225042601/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs%2Fmisc%2F2010%2Fumzabalazo.html|date=25 February 2011}}. Anc.org.za. Retrieved 23 November 2011.</ref>\n\nThe government of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]] began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa. The [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Land Act]] was promulgated in 1913 forcing many black South Africans from their farms into the cities and towns to work, and to restrict their movement within South Africa.\n\nBy 1919, the SANNC was leading a campaign against passes (an ID which black South Africans had to possess). However, it then became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union|ICU]] and the previously white-only Communist party. In 1923, the organisation became the African National Congress, and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers' strike.\n\nBy 1927, [[Josiah Tshangana Gumede|J.T. Gumede]] (president of the ANC) proposed co-operation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation, but he was voted out of power in the 1930s. This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive, until the mid-1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement.\n\nThe ANC responded to attacks on the rights of black South Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance. This led to a later [[Defiance Campaign]] in the 1950s, a mass movement of resistance to [[apartheid]]. The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] officially adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], stating the core principles of the South African [[Congress Alliance]], which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), the [[South African Indian Congress]], the [[South African Congress of Democrats]] (COD) and the Coloured People's Congress.<ref name=\"pil-lut\">{{cite book|last=Pillay|first=Gerald J.|title=Voices of Liberation: Albert Lutuli|year=1993|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=0-7969-1356-0|pages=82\u201391}}</ref> The government claimed that this was a communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the [[Sharpeville massacre]], in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.\n\n===uMkhonto we Sizwe===\n{{main|uMkhonto we Sizwe}}\n[[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] or MK, translated \"The Spear of the Nation\", was the military wing of the ANC.

The ANC is a member of the [[Socialist International]].<ref name=socialistinternational/> It also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of ANC policy.\n\nThe National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or [[Concentric objects|concentric circles]] the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include [[Joe Slovo]], [[Joel Netshitenzhe]] and [[Tshilidzi Marwala]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Slovo|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/slovo/1988/national-democratic-revolution.htm|title=The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Joel|last=Netshitenzhe|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|title=Understanding the tasks of the moment|work=Umrabulo|volume=25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622025249/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|archivedate=22 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Marwala|first=T|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844|title=The anatomy of capital and the national democratic revolution|work=Umrabulo|volume=29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018065656/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844 |archivedate=18 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ANC declared itself to be a social democratic party.<ref>The Mail & Guardian A-Z of South African Politics by Barbara Ludman, Paul Stober, and Ferial Haffagee</ref>\n\nThe 53rd National Conference of the ANC, held in 2015, stated in its \"Discussion Document\" that \"China economic development trajectory remains a leading example of the triumph of humanity over adversity.

Initially intelligence agents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] met in secret with ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to judge whether conflict resolution was possible.<ref>[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid apartheid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054317/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid |date=20 December 2008 }}.

Retrieved 23 November 2011.</ref> Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President [[F. W. de Klerk|de Klerk]] on 2 February 1990.\n\nThe next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.\n\nLater the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC \u2013 the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.<ref name=concise>{{cite book|title=A Concise History of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act, the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.<ref name=concise/> These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.\n\nIn December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ([[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|CODESA]]) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government. However, a few months later in June 1992 the [[Boipatong massacre]] occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party. In over 40 sessions the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994.<ref name=concise/> The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.<ref>[http://www.africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidfaq/f/HowEnded.htm Apartheid FAQ: When Did Apartheid End?].

After the [[Public Protector]] released her report (Secure in Comfort) which found that Zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features, he refused to do so.

Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated.

This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic \u03b12 versus \u03b11 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function).&nbsp;...

Studies with juvenile rats have also indicated that repeated exposure to methylphenidate does not necessarily lead to enhanced drug-seeking behavior in adulthood (38). However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6\u201310).

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).<br />G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of \u0394FosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while \u0394FosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine\u2019s behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation. -->}}</ref> Sufficiently overexpressing \u0394JunD in the nucleus accumbens with [[viral vector]]s can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by \u0394FosB).<ref name=\"Nestler\" /> \u0394FosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to [[natural reward]]s, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise.<ref name=\"Natural and drug addictions\" /><ref name=\"Nestler\" /><ref name=\"\u0394FosB reward\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Blum K, Werner T, Carnes S, Carnes P, Bowirrat A, Giordano J, Oscar-Berman M, Gold M | title = Sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll: hypothesizing common mesolimbic activation as a function of reward gene polymorphisms | journal = J.

In asynchronous transmission, data is sent one byte at a time and each byte is preceded by start bit and stop bit.\n\n== Physical layer ==\n{{main|Asynchronous serial communication}}\nIn [[asynchronous serial communication]]  the [[physical protocol layer]], the data blocks are code words of a certain [[word length]], for example [[Octet (computing)|octets]] ([[bytes]]) or [[ASCII characters]], delimited by start bits and stop bits. A variable length space can be inserted between the code words. No bit synchronization signal is required. This is sometimes called [[character oriented communication]].

In this case the asynchronously transferred blocks are called [[data packet]]s, for example ATM cells. The opposite is [[circuit switched]] communication, which provides constant bit rate, for example [[ISDN]] and [[SONET/SDH]].\n\nThe packets may be encapsulated in a [[data frame]], with a [[frame synchronization]] bit sequence indicating the start of the frame, and sometimes also a [[bit synchronization]] bit sequence, typically 01010101, for identification of the bit transition times. Note that at the physical layer, this is considered as synchronous serial communication. Examples of packet mode data link protocols that can be/are transferred using synchronous serial communication are the [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], [[Point-to-point protocol|PPP]] and [[USB]] protocols.\n\n== Application layer ==\n{{Original research|date=September 2007}}\nAn asynchronous communication service or application does not require a constant bit rate.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hargrave|first1=Frank|title=Hargrave's Communication Dictionary|date=2001|publisher=Wiley|url=https://search.credoreference.com/}}</ref> Examples are [[file transfer]], [[email]] and the [[World Wide Web]].

Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach [[fortification]]s, and led to heavy, fairly immobile [[siege engine]]s. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile [[field artillery]] developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern [[self-propelled artillery]] vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.\n\nIn its earliest sense, the word artillery referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armour. Since the introduction of gunpowder and [[cannon]], the word \"artillery\" has largely meant cannon, and in contemporary usage, it usually refers to [[Explosive shell|shell]]-firing guns, [[howitzer]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], [[Rocket artillery|rockets]] and guided missiles. In common speech, the word artillery is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called \"equipments\". However, there is no generally recognised generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses \"artillery piece\", but most English-speaking armies use \"gun\" and \"mortar\". The projectiles fired are typically either \"shot\" (if solid) or \"shell\" (if not). \"Shell\" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of [[ammunition|munitions]].\n\nBy association, artillery may also refer to the [[Combat Arms|arm of service]] that customarily operates such engines.  In some armies one arm has operated field, coast, anti-aircraft artillery and some anti-tank artillery, in others these have been separate arms and in some nations coast has been a naval or marine responsibility. In the 20th century technology based target acquisition devices, such as radar, and systems, such as sound ranging and flash spotting, emerged to acquire targets, primarily for artillery.  These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms.  The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, in some armies provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm.\n\nArtillery originated for use against ground targets\u2014against infantry, cavalry and other artillery.  An early specialist development was [[coastal artillery]] for use against enemy ships.  The early 20th century saw the development of a new class of artillery for use against aircraft: [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]].\n\nArtillery is arguably the most lethal form of land-based armament currently employed, and has been since at least the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. The majority of combat deaths in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]] were caused by artillery.<ref name=bellamy>Christopher Bellamy, Oxford Companion to Military History: artillery</ref> In 1944, [[Joseph Stalin]] said in a speech that artillery was \"the God of War\".<ref name=bellamy/>\n\n==Artillery piece==\n[[File:French soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War 1870-71.jpg|thumb|right|French soldiers in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] 1870\u201371.]]\n[[File:British 64 Pounder Rifled Muzzle-Loaded (RML) Gun on Moncrieff disappearing mount, at Scaur Hill Fort, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|British 64 Pounder Rifled Muzzle-Loaded (RML) Gun on a Moncrieff disappearing mount, at Scaur Hill Fort, Bermuda. This is a part of a fixed battery, meant to protect against over-land attack and to serve as coastal artillery.]]\nAlthough not called as such, machines performing the role recognizable as artillery have been employed in warfare since antiquity. Historical references show artillery was first employed by the [[Roman legion]]s at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in 399 BC.{{citation needed|reason=dubious|date=September 2017}} Until the introduction of [[gunpowder]] into western warfare, artillery was dependent upon mechanical energy which not only severely limited the kinetic energy of the projectiles, it also required the construction of very large engines to store sufficient energy. A 1st-century BC Roman [[catapult]] launching {{cvt|6.55|kg|lb}} stones achieved a kinetic energy of 16,000 [[Joule#Kilojoule|joules]], compared to a mid-19th-century [[12-pounder gun]], which fired a {{cvt|4.1|kg|lb}} round, with a kinetic energy of 240,000 joules, or a late 20th century US battleship that fired a {{cvt|1225|kg|lb}} projectile from its main battery with an energy level surpassing 350,000,000 [[Joule#Megajoule|joules]].\n\nFrom the [[Middle Ages]] through most of the [[modern era]], [[Cannon|artillery pieces]] on land were moved by [[Horse-drawn vehicle|horse-drawn]] [[gun carriage]]s. In the [[Contemporary history|contemporary era]], artillery pieces and their crew relied on [[Motor vehicle|wheeled]] or [[tracked vehicle]]s as transportation. These land versions of artillery were dwarfed by [[railway gun]]s, which includes the largest [[supergun|super-gun]] ever [[Project Babylon|conceived]], theoretically capable of [[Space gun|putting a satellite into orbit]]. Artillery used by naval forces has also changed significantly, with [[missile]]s replacing guns in [[surface warfare]].\n\nOver the course of military history, projectiles were manufactured from a wide variety of materials, into a wide variety of shapes, using many different methods in which to [[Targeting (warfare)|target]] structural/defensive works and inflict enemy [[Casualty (person)|casualties]]. The engineering applications for [[Ammunition#Artillery|ordnance]] delivery have likewise changed significantly over time, encompassing some of the most complex and advanced technologies in use today.\n\nIn some armies, the weapon of artillery is the projectile, not the equipment that fires it. The process of delivering fire onto the target is called gunnery. The actions involved in operating an artillery piece are collectively called \"serving the gun\" by the \"detachment\" or gun crew, constituting either direct or indirect artillery fire. The manner in which gunnery crews (or formations) are employed is called artillery support. At different periods in history this may refer to weapons designed to be fired from ground-, sea-, and even air-based [[weapons platform]]s.\n\n==Crew==<!-- Gunner (artillery) links here. Pls do not change -->\nThe term \"[[Crew-served weapon|gunner]]\" is used in some armed forces for the soldiers and sailors with the primary function of using artillery. \n[[File:M777 Light Towed Howitzer 1.jpg|thumb|7-person gun crew firing a US [[M777 howitzer|M777 Light Towed Howitzer]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]], 2009.]]\nThe gunners and their guns are usually grouped in teams called either \"crews\" or \"detachments\". Several such crews and teams with other functions are combined into a unit of artillery, usually called a [[Artillery battery|battery]], although sometimes called a company. In gun detachments, each role is numbered, starting with \"1\" the Detachment Commander, and the highest number being the Coverer, the second-in-command. \"Gunner\" is also the lowest rank and junior non-commissioned officers are \"Bombardiers\" in some artillery arms.\n\nBatteries are roughly equivalent to a [[Company (military unit)|company]] in the infantry, and are combined into larger [[military organization]]s for administrative and operational purposes, either battalions or regiments, depending on the army. These may be grouped into brigades; the Russian army also groups some brigades into artillery divisions, and the [[People's Liberation Army]] has artillery corps.\n\nThe term \"artillery\" is also applied to a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of most [[military service]]s when used organizationally to describe [[Military organization|unit]]s and [[Military organization|formation]]s of the national armed forces that operate the weapons.\n\nDuring [[military operation]]s, the role of [[field artillery]] is to provide support to other arms in combat or to attack targets, particularly in depth. Broadly, these effects fall into two categories, either to suppress or neutralize the enemy, or to cause casualties, damage, and destruction. This is mostly achieved by delivering high-explosive munitions to suppress, or inflict casualties on the enemy from [[Penetrating trauma|casing fragments and other debris]] and [[blast injury|blast]], or by destroying enemy positions, equipment, and vehicles. Non-lethal munitions, notably smoke, can also be used to suppress or neutralize the enemy by obscuring their view.\n\nFire may be directed by an [[artillery observer]] or other observer, including manned and unmanned aircraft pilots, or called onto [[Geographic coordinate system|map coordinates]].\n\n[[Military doctrine]] has played a significant influence on the core [[Engineering design process|engineering design]] considerations of artillery ordnance through its history, in seeking to achieve a balance between delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility. However, during the modern period, the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late-19th-century introduction of the new generation of infantry weapons using [[Cylindro-conoidal bullet|conoidal bullet]], better known as the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]], with a range almost as long as that of field artillery.\n\nThe gunners' increasing proximity to and participation in direct combat against other combat arms and attacks by aircraft made the introduction of a gun shield necessary. The problems of how to employ a fixed or horse-towed gun in mobile warfare necessitated the development of new methods of transporting the artillery into combat. Two distinct forms of artillery developed: the towed gun, which was used primarily to attack or defend a fixed line; and the self-propelled gun, which was designed to accompany a mobile force and provide continuous fire support. These influences have guided the development of artillery ordnance, systems, organisations, and operations until the present, with artillery systems capable of providing support at ranges from as little as 100&nbsp;m to the intercontinental ranges of [[ballistic missile]]s. The only combat in which artillery is unable to take part in is [[Close combat|close quarters combat]], with the possible exception of artillery reconnaissance teams.<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u0160otnar|first1=Ji\u0159\u00ed|last2=Carbol|first2=Michal|last3=Blaha|first3=Martin|title=Modernization of artillery reconnaissance|url=http://inase.org/library/2014/varna/bypaper/AMCSE/AMCSE-17.pdf|website=INASE|publisher=Applied Mathematics, Computational Science and Engineering|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word as used in the current context originated in the [[Middle Ages]]. One suggestion is that it comes from the [[Old French]] ''atellier'', meaning \"to arrange\", and ''attillement'', meaning \"equipment\".\n\nFrom the 13th century, an ''artillier'' referred to a builder of any war equipment; and, for the next 250 years, the sense of the word \"artillery\" covered all forms of military weapons. Hence, the naming of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]], which was essentially an [[infantry]] unit until the 19th century. Another suggestion is that it comes from the Italian ''arte de tirare'' (art of shooting), coined by one of the first theorists on the use of artillery, [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia|Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of gunpowder}}\nMechanical systems used for throwing ammunition in ancient warfare, also known as \"[[engines of war]]\", like the [[catapult]], [[onager (siege weapon)|onager]], [[trebuchet]], and [[ballista]], are also referred to by military historians as artillery.\n\n===Invention of gunpowder===\n[[File:1350 AD early Chinese vase-shaped cannon.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|A depiction of an early vase-shaped cannon dated from around 1350 AD.

During the [[Hundred Years' War]], these weapons became more common, initially as the [[Bombard (weapon)|bombard]] and later the [[cannon]]. Cannon were always [[muzzle-loader]]s. While there were many early attempts at breech-loading designs, a lack of engineering knowledge rendered these even more dangerous to use than muzzle-loaders.\n\n===Expansion of artillery use===\n[[File:French gunner 15th century \u00b7 HHWXI264.svg|thumb|left|upright|French gunner in the 15th century, a 1904 illustration.]]\n[[File:1526-First Battle of Panipat-Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[First Battle of Panipat]]<ref>{{cite web|last=unknown |url=http://warfare.uphero.com/Moghul/Baburnama/1526-First_Battle_of_Panipat-Ibrahim_Lodhi_and_Babur.htm |title=1526, First Battle of Panipat, Ibrahim Lodhi and Babur |date=1590s |work=Baburnama}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Bullocks dragging siege-guns up hill during the attack on Ranthambhor Fort.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Bullocks dragging siege-guns up hill during Akbar's [[Siege of Ranthambore (1568)|Siege of Ranthambore]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Unknown|url=http://warfare2.likamva.in/Moghul/Akbar/1568-Bullocks_dragging_siege-guns_up_hill_during_the_attack_on_Ranthambhor_Fort.htm|title=Bullocks dragging siege-guns up hill during Akbar's attack on Ranthambhor Fort |date=1590\u201395|work=the Akbarnama}}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1415, the Portuguese invaded the Mediterranean port town of [[Ceuta]]. While it is difficult to confirm the use of firearms in the siege of the city, it is known the Portuguese defended it thereafter with firearms, namely ''bombardas'', ''colebratas'', and ''falconetes''. In 1419, Sultan Abu Sa'id led an army to reconquer the fallen city, and Moroccans brought cannons and used them in the assault on Ceuta. Finally, hand-held firearms and riflemen appear in Morocco, in 1437, in an expedition against the people of [[Tangiers]].<ref>Cook, Weston F., Jr. ''Warfare and Firearms in Fifteenth century Morocco, 1400\u20131492.'' <!--Publisher & place?--> 1993</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2011}} It is clear these weapons had developed into several different forms, from small guns to large artillery pieces.\n\nThe artillery revolution in Europe caught on during the [[Hundred Years' War]] and changed the way that battles were fought. In the preceding decades, the English had even used a gunpowder-like weapon in military campaigns against the Scottish.<ref>([[Sieges of Stirling Castle]])</ref> However, at this time, the cannons used in battle were very small and not particularly powerful. Cannons were only useful for the defense of a [[castle]], as demonstrated at [[battle of Breteuil|Breteuil]] in 1356, when the besieged English used a cannon to destroy an attacking French assault tower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=T.W.|title=Military Technologies of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nrZqzQs3jMC&lpg=PA242&ots=-yW9XTP66z&dq=Battle%20of%20Breteuil%20cannon&pg=PA242#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=17 November 2017}}</ref> By the end of the 14th century, cannon were only powerful enough to knock in roofs, and could not penetrate castle walls.\n\nHowever, a major change occurred between 1420 and 1430, when artillery became much more powerful and could now batter strongholds and fortresses quite efficiently. The English, French, and Burgundians all advanced in military technology, and as a result the traditional advantage that went to the defense in a siege was lost. The cannon during this period were elongated, and the recipe for gunpowder was improved to make it three times as powerful as before.<ref>{{cite journal\n  |title = The Military Revolutions of the Hundred Years' War\n  |last = Rogers\n  |first = Clifford J.\n  |journal = [[The Journal of Military History]]\n  |issn = 1543-7795\n  |volume = 57\n  |issue = 2\n  |year = 1993\n  |pages = 241\u201378\n  |doi = 10.2307/2944058\n  |jstor = 2944058\n  |via = [[JSTOR]]\n  |registration = y\n}}</ref> These changes led to the increased power in the artillery weapons of the time.\n\n[[File:HGM Pumhart von Steyr.jpg|thumb|left|The Austrian [[Pumhart von Steyr]], the earliest extant [[supergun]].<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidtchen|1977|p=162}}</ref>]]\n[[Joan of Arc]] encountered gunpowder weaponry several times. When she led the French against the English at the Battle of Tourelles, in 1430, she faced heavy gunpowder fortifications, and yet her troops prevailed in that battle. In addition, she led assaults against the English-held towns of Jargeau, Meung, and Beaugency, all with the support of large artillery units.

Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery was not available until the mid-19th century. [[Martin von Wahrendorff]], and [[Joseph Whitworth]] independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s, but it was Armstrong's gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/gabrmetz/gabr001b.htm|title= The Emergence of Modern War}}</ref> The [[cast iron]] shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a [[Mini\u00e9 ball]] and had a thin lead coating which made it fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's [[rifling]] grooves to impart spin to the shell. This spin, together with the elimination of [[British ordnance terms#Windage|windage]] as a result of the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smooth-bore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge.\n\n[[File:ArmstrongRifle.jpg|thumb|right|8-inch Armstrong gun during [[American Civil War]], [[Fort Fisher]], 1865.]]\nHis gun was also a breech-loader. Although attempts at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering problem was that the mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in [[metallurgy]] and [[precision engineering]] capabilities during the [[Industrial Revolution]] that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. The gun combined all the properties that make up an effective artillery piece. The gun was mounted on a carriage in such a way as to return the gun to firing position after the [[recoil]].\n\nWhat made the gun really revolutionary lay in the technique of the construction of the gun barrel that allowed it to withstand much more powerful explosive forces. The \"[[built-up gun|built-up]]\" method involved assembling the barrel with [[wrought-iron]] (later [[mild steel]] was used) tubes of successively smaller diameter.<ref>[http://riv.co.nz/rnza/hist/local/rbl6.htm Armstrong Rifled Breech Loading (RBL) 6-Pounder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220090540/http://riv.co.nz/rnza/hist/local/rbl6.htm |date=February 20, 2002 }}</ref> The tube would then be heated to allow it to expand and fit over the previous tube. When it cooled the gun would contract although not back to its original size, which allowed an even pressure along the walls of the gun which was directed inward against the outward forces that the gun's firing exerted on the barrel.<ref>Holley states that [[Daniel Treadwell]] first patented the concept of a central steel tube kept under compression by wrought-iron coils.. and that Armstrong's assertion that he (Armstrong) first used a wrought-iron A-tube and hence did not infringe the patent, was disingenuous, as the main point in Treadwell's patent was the tension exerted by the wrought-iron coils, which Armstrong used in exactly the same fashion. Holley, Treatise on Ordnance and Armour, 1865, pages 863\u2013870</ref>\n\nAnother innovative feature, more usually associated with 20th-century guns, was what Armstrong called its \"grip\", which was essentially a squeeze [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel and at the same time slightly [[swage]]d down its lead coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.\n\n[[File:Canon de 75 front.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The French [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]], the first modern artillery piece.]]\nArmstrong's system was adopted in 1858, initially for \"special service in the field\" and initially he produced only smaller artillery pieces, 6-pounder (2.5 in/64&nbsp;mm) mountain or light field guns, 9-pounder (3 in/76&nbsp;mm) guns for [[horse artillery]], and [[RBL 12 pounder 8 cwt Armstrong gun|12-pounder (3 inches /76 mm) field guns]].\n\nThe first cannon to contain all 'modern' features is generally considered to be the [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897|French 75]] of 1897.<ref>Chris Bishop, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA137 \"Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897\"], The encyclopedia of weapons of World War II, pg. 137</ref><ref name=roberts>Priscilla Mary Roberts, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TogXVHTlxG4C&pg=PA726 \"French 75 gun\"], World War One, pg. 726</ref> It was the first [[field gun]] to include a [[Hydraulic recoil mechanism|hydro-pneumatic recoil mechanism]], which kept the gun's trail and wheels perfectly still during the firing sequence. Since it did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, the crew could fire as soon as the barrel returned to its resting position. In typical use, the French 75 could deliver fifteen rounds per minute on its target, either [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] or [[Picric acid|melinite]] [[high-explosive]], up to about 5 miles (8,500 m) away. Its firing rate could even reach close to 30 rounds per minute, albeit only for a very short time and with a highly experienced crew. These were rates that contemporary [[bolt action rifle]]s could not match.

In the early 1900s, Goertz in Germany developed an optical sight for azimuth laying. It quickly replaced the lining-plane; in English, it became the 'Dial Sight' (UK) or 'Panoramic Telescope' (US).\n\nThe British halfheartedly experimented with indirect fire techniques since the 1890s, but with the onset of the [[Boer War]], they were the first to apply the theory in practice in 1899, although they had to improvise without a lining-plane sight.<ref name=\"Evolution\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dmYQPNfGFsC&pg=PA30|title=The Evolution of Indirect Fire|author=Frank W.

The result was decreasing accuracy (the increasing distance between the target and the mean point of impact of the shells aimed at it) caused by the increasing effects of non-standard conditions. Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity, zero wind, air temperature and density, and propellant temperature. In practice, this standard combination of conditions almost never existed, they varied throughout the day and day to day, and the greater the time of flight, the greater the inaccuracy. An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide accurate orientation for the guns. Of course, targets had to be accurately located, but by 1916, air photo interpretation techniques enabled this, and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S36048, Frankreich, Arras, Artillerie.jpg|thumb|<center>The German [[15 cm sFH 13|15cm field howitzers]] during [[World War I]]</center>]]In 1914, the methods of correcting firing data for the actual conditions were often convoluted, and the availability of data about actual conditions was rudimentary or non-existent, the assumption was that fire would always be ranged (adjusted). British heavy artillery worked energetically to progressively solve all these problems from late 1914 onwards, and by early 1918, had effective processes in place for both field and heavy artillery. These processes enabled 'map-shooting', later called 'predicted fire'; it meant that effective fire could be delivered against an accurately located target without ranging. Nevertheless, the mean point of impact was still some tens of yards from the target-centre aiming point. It was not precision fire, but it was good enough for concentrations and barrages. These processes remain in use into the 21st Century with refinements to calculations enabled by computers and improved data capture about non-standard conditions.\n\nThe British [[major-general]] [[Henry Hugh Tudor]] pioneered armour and artillery cooperation at the breakthrough [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]].

However, its most important characteristic is the use of indirect fire, whereby the firing equipment is aimed without seeing the target through its sights. Indirect fire emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and was greatly enhanced by the development of [[predicted fire]] methods in World War I.<!--To make indirect fire really effective required telegraph or telephone communication...--> However, indirect fire was area fire; it was and is not suitable for destroying point targets; its primary purpose is area suppression. Nevertheless, by the late 1970s precision-guided munitions started to appear, notably the US 155&nbsp;mm Copperhead and its Soviet 152&nbsp;mm [[Krasnopol (weapon)|Krasnopol]] equivalent that had success in Indian service. These relied on laser designation to 'illuminate'  the target that the shell homed onto. However, in the early 21st Century, the Global Positioning System (GPS) enabled relatively cheap and accurate guidance for shells and missiles, notably the US 155&nbsp;mm Excalibur and the 227&nbsp;mm GMLRS rocket. The introduction of these led to a new issue, the need for very accurate three dimensional target coordinates \u2013 the mensuration process.\n\nWeapons covered by the term 'modern artillery' include \"[[cannon]]\" artillery (such as [[howitzer]], [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and [[field gun]]) and [[rocket artillery]]. Certain smaller-caliber mortars are more properly designated small arms rather than artillery, albeit indirect-fire small arms. This term also came to include [[coastal artillery]] which traditionally defended coastal areas against seaborne attack and controlled the passage of ships. With the advent of powered flight at the start of the 20th century, artillery also included ground-based [[anti-aircraft battery|anti-aircraft batteries]].\n\nThe term \"artillery\" has traditionally not been used for projectiles with internal [[guidance system]]s, preferring the term \"missilery\",{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} though some modern artillery units employ surface-to-surface [[missile]]s. Advances in terminal guidance systems for small munitions has allowed large-caliber guided projectiles to be developed, blurring this distinction.\n\n==Ammunition==\n\nOne of the most important roles of logistics is the supply of [[munition]]s as a primary type of artillery consumable, their storage ([[ammunition dump]], [[arsenal]], [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]]\n) and the provision of fuses, detonators and warheads at the point where artillery troops will assemble the charge, projectile, bomb or shell.\n\nA round of artillery ammunition comprises four components:\n# Fuze\n# Projectile\n# Propellant\n# Primer\n\n===Fuzes===\n{{Commons category|Fuzes}}\n{{Main article|Artillery fuze}}\n[[Fuze (munitions)|Fuzes]] are the devices that initiate an artillery projectile, either to detonate its high explosive (HE) filling or eject its cargo (illuminating flare or smoke canisters being examples). The official military spelling is \"fuze\".<ref>http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Broadly there are four main types:\n*impact (including graze and delay)\n*mechanical time including [[Air burst|airburst]]\n*proximity sensor including airburst<!--proximity has also been used against ground troops & barges...-->\n*electronic time including airburst\n\nMost artillery fuzes are nose fuzes. However, base fuzes have been used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells. At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.\n\nImpact fuzes were, and in some armies remain, the standard fuze for HE projectiles. Their default action is normally 'superquick', some have had a 'graze' action which allows them to penetrate light cover and others have 'delay'. Delay fuzes allow the shell to penetrate the ground before exploding. Armor- or concrete-piercing fuzes are specially hardened. During World War I and later, ricochet fire with delay or graze fuzed HE shells, fired with a flat angle of descent, was used to achieve airburst.\n\nHE shells can be fitted with other fuzes. Airburst fuzes usually have a combined airburst and impact function. However, until the introduction of [[proximity fuze]]s, the airburst function was mostly used with cargo munitions\u2014for example, shrapnel, illumination, and smoke. The larger calibers of [[anti-aircraft]] artillery are almost always used airburst. Airburst fuzes have to have the fuze length (running time) set on them. This is done just before firing using either a wrench or a fuze setter pre-set to the required fuze length.\n\nEarly airburst fuzes used igniferous timers which lasted into the second half of the 20th century. Mechanical time fuzes appeared in the early part of the century. These required a means of powering them. The Thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement (i.e. 'clockwork'), Junghans used [[centrifugal force]] and gears, and Dixi used centrifugal force and balls. From about 1980, electronic time fuzes started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions.\n\nProximity fuzes have been of two types: photo-electric or radar. The former was not very successful and seems only to have been used with British [[anti-aircraft artillery]] 'unrotated projectiles' (rockets) in World War II. Radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical (time) fuzes which they replaced. Mechanical time fuzes required an accurate calculation of their running time, which was affected by non-standard conditions. With HE (requiring a burst 20 to {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the ground), if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high. Accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher.\n\nThe first [[Proximity fuze|radar proximity fuzes]] (codenamed 'VT') were invented by the British and developed by the US and initially used against aircraft in World War II. Their ground use was delayed for fear of the enemy recovering 'blinds' (artillery shells which failed to detonate) and copying the fuze. The first proximity fuzes were designed to detonate about {{convert|30|ft|m}} above the ground. These air-bursts are much more lethal against personnel than ground bursts because they deliver a greater proportion of useful fragments and deliver them into terrain where a prone soldier would be protected from ground bursts.\n\nHowever, proximity fuzes can suffer premature detonation because of the moisture in heavy rain clouds. This led to 'controlled variable time' (CVT) after World War II. These fuzes have a mechanical timer that switched on the radar about 5 seconds before expected impact, they also detonated on impact.\n\nThe proximity fuze emerged on the battlefields of Europe in late December 1944. They have become known as the U.S. Artillery's \"Christmas present\", and were much appreciated when they arrived during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. They were also used to great effect in anti-aircraft projectiles in the Pacific against ''[[kamikaze]]'' as well as in Britain against [[V-1 flying bomb]]s.<ref>[http://scienceservice.si.edu/pages/102001.htm 102.001 \u2013 PROXIMITY FUSE, Science Service Historical Image Collection<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nElectronic multi-function fuzes started to appear around 1980. Using solid-state electronics they were relatively cheap and reliable, and became the standard fitted fuze in operational ammunition stocks in some western armies. The early versions were often limited to proximity airburst, albeit with height of burst options, and impact. Some offered a go/no-go functional test through the fuze setter.\n\nLater versions introduced induction fuze setting and testing instead of physically placing a fuze setter on the fuze. The latest, such as Junghan's DM84U provide options giving, superquick, delay, a choice of proximity heights of burst, time and a choice of foliage penetration depths.\n\nA new type of artillery fuze will appear soon. In addition to other functions these offer some course correction capability, not full precision but sufficient to significantly reduce the dispersion of the shells on the ground.\n\n===Projectiles===\n{{Main article|Shell (projectile)}}\n[[File:Nuclear artillery test Grable Event - Part of Operation Upshot-Knothole.jpg|thumb|Artillery ammunition can also make use of [[nuclear artillery|nuclear warheads]], as seen in [[Upshot-Knothole Grable|this 1953 nuclear test]].]]\nThe projectile is the munition or \"bullet\" fired downrange. This may or may not be an explosive device. Traditionally, projectiles have been classified as \"shot\" or \"shell\", the former being solid and the latter having some form of \"payload\".\n\nShells can also be divided into three configurations: bursting, base ejection or nose ejection. The latter is sometimes called the shrapnel configuration. The most modern is base ejection, which was introduced in World War I. Both base and nose ejection are almost always used with airburst fuzes. Bursting shells use various types of fuze depending on the nature of the payload and the tactical need at the time.\n\nPayloads have included:\n*Bursting: high-explosive, [[white phosphorus]] (\"Willie Pete\" or \"Wilson Picket\"),{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}<!--since when Wilson Pickett? It was \"Willie Pete\" from the phonetic alphabet...--> coloured marker, chemical, nuclear devices; [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) and canister may be considered special types of bursting shell.\n*Base Ejection: dual purpose improved conventional munitions ([[DPICM]])-bomblets, which arm themselves and function after a set number of rotations after having been ejected from the projectile (this produces unexploded sub-munitions, or \"duds\", which remain dangerous), scatterable mines, illuminating, coloured flare, smoke, incendiary, propaganda, chaff<ref>p.266, Browne & Thurbon</ref> (foil to jam radars: originally known as \"window\")<ref>p.262, International\nAeronautic Federation</ref> and modern exotics such as electronic payloads and sensor-fuzed munitions.\n*Nose Ejection: shrapnel, star, incendiary and flechette (a more modern version of shrapnel).\n\n===Stabilization===\n*'''Rifled''' Traditionally, artillery projectiles have been spin-stabilised, meaning that they spin in flight so that [[gyroscopic]] forces prevent them from tumbling. Spin is induced by gun barrels having [[rifling]] which engages a soft metal band around the projectile, called a \"[[driving band]]\" (UK) or \"rotating band\" (U.S.). The driving band is usually made of copper, but synthetic materials have also been used.\n*'''Smoothbore/Fin-Stabilized''' In modern artillery [[smoothbore]] tubes have been used mostly by [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. These projectiles use fins in the airflow at their rear to maintain correct orientation. The primary benefits over rifled barrels is reduced barrel wear, longer ranges that can be achieved (due to the reduced loss of energy to friction and gas escaping around the projectile via the rifling) and larger explosive cores for a given caliber artillery due to less metal needing to be used to form the case of the projectile because of less force applied to the shell from the non-rifled sides of the barrel of smooth bore guns.\n*'''Rifled/Fin-Stabilized''' A combination of the above can be used, where the barrel is rifled, but the projectile also has deployable fins for stabilization,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6779754-fulltext.html |title=Fin-stabilized artillery shell |publisher=patentstorm.us |date=August 24, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209222127/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6779754-fulltext.html |archivedate=February 9, 2008 |df= }}</ref> guidance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/m982-155.htm|title=Excalibur Precision Projectile|publisher=globalsecurity.org}}</ref> or gliding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6748871-fulltext.html |title=Guided artillery missile with extremely long range |publisher=patentstorm.us |date=August 24, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209222122/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6748871-fulltext.html |archivedate=February 9, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Propellant===\n[[File:152 mm howitzer D-20 belong to Military of Iran.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.05|[[152 mm towed gun-howitzer M1955 (D-20)|152 mm howitzer D-20]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].]]\nMost forms of artillery require a [[propellant]] to propel the projectile at the target. Propellant is always a low explosive, this means it [[Deflagration|deflagrates]] instead of [[detonation|detonating]], as with high explosives. The shell is accelerated to a high velocity in a very short time by the rapid generation of gas from the burning propellant. This high pressure is achieved by burning the propellant in a contained area, either the chamber of a gun barrel or the combustion chamber of a [[rocket motor]].\n\nUntil the late 19th century, the only available propellant was [[black powder]]. Black powder had many disadvantages as a propellant; it has relatively low power, requiring large amounts of powder to fire projectiles, and created thick clouds of white smoke that would obscure the targets, betray the positions of guns, and make aiming impossible. In 1846, nitrocellulose (also known as guncotton) was discovered, and the high explosive [[nitroglycerin]] was discovered at much the same time. [[Nitrocellulose]] was significantly more powerful than black powder, and was smokeless. Early guncotton was unstable, however, and burned very fast and hot, leading to greatly increased barrel wear. Widespread introduction of smokeless powder would wait until the advent of the double-base powders, which combine nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin to produce powerful, smokeless, stable propellant.\n\nMany other formulations were developed in the following decades, generally trying to find the optimum characteristics of a good artillery propellant; low temperature, high energy, non-corrosive, highly stable, cheap, and easy to manufacture in large quantities. Broadly, modern gun propellants are divided into three classes: single-base propellants which are mainly or entirely nitrocellulose based, double-base propellants composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, and triple base composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and [[Nitroguanidine]].\n\nArtillery shells fired from a barrel can be assisted to greater range in three ways:\n*[[rocket-assisted projectile]]s (RAP) enhance and sustain the projectile's velocity by providing additional 'push' from a small rocket motor that is part of the projectile's base.\n*[[Base bleed]] uses a small pyrotechnic charge at the base of the projectile to introduce sufficient combustion products into the low-pressure region behind the base of the projectile responsible for a large proportion of the [[Form drag|drag]].\n*ramjet-assisted, similar to rocket-assisted, but using a ramjet instead of a rocket motor; it is anticipated that a ramjet-assisted 120-mm mortar shell could reach a range of {{convert|22|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=McNab|first=Chris |author2=Hunter Keeter|title=Tools of Violence: Guns, Tanks and Dirty Bombs|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2008|page=145 |isbn=1-84603-225-3}}</ref>\n\nPropelling charges for tube artillery can be provided in one of two ways: either as cartridge bags or in metal cartridge cases. Generally, anti-aircraft artillery and smaller-caliber (up to 3\" or 76.2&nbsp;mm) guns use metal cartridge cases that include the round and propellant, similar to a modern rifle cartridge. This simplifies loading and is necessary for very high rates of fire. Bagged propellant allows the amount of powder to be raised or lowered, depending on the range to the target. It also makes handling of larger shells easier. Each requires a totally different type of breech to the other. A metal case holds an integral primer to initiate the propellant and provides the gas seal to prevent the gases leaking out of the breech; this is called obturation. With bagged charges, the breech itself provides obturation and holds the primer. In either case, the primer is usually percussion, but electrical is also used, and [[laser ignition]] is emerging. Modern 155&nbsp;mm guns have a primer magazine fitted to their breech.\n\n[[File:16-in Battleship Ammunition.JPG|thumb|Battleship Ammunition: 16\" artillery shells aboard one of the United States {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s.]]\nArtillery ammunition has four classifications according to use:\n*'''Service:''' ammunition used in [[live fire exercise|live fire training]] or for wartime use in a combat zone. Also known as \"warshot\" ammunition.\n*'''Practice:''' Ammunition with a non- or minimally-explosive projectile that mimics the characteristics (range, accuracy) of live rounds for use under training conditions. Practice artillery ammunition often utilizes a colored-smoke-generating bursting charge for marking purposes in place of the normal high-explosive charge.\n*'''Dummy:''' Ammunition with an inert warhead, inert primer, and no propellant; used for training or display.\n*'''Blank:''' Ammunition with live primer, greatly reduced propellant charge (typically [[black powder]]), and no projectile; used for training, demonstration or ceremonial use.\n\n==Field artillery system==\n{{unreferenced section |date=May 2017}}\n\n[[File:Cyclone-French-320th-artillery-5 Sept-1917-Belgium.jpg|thumb|right|''Cyclone'' of the 320th French Artillery, in [[Hoogstade]], Belgium, September 5, 1917.]]\nBecause field artillery mostly uses [[indirect fire]] the guns have to be part of a system that enables them to attack targets invisible to them in accordance with the combined arms plan.\n\nThe main functions in the field artillery system are:\n*Communications\n*Command: authority to allocate resources;\n*Target acquisition: detect, identify and deduce the location of targets;\n*Control: authority to decide which targets to attack and allot fire units to the attack;\n*Computation of firing data \u2013 to deliver fire from a fire unit onto its target;\n*Fire units: guns, launchers or mortars grouped together;\n*Specialist services: produce data to support the production of accurate firing data;\n*Logistic services: to provide combat supplies, particularly ammunition, and equipment support.\n\nOrganisationally and spatially, these functions can be arranged in many ways. Since the creation of modern indirect fire, different armies have done it differently at different times and in different places. Technology is often a factor, but so are military\u2013social issues, the relationships between artillery and other arms, and the criteria by which military capability, efficiency, and effectiveness are judged. Cost is also an issue because artillery is expensive due to the large quantities of ammunition that it uses and its level of manpower.\n\n'''Communications''' underpin the artillery system, as it must be reliable and available in real-time. During the 20th century communications often used flags, morse code by radio, line and lights (which could include voice and [[teleprinter]], to name a few contrivances). Radio has included HF, VHF, satellite and radio relay as well as modern tactical trunk systems. In western armies radio communications are now usually encrypted.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe emergence of mobile and man-portable radios after World War I had a major impact on artillery because it enabled fast and mobile operations with observers accompanying the infantry or armoured troops. In World War II, some armies fitted their self-propelled guns with radios. However, sometimes in the first half of the 20th century, hardcopy artillery fire plans and map traces were distributed.\n\nData communications can be especially important for artillery because by using structured messages and defined data types fire control messages can be automatically routed and processed by computers. For example, a target acquisition element can send a message with target details which is automatically routed through the tactical and technical fire control elements to deliver firing data to the gun's laying system and the gun automatically laid. As tactical data networks become pervasive, they will provide any connected soldier with a means for reporting target information and requesting artillery fire.\n\n'''Command''' is the authority to allocate resources, typically by assigning artillery formations or units. Terminology and its implications vary widely. However, very broadly, artillery units are assigned in direct support or in general support. Typically, the former mostly provide close support to manoeuvre units, while the latter may provide close support and or depth fire, notably counter-battery. Generally, 'direct support' also means that the artillery unit provides artillery observation and liaison teams to the supported units. Sometimes, direct support units are placed under command of the regiment/brigade they support. General support units may be grouped into artillery formations; for example, brigades, even divisions, or multi-battalion regiments, and usually under command of division, corps, or higher HQs. General support units tend to be moved to where they are most required at any particular time. Artillery command may impose priorities and constraints to support their combined arms commander's plans.\n\n'''Target acquisition''' can take many forms, it is usually observation in real time, but may be the product of analysis. Artillery observation teams are the most common means of target acquisition. However, air observers have been use since the beginning of indirect fire and were quickly joined by air photography. Target acquisition may also be by anyone that can get the information into the artillery system. Targets may be visible to forward troops or in depth and invisible to them.\n\nObservation equipment can vary widely in its complexity.\n*Unmanned air vehicles are the latest form of air observation, having been first introduced in the early 1960s.\n*The equipment available to observation teams has progressed from just prismatic compass, hand-held or tripod mounted binoculars and sometimes optical range-finders.\n*Special equipment for locating hostile artillery: flash spotting and notably [[sound ranging]] appeared in World War I the latter has been undergone increasing refinement as technology has improved. These were joined by radar in World War II.\n*In the mid-1970s several armies started equipping their artillery observation teams with laser rangefinders, ground surveillance radars and night vision devices, these were soon followed by inertial orienting and navigating devices to improve the accuracy of target locations. The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) provided a smaller and cheaper means of quick and accurate fixation for target acquisition devices.\n*Specialised units with ground surveillance radars, unattended ground sensors or observation patrols operating in depth have also been used.\n*Targets in depth may also be 'acquired' by intelligence processes using various sources and agencies such as [[HUMINT]], [[SIGINT]], [[ELINT]] and [[IMINT]].\n*Laser guided shells require laser target designators, usually with observation teams on the ground but UAV installations are possible.\n*Specialised artillery observation vehicles appeared in World War II and have greatly increased in sophistication since that time.\n\n'''Control''', sometimes called tactical fire control, is primarily concerned with 'targeting' and the allotment of fire units to targets. This is vital when a target is within range of many fire units and the number of fire units needed depends on the nature of the target, and the circumstances and purpose of its engagement. Targeting is concerned with selecting the right weapons in the right quantities to achieve the required effects on the target. Allotment attempts to address the artillery dilemma\u2014important targets are rarely urgent and urgent targets are rarely important. Of course importance is a matter of perspective; what is important to a divisional commander is rarely the same as what is important to an infantry platoon commander.\n[[File:August 1984 - captured field guns in Jaji, Paktia.jpg|thumb|Afghans with two captured artillery field guns in Jaji, 1984.]]\nBroadly, there are two situations: fire against opportunity targets, and targets whose engagement is planned as part of a particular operation. In the latter situation, command assigns fire units to the operation and an overall artillery fire planner makes a plan, possibly delegating resources for some parts of it to other planners. Fire plans may also involve use of non-artillery assets, such as mortars and aircraft.\n\nControl of fire against opportunity targets is an important differentiator between different types of artillery system. In some armies, only designated artillery HQs have the tactical fire control authority to order fire units to engage a target, all 'calls for fire' being requests to these HQs. This authority may also extend to deciding the type and quantity of ammunition to be used. In other armies, an 'authorised observer' (for example, artillery observation team or other target acquisition element) can order fire units to engage. In the latter case, a battery observation team can order fire to their own battery and may be authorised to order fire to their own battalion, and sometimes to many battalions. For example, a divisional artillery commander may authorise selected observers to order fire to the entire divisional artillery. When observers or cells are not authorised, they can still request fire.\n\nArmies that apply forward tactical control generally put the majority of the more senior officers of artillery units forward in command observation posts or with the supported arm. Those that do not use this approach tend to put these officers close to the guns. In either case, the observation element usually controls fire in detail against the target, such as adjusting it onto the target, moving it, and coordinating it with the supported arm as necessary to achieve the required effects.\n\n'''Firing data''' has to be calculated and is the key to indirect fire; the arrangements for this have varied widely. Firing data has two components: quadrant elevation and [[azimuth]]; to these may be added the size of propelling charge and the fuze setting. The process to produce firing data is sometimes called technical fire control. Before computers, some armies set the range on the gun's sights, which mechanically corrected it for the gun's muzzle velocity. For the first few decades of indirect fire, firing data were calculated by the observer, who then adjusted the fall of shot onto the target.\n\nThe need to engage targets at night or in depth, or to hit the target with the first rounds, led to predicted fire being quickly developed in World War I. Predicted fire existed alongside the older method. After World War II, predicted methods were invariably applied, but the fall of shot usually needed adjustment because of inaccuracy in locating the target, the proximity of friendly troops, or the need to engage a moving target. Target location errors were significantly reduced once laser rangefinders, orientation, and navigation devices were issued to observation parties.\n\nIn predicted fire, the basic geospatial data of range, angle of sight, and azimuth between a fire unit and its target was produced and corrected for variations from the 'standard conditions'. These variations included barrel wear, propellant temperature and different projectiles weights that all affect the muzzle velocity, and air temperature, density, wind speed & direction, and rotation of the Earth that affect the shell in flight. The net effect of variations can also be determined by shooting at an accurately known point, a process called 'registration'.\n\nAll these calculations to produce a quadrant elevation (or range) and azimuth were done manually using instruments, tablulated, data of the moment, and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the 1960s and 1970s. While some early calculators copied the manual method (typically substituting [[polynomials]] for tabulated data), computers use a different approach. They simulate a shell's trajectory by 'flying' it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step. This simulation is repeated until it produces a quadrant elevation and azimuth that lands the shell within the required 'closing' distance of the target coordinates. \nNATO has a standard ballistic model for computer calculations and has expanded the scope of this into the NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK)<ref>The public NABK Brochure [https://aop37.lsec.dnd.ca/sites/s4_public_info/S4%20Document%20Information/NABK%20brochure.pdf NABK] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706175224/https://aop37.lsec.dnd.ca/sites/s4_public_info/S4%20Document%20Information/NABK%20brochure.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}</ref> within the [[SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4)]].\n\nTechnical fire control has been performed in various places, but mostly in firing batteries. However, in the 1930s, the French moved it to battalion level and combined it with some tactical fire control. This was copied by the US. Nevertheless, most armies seemed to have retained it within firing batteries, and some duplicated the technical fire control teams in a battery to give operational resilience and tactical flexibility. Computers reduced the number of men needed and enabled decentralisation of technical fire control to autonomous sub-battery fire units, such as platoons, troops, or sections, although some armies had sometimes done this with their manual methods. Computation on the gun or launcher, integrated with their laying system, is also possible. [[MLRS]] led the way in this.\n[[File:Artillery Operation Hawthorne.jpg|thumb|155 howitzer [[fire support base]] for [[Operation Hawthorne]], 5th Bn., 27th Arty., 1st Bde., 101st Airborne Div., Vietnam, June 1966]]\n\nA '''fire unit''' is the smallest artillery element, consisting of one or more weapon systems, capable of being employed to execute a fire assigned by a tactical fire controller. Generally it is a battery, but sub-divided batteries are also used. On occasions a battery of 6 guns has been 6 fire units. Fire units may or may not occupy separate positions.\n\n'''Specialist services''' provide data need for predicted fire. Increasingly, they are provided from within firing units. These services include:\n*Survey: accurate fixation and orientation of the guns, historically this involved specialists within field artillery units and specialist units. In some armies mapping and amp supply has also been an artillery responsibility. Survey is also essential for some target acquisition devices. Traditional survey methods of measurement and calculation have been replaced by inertial orientation and navigators and GPS.\n*Meteorological data: historically these were usually divisional level specialist teams but advances in technology mean they are now increasingly part of artillery units.\n*Calibration: periodically establishing the \"normal\" muzzle velocity of each gun as it wears. Originally this involved special facilities and army level teams. Measurement using Doppler radar, introduced in the 1950s, started to simplify arrangements. Some armies now have a muzzle velocity measuring radar permanently fitted to every gun.\n\n===Logistics===\nSupply of artillery ammunition has always been a major component of military logistics. Up until World War I some armies made artillery responsible for all forward ammunition supply because the load of small arms ammunition was trivial compared to artillery. Different armies use different approaches to ammunition supply, which can vary with the nature of operations. Differences include where the logistic service transfers artillery ammunition to artillery, the amount of ammunition carried in units and extent to which stocks are held at unit or battery level. A key difference is whether supply is 'push' or 'pull'. In the former the 'pipeline' keeps pushing ammunition into formations or units at a defined rate. In the latter units fire as tactically necessary and replenish to maintain or reach their authorised holding (which can vary), so the logistic system has to be able to cope with surge and slack.\n\n==Classification of artillery==\nArtillery types can be categorised in several ways, for example by type or size of weapon or ordnance, by role or by organizational arrangements.\n\n===Types of ordnance===\nThe types of cannon artillery are generally distinguished by the velocity at which they fire projectiles.\nTypes of artillery:\n[[File:PzH2000.Ger.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Army]] [[PzH 2000]] self-propelled artillery]]\n*Heavy artillery: capable of firing a long distance to bombard its target. \n*[[Field artillery]]: mobile weapons used to support armies in the field. Subcategories include:\n**[[infantry support gun]]s: directly support infantry units.\n**[[mountain gun]]s: lightweight weapons that can be moved through difficult terrain.\n**[[field gun]]s: capable of long range fire.\n**[[howitzer]]s: capable of high angle fire, they are most often employed for [[indirect-fire]].\n**[[gun howitzer]]s: capable of high or low angle fire with a long barrel.\n**[[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]: typically short-barreled, high-trajectory weapons designed primarily for an indirect-fire role.\n**[[anti-tank artillery]]: weapons, usually mobile, designed for attacking tanks.\n**[[anti-aircraft artillery]]: weapons, usually mobile, designed for attacking aircraft from the ground. Some guns were suitable for dual-role anti-aircraft and field (anti-tank) use. The World War II German [[88 mm gun]] was a famous example.\n**[[rocket artillery]]: rocket-launched instead of shot or shell.\n*[[Railway gun]]: large-caliber weapons that are mounted on, transported by and fired from specially-designed railway wagons.\n[[File:MuseeMarine-canonBronze-p1000434.jpg|thumb|Naval cannon, early 19th century]]\n*[[Naval artillery]]: guns mounted on warships and used either against other ships or in support of ground forces. The crowning achievement of naval artillery was the [[battleship]], but the advent of airpower and missiles have rendered this type of artillery largely obsolete. They are typically longer-barreled, low-trajectory, high-velocity weapons designed primarily for a direct-fire role.\n*[[Coastal artillery]]: Fixed-position weapons dedicated to defense of a particular location, usually a coast (for example, the [[Atlantic Wall]] in World War II) or harbor. Not needing to be mobile, coastal artillery used to be much larger than equivalent field artillery pieces, giving them longer range and more destructive power. Modern coastal artillery (for example, Russia's [[130 mm coastal defense gun A-222|\"Bereg\"]] system) is often self-propelled, (allowing it to avoid [[counter-battery fire]]) and fully integrated, meaning that each battery has all of the support systems that it requires (maintenance, targeting radar, etc.) organic to its unit.\n\nModern field artillery can also be split into two other subcategories: towed and [[Self-propelled artillery|self-propelled]]. As the name suggests, [[Field artillery|towed artillery]] has a prime mover, usually an [[artillery tractor]] or truck, to move the piece, crew, and ammunition around. Towed artillery is in some cases equipped with an [[Auxiliary power unit|APU]] for small displacements. Self-propelled artillery is permanently mounted on a carriage or vehicle with room for the crew and ammunition and is thus capable of moving quickly from one firing position to another, both to support the fluid nature of modern combat and to avoid counter-battery fire. It includes mortar carrier vehicles, many of which allow the mortar to be removed from the vehicle and be used dismounted, potentially in terrain in which the vehicle cannot navigate, or in order to avoid detection.\n\n===Organizational types===\nAt the beginning of the modern artillery period, the late 19th century, many armies had three main types of artillery, in some case they were sub-branches within the artillery branch in others they were separate branches or corps. There were also other types excluding the armament fitted to warships:\n[[File:70 mm horse artillery (cropped).jpg|thumb|Horse-drawn artillery.]]\n[[File:Skoda 70 mm field gun pulled by men (cropped).jpg|thumb|Man-pulled artillery.]]\n[[File:Gasmasked artillerymen.jpg|thumb|Australian gunners, wearing [[gas mask]]s, operate a [[BL 9.2 inch Howitzer|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on}} howitzer]] during World War I.]]\n*[[Horse artillery]], first formed as regular units in the late 18th century, with the role of supporting cavalry, they were distinguished by the entire crew being mounted.\n*[[Field artillery|Field or \"foot\" artillery]], the main artillery arm of the field army, using either guns, howitzers or mortars. In World War II this branch again started using [[rocket artillery|rockets]] and later surface to surface missiles.\n*Fortress or garrison artillery, manned a nation's fixed defences using guns, howitzers or mortars, either on land or coastal frontiers. Some had deployable elements to provide heavy artillery to the field army. In some nations [[Coastal artillery|coast defence artillery]] was a naval responsibility.\n*[[mountain gun|Mountain artillery]], a few nations treated mountain artillery as a separate branch, in others it was a speciality in another artillery branch. They used light guns or howitzers, usually designed for pack animal transport and easily broken down into small easily handled loads\n*Naval artillery, some nations carried pack artillery on some warships, these were used and manhandled by naval (or marine) landing parties. At times, part of a ship's armament would be unshipped and mated to makeshift carriages and limbers for actions ashore, for example during the [[Second Boer War]], during the First World War the guns from the stricken [[SMS K\u00f6nigsberg (1905)|SMS ''K\u00f6nigsberg'']] formed the main artillery strength of the German forces in East Africa.\n[[File:Tir.jpg|thumb|Firing of an 18-pound gun, [[Louis-Philippe Crepin]], (1772\u20131851)]]\nAfter World War I many nations merged these different artillery branches, in some cases keeping some as sub-branches. Naval artillery disappeared apart from that belonging to marines. However, two new branches of artillery emerged during that war and its aftermath, both used specialised guns (and a few rockets) and used direct not indirect fire, in the 1950s and 1960s both started to make extensive use of missiles:\n*Anti-tank artillery, also under various organisational arrangements but typically either field artillery or a specialist branch and additional elements integral to infantry, etc., units. However, in most armies field and anti-aircraft artillery also had at least a secondary anti-tank role. After World War II anti-tank in Western armies became mostly the responsibility of infantry and armoured branches and ceased to be an artillery matter, with some exceptions.\n*[[Anti-aircraft artillery]], under various organisational arrangements including being part of artillery, a separate corps, even a separate service or being split between army for the field and airforce for home defence. In some cases infantry and the new armoured corps also operated their own integral light anti-aircraft artillery. Home defence anti-aircraft artillery often used fixed as well as mobile mountings. Some anti-aircraft guns could also be used as field or anti-tank artillery, providing they had suitable sights.\n\nHowever, the general switch by artillery to indirect fire before and during World War I led to a reaction in some armies. The result was accompanying or infantry guns. These were usually small, short range guns, that could be easily man-handled and used mostly for direct fire but some could use indirect fire. Some were operated by the artillery branch but under command of the supported unit. In World War II they were joined by self-propelled assault guns, although other armies adopted infantry or close support tanks in armoured branch units for the same purpose, subsequently tanks generally took on the accompanying role.\n\n===Equipment types===\n[[File:Artillery gun crew-illustration.jpeg|right|thumb|Continental Artillery crew from the [[American Revolution]] handling a cannon.]]\nThe three main types of artillery \"gun\" are guns, howitzers and [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. During the 20th century, guns and howitzers have steadily merged in artillery use, making a distinction between the terms somewhat meaningless. By the end of the 20th century, true guns with calibers larger than about 60&nbsp;mm had become very rare in artillery use, the main users being tanks, ships, and a few residual anti-aircraft and coastal guns. The term \"cannon\" is a United States generic term that includes guns, howitzers and mortars; it is not used in other English speaking armies.\n\nThe traditional definitions differentiated between guns and howitzers in terms of maximum elevation (well less than 45\u00b0 as opposed to close to or greater than 45\u00b0), number of charges (one or more than one charge), and having higher or lower muzzle velocity, sometimes indicated by barrel length. These three criteria give eight possible combinations, of which guns and howitzers are but two. However, modern \"howitzers\" have higher velocities and longer barrels than the equivalent \"guns\" of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nTrue guns are characterized by long range, having a maximum elevation significantly less than 45\u00b0, a high muzzle velocity and hence a relatively long barrel, smooth bore (no rifling) and a single charge. The latter often led to fixed ammunition where the projectile is locked to the cartridge case. There is no generally accepted minimum muzzle velocity or barrel length associated with a gun. [[File:60 pounder Cape Helles June 1915.jpg|thumb|A British 60-pounder ({{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}}) gun at full recoil, in action during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], 1915. Photo by [[Ernest Brooks (photographer)|Ernest Brooks]].]]\n\nHowitzers can fire at maximum elevations at least close to 45\u00b0; elevations up to about 70\u00b0 are normal for modern howitzers. Howitzers also have a choice of charges, meaning that the same elevation angle of fire will achieve a different range depending on the charge used. They have rifled bores, lower muzzle velocities and shorter barrels than equivalent guns. All this means they can deliver fire with a steep angle of descent. Because of their multi-charge capability, their ammunition is mostly separate loading (the projectile and propellant are loaded separately).\n\nThat leaves six combinations of the three criteria, some of which have been termed [[gun howitzers]]. A term first used in the 1930s when howitzers with a relatively high maximum muzzle velocities were introduced, it never became widely accepted, most armies electing to widen the definition of \"gun\" or \"howitzer\". By the 1960s, most equipments had maximum elevations up to about 70\u00b0, were multi-charge, had quite high maximum muzzle velocities and relatively long barrels.\n\n[[mortar (weapon)|Mortars]] are simpler. The modern mortar originated in World War I and there were several patterns. After that war, most mortars settled on the Stokes pattern, characterized by a short barrel, smooth bore, low muzzle velocity, elevation angle of firing generally greater than 45\u00b0, and a very simple and light mounting using a \"baseplate\" on the ground. The projectile with its integral propelling charge was dropped down the barrel from the muzzle to hit a fixed firing pin. Since that time, a few mortars have become rifled and adopted breech loading.\n\nThere are other recognized typifying characteristics for artillery. One such characteristic is the type of obturation used to seal the chamber and prevent gases escaping through the breech. This may use a metal cartridge case that also holds the propelling charge, a configuration called \"QF\" or \"quickfiring\" by some nations. The alternative does not use a metal cartridge case, the propellant being merely bagged or in combustible cases with the breech itself providing all the sealing. This is called \"BL\" or \"breech loading\" by some nations.\n\nA second characteristic is the form of propulsion. Modern equipment can either be towed or self-propelled (SP). A towed gun fires from the ground and any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield. Towing by horse teams lasted throughout World War II in some armies, but others were fully mechanized with wheeled or tracked gun towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war. The size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry.\n\nA variation of towed is portee, where the vehicle carries the gun which is dismounted for firing. Mortars are often carried this way. A mortar is sometimes carried in an armored vehicle and can either fire from it or be dismounted to fire from the ground. Since the early 1960s it has been possible to carry lighter towed guns and most mortars by helicopter. Even before that, they were parachuted or landed by glider from the time of the first airborne trials in the USSR in the 1930s.\n\nIn an SP equipment, the gun is an integral part of the vehicle that carries it. SPs first appeared during World War I, but did not really develop until World War II. They are mostly tracked vehicles, but wheeled SPs started to appear in the 1970s. Some SPs have no armor and carry little or no ammunition. Armoured SPs usually carry a useful ammunition load. Early armoured SPs were mostly a \"casemate\" configuration, in essence an open top armored box offering only limited traverse. However, most modern armored SPs have a full enclosed armored turret, usually giving full traverse for the gun. Many SPs cannot fire without deploying stabilizers or spades, sometimes hydraulic. A few SPs are designed so that the recoil forces of the gun are transferred directly onto the ground through a baseplate. A few towed guns have been given limited self-propulsion by means of an auxiliary engine.\n\nTwo other forms of tactical propulsion were used in the first half of the 20th century: Railways or transporting the equipment by road, as two or three separate loads, with disassembly and re-assembly at the beginning and end of the journey. [[Railway gun|Railway artillery]] took two forms, railway mountings for heavy and super-heavy guns and howitzers and armored trains as \"fighting vehicles\" armed with light artillery in a direct fire role. Disassembled transport was also used with heavy and super heavy weapons and lasted into the 1950s.\n\n===Caliber categories===\nA third form of artillery typing is to classify it as \"light\", \"medium\", \"heavy\" and various other terms. It appears to have been introduced in World War I, which spawned a very wide array of artillery in all sorts of sizes so a simple categorical system was needed. Some armies defined these categories by bands of calibers. Different bands were used for different types of weapons\u2014field guns, mortars, anti-aircraft guns and coast guns.\n\n==Modern operations==\n[[File:AMX AuF1, 40e r\u00e9giment d'artillerie, Implementation Force, 1996.jpg|thumb|Two French Army Giat [[GCT 155mm]] (155&nbsp;mm AUF1) Self-propelled Guns, 40th Regiment d' Artillerie, with IFOR markings are parked at Hekon base, near Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, in support of Operation Joint Endeavor.]]\n\nList of countries in order of amount of artillery:<ref>Hackett, James, (ed.), ''The Military Balance 2010'', The International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2010; Note: Only conventional tube ordnance is given, in use with land forces</ref>\n\n# Russia \u2013 26,121<ref>Hackett, James, (ed.), ''The Military Balance 2010'', The International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2010, p.223; Note: the number given is for Land Forces only.

The general role of artillery is to provide ''fire support''\u2014\"the application of fire, coordinated with the manoeuvre of forces to destroy, ''neutralize'' or ''suppress'' the enemy\". This NATO definition, of course, makes artillery a supporting arm although not all NATO armies agree with this logic. The ''italicised'' terms are NATO's.<ref>AAP-6(2006) NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions.</ref>\n\nUnlike rockets, guns (or howitzers as some armies still call them) and mortars are suitable for delivering ''close supporting fire''. However, they are all suitable for providing ''deep supporting fire'' although the limited range of many mortars tends to exclude them from the role. Their control arrangements and limited range also mean that mortars are most suited to ''direct supporting fire''. Guns are used either for this or ''general supporting fire'' while rockets are mostly used for the latter. However, lighter rockets may be used for direct fire support. These rules of thumb apply to NATO armies.\n\nModern [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]], because of their lighter weight and simpler, more transportable design, are usually an integral part of [[infantry]] and, in some armies, [[armor]] units. This means they generally do not have to ''concentrate'' their fire so their shorter range is not a disadvantage. Some armies also consider infantry operated mortars to be more responsive than artillery, but this is a function of the control arrangements and not the case in all armies. However, mortars have always been used by artillery units and remain with them in many armies, including a few in NATO.\n\nIn NATO armies artillery is usually assigned a tactical mission that establishes its relationship and responsibilities to the formation or units it is assigned to. It seems that not all NATO nations use the terms and outside NATO others are probably used. The standard terms are: ''direct support'', ''general support'', ''general support reinforcing'' and ''reinforcing''. These tactical missions are in the context of the command authority: ''operational command'', ''operational control'', ''tactical command'' or ''tactical control''.\n\nIn NATO direct support generally means that the directly supporting artillery unit provides observers and liaison to the manoeuvre troops being supported, typically an artillery battalion or equivalent is assigned to a brigade and its batteries to the brigade's battalions. However, some armies achieve this by placing the assigned artillery units under command of the directly supported formation. Nevertheless, the batteries' fire can be ''concentrated'' onto a single target, as can the fire of units in range and with the other tactical missions.\n\n===Application of fire===\n[[File:155fire.jpg|right|thumb|A 155&nbsp;mm artillery shell fired by a United States [[11th Marine Regiment]] [[M198 howitzer|M-198]] [[howitzer]]]]\nThere are several dimensions to this subject. The first is the notion that fire may be against an ''opportunity'' target or may be ''prearranged''. If it is the latter it may be either ''on-call'' or ''scheduled''. Prearranged targets may be part of a ''fire plan''. Fire may be either ''observed'' or ''unobserved'', if the former it may be ''adjusted'', if the latter then it has to be ''[[predicted fire|predicted]]''. Observation of adjusted fire may be directly by a forward observer or indirectly via some other ''target acquisition'' system.\n\nNATO also recognises several different types of fire support for tactical purposes:\n*''[[Counterbattery fire]]'': delivered for the purpose of destroying or ''neutralizing'' the enemy's fire support system.\n*''Counterpreparation fire'': intensive prearranged fire delivered when the imminence of the enemy attack is discovered.\n*''Covering fire'': used to protect troops when they are within range of enemy small arms.\n*''Defensive fire'': delivered by supporting units to assist and protect a unit engaged in a defensive action.\n*''Final Protective Fire'': an immediately available prearranged barrier of fire designed to impede enemy movement across defensive lines or areas.\n*''[[Harassing fire]]'': a random number of shells are fired at random intervals, without any pattern to it that the enemy can predict. This process is designed to hinder enemy forces' movement, and, by the constantly imposed stress, threat of losses and inability of enemy forces to relax or sleep, lowers their morale.\n*''Interdiction fire'': placed on an area or point to prevent the enemy from using the area or point.\n*''Preparation fire'': delivered before an attack to weaken the enemy position.\n\nThese purposes have existed for most of the 20th century, although their definitions have evolved and will continue to do so, lack of ''suppression'' in ''counterbattery'' is an omission. Broadly they can be defined as either:\n*''Deep supporting fire'': directed at objectives not in the immediate vicinity of own force, for neutralizing or destroying enemy reserves and weapons, and interfering with enemy command, supply, communications and observation; or\n*''Close supporting fire'': placed on enemy troops, weapons or positions which, because of their proximity present the most immediate and serious threat to the supported unit.\n[[File:Gun5a.jpg|thumb|[[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[M198 howitzer|M-198]] firing outside of [[Fallujah]], Iraq in 2004]]\nTwo other NATO terms also need definition:\n*''Neutralization fire'': delivered to render a target temporarily ineffective or unusable; and\n*''Suppression fire'': that degrades the performance of a target below the level needed to fulfill its mission. Suppression is usually only effective for the duration of the fire.\n\nThe tactical purposes also include various \"mission verbs\", a rapidly expanding subject with the modern concept of \"effects based operations\".\n\n''Targeting'' is the process of selecting target and matching the appropriate response to them taking account of operational requirements and capabilities. It requires consideration of the type of fire support required and the extent of coordination with the supported arm. It involves decisions about:\n*what effects are required, for example, ''neutralization'' or ''suppression'';\n*the proximity of and risks to own troops or non-combatants;\n*what types of munitions, including their fuzing, are to be used and in what quantities;\n*when the targets should be attacked and possibly for how long;\n*what methods should be used, for example, ''converged'' or ''distributed'', whether adjustment is permissible or surprise essential, the need for special procedures such as precision or danger close\n*how many fire units are needed and which ones they should be from those that are available (in range, with the required munitions type and quantity, not allotted to another target, have the most suitable line of fire if there is a risk to own troops or non-combatants);\n\nThe ''targeting'' process is the key aspect of tactical fire control. Depending on the circumstances and national procedures it may all be undertaken in one place or may be distributed. In armies practicing control from the front, most of the process may be undertaken by a forward observer or other target acquirer. This is particularly the case for a smaller target requiring only a few fire units. The extent to which the process is formal or informal and makes use of computer based systems, documented norms or experience and judgement also varies widely armies and other circumstances.\n\nSurprise may be essential or irrelevant. It depends on what effects are required and whether or not the target is likely to move or quickly improve its protective posture. During World War II UK researchers concluded that for impact fuzed munitions the relative risk were as follows:\n*men standing \u2013 1\n*men lying \u2013 1/3\n*men firing from trenches \u2013 1/15\u20131/50\n*men crouching in trenches \u2013 1/25\u20131/100\nAirburst munitions significantly increase the relative risk for lying men, etc. Historically most casualties occur in the first 10\u201315 seconds of fire, i.e. the time needed to react and improve protective posture, however, this is less relevant if airburst is used.\n\nThere are several ways of making best use of this brief window of maximum vulnerability:\n*ordering the guns to fire together, either by executive order or by a \"fire at\" time. The disadvantage is that if the fire is ''concentrated'' from many dispersed ''fire units'' then there will be different times of flight and the first rounds will be spread in time. To some extent a large concentration offsets the problem because it may mean that only one round is required from each gun and most of these could arrive in the 15 second window.\n*burst fire, a rate of fire to deliver three rounds from each gun within 10 or 15 seconds, this reduces the number of guns and hence fire units needed, which means they may be less dispersed and have less variation in their times of flight. Smaller caliber guns, such as 105&nbsp;mm, have always been able to deliver three rounds in 15 seconds, larger calibers firing fixed rounds could also do it but it wasn't until the 1970s that a multi-charge 155&nbsp;mm howitzer, [[FH-70]] first gained the capability.\n*multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI), where a single weapon or multiple individual weapons fire multiple rounds at differing trajectories so that all rounds arrive on target at the same time.\n*''time on target'', fire units fire at the time less their time of flight, this works well with prearranged scheduled fire but is less satisfactory for opportunity targets because it means delaying the delivery of fire by selecting a 'safe' time that all or most fire units can achieve. It can be used with both the previous two methods.\n\n===Counter-battery fire===\n{{Main article|Counter-battery fire}}\nModern counter-battery fire developed in [[World War I]], with the objective of defeating the enemy's artillery. Typically such fire was used to suppress enemy batteries when they were or were about to interfere with the activities of friendly forces (such as to prevent enemy defensive artillery fire against an impending attack) or to systematically destroy enemy guns. In World War I the latter required air observation. The first indirect counter-battery fire was in May 1900 by an observer in a balloon.\n\nEnemy artillery can be detected in two ways, either by direct observation of the guns from the air or by ground observers (including specialist reconnaissance), or from their firing signatures. This includes radars tracking the shells in flight to determine their place of origin, sound ranging detecting guns firing and resecting their position from pairs of microphones or cross-observation of gun flashes using observation by human observers or opto-electronic devices, although the widespread adoption of 'flashless' propellant limited the effectiveness of the latter.\n\nOnce hostile batteries have been detected they may be engaged immediately by friendly artillery or later at an optimum time, depending on the tactical situation and the counter-battery policy. Air strike is another option. In some situations the task is to locate all active enemy batteries for attack using a counter-battery fire at the appropriate moment in accordance with a plan developed by artillery intelligence staff. In other situations counter-battery fire may occur whenever a battery is located with sufficient accuracy.\n\nModern counter-battery target acquisition uses unmanned aircraft, [[counter-battery radar]], ground reconnaissance and sound-ranging. Counter-battery fire may be adjusted by some of the systems, for example the operator of an unmanned aircraft can 'follow' a battery if it moves. Defensive measures by batteries include frequently changing position or constructing defensive earthworks, the tunnels used by North Korea being an extreme example. Counter-measures include air defence against aircraft and attacking counter-battery radars physically and electronically.\n\n[[File:PzH2000Munition.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Modern artillery ammunition. Caliber 155&nbsp;mm as used by the [[PzH 2000]]]]\n\n===Field artillery team===\n{{Main article|Field artillery team}}\n'Field Artillery Team' is a US term and the following description and terminology applies to the US, other armies are broadly similar but differ in significant details. Modern field artillery (post\u2013World War I) has three distinct parts: the [[forward observer]] (or FO), the [[fire direction center]] (FDC) and the actual guns themselves. The forward observer observes the target using tools such as [[binoculars]], [[laser rangefinder]]s, designators and call back fire missions on his radio, or relays the data through a portable computer via an encrypted digital radio connection protected from jamming by computerized frequency hopping. A lesser known part of the team is the FAS or Field Artillery Survey team which setups up the \"Gun Line\" for the cannons. Today most artillery battalions use a(n) \"Aiming Circle\" which allows for faster setup and more mobility. FAS teams are still used for checks and balances purposes and if a gun battery has issues with the \"Aiming Circle\" a FAS team will do it for them.\n\nThe FO can communicate directly with the battery FDC, of which there is one per each [[Artillery battery|battery]] of 4\u20138 guns. Otherwise the several FOs communicate with a higher FDC such as at a Battalion level, and the higher FDC prioritizes the targets and allocates fires to individual batteries as needed to engage the targets that are spotted by the FOs or to perform preplanned fires.\n\nThe Battery FDC computes firing data\u2014ammunition to be used, powder charge, fuse settings, the direction to the target, and the quadrant elevation to be fired at to reach the target, what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target, and the number of rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately located\u2014to the guns. Traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting, direction, and the elevation needed to reach the target, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). However, in more advanced artillery units, this data is relayed through a digital radio link.\n\nOther parts of the field artillery team include meteorological analysis to determine the temperature, humidity and pressure of the air and wind direction and speed at different altitudes. Also radar is used both for determining the location of enemy artillery and mortar batteries and to determine the precise actual strike points of rounds fired by battery and comparing that location with what was expected to compute a registration allowing future rounds to be fired with much greater accuracy.\n\n=== Time on Target ===\nA technique called Time on Target was developed by the British Army in North Africa at the end of 1941 and early 1942 particularly for counter-battery fire and other concentrations, it proved very popular. It relied on BBC time signals to enable officers to synchronize their watches to the second because this avoided the need to use military radio networks and the possibility of losing surprise, and the need for field telephone networks in the desert.<ref>The Development of Artillery Tactics and Equipment, Brigadier AL Pemberton, 1950, The War Office, pg 129</ref> With this technique the time of flight from each fire unit (battery or troop) to the target is taken from the range or firing tables, or the computer and each engaging fire unit subtracts its time of flight from the TOT to determine the time to fire. An executive order to fire is given to all guns in the fire unit at the correct moment to fire. When each fire unit fires their rounds at their individual firing time all the opening rounds will reach the target area almost simultaneously. This is especially effective when combined with techniques that allow fires for effect to be made without preliminary adjusting fires.\n\n===MRSI===\n[[File:MRSI-trajectories.svg|thumb|Illustration of different trajectories used in MRSI: For any muzzle velocity there is a steeper (> 45\u00b0, solid line) and a lower (<45\u00b0, dashed line) trajectory. On these different trajectories, the shells have different flight times.]]\n{{MRSI_animation_SMIL.svg}}\nA modern version of the earlier \"[[time on target]]\" is a concept in which fire from different weapons was timed to arrive on target at the same time. It is possible for artillery to fire several shells per gun at a target and have all of them arrive simultaneously, which is called MRSI (Multiple Rounds Simultaneous Impact). This is because there is more than one trajectory for the rounds to fly to any given target: typically one is below 45 degrees from horizontal and the other is above it, and by using different size propelling charges with each shell, it is possible to create multiple trajectories. Because the higher trajectories cause the shells to arc higher into the air, they take longer to reach the target and so if the shells are fired on these trajectories for the first volleys (starting with the shell with the most propellant and working down) and then after the correct pause more volleys are fired on the lower trajectories, the shells will all arrive at the same time. This is useful because many more shells can land on the target with no warning. With traditional volleys along the same trajectory, anybody at the target area may have time (however long it takes to reload and re-fire the guns) to take cover between volleys. However, guns capable of burst fire can deliver several rounds in 10 seconds if they use the same firing data for each, and if guns in more than one location are firing on one target they can use Time on Target procedures so that all their shells arrive at the same time and target.\n\nTo engage targets using MRSI requires two things, firstly guns with the requisite rate of fire and sufficiently different size propelling charges, secondly a fire control computer that has been designed to compute such missions and the data handling capability that allows all the firing data to be produced, sent to each gun and then presented to the gun commander in the correct order. The number of rounds that can be delivered in MRSI depends primarily on the range to the target and the rate of fire, for maximum rounds the range is limited to that of lowest propelling charge that will reach the target.\n\nExamples of guns with a rate of fire that makes them suitable for MRSI includes UK's [[AS-90]], South Africa's [[Denel G6]]-52 (which can land six rounds simultaneously at targets at least {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} away), Germany's [[Panzerhaubitze 2000]] (which can land five rounds simultaneously at targets at least {{convert|17|km|0|abbr=on}} away), and Slovakia's [[155mm SpGH ZUZANA|155&nbsp;mm SpGH ZUZANA model 2000]]. The [[ARCHER Artillery System|Archer project]] (developed by BAE-Systems in Sweden) is a 155&nbsp;mm howitzer on a wheeled chassis which is claimed to be able to deliver up to six shells on target simultaneously from the same gun. The 120&nbsp;mm twin barrel [[AMOS]] mortar system, joint developed by [[H\u00e4gglunds]] (Sweden) and [[Patria (company)|Patria]] (Finland),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.patriahagglunds.fi/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404172145/http://www.patriahagglunds.fi/ |archive-date=April 4, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> is capable of 7 + 7 shells MRSI. The United States [[XM2001 Crusader|Crusader]] program (now cancelled) was slated to have MRSI capability. It is unclear how many fire control computers have the necessary capabilities.\n\nTwo-round MRSI firings were a popular artillery demonstration in the 1960s, where well trained detachments could show off their skills for spectators.\n\n===Air burst===\n{{Main article|Air burst}}\nThe destructiveness of artillery bombardments can be enhanced when some or all of the shells are set for airburst, meaning that they explode in the air above the target instead of upon impact. This can be accomplished either through time [[Fuze (explosives)|fuzes]] or [[proximity fuze]]s. Time fuses use a precise timer to detonate the shell after a preset delay. This technique is tricky and slight variations in the functioning of the fuse can cause it to explode too high and be ineffective, or to strike the ground instead of exploding above it. Since December 1944 ([[Battle of the Bulge]]), proximity fuzed artillery shells have been available that take the guesswork out of this process. These embody a miniature, low powered [[radar]] transmitter in the fuse to detect the ground and explode them at a predetermined height above it. The return of the weak radar signal completes an electrical circuit in the fuze which explodes the shell. The proximity fuse itself was developed by the British to increase the effectiveness of [[anti-aircraft warfare]].\n\nThis is a very effective tactic against infantry and light vehicles, because it scatters the [[fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] of the shell over a larger area and prevents it from being blocked by terrain or entrenchments that do not include some form of robust overhead cover. Combined with TOT or MRSI tactics that give no warning of the incoming rounds, these rounds are especially devastating because many enemy soldiers are likely to be caught in the open. This is even more so if the attack is launched against an assembly area or troops moving in the open rather than a unit in an entrenched tactical position.\n\n==Use in monuments==\n{{Main article|War memorial}}\n[[File:Tupelo NBS Monument.jpg|thumb|An artillery piece in the monument commemorating the 1864  [[Battle of Tupelo]] ([[American Civil War]]).]]\n\nNumerous [[war memorial]]s around the world incorporate an artillery piece which had been used in the specific war or battle commemorated.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n\n* [[List of artillery]]\n* [[Indirect fire]]\n* [[Advanced Gun System]]\n* [[Aiming point]]\n* [[Artillery battery]]\n* [[Artillery fuze]]\n* [[Artillery museums]]\n* [[Barrage (artillery)]]\n* [[Beehive anti-personnel round]]\n* [[Combustion light-gas gun]]\n* [[Cordite]]\n* [[Counter-battery fire]]\n* [[Counter-battery radar]]\n* [[Fuze]]\n* [[Project Babylon]]\n* [[Gun laying]]\n* [[Howitzer]]\n* [[Light-gas gun]]\n* [[Naval artillery]]\n* [[Nuclear artillery]]\n* [[Paris Gun]]\n* [[Railgun]]\n* [[Coilgun]]\n* [[Shell (projectile)]]\n* [[Shoot-and-scoot]]\n* [[Shrapnel shell]]\n* [[Sound ranging]]\n* [[Suppressive fire]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* TM 9-2300\n*{{Cite book|last= Holmes|first= Richard|title= The World Atlas of Warfare: Military Innovations that Changed the Course of History|year= 1988|publisher= [[Viking Press|Viking Studio Books]]|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-670-81967-6|oclc= 17840438}}\n*{{Cite book|last= McCamley|first= N J|title= Disasters Underground|year= 2004|location= [[Barnsley]]|isbn= 978-1-84415-022-9|oclc= 53241739|publisher= [[Pen and Sword Books|Pen & Sword Military]]}}\n*{{Cite journal|last= McNaughton|first= Andrew|authorlink= Andrew McNaughton|title= The Development of Artillery in the Great War|journal= Canadian Defence Quarterly|volume= 6|issue= 2|date=January 1929}}\n*{{Cite journal|last= Ordway|first= Frederick I|title= History of Astronautics Symposium: Mar Del Plata, Argentina, October 1969|journal= Technology and Culture|volume= 11|issue= 3|date=July 1970|issn= 0040-165X}}\n*{{Cite book|last1= Browne|first1= J P R|last2= Thurbon|first2= M T|title= Electronic Warfare|year= 1998|series= Brassey's air power, v. 4|publisher= Brassey's|location= London|isbn= 978-1-85753-133-6|oclc= 38292289}}\n*{{Cite journal|author= International Aeronautic Federation|journal= Interavia|page= 262|volume= 32|date=January\u2013June 1977|publisher= Interavia SA|location= Geneva|issn= 0020-5168}}\n*{{Cite journal|last= Schmidtchen|first= Volker|title= Riesengesch\u00fctze des 15.

After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married, before 861, a daughter of that same Count Ernst, who died after 8 August 879.

Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own Duke. Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the [[March of Carinthia]], a part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]].\n\n===Regional ruler===\nAfter King Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, [[Louis the Younger]] inherited Bavaria, [[Charles the Fat]] was given the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman. However, Bavaria was more or less ruled by Arnulf.<ref>Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.)

Cambridge University Press: 2003. pg. 135</ref> The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 after Carloman's death.\n\nWhen [[Engelschalk II]] of Pannonia in 882 rebelled against [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]], [[March of Pannonia|Margrave of Pannonia]] and ignited the [[Wilhelminer War]], Arnulf supported him and accepted his and his brother's homage. This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle the Emperor and put him at war with [[Svatopluk of Moravia]]. [[Pannonia]] was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers. Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time Moravian ruler was loyal to the emperor. Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes at succeeding Charles the Fat.\n\n==King of East Francia==\nArnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]]. With the support of the Frankish nobles, Arnulf called a [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Trebur|Tribur]] and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 78\">Comyn, pg. 78</ref><ref name=\"Mann III, pg. 376\">Mann III, pg. 376</ref> Charles peacefully agreed to this involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf granted him,<ref>Duckett, pg. 12</ref> on which to live out his final months.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the [[Slavs]], was then elected king by the nobles of East Francia (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish Empire).<ref>Comyn, pg. 80</ref> [[West Francia]], the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] and the Kingdom of Italy at this point elected their own kings from the Carolingian family.\n\nLike all early Germanic rulers, he was heavily involved in [[ecclesiastical]] disputes. In 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the [[Episcopal see]]s of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]] over jurisdictional authority, which saw [[Hamburg-Bremen|Bremen and Hamburg]] remain a combined see, independent of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|see of Cologne]].<ref>Mann IV, pg. 66</ref>\n\nArnulf was a fighter, not a negotiator.

Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when [[Duchy of Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal state. An accord was reached between him and [[Duke of Bohemia]] [[Borivoj I of Bohemia|Borivoj I]] (reigned 870-95). Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of Frankish invasion. In 893 or 894 Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory \u2014 present-day Western [[Hungary]] \u2014 to him. As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf's [[chancellor]] in 892.<ref>Mann, III, pg. 244</ref> In his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf reached out to [[Magyars]] who had settled in [[Pannonia]], and with their help he imposed a measure of control over Moravia.<ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 83\">Comyn, pg. 83</ref><ref name=\"Comyn, pg. 83\">Comyn, pg. 83</ref><ref>Mann IV, pg. 13</ref>\n\n==King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor==\n[[File:Arnulf Korutansk\u00fd.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Arnulf of Carinthia, 13c picture]]\n[[File:Johann Jakob Jung Ludwig das Kind und Arnulf von K\u00e4rnten.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Arnulf of Carinthia and [[Louis the Child]] by [[Johann Jakob Jung]] (19th century).]]\nIn Italy [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar of Friuli]] fought over the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was then crowned in 889. While [[Pope Stephen V]] supported Guy, even crowning him [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar.<ref>Mann III, pg. 378</ref>\n\nIn 893 the new [[Pope Formosus]], not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and his son [[Lambert II of Spoleto]], sent an embassy to [[Omuntesberch]], where Arnulf was meeting with [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]],<ref>Mann III, pg. 379</ref> to request that Arnulf come and liberate [[Italy]],<ref>Mann IV, pg. 50</ref> where he would be crowned emperor in [[Rome]]. Arnulf met the ''Primores'' of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to assist the pope.<ref name=\"Mann IV, pg. 51\">Mann IV, pg. 51</ref> Arnulf then sent his son [[Zwentibold]] with a Bavarian army to join [[Berengar of Friuli]]. They defeated Guy, but were bought off and left in autumn.\n\nWhen pope Formosus again asked Arnulf to invade, the duke personally led an army across the [[Alps]] early in 894. In January 894 [[Bergamo]] fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy's representative in the city, was hung from a tree by the city's gates.<ref name=\"Duckett, pg. 22\" /> Conquering all of the territory north of the [[Po River]], Arnulf forced the surrender of [[Milan]] and then drove Guy out of [[Pavia]], where he was crowned [[King of Italy]].<ref name=\"Bryce, pg. xxxv\" /> Arnulf went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and a fever incapacitated his troops.<ref name=\"Mann IV, pg. 51\">Mann IV, pg. 51</ref> His march northward through the [[Alps]] was interrupted by [[Rudolph I of Burgundy]], and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range.<ref name=\"Duckett, pg. 22\">Duckett, pg. 22</ref> In retaliation, Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] to ravage Rudolph's kingdom.<ref name=\"Duckett, pg. 22\">Duckett, pg. 22</ref> In the meantime, Lambert and his mother [[Ageltrude]] travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but when pope Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, refused, he was imprisoned in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].\n\nIn September 895 a new papal embassy arrived in [[Regensburg]] beseeching Arnulf's aid.

Berliners often call it simply '''''Alex''''', referring to a larger neighbourhood stretching from ''Mollstra\u00dfe'' in the northeast to ''Spandauer Stra\u00dfe'' and the [[Rotes Rathaus]] in the southwest.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alexanderplatz 1796.jpg|thumb|left|Alexanderplatz in 1796]]\n[[File:Alexanderplatz 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Alexanderplatz in 1912]]\n[[File:BVG KT4D mod.JPG|thumb|left|Tram passing the [[World Clock (Alexanderplatz)|World Clock]]]]\n[[File:Alexander Platz.jpg|thumb|Alexander Platz]]\n\n===Early history===\nOriginally a cattle market outside the city fortifications, it was named in honor of a visit of the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] to Berlin on 25 October 1805 by order of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]]. The square gained a prominent role in the late 19th century with the construction of the [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]] station of the same name and a nearby market hall, followed by the opening of a department store of [[Hermann Tietz]] in 1904, becoming a major commercial centre. The [[Berlin U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] station of the present-day [[U2 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U2]] line opened on 1 July 1913.\n\nIts heyday was in the 1920s, when together with [[Potsdamer Platz]] it was at the heart of Berlin's [[Nightlife (activity)|nightlife]], inspiring the 1929 novel ''[[Berlin Alexanderplatz]]'' (see [[1920s Berlin]]) and the two [[film]]s based thereon, Piel Jutzi's 1931 film and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]]'s 15\u00bd hour [[Berlin Alexanderplatz (television)|second adaptation]], released in 1980. About 1920 the city's authorities started a rearrangement of the increasing traffic flows laying out a roundabout, accompanied by two buildings along the Stadtbahn viaduct, ''Alexanderhaus'' and ''Berolinahaus'' finished in 1932 according to plans designed by [[Peter Behrens]].\n\n===East Germany===\n[[File:Press Cafe in East Berlin on Alexanderplatz, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|The Press Cafe in 1977. The mural displaying the Marxist view of the press has been covered over by commercial advertising.]]\n[[Image:Berlin - Fernsehturm - 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|The Fernsehturm Berlin seen from a distance]]\n\nAlexanderplatz has been subject to redevelopment several times in its history, most recently during the 1960s, when it was turned into a pedestrian zone and enlarged as part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]'s redevelopment of the city centre. It is surrounded by several notable structures including the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV Tower), the second tallest structure in the [[European Union]].\n\n===After German reunification===\n\n{{Update|section|date=December 2017}}\n\nEver since [[German reunification]], Alexanderplatz has undergone a gradual process of change with many of the surrounding buildings being renovated. Despite the reconstruction of the [[Berlin Stra\u00dfenbahn|tram]] line crossing, it has retained its socialist character, including the much-[[graffiti]]ed \"Fountain of Friendship between Peoples\" (''Brunnen der V\u00f6lkerfreundschaft''), a popular venue.\n\nIn 1993, architect [[Hans Kollhoff]]'s master plan for a major redevelopment including the construction of several skyscrapers was published.<ref name=\"bloomberg1\">Dalia Fahmy (May 27, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-26/25-years-after-communism-eyesores-spur-landmark-debate.html \"25 Years After Communism, Eyesores Spur Landmark Debate\"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> Due to a lack of demand it is unlikely these will be constructed, with the exception (announced January 2014) of a 39-storey residential tower designed by Frank Gehry on which work is expected to begin in 2015. However, beginning with the reconstruction of the ''[[Metro AG|Kaufhof]]'' department store in 2004, and the biggest underground railway station of Berlin, some buildings will be redesigned and new structures built on the square's south-eastern side. Sidewalks were expanded to shrink one of the avenues, a new underground garage was built, and commuter tunnels meant to keep pedestrians off the streets were removed.<ref name=\"bloomberg1\"/> The surrounding buildings now house chain stores, fast-food restaurants, and fashion discounters.<ref name=\"bloomberg1\"/> The ''Alexa'' shopping mall, with approximately 180 stores opened nearby during 2007 and a large ''Saturn'' electronic store was built and is open on Alexanderplatz since 2008. The CUBIX [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema, which opened in November 2000, joined in 2007 the team of [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] cinemas and the festival is showing films on three of its screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/programm/spielst_tten/kinos/index.html|title=Berlinale venues|website=berlinale.de|accessdate=17 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nMany historic buildings are located in the vicinity of Alexanderplatz. The traditional seat of city government, the [[Rotes Rathaus]], or ''Red City Hall'',  is located nearby, as was the former East German parliament building, the [[Palast der Republik]], demolition of which began in February 2006 and has been completed. The reconstruction of the Baroque [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] near Alexanderplatz has been in planning for several years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,594515,00.html|title=The New Palace: Neo-Baroque in Berlin|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2018|via=Spiegel Online}}</ref>\n\nAlexanderplatz is also the name of the [[Berlin Alexanderplatz railway station|S-Bahn]] and [[Alexanderplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|U-Bahn]] stations there. It is one of Berlin's largest and most important transportation hubs, being a meetingplace of three subway (U-Bahn) lines, three S-Bahn lines, and many tram and bus lines, as well as regional trains.\n\nIt also accommodates the [[Park Inn Berlin]] and the [[World Clock (Alexanderplatz)|World Time Clock]], a continually rotating installation that shows the time throughout the globe, and [[Hermann Henselmann]]'s ''Haus des Lehrers''. During the [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989, the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] on 4 November was the largest demonstration in the history of East Germany.\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200\" mode=packed-hover>\nFile:Der Alexanderplatz um 1908.jpg|Alexanderplatz, 1908 (l-r :Lehrervereinshaus, Polizeipr\u00e4sidium, Aschinger)\nFile:Weltzeituhr.jpg|The [[World Clock (Alexanderplatz)|World Clock]] with the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] in the background\nFile:Bahnhof Berlin-Alexanderplatz.jpg|[[Berlin Alexanderplatz station|Bahnhof Alexanderplatz]]\nFile:Berlin Alexanderplatz - Alexanderhaus 1.jpg|Alexanderhaus\nFile:Project-blinkenlights-aerial-view.jpg|Project Blinkenlights\nFile:Die mitte Alexanderplatz IMGP1725.jpg|''Die Mitte'' shopping mall\nFile:Apstatue.jpg|[[Neptunbrunnen]]\nFile:Alexplatz1.jpg|Tram at Alexanderplatz\nFile:Alexanderplatz 01.jpg|[[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] on \"Alex\"\nFile:Urania-Weltzeituhr auf dem Alexanderplatz in Berlin 2015 Weitwinkel.jpg|The [[World Clock (Alexanderplatz)|World Clock]] and [[Park Inn Berlin|Park Inn]] hotel in the background\nFile:Reloj Mundial, Berl\u00edn, Alemania, 2016-04-22, DD 46-48 HDR.jpg|Night view of the [[World Clock (Alexanderplatz)|World Clock]]\nFile:Berlin Alexanderplatz abend.JPG|Bahnhof Alexanderplatz and the Fernsehturm\nFile:Berlin TV tower reflection.jpg|[[Park Inn Berlin|Park Inn]] with a reflection from the [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]].\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Weszkalnys, Gisa (2010).

A year later, Japanese Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]] announced that Japan intended to sponsor the establishment of a regional development fund with resources largely from Japan and other industrial countries. But the US did not warm to the plan and the concept was shelved. See full account in  \"[https://www.adb.org/publications/50-years-adb Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank],\" July 2017.\n\nThe idea came up again late in 1962 when Kaoru Ohashi, an economist from a research institute in Tokyo, visited [[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]], then a private financial consultant in Tokyo, and proposed a study group to form a development bank for the Asian region. The group met regularly in 1963, examining various scenarios for setting up a new institution and drew on Watanabe\u2019s experiences with the [[World Bank]]. However, the idea received a cool reception from the World Bank itself and the study group became discouraged.\n\nIn parallel, the concept was formally proposed at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai economist, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \"The first parliament of Asia\" pp.&nbsp;65). Despite an initial mixed reaction, support for the establishment of a new bank soon grew.\n\nAn expert group was convened to study the idea, with Japan invited to contribute to the group. When Watanabe was recommended, the two streams proposing a new bank\u2014from ECAFE and Japan\u2014came together. Initially, the US was on the fence, not opposing the idea but not ready to commit financial support. But a new bank for Asia was soon seen to fit in with a broader program of assistance to Asia planned by U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the wake of the escalating US military support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nAs a key player in the concept, Japan hoped that the ADB offices would be in Tokyo. However, eight other cities had also expressed an interest\u2014Bangkok, Colombo, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, and Tehran. To decide, the 18 prospective regional members of the new bank held three rounds of votes at a ministerial conference in Manila in November/December 1965. In the first round on 30 November, Tokyo failed to win a majority, so a second ballet was held the next day at noon. Although Japan was in the lead, it was still inconclusive, so a final vote was held after lunch. In the third poll, Tokyo gained eight votes to Manila\u2019s nine, with one abstention. Therefore, Manila was declared the host of the new development bank. The Japanese were mystified and deeply disappointed. Watanabe later wrote in his personal history of ADB: \"I felt as if the child I had so carefully reared had been taken away to a distant country.\" (Asian Development Bank publication, \"Towards a New Asia\", 1977, p.&nbsp;16)\n\nAs intensive work took place during 1966 to prepare for the opening of the new bank in Manila, high on the agenda was choice of president. Japanese Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sato]]  asked Watanabe to be a candidate. Although he initially declined, pressure came from other countries and Watanabe agreed. In the absence of any other candidates, Watanabe was elected first President of the Asian Development Bank at its Inaugural Meeting on 24 November 1966.\n\nBy the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.<ref name=\"admin\">{{Cite web|title = ADB History|url = http://www.adb.org/about/history|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}</ref>\n\nEarly loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nWatanabe served as the first ADB president to 1972.<ref name=\"KapurLewis\">{{cite book|author1=Devesh Kapur|author2=John Prior Lewis|author3=Richard Charles Webb|title=The World Bank: Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suOGRlBoPgQC&pg=PA304|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-2014-9|pages=304\u2013|date=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Magill2014\">{{cite book|author=Frank N.

The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in [[Bangladesh]], and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972\u201376) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976\u201381) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981\u201390), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan \u2013 a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including [[avian influenza]] and HIV/[[AIDS]]. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global economic crisis]]. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening [[income gap]] that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with [[Myanmar]] in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR).  The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion by 2020 \u2014 50% more than the previous level.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n==Objectives and activities==\n\n===Aim===\nThe ADB defines itself as a [[social development]] organization that is dedicated to reducing [[poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive [[economic growth]], environmentally [[sustainable growth]], and [[regional integration]]. This is carried out through [[investment]]s \u2013 in the form of loans, grants and information sharing \u2013 in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of [[climate change]] or better [[natural resource management|manage their natural resources]], as well as other areas.\n\n===Focus areas===\nEighty percent of ADB\u2019s lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Core Operational Areas|url = http://www.adb.org/about/core-operational-areas|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* [[Education]] \u2013 Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high marks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three decades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Education|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/education/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management \u2013 [[Environmental sustainability]] is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/environment/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Finance Sector Development \u2013 The financial system is the lifeline of a country\u2019s economy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit the poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market development, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.This has been a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)since 2002. One of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade finance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all of Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Finance Sector Development|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/finance/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Infrastructure, including transport<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable Transport for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/transport/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and communications,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Information and Communications Technology|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/ict/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> energy,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Energy|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/energy/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> water supply and sanitation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Water for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/water/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and urban development.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Urban Development|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/urban-development/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Regional Cooperation and Integration \u2013 Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) was introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as a long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national economies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regional Cooperation and Integration|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/regional-cooperation/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Private Sector Lending \u2013 This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the insistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true priority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a seasoned American banker \u2013 Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest financing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume. As noted earlier, this culminated in the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which was adopted by the Board in March 2008.\n\n==Financings==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;float:right;\"\n|+Five largest borrowing countries<ref name=AFS2016>{{cite web |title=Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis and Annual Financial Statements |date=31 December 2016 |publisher=Asian Development Bank |url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/237881/adb-financial-report-2016.pdf}}</ref>\n!rowspan=\"2\" |Country !!colspan=\"2\"|2016 !!colspan=\"2\"| 2015\n|-\n!$ million !!% !!$ million !!%\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flag|China}} ||15,615 ||24.8 ||14,646 ||25.2\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flag|India}} ||13,331 ||21.2 ||12,916 ||22.2\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flag|Indonesia}} ||8,700 ||13.8 ||8,214 ||14.1\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flag|Philippines}} ||5,935 ||9.4 || 5,525 ||9.5\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flag|Pakistan}} ||4,570 ||7.3 ||4,319 ||7.4\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Others ||14,831 ||23.5 ||12,486 ||21.6\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Total ||62,983 ||100.0 ||58,106 ||100.0\n|}\n\nThe ADB offers \"hard\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \"[[Soft loan|soft\" loans]] with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region.

Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\n\n==List of 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power==\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.<ref name=\"adb.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/158032/oi-appendix1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Members, Capital Stock, and Voting Power |date=December 2014|publisher=adb.org}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ The 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank\n!

Navigation to the delta was possible from this location without encountering a barrier.\n\nThe [[stone quarries of ancient Egypt]] located here were celebrated for their stone, and especially for the granitic rock called Syenite. They furnished the colossal statues, [[obelisk]]s, and monolithal shrines that are found throughout Egypt, including the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]; and the traces of the quarrymen who worked in these 3,000 years ago are still visible in the native rock. They lie on either bank of the [[Nile]], and a road, {{convert|6.5|km|abbr=on}} in length, was cut beside them from Syene to [[Philae]].\n\nSwenett was equally important as a military station as a place of traffic. Under every dynasty it was a garrison town; and here tolls and customs were levied on all boats passing southwards and northwards. Around 330, the legion stationed here received a bishop from [[Alexandria]]; this later became the [[Coptic Diocese of Syene]].<ref>Dijkstra, J. Harm F.

They believed that it was seated immediately under the [[Tropic of Cancer|tropic]], and that on the day of the [[summer solstice]], a vertical staff cast no shadow. They noted that the sun's disc was reflected in a well at noon. This statement is only approximately correct; at the summer solstice, the shadow was only {{frac|400}} of the staff, and so could scarcely be discerned, and the northern limb of the Sun's disc would be nearly vertical.\nHowever, [[Eratosthenes]] used this information together with measurements of the shadow length on the solstice at [[Alexandria]] to perform the first known calculation of the [[circumference]] of the Earth.\n\nThe [[Nile]] is nearly {{convert|650|m|mi|abbr=on}} wide above Aswan. From this frontier town to the northern extremity of Egypt, the river flows for more than {{convert|1200|km|abbr=on}} without bar or cataract. The voyage from Aswan to Alexandria usually took 21 to 28 days in favourable weather.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}\n\nAswan has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') like the rest of Egypt. Aswan and [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]] have the hottest summer days of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Aswan is one of the hottest, sunniest and driest cities in the world. Average high temperatures are consistently above {{convert|40|\u00b0C|1}} during summer (June, July, August and also September) while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|25|\u00b0C|1}}. Summers are long, prolonged and extremely hot. Average high temperatures remain above {{convert|23|\u00b0C|1}} during the coldest month of the year while average low temperatures remain above {{convert|8|\u00b0C|1}}. Winters are short, brief and extremely warm. Wintertime is very pleasant and enjoyable while summertime is unbearably hot with blazing sunshine although desert heat is dry.\n\nThe climate of Aswan is extremely dry year-round, with less than {{convert|1|mm|0|abbr=on}} of average annual precipitation.

After a time spent in the marshes nearby, she was rescued and taken to a \"certain impregnable fortress,\" likely the fortified town of [[Canossa Castle]] near [[Reggio nell'Emilia|Reggio]].<ref>Odilo of Cluny, ''Epitaph of Adelheid'' ch. 3, in Gilsdorf, ''Queenship and Sanctity'', 131</ref> She managed to send an emissary to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and asked the [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king for his protection. The widow met Otto at the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] capital of [[Pavia]] and they married in 951.<ref>''Burgundy and Provence, 879\u20131032'', Constance Brittain Bouchard,'''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 342.</ref> [[Pope John&nbsp;XII]] crowned Otto [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Rome]] on February 2, 962, and, breaking tradition, also crowned Adelaide as [[List of Holy Roman Empresses|Holy Roman Empress]].<ref>''The Ottonians as kings and emperors'', Eckhard M\u00fcller-Mertens, '''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 251.</ref>\n\nIn Germany, the crushing of a revolt in 953 by [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]], Otto's son by his first marriage, cemented Adelaide's position, for she retained all her dower lands. She and their eleven-year-old son, [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], accompanied Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where Otto restored the newly elected [[Pope John XIII]] to his throne (and executed some of the Roman rioters who had deposed him). Adelaide remained in Rome for six years while Otto ruled his kingdom from Italy. Their son Otto II was crowned co-emperor in 967, then married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]] in April 972, resolving the conflict between the two empires in southern Italy, as well as ensuring the imperial succession. Adelaide and her husband then returned to Germany, where Otto died in May 973, at the same [[Memleben]] palace where his father had died 37 years earlier.\n\n===Regency===\nIn 983, her son Otto II died and was succeeded by her grandson Otto III under the regency of his mother Adelaide's daughter-in-law Dowager Empress Theophanu. When Theophanu died in 990, Adelaide assumed regency on behalf of her grandson the Emperor until he reached legal majority four years later. Adelaide resigned as regent when Otho III was declared of legal majority in 995. \n\nAdelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots [[Majolus]] and [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. She retired to a nunnery she had founded in c.&nbsp;991 at [[Selz Abbey|Selz]] in [[Alsace]].<ref>\"[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-adelaide-of-burgundy Saint Adelaide of Burgundy]\".

She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the [[early Slavs|Slavs]].

Formally announced in 1969 and first flying in October 1972, it holds the distinction of being the world's first twin-engined widebody airliner; it was also the first product of [[Airbus|Airbus Industrie]], a [[consortium]] of European [[aerospace manufacturer]]s, now known as [[Airbus]]. The A300 can typically seat 266 passengers in a [[Travel class|two-class layout]], with a maximum [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of {{Convert|4070|nmi|km|lk=on}} when fully loaded, depending on model.\n\nDevelopment of the A300 began during the 1960s as a [[Europe]]an collaborative project between various aircraft manufacturers in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[West Germany]]. In September 1967, the participating nations signed a Memorandum of Understanding to manufacture the aircraft. The British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969. A new agreement was reached between Germany and France on 29 May 1969, and Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce the A300. The type first flew on 28 October 1972.\n\n[[Air France]], the launch customer for the A300, introduced the type into service on 30 May 1974. Following a period of limited customer demand, the A300 achieved several large sales in 1978, after which the type was viewed to have proven itself and orders came in at a steady rate across the next three decades. During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with various freight operators, and several different [[cargo aircraft]] variants were produced. Production of the A300 ceased in July 2007, along with its smaller [[Airbus A310|A310]] derivative. The freighter sales for which the A300 had previously competed in later life are instead fulfilled by the A330-200F, a derivative of the newer [[Airbus A330]].<ref name=fi_20060314>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-aims-to-fill-freighter-void-with-a330-derivative-205407/|title=Airbus aims to fill freighter void with A330 derivative|publisher=[[Flight International]]|date=14 March 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nDuring the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as [[Hawker Siddeley]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], based in the UK, and [[Sud Aviation]] of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine of the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] and an expanded development of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] [[BAC One-Eleven]] designated the [[BAC Three-Eleven|BAC Two-Eleven]], it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch quite similar aircraft onto the market at the same time, none of them would achieve the volume sales needed to make them viable.<ref name=\"early days\">[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/ \"Early days (1967\u20131969).\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195621/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/ |date=5 July 2011 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.</ref> In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10 and 20 per cent higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which in turn was due to the fractured European market.

Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the [[Airbus Beluga|A300-600ST Beluga]], a oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities.<ref name = \"airbus launch\"/> The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller [[Airbus A310]].<ref name = \"tech lead\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Air France Airbus A300B2 1974 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air France]] A300B2 at [[Farnborough Airshow]] in 1974]]\n\nOn 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for [[Air France]].<ref name = \"simon 39\"/><ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/>\n\nImmediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product&nbsp;\u2013 notably Air France and [[Lufthansa]], the first two airlines to place orders for the type.<ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/><ref>Bowen 2010, pp. 50\u201352.</ref> Following the appointment of [[Bernard Lathi\u00e8re]] as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. [[Indian Airlines]] was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of \"whitetail\" A300s&nbsp;\u2013 completed but unsold aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely.<ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/>\n\nDuring the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with [[Korean Air]] on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'.<ref name = \"airbus 30\"/><ref name=\"Champagne and Drought\">[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/champagneand-drought-1973-1977/ \"Champagne&nbsp;... and drought (1973\u20131977).\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401100121/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/champagneand-drought-1973-1977/ |date=1 April 2015 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.</ref><ref name = \"nor wag 23\">Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 23.</ref>\n\nIt was becoming clear that the whole concept of a short haul widebody was flawed. Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. The supposed widebody comfort which it was assumed passengers would demand was illusory. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the [[Boeing 737]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]]. The savior of the A300 was the advent of [[ETOPS|Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS)]], a revised [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner.\n\nIn 1977, US carrier [[Eastern Air Lines]] leased four A300s as an in-service trial.<ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/> Frank Borman, ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|Tristars]] and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]].<ref name = \"airbus 30\"/><ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/><ref name = \"simon 40\"/> Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well.<ref name = \"bowen 52\"/> The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft.<ref name=\"Airbus_Deliveries\"/>\n\nIn December 1977, [[AeroC\u00f3ndor]] [[Colombia]] became the first [[Airbus]] operator in [[Latin America]], leasing one Airbus A300, named \"Ciudad de Barranquilla\".\n\nDuring the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called '[[Silk Road]]' strategy, targeting airlines in the [[Far East]].<ref name= \"Champagne and Drought\"/><ref name = \"bowen 52\">Bowen 2010, p. 52.</ref> As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by [[Japan Air System]], [[Korean Air]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[China Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Indian Airlines]], [[Trans Australia Airlines]] and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA [[ETOPS|60-minutes rule]] for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[South China Sea]].\n\n[[File:M4H00496.theora.ogv|thumb|[[China Eastern Airlines]] A300B4-600R cabin in-flight]]\n\nIn 1977, the A300B4 became the first [[ETOPS]] compliant aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing. In 1982 [[Garuda Indonesia]] became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines. Alarmed by the success of the A300, Boeing responded with the new [[Boeing 767]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1989, Chinese operator [[China Eastern Airlines]] received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time.

He was the brother of the more famous [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]] and cousin of [[Lodovico Carracci]].\n\nHe posited the ideal in nature, and was the founder of the competing school to the more gritty view of nature as expressed by [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] along with his brother, Annibale Carracci, and cousin, Ludovico Carracci. The academy helped propel painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|School of Bologna]] to prominence.\n\n==Life==\nAgostino Carracci was born in [[Bologna]], and trained at the workshop of the architect Domenico Tibaldi. Starting from 1574 he worked as a reproductive [[engraver]], copying works of 16th century masters such as [[Federico Barocci]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Antonio Campi]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Correggio]]. He also produced some original prints, including two [[etching]]s.\n\nHe travelled to [[Venice]] (1582, 1587\u20131589) and [[Parma]] (1586\u20131587). Together with Annibale and Ludovico he worked in Bologna on the fresco cycles in [[Palazzo Fava]] (''Histories of Jason and Medea'', 1584) and [[Palazzo Magnani, Bologna|Palazzo Magnani]] (''Histories of [[Romulus]]'', 1590\u20131592). In 1592 he also painted the ''Communion of St. Jerome'', now in the [[Pinacoteca di Bologna]] and considered his masterwork. From 1586 is his altarpiece of the ''Madonna with Child and Saints'', in the National Gallery of [[Parma]].  In 1598 Carracci joined his brother Annibale in Rome, to collaborate on the decoration of the Gallery in [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Palazzo Farnese]]. From 1598\u20131600 is a ''triple Portrait'', now in [[Naples]], an example of genre painting.  In 1600 he was called to Parma by Duke [[Ranuccio I Farnese]] to begin the decoration of the Palazzo del Giardino, but he died before it was finished.\n\nAgostino's son [[Antonio Marziale Carracci|Antonio Carracci]] was also a painter, and attempted to compete with his father's Academy.\n\nAn engraving by Agostino Carraci after the painting ''Love in the Golden Age'' by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Paolo Fiammingo]] was the inspiration for [[Matisse]]'s ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (Joy of Life).<ref>Thomas Puttfarken, \"Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and 'gli Amori de' Carracci\", ''The Burlington Magazine'', 124 (Apr. 1982): 203\u2013208.</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*''Head of a Faun in a Concave'' (drawing in roundel, c. 1595, National Gallery of Art, Washington DC)\n*''The Penitent Magdalen'' (private collection)\n*''The Annunciation'', Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&idNotice=18809|title=Louvre Museum Official Website|work=louvre.fr}}</ref>\n*''The Lamentation'', Hermitage, St. Petersburg<ref>http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/fcgi-bin/db2www/quickSearch.mac/gallery?selLang=English&tmCond=Carracci+Agostino{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*''Reciprico Amore'', Baltimore Museum of Art<ref>{{cite journal |title=Matisse and Agostino Carracci: A Source for the 'Bonheur de Vivre'|first=James B. |last=Cuno|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=122|issue=928 |date=July 1980 |pages=503\u2013505 |jstor=880057}}</ref>\n*[[Erotic art of Agostino Carracci|Carracci's erotic work]]\n*''Piet\u00e0'', 1973, [[Muscarelle Museum of Art]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]<ref name=\"Piet\u00e0\">{{cite web | author= | year=2018 | title=Piet\u00e0, (engraving). | work=In the Light of Caravaggio: Dutch and Flemish Paintings from Southeastern Museums | publisher=[[Muscarelle Museum of Art]] | url=https://proficio.campus.wm.edu/RediscoveryProficioPublicSearch/ShowItem.aspx?5625+ | accessdate=20 Jun 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/13424 ''Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi''], a fully digitized exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, which contains material on Agostino Carracci (see index)\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03374c.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'': Carracci]\n\n{{Annibale Carracci|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carracci, Agostino}}\n[[Category:1557 births]]\n[[Category:1602 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian male painters]]\n[[Category:17th-century Italian painters]]\n[[Category:Italian Baroque painters]]\n[[Category:Bolognese painters]]\n[[Category:Italian printmakers]]\n[[Category:Italian erotic artists]]", "sha1": "m8ziodwmtd672ppsngs7ab5xt1abtoe"}}, {"title": "Ayatollah Khomeini", "ns": "0", "id": "2527", "redirect": {"title": "Ruhollah Khomeini"}, "revision": {"id": "783846472", "parentid": "176514719", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T01:19:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from alternative name}}\n}}", "sha1": "7eqr8okad7gbrjxqsg5tc0v61vznko3"}}, {"title": "Adenylyl cyclase", "ns": "0", "id": "2528", "revision": {"id": "866599763", "parentid": "865757727", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T10:34:11Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2A02:1810:9531:B300:8D8E:8151:52D2:3743"}, "comment": "grammatical error: All classes of adenylyl cyclase(s)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2007}}\n{{enzyme\n| Name = Adenylyl cyclase\n| EC_number = 4.6.1.1\n| CAS_number = 9012-42-4\n| IUBMB_EC_number = 4/6/1/1\n| GO_code = 0008294\n| image = 1sk6.jpg\n| width = 270\n| caption = Adenylate cyclase (calmodulin sensitive) trimer, Bacillus anthracis<br>\nEpinephrine binds its receptor, that associates with a heterotrimeric G protein.

PDB-101.</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Adenylyl cyclase''' ({{EC number|4.6.1.1}}, also commonly known as '''adenyl cyclase''' and '''adenylate cyclase''', abbreviated '''AC''') is an [[enzyme]] with key regulatory roles in essentially all [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. It is the most [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] known enzyme: six distinct classes have been described, all [[catalysis|catalyzing]] the same reaction but representing unrelated [[gene]] [[Gene family|families]] with no known [[Sequence homology|sequence or structural homology]].{{Cn|date=September 2018}} The best known class of adenylyl cyclases is class III or AC-III (Roman numerals are used for classes). AC-III occurs widely in [[eukaryote]]s and has important roles in many human [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].\n\nAll classes of adenylyl cyclase [[Catalysis|catalyse]] the conversion of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|3',5'-cyclic AMP]] (cAMP) and [[pyrophosphate]]. [[Magnesium]] [[ion]]s are generally required and appears to be closely involved in the enzymatic mechanism. The cAMP produced by AC then serves as a regulatory signal via specific cAMP-binding [[protein]]s, either [[transcription factor]]s, enzymes (e.g., cAMP-dependent [[kinase]]s), or ion [[membrane transport proteins|transporters]].\n\n[[Image:adenylate kinase.png|thumb|500px|center|Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[cyclic AMP|3',5'-cyclic AMP]]]]\n\n== Classes ==\n\n=== Class I ===\nThe first class of adenylyl cyclases occur in many bacteria including ''E. coli''. This was the first class of AC to be characterized. It was observed that ''E. coli'' deprived of glucose produce cAMP that serves as an internal signal to activate expression of genes for importing and metabolizing other sugars. cAMP exerts this effect by binding the transcription factor [[cAMP receptor protein|CRP]], also known as CAP. Class I AC's are large cytosolic enzymes (~100&nbsp;kDa) with a large regulatory domain (~50&nbsp;kDa) that indirectly senses glucose levels. {{as of|2012}}, no crystal structure is available for class I AC.\n\n=== Class II ===\nThese adenylyl cyclases are toxins secreted by pathogenic bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'' and ''Bordetella pertussis'' during infection. These bacteria also secrete proteins that enable the AC-II to enter host cells, where the exogenous AC activity undermines normal cellular processes. The genes for Class II AC's are known as [[cyaA]]. Several crystal structures are known for AC-II enzymes.\n\n=== Class III ===\nThese adenylyl cyclases are the most familiar based on extensive study due to their important roles in human health. They are also found in some bacteria, notably ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' where they appear to have a key role in pathogenesis. Most AC-III's are integral membrane proteins involved in transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses. A Nobel Prize was awarded to Earl Sutherland in 1971 for discovering the key role of AC-III in human liver, where adrenaline indirectly stimulates AC to mobilize stored energy in the \"fight or flight\" response. The effect of adrenaline is via a [[G protein]] signaling cascade, which transmits chemical signals from outside the cell across the membrane to the inside of the cell ([[cytoplasm]]). The outside signal (in this case, adrenaline) binds to a receptor, which transmits a signal to the G protein, which transmits a signal to adenylyl cyclase, which transmits a signal by converting [[adenosine triphosphate]] to [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]] (cAMP). cAMP is known as a [[second messenger]].<ref name=\"Campbell\">{{cite book | vauthors = Reece J, Campbell N | title = Biology | publisher = Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | pages = 207 | isbn = 0-8053-6624-5 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cyclic AMP]] is an important molecule in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[signal transduction]], a so-called [[second messenger]]. Adenylyl cyclases are often activated or inhibited by [[G protein]]s, which are coupled to membrane receptors and thus can respond to hormonal or other stimuli. Following activation of adenylyl cyclase, the resulting cAMP acts as a second messenger by interacting with and regulating other proteins such as [[protein kinase A]] and [[HCN channel|cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels]].\n\nPhotoactivatable adenylyl cyclase (PAC) was discovered in ''Euglena gracilis'' and can be expressed in other organisms through genetic manipulation. Shining blue light on a cell containing PAC activates it and abruptly increases the rate of conversion of ATP to cAMP. This is a useful technique for researchers in neuroscience because it allows them to quickly increase the intracellular cAMP levels in particular neurons, and to study the effect of that increase in neural activity on the behavior of the organism. For example, PAC expression in certain neurons has been shown to alter the grooming behavior in fruit flies exposed to blue light.<ref name=\"pmid17128267\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schr\u00f6der-Lang S, Schw\u00e4rzel M, Seifert R, Str\u00fcnker T, Kateriya S, Looser J, Watanabe M, Kaupp UB, Hegemann P, Nagel G | title = Fast manipulation of cellular cAMP level by light in vivo | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 39\u201342 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17128267 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth975 | url = https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/18452/10021/1/28h2X8KbeONlk.pdf }}</ref> A green-light activated rhodopsin adenylyl cyclase (CaRhAC) has recently been engineered by modifying the nuclecotide binding pocket of rhodopsin [[guanylyl cyclase]] from the fungus ''Catenaria anguillulae''.\n\n==== Structure ====\n[[Image:Adenylyl cyclase.png|thumb|Structure of adenylyl cyclase]]\nMost class III adenylyl cyclases are transmembrane [[protein]]s with 12 transmembrane segments. The protein is organized with 6 transmembrane segments, then the C1 cytoplasmic domain, then another 6 membrane segments, and then a second cytoplasmic domain called C2. The important parts for function are the N-terminus and the C1 and C2 regions. The C1a and C2a subdomains are homologous and form an intramolecular 'dimer' that forms the active site. In ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'',  the AC-III polypeptide is only half as long, comprising one 6-transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic domain, but two of these form a functional homodimer that resembles the mammalian architecture.\n\n==== Types ====\nThere are ten known isoforms of adenylyl cyclases in [[mammal]]s:\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[ADCY1]]\n* [[ADCY2]]\n* [[ADCY3]]\n* [[ADCY4]]\n* [[ADCY5]]\n* [[ADCY6]]\n* [[ADCY7]]\n* [[ADCY8]]\n* [[ADCY9]]\n* [[ADCY10]]\n}}\nThese are also sometimes called simply AC1, AC2, etc., and, somewhat confusingly, sometimes Roman numerals are used for these isoforms that all belong to the overall AC class III. They differ mainly in how they are regulated, and are differentially expressed in various tissues throughout mammalian development.\n\n==== Regulation ====\nAdenylyl cyclase is dually regulated by [[G protein]]s (Gs stimulating activity and Gi inhibiting it), and by [[forskolin]], as well as other isoform-specific effectors:\n* Isoforms III, V and VIII are also stimulated by [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]/[[calmodulin]].\n* Isoforms I and VI are inhibited by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in a calmodulin-independent manner.\n* Isoforms II, IV and IX are stimulated by alpha subunit of the G protein.\n* Isoforms I, V and VI are most clearly inhibited by Gi, while other isoforms show less dual regulation by the inhibitory G protein.\n* Soluble AC (sAC) is not a transmembrane form and is not regulated by G proteins or forskolin, instead acts as a bicarbonate/pH sensor. It is anchored at various locations within the cell and, with [[phosphodiesterases]], forms local cAMP signalling domains.<ref name=\"pmid4324443\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guilley H, Stussi C, Hirth L | title = [Influence of phosphodiesterase of swine spleen on the reconstitution in vitro of tobacco mosaic virus] | language = French | journal = Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires Des Seances De l'Academie Des Sciences.

As one of the [[Duma]]'s most well-known spacers from the monarchy and as a lawyer and defender of many revolutionaries, Kerensky became a member of the [[Provisional Committee of the State Duma]] and was elected vice-chairman of the newly formed [[Petrograd Soviet]]. These two instances, the Duma and the Petrograd Soviet, or their respective executive committees rather, soon became each other's antagonists on most matters except regarding the end of the Tsar's autocracy.\n\nThe Petrograd Soviet counted 3000-4000 members, and as their meetings drowned in a blur of everlasting orations, soon the '''Executive committee of Petrograd Soviet''' or [[Ispolkom]] was formed. Ispolkom was a self-appointed committee, with three members from all parties represented in the Soviet. Kerensky was one of them, representing the Social Revolutionary party.<ref>Richard Pipes,1995, \"The Russian Revolution\", p104-106,s ''Swedish'' {{ISBN|91-27-09935-0}}</ref>\n\nOn 1.March 1917, without any consultation with the government, Ispolkom declared the infamous [[Petrograd Soviet Order No. 1|Order No. 1]], intended for the 160.000 men strong Petrograd garrison only, but which became interpreted to be valid also at the front. The order stipulated that all military units should form committees like the Petrograd Soviet. This led to confusion and \"striping of officers\", further \"Order number 3\" stipulated that the military, in every political perspective, was subordinated to Ispolkom. The ideas came from a group of Socialists and aimed to make the officers without power aside from the war. The socialist intellectuals believed the officers to be the most likely counterrevolutionary elements. Kerensky's role in these orders are unclear, but he participated in the decisions. But just like he before the revolution had defended many who disliked the Tsar, he now saved the lives of many of the Tsar's civil servants about to be lynched by mobs<ref>Pipes, p.110</ref>\n\nAlso, the Duma formed an executive committee which eventually became the so-called [[Russian Provisional Government]]. As there was little trust between Ispolkom and this Government, and as Kerensky was about to accept becoming Attorney General in the Provisional Government, he held a most passionate speech, not to the Ispolkom, but to the entire Petrograd Soviet. He then swore, as Minister never to fail the democratic values, and ended his speech with the words \"''I cannot live without the people. In the moment you begin to doubt me, then kill me''\". The huge majority (workers and soldiers) gave him great applause, and Kerensky now became the first and ''the only one'' that participated in both the Provisional Government and the Ispolkom. As a link between Ispolkom and the Provisional Government, the quite ambitious Kerensky could benefit from this position.<ref>Pipes,p. 110</ref>\n \nAfter the first government crisis over [[Pavel Milyukov]]'s secret note re-committing Russia to its original war aims on 2\u20134 May, Kerensky became the [[Minister of War]] and the dominant figure in the newly formed socialist-liberal coalition government. On 10 May ([[Julian calendar]]), Kerensky started for the front and visited one division after another, urging the men to do their duty. His speeches were impressive and convincing for the moment, but had little lasting effect. Under Allied pressure to continue the war, he launched what became known as the [[Kerensky Offensive]] against the Austro-Hungarian/German South Army on 17 June (Julian Calendar). At first successful, the offensive was soon stopped and then thrown back by a strong counter-attack. The Russian army suffered heavy losses, and it was clear from the many incidents of desertion, sabotage, and mutiny that the army was no longer willing to attack.\n\n[[File:K\u00e9resnkiEnUnDiscursoALosSoldadosDelFrenteMayo1917.png|thumb|left|Kerensky in May 1917]]\n\nKerensky was heavily criticised by the military for his liberal policies, which included stripping officers of their mandates and handing over control to revolutionary inclined \"soldier committees\" instead; the abolition of the death penalty; and allowing revolutionary agitators to be present at the front. Many officers jokingly referred to commander-in-chief Kerensky as \"persuader-in-chief.\"\n\nOn 2 July 1917, the first coalition collapsed over the question of [[Ukraine]]'s autonomy. Following the [[July Days]] unrest in Petrograd and suppression of the Bolsheviks, Kerensky succeeded [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]] as Russia's Prime Minister. Following the [[Kornilov Affair]], an attempted military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] at the end of August, and the resignation of the other ministers, he appointed himself Supreme [[Commander-in-Chief]] as well.\n\nKerensky's next move, on 15 September, was to proclaim Russia a republic, which was contrary to the non-socialists' understanding that the Provisional Government should hold power only until a [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]] should meet to decide Russia's form of government, but which was in line with the long proclaimed aim of the Socialist Revolutionary Party.<ref>Party manifesto listed in McCauley, M ''Octobrists to Bolsheviks: Imperial Russia 1905\u20101917'' (1984)</ref> He formed a five-member Directory, which consisted of himself, minister of foreign affairs [[Mikhail Tereshchenko]], minister of war General Verkhovsky, minister of the navy Admiral [[Dmitry Verderevsky]] and minister of post and telegraph Nikitin. He retained his post in the final coalition government in October 1917 until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.\n\n[[File:Kerensky.jpg|thumb|upright|Kerensky in office]]\nKerensky's major challenge was that Russia was exhausted after three years of its participation in World War I, while the provisional government offered little motivation for a victory outside of continuing Russia's obligations towards its allies. Russia's continued involvement in the war was not popular among the lower and middle classes, and especially not popular among the soldiers. They had all believed that Russia would stop fighting when the Provisional Government took power, and now they felt deceived. Furthermore, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and his [[Bolshevik]] party were promising \"peace, land, and bread\" under a communist system. The army was disintegrating owing to a lack of discipline, leading to desertion in large numbers. By autumn 1917, an estimated two million men had unofficially left the army.\n\nKerensky and the other political leaders continued Russia's involvement in World War I, thinking nothing but a glorious victory was the only road forward.<ref>Pipes p.121</ref> Fearing that the economy, already under huge stress from the war effort, might become increasingly unstable if vital supplies from France and the United Kingdom were cut off. The dilemma of whether to withdraw was a great one, and Kerensky's inconsistent and impractical policies further destabilised the army and the country at large.\n\nFurthermore, Kerensky adopted a policy that isolated the right-wing conservatives, both democratic and monarchist-oriented. His philosophy of \"no enemies to the left\" greatly empowered the Bolsheviks and gave them a free hand, allowing them to take over the military arm or \"voyenka\" of the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets. His arrest of [[Lavr Kornilov]] and other officers left him without strong allies against the Bolsheviks, who ended up being Kerensky's strongest and most determined adversaries, as opposed to the right wing, which evolved into the [[White movement]].\n\n==October Revolution of 1917==\nDuring the [[Kornilov Affair]], Kerensky had distributed arms to the [[Petrograd]] workers, and by November most of these armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} On {{OldStyleDateNY|6\u20137 November|25\u201326 October}} 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the [[October Revolution|second Russian revolution]] of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, a subdivision of the 2nd company of the [[Women's Battalion#1st Petrograd Women.27s Battalion|First Petrograd Women's Battalion]], also known as The Women's Death Battalion, was willing to fight for the government against the Bolsheviks, but this force was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces, defeated, and captured.<ref name=gwar>{{cite web|title=Women Soldiers in Russia's Great War|url=http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/military/women_soldiers.shtml|publisher=Great War|accessdate=1 April 2013}}</ref> It took fewer than 20 hours for the Bolsheviks to seize the government.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nKerensky escaped the Bolsheviks and fled to [[Pskov]], where he rallied some loyal troops for an [[Kerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising|attempt to re-take the city]]. His troops managed to capture [[Tsarskoe Selo]] but were beaten the next day at [[Pulkovo Heights|Pulkovo]].

His pupil, successor, and eventual biographer [[Rimbert]] considered the visions of which this was the first to be the main motivation of the saint's life.\n\nAnsgar was a product of the phase of Christianization of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] (present day [[Northern Germany]]) begun by [[Charlemagne]] and continued by his son and successor, [[Louis the Pious]]. A group of monks including Ansgar were sent back to [[Jutland]] with the baptized exiled king [[Harald Klak]]. Ansgar returned two years later after educating young boys who had been purchased because Harald had possibly been driven out of his kingdom. In 822 Ansgar was one of a number of missionaries sent to found the abbey of [[Corvey]] (New Corbie) in [[Westphalia]], and there became a teacher and preacher. Then in 829 in response to a request from the Swedish king [[Bj\u00f6rn at Hauge]] for a mission to the [[Swedish people|Swedes]], Louis appointed Ansgar missionary. With an assistant, the friar Witmar, he preached and made converts for six months at [[Birka]], on Lake [[M\u00e4laren]]. They organized a small congregation there with the king's steward, Hergeir, and [[Mor Frideborg]] as its most prominent members. In 831 he returned to Louis' court at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and was appointed to the [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishopric of Hamburg]]. This was a new archbishopric with a see formed from those of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] and [[Verden, Germany|Verden]], plus the right to send missions into all the northern lands and to consecrate bishops for them. He was given the mission of evangelizing [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]]. The King of Sweden decided to cast lots as to whether the Christian missionaries should be admitted into his kingdom. Ansgar recommended the issue to the care of God, and the lot was favorable.<ref name=SHMI />\n\nAnsgar was consecrated in November 831, and, the arrangements having been at once approved by [[Pope Gregory IV|Gregory IV]], he went to Rome to receive the [[pallium]] directly from the hands of the pope and to be named legate for the northern lands. This commission had previously been bestowed upon [[Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims]], but the jurisdiction was divided by agreement, with Ebbo retaining Sweden for himself. For a time Ansgar devoted himself to the needs of his own diocese, which was still missionary territory with but a few churches. He founded a monastery and a school in Hamburg; the school was intended to serve the Danish mission, but accomplished little.\n\nAfter [[Louis the Pious|Louis]] died in 840, his empire was divided and Ansgar lost the abbey of [[Torhout|Turholt]], which had been given as an endowment for his work. Then in 845, the [[Danes]] unexpectedly raided Hamburg, destroying all the church's treasures and books and leaving the entire diocese unrestorable.  Ansgar now had neither see nor revenue. Many of his helpers deserted him, but the new king, [[Louis the German]], came to his aid; after failing to recover Turholt for him, in 847 he awarded him the vacant diocese of Bremen, where he took up residence in 848. However, since Hamburg had been an archbishopric, the sees of Bremen and Hamburg were combined for him. This presented canonical difficulties and also aroused the anger of the Bishop of Cologne, to whom Bremen had been [[suffragan]], but after prolonged negotiations, [[Pope Nicholas I]] approved the union of the two dioceses in 864.\n\nThrough all this political turmoil, Ansgar continued his mission to the northern lands. The Danish civil war compelled him to establish good relations with two kings, [[Horik I|Horik the Elder]] and his son, [[Horik II]]. Both assisted him until his death (Wood, 124\u2013125). He was able to secure recognition of Christianity as a tolerated religion and permission to build a church in [[Hedeby|Sleswick]]. He did not forget the Swedish mission, and spent two years there in person (848\u2013850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was threatened, which he succeeded in averting. In 854, Ansgar returned to Sweden when king [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]] ruled in Birka. According to Rimbert, he was well disposed to Christianity. On a Viking raid to [[Apuole]] (current village in [[Lithuania]]) in [[Courland]], the Swedes plundered the [[Curonians]].\n\nAnsgar wore a rough hair shirt, lived on bread and water, and showed great charity to the poor. Being the first missionary in Sweden and the organiser of the hierarchy in the [[Nordic countries]], he was declared Patron of [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=SHMI /> Ansgar was buried in [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] in 865.\n\nHis life story was written by his successor as archbishop, [[Rimbert]], in the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]i''.\n\n== Relics ==\nRelics are located in [[Hamburg]] on two places: St. Mary's Cathedral (germ.: Domkirche St. Marien) and St. Ansgar's and St. Bernard's Church (germ.: St. Ansgar und St. Bernhard Kirche).{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Visions==\n[[File:Erzbischof Ansgar 01 KMJ.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Ansgar statue in Hamburg]]\nAlthough a historical document and primary source written by a man whose existence can be proven historically, the ''[[Vita Ansgari]]i'' (\"The Life of Ansgar\") aims above all to demonstrate Ansgar's sanctity. It is partly concerned with Ansgar's visions, which, according to the author Rimbert, encouraged and assisted Ansgar's remarkable missionary feats.\n\nThrough the course of this work, Ansgar repeatedly embarks on a new stage in his career following a vision.  According to Rimbert, his early studies and ensuing devotion to the ascetic life of a monk were inspired by a vision of his mother in the presence of Saint Mary.  Again, when the Swedish people were left without a priest for some time, he begged King Horik to help him with this problem; then after receiving his consent, consulted with Bishop Gautbert to find a suitable man. The two together sought the approval of King Louis, which he granted when he learned that they were in agreement on the issue. Ansgar was convinced he was commanded by heaven to undertake this mission and was influenced by a vision he received when he was concerned about the journey, in which he met a man who reassured him of his purpose and informed him of a prophet that he would meet, the [[abbot]] [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalhard]], who would instruct him in what was to happen.  In the vision, he searched for and found Adalhard, who commanded, \"Islands, listen to me, pay attention, remotest peoples\", which Ansgar interpreted as God's will that he go to the Scandinavian countries as \"most of that country consisted of islands, and also, when 'I will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the ends of the earth' was added, since the end of the world in the north was in Swedish territory\".<ref name=rimbert>{{cite web|last=Rimbert|title=Life of Anskar, the Apostle of the North, 801\u2013865|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/anskar.asp|work=Medieval Sourcebook|publisher=New York: Fordham University|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref>\n\nStatues dedicated to him stand in [[Hamburg]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Ribe]] as well as a stone cross at [[Birka]].

In 1920, [[Thoralf Skolem]] simplified a previous result by [[Leopold L\u00f6wenheim]], leading to the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] and, in 1930, to the notion of a [[Herbrand universe]] and a [[Herbrand interpretation]] that allowed (un)satisfiability of first-order formulas (and hence the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of a theorem) to be reduced to (potentially infinitely many) propositional satisfiability problems.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herbrand|first=Jaques|title=Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie de la d\u00e9monstration|year=1930}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929, [[Moj\u017cesz Presburger]] showed that the theory of [[natural numbers]] with addition and equality (now called [[Presburger arithmetic]] in his honor) is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] and gave an algorithm that could determine if a given sentence in the language was true or false.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Presburger|first=Moj\u017cesz|title=\u00dcber die Vollst\u00e4ndigkeit eines gewissen Systems der Arithmetik ganzer Zahlen, in welchem die Addition als einzige Operation hervortritt|journal=Comptes Rendus du I congr\u00e8s de Math\u00e9maticiens des Pays Slaves|year=1929|pages=92\u2013101|location=Warszawa}}</ref><ref name=Davis2001>{{Citation\n| last = Davis\n| first = Martin\n| author-link = Martin Davis\n| chapter = The Early History of Automated Deduction\n| year = 2001\n| chapter-url = http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/early.ps\n| editor-last = Robinson\n| editor-first = Alan\n| editor-link = John Alan Robinson\n| editor2-last = Voronkov\n| editor2-first = Andrei\n| editor2-link = Andrei Voronkov (scientist)\n| title = [[Handbook of Automated Reasoning]]\n| volume = 1\n| publisher = [[Elsevier]]\n| publication-date = 2001\n}})</ref>\nHowever, shortly after this positive result, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] published ''[[On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems]]'' (1931), showing that in any sufficiently strong axiomatic system there are true statements which cannot be proved in the system. This topic was further developed in the 1930s by [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]], who on the one hand gave two independent but equivalent definitions of [[computability]], and on the other gave concrete examples for undecidable questions.\n\n== First implementations ==\n\nShortly after [[World War II]], the first general purpose computers became available. In 1954, [[Martin Davis]] programmed Presburger's algorithm for a [[JOHNNIAC]] vacuum tube computer at the [[Princeton Institute for Advanced Study]]. According to Davis, \"Its great triumph was to prove that the sum of two even numbers is even\".<ref name=Davis2001/><ref name=Bibel2007>{{cite journal|last=Bibel|first=Wolfgang|title=Early History and Perspectives of Automated Deduction|journal=KI 2007|year=2007|series=LNAI|issue=4667|pages=2\u201318|url=http://www.intellektik.de/resources/OsnabrueckBuchfassung.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2012|publisher=Springer}}</ref> More ambitious was the [[Logic Theory Machine]] in 1956, a deduction system for the [[propositional logic]] of the ''Principia Mathematica'', developed by [[Allen Newell]], [[Herbert A. Simon]] and [[Cliff Shaw|J. C. Shaw]]. Also running on a JOHNNIAC, the Logic Theory Machine constructed proofs from a small set of propositional axioms and three deduction rules: [[modus ponens]], (propositional) variable substitution, and the replacement of formulas by their definition. The system used heuristic guidance, and managed to prove 38 of the first 52 theorems of the ''Principia''.<ref name=Davis2001/>\n\nThe \"heuristic\" approach of the Logic Theory Machine tried to emulate human mathematicians, and could not guarantee that a proof could be found for every valid theorem even in principle.  In contrast, other, more systematic algorithms achieved, at least theoretically, [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] for first-order logic. Initial approaches relied on the results of Herbrand and Skolem to convert a first-order formula into successively larger sets of propositional formulae by instantiating variables with terms from the [[Herbrand universe]]. The propositional formulas could then be checked for unsatisfiability using a number of methods. Gilmore's program used conversion to [[disjunctive normal form]], a form in which the satisfiability of a formula is obvious.<ref name=Davis2001/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Paul|title=A proof procedure for quantification theory: its justification and realisation|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|year=1960|volume=4|pages=28\u201335|doi=10.1147/rd.41.0028}}</ref>\n\n== Decidability of the problem ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nDepending on the underlying logic, the problem of deciding the validity of a formula varies from trivial to impossible. For the frequent case of [[propositional logic]], the problem is decidable but [[co-NP-complete]], and hence only exponential-time algorithms are believed to exist for general proof tasks. For a [[first-order logic|first order predicate calculus]], [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]] states that the theorems (provable statements) are exactly the logically valid [[well-formed formula]]s, so identifying valid formulas is [[recursively enumerable]]: given unbounded resources, any valid formula can eventually be proven. However, ''invalid'' formulas (those that are ''not'' entailed by a given theory), cannot always be recognized.\n\nThe above applies to first order theories, such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]. However, for a specific model that may be described by a first order theory, some statements may be true but undecidable in the theory used to describe the model. For example, by [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], we know that any theory whose proper axioms are true for the natural numbers cannot prove all first order statements true for the natural numbers, even if the list of proper axioms is allowed to be infinite enumerable. It follows that an automated theorem prover will fail to terminate while searching for a proof precisely when the statement being investigated is undecidable in the theory being used, even if it is true in the model of interest. Despite this theoretical limit, in practice, theorem provers can solve many hard problems, even in models that are not fully described by any first order theory (such as the integers).\n\n== Related problems ==\n\nA simpler, but related, problem is '''[[proof verification]]''', where an existing proof for a theorem is certified valid. For this, it is generally required that each individual proof step can be verified by a [[primitive recursive function]] or program, and hence the problem is always decidable.\n\nSince the proofs generated by automated theorem provers are typically very large, the problem of [[proof compression]] is crucial and various techniques aiming at making the prover's output smaller, and consequently more easily understandable and checkable, have been developed.\n\n[[Proof assistant]]s require a human user to give hints to the system. Depending on the degree of automation, the prover can essentially be reduced to a proof checker, with the user providing the proof in a formal way, or significant proof tasks can be performed automatically. Interactive provers are used for a variety of tasks, but even fully automatic systems have proved a number of interesting and hard theorems, including at least one that has eluded human mathematicians for a long time, namely the [[Robbins conjecture]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=W.W. McCune|title=Solution of the Robbins Problem|journal=Journal of Automated Reasoning|year=1997|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h77246751668616h/|volume=19|issue=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Computer Math Proof Shows Reasoning Power|author=Gina Kolata|date=December 10, 1996|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/1210math.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref> However, these successes are sporadic, and work on hard problems usually requires a proficient user.\n\nAnother distinction is sometimes drawn between theorem proving and other techniques, where a process is considered to be theorem proving if it consists of a traditional proof, starting with axioms and producing new inference steps using rules of inference.  Other techniques would include [[model checking]], which, in the simplest case, involves brute-force enumeration of many possible states (although the actual implementation of model checkers requires much cleverness, and does not simply reduce to brute force).\n\nThere are hybrid theorem proving systems which use model checking as an inference rule. There are also programs which were written to prove a particular theorem, with a (usually informal) proof that if the program finishes with a certain result, then the theorem is true. A good example of this was the machine-aided proof of the [[four color theorem]], which was very controversial as the first claimed mathematical proof which was essentially impossible to verify by humans due to the enormous size of the program's calculation (such proofs are called [[non-surveyable proofs]]).  Another example of a program-assisted proof is the one that shows that the game of [[Connect Four]] can always be won by first player.\n\n== Industrial uses ==\n\nCommercial use of automated theorem proving is mostly concentrated in [[integrated circuit design]] and verification.  Since the [[Pentium FDIV bug]], the complicated [[floating point unit]]s of modern microprocessors have been designed with extra scrutiny. [[AMD]], [[Intel]] and others use automated theorem proving to verify that division and other operations are correctly implemented in their processors.\n\n==First-order theorem proving==\nIn the late 1960s agencies funding research in automated deduction began to emphasize the need for practical applications. One of the first fruitful areas was that of [[program verification]] whereby first-order theorem provers were applied to the problem of verifying the correctness of computer programs in languages such as Pascal, Ada, Java etc. Notable among early program verification systems was the Stanford Pascal Verifier developed by David Luckham at Stanford University. This was based on the Stanford Resolution Prover also developed at Stanford using J.A. Robinson's resolution Principle. This was the first automated deduction system to demonstrate an ability to solve mathematical problems that were announced in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society before solutions were formally published.\n\n[[First-order logic|First-order]] theorem proving is one of the most mature subfields of automated theorem proving. The logic is expressive enough to allow the specification of arbitrary problems, often in a reasonably natural and intuitive way. On the other hand, it is still semi-decidable, and a number of sound and complete calculi have been developed, enabling ''fully'' automated systems. More expressive logics, such as [[Higher-order logic|higher order logics]], allow the convenient expression of a wider range of problems than first order logic, but theorem proving for these logics is less well developed.\n\n==Benchmarks, Competitions, and Sources ==\nThe quality of implemented systems has benefited from the existence of a large library of standard benchmark examples \u2014 the Thousands of Problems for Theorem Provers (TPTP) Problem Library<ref>{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Geoff|title=The TPTP Problem Library for Automated Theorem Proving|url=http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/|accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>  \u2014 as well as from the [[CADE ATP System Competition]] (CASC), a yearly competition of first-order systems for many important classes of first-order problems.\n\nSome important systems (all have won at least one CASC competition division) are listed below.\n* [[E theorem prover|E]] is a high-performance prover for full first-order logic, but built on a [[superposition calculus|purely equational calculus]], originally developed in the automated reasoning group of [[Technical University of Munich]], and now at [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Cooperative State University]] in [[Stuttgart]].\n* [[Otter (theorem prover)|Otter]], developed at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], is based on [[first-order resolution]] and [[paramodulation]]. Otter has since been replaced by [[Prover9]], which is paired with [[Mace4]].\n* [[SETHEO]] is a high-performance system based on the goal-directed [[model elimination]] calculus. It is developed in the automated reasoning group of Technical University of Munich. E and SETHEO have been combined (with other systems) in the composite theorem prover E-SETHEO.\n* [[Vampire theorem prover|Vampire]] is developed and implemented at [http://www.manchester.ac.uk/ Manchester University] by [http://www.voronkov.com/ Andrei Voronkov] and [http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~hoderk/ Krystof Hoder], formerly also by [http://www.freewebs.com/riazanov/ Alexandre Riazanov]. It has won the CADE ATP System Competition in the most prestigious CNF (MIX) division for eleven years (1999, 2001\u20132010).\n* Waldmeister is a specialized system for unit-equational first-order logic developed by Arnim Buch and Thomas Hillenbrand. It won the CASC UEQ division for fourteen consecutive years (1997\u20132010).\n* [[SPASS]] is a first order logic theorem prover with equality. This is developed by the research group Automation of Logic, [[Max Planck Institute for Computer Science]].\n\nThe [https://theoremprover-museum.github.io/ Theorem Prover Museum] is an initiative to conserve the sources of theorem prover systems for future analysis, since they are imporant cultural/scientific artefacts.

Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision.

The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year \u2212584.\nThe astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose. For example, in the historical practice of counting, the rule of divisibility by 4 revealing Julian leap-years no longer exists; these years are, indeed, 1, 5, 9, 13, ... B.C. In the astronomical sequence, however, these leap-years are called 0, \u22124, \u22128, \u221212, ..., and the rule of divisibility by 4 subsists.|Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms''}}\n\n==Signed years without year 0==\nAlthough he used the usual French terms \"avant J.-C.\" (before Jesus Christ) and \"apr\u00e8s J.-C.\" (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian [[Venance Grumel]] used negative years (identified by a minus sign, \u2212) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table.

''Ab urbe condita'' literally means \"from the [[founding of Rome|founding of the City]],\" while ''anno urbis condit\u00e6'' means \"in the year since the City's founding.\"  Therefore, the traditional year of the foundation of Rome, [[753 BC]], would be written AUC 1, while [[AD 1]] would be AUC 754. The foundation of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] in 27 BC would be AUC 727.\n\nUsage of the term was more common during the [[Renaissance]], when editors sometimes added AUC to Roman manuscripts they published, giving the false impression that the convention was commonly used in antiquity.  In reality, the dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two [[Roman consul|consul]]s who held office that year. In late antiquity, [[regnal years]] were also in use, as was the [[Diocletian era]] in Roman Egypt after AD 293, and in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after AD 537, following a decree by [[Justinian]].\n\n==Significance==\nThe traditional date for the founding of Rome, 21 April 753 BC, is due to  [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] ([[1st century BC|First Century BC]]). Varro may have used the consular list (with its mistakes) and called the year of the first consuls \"''ab urbe condita'' 245,\" accepting the 244-year interval from [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] for the kings after the foundation of Rome. The correctness of this calculation has not been confirmed, but it is still used worldwide.\n\nFrom the time of [[Claudius]] (ruled AD 41 to AD 54) onward, this calculation superseded other contemporary calculations. Celebrating the anniversary of the city became part of imperial [[propaganda]]. Claudius was the first to hold magnificent celebrations in honor of the anniversary of the city, in AD 48, the eight hundredth year from the founding of the city.{{cn|date=June 2016}} [[Hadrian]] and [[Antoninus Pius]] held similar celebrations, in AD 121, and in AD 147 and AD 148, respectively.\n\nIn AD 248, [[Philip the Arab]] celebrated Rome's first [[millennium]], together with [[Ludi saeculares]] for Rome's alleged tenth [[saeculum|s\u00e6culum]]. [[Coin]]s from his reign commemorate the celebrations. A coin by a contender for the imperial throne, [[Pacatianus]], explicitly states \"[y]ear one thousand and first\", which is an indication that the citizens of the empire had a sense of the beginning of a new era, a ''S\u00e6culum Novum''.\n\n==Calendar era==\n{{see|Calendar era}}\nThe [[Anno Domini]] (AD) year numbering was developed by a monk named [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in Rome in AD 525, as a result of his work on calculating the date of Easter. \nDionysius did not use the AUC convention, but instead based his calculations on the \n[[Diocletian era]].\nThis convention had been in use since AD 293, the year of the [[tetrarchy]], as it became impractical to use regnal years of the current emperor.<ref>\nJ. David Thomas, \"On Dating by Regnal Years of Diocletian, Maximian and the Caesars\", \n''Chronique d'Egypte'' 46.91 (1971),  173&ndash;179, [https://doi.org/10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234 doi:10.1484/J.CDE.2.308234].</ref>\nIn his Easter table, the year AD 532 was equated with the 248th regnal year of  Diocletian. The table counted the years starting from the presumed birth of Christ, rather than the accession of the emperor [[Diocletian]] on 20 November AD 284, or as stated by Dionysius: \"''sed magis elegimus ab incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi annorum tempora praenotare\u2026''\" (\"but rather we choose to name the times of the years from the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ \u2026\").<ref>''Liber de Paschate'', [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC12663742&id=LcEYeL-4ZuEC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP10&dq=%22in+hoc+tomo+LXVII#PRA1-PT165,M1 Volume 67, page 481, note f]</ref> Blackburn and Holford-Strevens review interpretations of Dionysius which place the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] in 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1.<ref>Blackburn, B. & Holford-Strevens, L, ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'' (Oxford University Press, 2003 corrected reprinting, originally 1999) 778&ndash;780.</ref> \n\nIt has later been calculated{{by whom|date=May 2018}} (from the historical record of the succession of [[List of Roman consuls|Roman consuls]]) that the year AD 1 corresponds to AUC 754, based on the epoch of Varro. \nThus, \n:AUC 1 = 753 BC\n:AUC 753 = 1 BC\n:AUC 754 = AD 1 \n:AUC 1000 = AD 247\n:AUC 2753 = AD 2000\n:AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+752}} = AD {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}\n:AUC {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} = AD {{CURRENTYEAR}}\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{Portal|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[List of Latin phrases]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ancient Rome topics}}\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ab urbe condita}}\n[[Category:8th century BC in the Roman Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Latin words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Roman calendar]]\n[[Category:Calendar eras]]\n[[Category:Chronology]]\n[[Category:1st-century BC establishments in the Roman Empire]]", "sha1": "5b6il1r52mmwkd1equaqjbuvalg05r7"}}, {"title": "Arapaoa Island", "ns": "0", "id": "2559", "revision": {"id": "859507980", "parentid": "843865636", "timestamp": "2018-09-14T13:38:32Z", "contributor": {"username": "Grutness", "id": "117878"}, "comment": "/* Conservation */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox islands\n| name             = Arapaoa Island\n| local name       =\n| image name       = Southern end of Arapawa Island.jpg\n| image caption    = Southern end of Arapaoa Island\n| map              = New Zealand\n| coordinates = {{coords|-41.18951|174.30290|display=it}}\n| map caption      = \n| nickname         = \n| location         = [[Marlborough Sounds]]\n| archipelago      =\n| total islands    =\n| major islands    =\n| area_km2         = 75\n| length_km        = 28\n| width_km         = 4\n| highest mount    = Narawhia\n| elevation_m      = 559.4\n| population       = 50\n| population as of =\n| density_km2      =\n| ethnic groups    =\n| country          = New Zealand\n| additional info  =\n}}\n\n'''Arapaoa Island''', formerly known as '''Arapawa Island''', is a small [[island]] located in the [[Marlborough Sounds]], at the north east tip of the [[South Island]] of New Zealand.\nThe island has a land area of {{convert|75|km\u00b2|sqmi|0|abbr=in}}.

[[Government agency]] action can include [[rule making]], [[adjudication]], or the [[enforcement]] of a specific [[regulation|regulatory]] agenda. Administrative law is considered a branch of [[public law]]. As a body of law, administrative law deals with the decision-making of the administrative units of government (for example, [[tribunal]]s, [[Board of directors|board]]s or [[Government agency|commissions]]) that are part of a national [[regulation|regulatory scheme]] in such areas as [[police law]], [[international trade]], [[manufacturing]], the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[taxation]], [[broadcasting]], [[immigration]] and [[transport]]. Administrative law expanded greatly during the twentieth century, as legislative bodies worldwide created more [[government agency|government agencies]] to regulate the social, economic and political spheres of human interaction.\n\nCivil law countries often have specialized courts, [[administrative court]]s, that review these decisions.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n== In civil law countries ==\n{{Main article|Administrative court}}\n\nUnlike most common-law jurisdictions, the majority of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions have specialized courts or sections to deal with administrative cases which, as a rule, will apply procedural rules specifically designed for such cases and different from that applied in private-law proceedings, such as [[contract]] or [[tort]] claims.\n\n=== Brazil ===\n\nIn Brazil, unlike most Civil-law jurisdictions, there is no specialized court or section to deal with administrative cases. In 1998, a constitutional reform, led by the government of President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], introduced regulatory agencies as a part of the executive branch. Since 1988, Brazilian administrative law has been strongly influenced by the judicial interpretations of the constitutional principles of public administration (art. 37 of Federal Constitution): legality, impersonality, publicity of administrative acts, morality and efficiency.\n\n=== Chile ===\n{{Main article|Law of Chile#Administrative law}}\n\nThe [[President of Chile|President of the Republic]] exercises the administrative function, in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with ''ministerial rank''. Each Ministry has one or more under-secretary that performs through [[public services]] the actual satisfaction of public needs. There is not a single [[Administrative court|specialized court]] to deal with actions against the Administrative entities, but instead there are several specialized courts and procedures of review.\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n{{Main article|Administrative law in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nAdministrative law in the People's Republic of China was virtually non-existent before the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1976\u20131989)#Reform and opening up|economic reform era]] initiated by Deng Xiaoping. Since the 1980s, the People's Republic of China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws is vastly inadequate in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.\n\nIn 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations (\u884c\u653f\u68c0\u67e5\u6761\u4f8b) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (\u884c\u653f\u590d\u8bae\u6761\u4f8b) were passed. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u52a1\u5458\u6682\u884c\u6761\u4f8b) changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. The three regulations have been amended and upgraded into laws. In 1994, the State Compensation Law (\u56fd\u5bb6\u8d54\u507f\u6cd5) was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law (\u884c\u653f\u5904\u7f5a\u6cd5) in 1996.

It is a part of the public law, which deals with the organization, the tasks and the acting of the public administration. It also contains rules, regulations, orders and decisions created by and related to administrative agencies, such as federal agencies, federal state authorities, urban administrations, but also admission offices and fiscal authorities etc. Administrative law in Germany follows three basic principles.\n\n* Principle of the legality of the authority, which means that there is no acting against the law and no acting without a law.\n* Principle of legal security, which includes a principle of legal certainty and the principle of nonretroactivity\n* Principle of proportionality, which says that an act of an authority has to be suitable, necessary and appropriate<ref>Oberath, \u00f6ffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht pp. 12\u201314</ref>\n\nAdministrative law in Germany can be divided into '''general administrative law''' and '''special administrative law'''.\n\n==== General administrative law ====\n\nThe general administration law is basically ruled in the administrative procedures law (''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' [VwVfG]). Other legal sources are the Rules of the Administrative Courts (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung [VwGO]), the social security code (Sozialgesetzbuch [SGB]) and the general fiscal law (Abgabenordnung [AO]).<ref>Oberath, \u00f6ffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht p. 148</ref>\n\n===== Administrative procedures Law =====\n\nThe ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (VwVfG), which was enacted in 1977,<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar No. 1 and 26</ref> regulates the main administrative procedures of the federal government. It serves the purpose to ensure a treatment in accordance with the rule of law by the public authority. Furthermore, it contains the regulations for mass processes and expands the legal protection against the authorities. The VwVfG basically applies for the entire public administrative activities of federal agencies as well as federal state authorities, in case of making federal law. One of the central clause is \u00a7 35 VwVfG. It defines the administrative act, the most common form of action in which the public administration occurs against a citizen. The definition in \u00a7 35 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwvfg/__35.html|title=\u00a7 35 VwVfG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}</ref> says, that an administration act is characterized by the following features:\n\nIt is an official act<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar \u00a735 No.59</ref> of an authority<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar \u00a735 No.65</ref> in the field of public law<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar \u00a735 No.70</ref> to resolve an individual case<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar \u00a735 No. 118</ref> with effect to the outside.<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz Kommentar \u00a735 No. 124</ref>\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 36 \u2013 39, \u00a7\u00a7 58 \u2013 59 and \u00a7 80 VwV\u2013\u2013fG rule the structure and the necessary elements of the\nadministrative act. \u00a7 48 and \u00a7 49 VwVfG have a high relevance in practice, as well. In these\nparagraphs, the prerequisites for redemption of an unlawful administration act (\u00a7 48 VwVfG <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwvfg/__48.html|title=\u00a7 48 VwVfG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}</ref>) and\nwithdrawal of a lawful administration act (\u00a7 49 VwVfG <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vwvfg/__49.html|title=\u00a7 49 VwVfG - Einzelnorm|website=www.gesetze-im-internet.de}}</ref>), are listed.<ref>Oberath, \u00f6ffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht 161\u2013163</ref>\n\n===== Other legal sources =====\n\nAdministration procedural law (Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung [VwGO]), which was enacted in 1960, rules the court procedures at the administrative court. The VwGO is divided into five parts, which are the constitution of the courts,<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar pp. 1\u201394</ref> action, remedies and retrial, costs and enforcement15 and final clauses and temporary arrangements.<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar p. 605,1517,1760,1882</ref>\n\nIn absence of a rule, the VwGO is supplemented by the code of civil procedure (Zivilprozessordnung [ZPO]) and the judicature act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz [GVG]).<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar \u00a7173 No. 1</ref> In addition to the regulation of the administrative procedure, the VwVfG also constitutes the legal protection in administrative law beyond the court procedure. \u00a7 68 VwVGO rules the preliminary proceeding, called \"Vorverfahren\" or \"Widerspruchsverfahren\",<ref>Oberath, \u00f6ffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht p. 211</ref> which is a stringent prerequisite for the administrative procedure, if an action for rescission or a writ of mandamus against an authority is aimed.<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar \u00a768 No.1</ref> The preliminary proceeding gives each citizen, feeling unlawfully mistreated by an authority, the possibility to object and to force a review of an administrative act without going to court. The prerequisites to open the public law remedy are listed in \u00a7 40 I VwGO. Therefore, it is necessary to have the existence of a conflict in public law<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar \u00a740 No. 6</ref>  without any constitutional aspects<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar $40 No. 31</ref> and no assignment to another jurisdiction.<ref>Kopp / Rammsauer Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung Kommentar \u00a7 40 No. 48</ref>\n\nThe social security code (Sozialgesetzbuch [SGB]) and the general fiscal law are less important for the administrative law. They supplement the VwVfG and the VwGO in the fields of taxation and social legislation, such as social welfare or financial support for students (BaF\u00d6G) etc.\n\n==== Special administrative law ====\n\nThe special administrative law consists of various laws. Each special sector has its own law. The most important ones are the\n\n* Town and Country Planning Code (Baugesetzbuch [BauGB])\n* Federal Control of Pollution Act (Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz [BImSchG])\n* Industrial Code (Gewerbeordnung [GewO])\n* Police Law (Polizei- und Ordnungsrecht)\n* Statute Governing Restaurants (Gastst\u00e4ttenrecht [GastG]).<ref>Oberath, \u00f6ffentliches Wirtschaftsrecht</ref>\n\nIn Germany, the highest administrative court for most matters is the federal administrative court [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]]. There are federal courts with special jurisdiction in the fields of social security law ([[Bundessozialgericht]]) and tax law ([[Bundesfinanzhof]]).\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n=== Italy ===\nAdministrative law in Italy, known as \"'''Diritto amministrativo''\", is a branch of [[public law]], whose rules govern the organization of the [[public administration]] and the activities of the pursuit of the public interest of the [[public administration]] and the relationship between this and the citizens.\nIts genesis is related to the principle of division of powers of the State. The administrative power, originally called \"executive\", is to organize resources and people whose function is devolved to achieve the public interest objectives as defined by the law.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Galli|first=Rocco|title=Corso di diritto amministrativo|journal=CEDAM|date=2011}}</ref>\n\n=== The Netherlands ===\n\nIn The Netherlands, administrative law provisions are usually contained in separate laws. There is however a single General Administrative Law Act (\"Algemene wet bestuursrecht\" or Awb) that applies both to the making of administrative decisions and the judicial review of these decisions in courts. On the basis of the Awb, citizens can oppose a decision ('besluit') made by an administrative agency ('bestuursorgaan') within the administration and apply for judicial review in courts if unsuccessful.\n\nUnlike France or Germany, there are no special administrative courts of first instance in the Netherlands, but regular courts have an administrative \"chamber\" which specializes in administrative appeals. The courts of appeal in administrative cases however are specialized depending on the case, but most administrative appeals end up in the judicial section of the Council of State ([[Raad van State]]).\n\nBefore going to court, citizens must usually first object to the decision with the administrative body who made it. This is called \"bezwaar\". This procedure allows for the administrative body to correct possible mistakes themselves and is used to filter cases before going to court. Sometimes, instead of bezwaar, a different system is used called \"administratief beroep\" (administrative [[appeal]]). The difference with bezwaar is that administratief beroep is filed with a different administrative body, usually a higher ranking one, than the administrative body that made the primary decision. Administratief beroep is available only if the law on which the primary decision is based specifically provides for it. An example involves objecting to a [[traffic ticket]] with the district attorney (\"officier van justitie\"), after which the decision can be appealed in court.\n\nIn addition, Netherlands General Administrative Law Act (GALA) is a rather good sample of procedural laws in Europe\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n[[File:Riddarholmen 2009f.jpg|thumb|The Stenbockska Palace is the seat of the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]].]]\n\nIn [[Sweden]], there is a system of administrative courts that considers only administrative law cases, and is completely separate from the system of general courts.<ref>[http://www.domstol.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx The Swedish courts], accessed on February 20, 2009</ref> This system has three tiers, with 12 county administrative courts (''f\u00f6rvaltningsr\u00e4tt'') as the first tier, four administrative courts of appeal (''kammarr\u00e4tt'') as the second tier, and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden]] (''H\u00f6gsta F\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen'') as the third tier.\n\nMigration cases are handled in a two-tier system, effectively within the system general administrative courts. Three of the administrative courts serve as migration courts (''migrationsdomstol'') with the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm serving as the Migration Court of Appeal (''Migrations\u00f6verdomstolen'').\n\n=== Turkey ===\nIn Turkey, the lawsuits against the acts and actions of the national or local governments and public bodies are handled by administrative courts which are the main administrative courts. The decisions of the administrative courts are checked by the Regional Administrative Courts and Council of State.  Council of State as a court of last resort is exactly similar to [[Conseil d'\u00c9tat (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] in France.<ref>Yucel Ogurlu, Canan Kucukali, Focus on ICT in Turkish Judicial System, http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/series/Etudes7TIC_en.pdf, p.50.</ref><ref>Administrative Sanctioning System in Turkey, www.idare.gen.tr/ogurlu-administrative.htm</ref>\n\n=== Ukraine ===\n{{Main article|Ukrainian administrative law}}\n\nAs a homogeneous legal substance isolated in a system of jurisprudence, the administrative law of Ukraine is characterized as: (1) a branch of law; (2) a science; (3) a discipline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law-property.in.ua/images/books/apuvsu.pdf|title=Administrative law of Ukraine nowadays (the beginning of the 21st century): monograph.

Often these procedures are coupled with legislation or other [[common law]] doctrines that establish standards for proper [[rulemaking]]. Administrative law may also apply to review of decisions of so-called semi-public bodies, such as [[non-profit corporations]], disciplinary boards, and other decision-making bodies that affect the legal rights of members of a particular group or entity.\n\nWhile administrative decision-making bodies are often controlled by larger governmental units, their decisions could be reviewed by a [[court]] of [[general jurisdiction]] under some principle of [[judicial review]] based upon [[due process]] (United States) or [[fundamental justice]] (Canada). Judicial review of administrative decisions is different from an administrative appeal. When sitting in review of a decision, the Court will only look at the method in which the decision was arrived at, whereas in an administrative appeal the correctness of the decision itself will be examined, usually by a higher body in the agency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This difference is vital in appreciating administrative law in common law countries.\n\nThe scope of [[judicial review]] may be limited to certain questions of [[Equity (law)|fairness]], or whether the administrative action is ''[[ultra vires]]''. In terms of ultra vires actions in the broad sense, a reviewing court may set aside an administrative decision if it is [[unreasonable]] (under Canadian law, following the rejection of the \"Patently Unreasonable\" standard by the Supreme Court in [[Dunsmuir v New Brunswick]]), [[Wednesbury unreasonableness|''Wednesbury'' unreasonable]] (under British law), or arbitrary and capricious (under U.S. [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] and New York State law). Administrative law, as laid down by the [[Supreme Court of India]], has also recognized two more grounds of judicial review which were recognized but not applied by English Courts, namely [[legitimate expectation]] and [[Proportionality (political maxim)|proportionality]].\n\nThe powers to review administrative decisions are usually established by statute, but were originally developed from the royal [[prerogative writ]]s of [[English law]], such as the writ of [[mandamus]] and the writ of [[certiorari]]. In certain [[common law]] jurisdictions, such as [[India]] or [[Pakistan]], the power to pass such writs is a Constitutionally guaranteed power. This power is seen as fundamental to the power of [[judicial review]] and an aspect of the independent [[judiciary]].\n\n{{globalise/US|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{main article|Australian administrative law}}\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{main article|Canadian administrative law}}\n\n=== Singapore ===\n{{main article|Administrative law in Singapore}}\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{main article|United Kingdom administrative law}}\n\n=== United States ===\n{{Main article|United States administrative law}}\n[[File:HQ FTC.jpg|thumb|American administrative law often involves the regulatory activities of so-called \"independent agencies\", such as the [[Federal Trade Commission]], whose headquarters is shown above.]]\n\nIn the United States, many [[Government agency|government agencies]] are organized under the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of government, although a few are part of the [[Judiciary|judicial]] or [[Legislature|legislative branches]].\n\nIn the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], the executive branch, led by the [[President of the United States|president]], controls the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive departments]], which are led by secretaries who are members of the [[United States Cabinet]]. The many [[independent agencies of the United States government]] created by [[statutes]] enacted by [[United States Congress|Congress]] exist outside of the federal executive departments but are still part of the executive branch.\n\nCongress has also created some special judicial bodies known as [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I tribunals]] to handle some areas of administrative law.\n\nThe actions of executive agencies and independent agencies are the main focus of American administrative law. In response to the rapid creation of new independent agencies in the early twentieth century (see discussion below), [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA) in 1946. Many of the independent agencies operate as miniature versions{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} of the tripartite federal government, with the authority to \"legislate\" (through [[rulemaking]]; see [[Federal Register]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]]), [[adjudication|\"adjudicate\"]] (through administrative hearings), and to \"execute\" administrative goals (through agency enforcement personnel). Because the [[United States Constitution]] sets no limits on this tripartite authority of [[government agency|administrative agencies]], Congress enacted the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|APA]] to establish fair administrative law procedures to comply with the constitutional requirements of [[due process]].  Agency procedures are drawn from four sources of authority: the APA, organic statutes, agency rules, and informal agency practice. It is important to note, though, that agencies can only act within their congressionally delegated authority,<ref>New York v. Fed. Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 535 U.S. 1, 18 (2002).</ref> and must comply with the requirements of the APA.\n\nThe [[American Bar Association]]'s official journal concerning administrative law is the ''[[Administrative Law Review]]'', a quarterly publication that is managed and edited by students at the [[Washington College of Law]].\n\n==== Historical development ====\n\n[[Stephen Breyer]], a [[U.S. Supreme Court Justice]] since 1994, divides the history of administrative law in the United States into six discrete periods, in his book, ''Administrative Law & Regulatory Policy'' (3d Ed., 1992):\n\n* English antecedents & the American experience to 1875\n* 1875 \u2013 1930: the rise of regulation & the traditional model of administrative law\n* 1930 - 1945: the New Deal\n* 1945 \u2013 1965: the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] & the maturation of the traditional model of administrative law\n* 1965 \u2013 1985: critique and transformation of the administrative process\n* 1985 \u2013 ?: retreat or consolidation\n\n==== Agriculture ====\n\nThe agricultural sector is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the U.S. economy, as it is regulated in various ways at the international, federal, state, and local levels. Consequently, administrative law is a significant component of the discipline of [[agricultural law]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and its myriad agencies such as the [http://www.ams.usda.gov Agricultural Marketing Service] are the primary sources of regulatory activity, although other administrative bodies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] play a significant regulatory role as well.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Rule of law]]\n* [[Rechtsstaat]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Commons category|Administrative law}}\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Davis |first=Kenneth Culp |year=1975 |title=Administrative Law and Government |location=St. Paul, MN |publisher=West Publishing}}\n\n{{Law}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Administrative Law}}\n[[Category:Administrative law| ]]", "sha1": "o4yslf9qk5az3dleaqetwlzfkjm9bh9"}}, {"title": "American political scandals", "ns": "0", "id": "2561", "redirect": {"title": "List of federal political scandals in the United States"}, "revision": {"id": "656290245", "parentid": "512244294", "timestamp": "2015-04-13T16:02:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Anythingyouwant", "id": "61960"}, "comment": "Change to redirect.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT[[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]", "sha1": "2k01y13xmi9xalmvxjxwd9nyk12jqvw"}}, {"title": "Arthur Phillip", "ns": "0", "id": "2563", "revision": {"id": "865159036", "parentid": "864747587", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T03:58:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "FlagrantUsername", "id": "6512108"}, "comment": "/* See also */  include ''[[Historical Records of Australia]]''", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox governor\n|name= Arthur Phillip\n|image= ArthurPhilip.jpg|caption=1786 portrait by [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]]<br />(National Portrait Gallery, London)\n|order =1st [[Governor of New South Wales]]\n|term_start =7 February 1788\n|term_end =10 December 1792\n|predecessor =\n|successor =[[John Hunter (Royal Navy officer)|John Hunter]]\n|birth_date ={{Birth date|df=yes|1738|10|11}}\n|birth_place= [[Cheapside]], [[London]], England\n|death_date = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1814|8|31|1738|10|11}}\n|death_place= [[Bath, Somerset]], England\n|nickname=\n|allegiance= [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]\n|branch= [[Royal Navy]]\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]]\n|commands=\n|unit=\n|battles= {{unbulleted list|[[Seven Years' War]] | [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War (1776\u201377)|Spanish-Portuguese War]] | [[American Revolutionary War]] }}  [[Australian Frontier Wars]]\n|awards=\n}}\n'''[[Admiral]] Arthur Phillip''' (11 October 1738 \u2013 31 August 1814) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer and the first [[Governor of New South Wales]] who founded the British penal colony that later became the city of [[Sydney]], Australia.<ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=%22Thomas+Gilbert%22+captain+pacific&num=100#v=onepage&q=%22Thomas%20Gilbert%22%20captain%20pacific&f=false\n|title=The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured Pacific groups |publisher=[[Life Magazine]] |date=22 May 1944 |last=Morison |first=Samuel Eliot |author-link=Samuel Eliot Morison |accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter much experience at sea, Phillip sailed with the [[First Fleet]] as Governor-designate of the proposed British penal colony of [[New South Wales]]. In January 1788, he selected its location to be [[Port Jackson]] (encompassing Sydney Harbour).<ref name=\"On this day\">{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=On this day: Arthur Phillip born|author=Leila Berney |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2014/10/on-this-day-arthur-phillip-born|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nPhillip was a far-sighted governor who soon saw that New South Wales would need a civil administration and a system for emancipating the convicts. But his plan to bring skilled tradesmen on the voyage had been rejected, and he faced immense problems of labour, discipline and supply. His friendly attitude towards Aboriginal people was also sorely tested when they killed his gamekeeper, and he was not able to assert a clear policy about them.\n\nThe arrival of the [[Second Fleet (Australia)|Second]] and [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third]] Fleets placed new pressures on the scarce local resources, but by the time Phillip sailed home in December 1792, the colony was taking shape, with official land-grants and systematic farming and water-supply.\n\nPhillip retired in 1805, but continued to correspond with his friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests.\n\n==Early life==\nCaptain Arthur Phillip was born on 11 October 1738, the youngest of two children to Jacob Phillip and Elizabeth Breach. His father Jacob was born in [[Frankfurt]], Germany. He was a languages teacher who may also have served in the Royal Navy as an [[able seaman]] and purser's steward. His mother Elizabeth was the widow of an [[ordinary seaman]], John Herbert, who had served in Jamaica aboard HMS ''Tartar'' and died of disease on 13 August 1732. At the time of Arthur Phillip's birth, his family maintained a modest existence as tenants near [[Cheapside]] in the [[City of London]].<ref>Pembroke 2013, p.5</ref>\n\nThere are no surviving records of Phillip's early childhood.

In July 1763 he married Margaret Denison, a widow 16 years his senior, and moved to [[Glasshayes]] in [[Lyndhurst, Hampshire]], establishing a farm there.

While with the Portuguese Navy, Phillip commanded a frigate, the ''Nossa Senhora do Pilar.'' On this ship he took a detachment of troops from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to [[Colonia do Sacramento]] on the [[Rio de la Plata]] (opposite [[Buenos Aires]]) to relieve the garrison there. This voyage also conveyed a consignment of convicts assigned to carry out work at Colonia. During a storm encountered in the course of the voyage, the convicts assisted in working the ship and, on arrival at Colonia, Phillip recommended that they be rewarded for saving the ship by remission of their sentences.<ref>[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=51BTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT164&dq=%22Gazeta+de+Lisboa%22+Philips&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_3OXVbGROKXWmAXOsYD4CA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Gazeta%20de%20Lisboa%22%20Philips&f=false ''Gazeta de Lisboa,'' 3 de Abril de 1787:] Maurine Goldston-Morris, OAM, ''The Life of Admiral Arthur Phillip, RN, 1738\u20131814,'' Naval Historical Society of Australia Monograph No.58, Garden Island [1997].</ref> A garbled version of this eventually found its way into the English press when Phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to Sydney.<ref>See for example, ''The World,'' 16 April 1789: \"BOTANY BAY.\u2014 Mr. ''Philip,'' who has this command, has the aid of experience.

Cited in Frost 1995, p.110</ref> A colony there would be of great assistance to the British Navy in facilitating attacks on the Spanish possessions in Chile and Peru, as Banks's collaborators, James Matra, Captain Sir George Young and Sir John Call pointed out in written proposals on the subject. The British Government took the decision to settle what is now Australia and found the Botany Bay colony in mid-1786. Lord Sydney, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, was the minister in charge, and in September 1786 he appointed Phillip commodore of the fleet which was to transport the convicts and soldiers who were to be the new settlers to Botany Bay. Upon arrival there, Phillip was to assume the powers of Captain General and Governor in Chief of the new colony. A subsidiary colony was to be founded on [[Norfolk Island]], as recommended by Sir John Call, to take advantage for naval purposes of that island's native flax and timber.\n\nIn October 1786, Phillip was appointed captain of {{HMS|Sirius|1786|6}} and named Governor-designate of [[New South Wales]], the proposed British colony on the east coast of Australia, by [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]], the [[Home Secretary]].\n\nPhillip had a very difficult time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of [[Royal Marines|marines]] and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony.\n\nThe 11 ships of the First Fleet set sail on 13 May 1787.  The leading ship, {{HMS|Supply|1759|6}} reached [[Botany Bay]] setting up camp on the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]],<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15100 The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay] With an Account of the Establishment of the Colonies of [[Port Jackson]] and [[Norfolk Island]] (1789) \u2013 from [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref> on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]], who had accompanied [[James Cook]] in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source. After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on 26 January the marines and convicts landed at [[Sydney Cove]], which Phillip named after Lord Sydney.\n\n===Governor of New South Wales===\nShortly after landing and establishing the settlement at Port Jackson, on 15 February 1788, Phillip sent Lieutenant [[Philip Gidley King]] with 8 free men and a number of convicts to establish the second British colony in the Pacific at [[Norfolk Island]]. This was partly in response to a perceived threat of losing Norfolk Island to the French and partly to establish an alternative food source for the new colony.\n[[File:Arthur Phillip - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|thumbnail|left|Arthur Phillip]]\nThe early days of the settlement were chaotic and difficult. With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture. The colony was on the verge of outright [[starvation]] for an extended period. The marines, poorly disciplined themselves in many cases, were not interested in convict discipline. Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working. This was the beginning of the process of convict emancipation which was to culminate in the reforms of [[Lachlan Macquarie]] after 1811.\n\nPhillip showed in other ways that he recognised that [[New South Wales]] could not be run simply as a prison camp. Lord Sydney, often criticised as an ineffectual incompetent, had made one fundamental decision about the settlement that was to influence it from the start. Instead of just establishing it as a military prison, he provided for a civil administration, with courts of law. Two convicts, [[Henry Kable|Henry]] and Susannah Kable, sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of [[Alexander (1783 ship)|''Alexander'']], for stealing their possessions during the voyage. Convicts in Britain had no right to sue, and Sinclair had boasted that he could not be sued by them. Despite this, the court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the captain to make restitution for the loss of their possessions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.mq.edu.au/research/colonial_case_law/nsw/cases/case_index/1788/cable_v_sinclair/|title=Cable v.

In one paragraph he wrote: \"The laws of this country [England] will of course, be introduced in [New] South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves.\"<ref>Britton (ed.) 1978, p. 53</ref> Nevertheless, Phillip believed in severe discipline; floggings and hangings were commonplace, although Philip commuted many death sentences.\n\nPhillip also had to adopt a policy towards the [[Eora]] [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal people]], who lived around the waters of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]].<ref name=\"On this day\"/> Phillip ordered that they must be well-treated, and that anyone killing Aboriginal people would be hanged. Phillip befriended an Eora man called [[Bennelong]],<ref name=\"On this day\"/> and later took him to England. On the beach at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], a misunderstanding arose and Phillip was speared in the shoulder: but he ordered his men not to retaliate.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Governors of New South Wales|last=Tink|first=Andrew|publisher=The Federation Press|year=2009|isbn=9781862877436|pages=42\u201343|editor=Cavalier, Rodney}}</ref> Phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the Eora, although they remained wary of the settlers. Soon, a virulent disease, smallpox that was believed to be on account of the white settlers, and other European-introduced epidemics, ravaged the Eora population.\n\nThe Governor's main problem was with his own military officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant. [[Scurvy]] broke out, and in October 1788 Phillip had to send ''Sirius'' to [[Cape Town]] for supplies, and strict rationing was introduced, with thefts of food punished by hanging. Arthur Phillip quoted \"The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so I have come to a conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts.\"\n\n===Stabilising the colony===\nPhillip insisted that no retaliation be taken to avenge his own non-fatal spearing. Convict John MacIntyre had been fatally speared during a hunting expedition by unknown Aboriginal people apparently without provocation. MacIntyre swore on his death bed that he had done them no harm, but marine officer [[Watkin Tench]] was suspicious of the claim.  Tench was sent on a punitive expedition but finding no Aboriginal people other than [[Bennelong]] took no action.<ref name=tench>{{cite book | title=A Complete Account of the Settlement at Port Jackson | author=Watkin Tench | url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/ozlit/pdf/p00044.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPhillip, growing frustrated with the burdens of upholding a colony and his health suffering, resigned soon after this episode.<ref name=\"sbs.com.au\">\n{{cite video\n|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/firstaustralians/\n|title=First Australians\n|publisher=[[Blackfella Films]], SBS, and Screen Australia\n|year=2008\n|accessdate=26 September 2012\n}}</ref><ref>''[[Watkin Tench]], 1788'' (ed: [[Tim Flannery]]), 1996, {{ISBN|1-875847-27-8}}, p. 167</ref>\n\nBy 1790 the situation had stabilised. The population of about 2,000 was adequately housed and fresh food was being grown. Phillip assigned a convict, [[James Ruse]], land at [[Rose Hill, New South Wales|Rose Hill]] (now [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]]) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony. Other convicts followed his example. ''Sirius'' was wrecked in March 1790 at the satellite settlement of [[Norfolk Island]], depriving Phillip of vital supplies. In June 1790 the Second Fleet arrived with hundreds more convicts, most of them too sick to work.\n\n[[File:ArthurPhillipStatueSydney gobeirne.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Arthur Phillip in the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]]]\nBy December 1790 Phillip was ready to return to England, but the colony had largely been forgotten in London and no instructions reached him, so he carried on. In 1791 he was advised that the government would send out two convoys of convicts annually, plus adequate supplies. But July, when the vessels of the [[Third Fleet (Australia)|Third Fleet]] began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send the ship ''[[Atlantic (1783 ship)|Atlantic]]'' to [[Calcutta]] for supplies.<ref>Hunter, Chapter XXIII</ref>\n\nBy 1792 the colony was well established, though Sydney remained an unplanned huddle of wooden huts and tents. The [[whaling|whaling industry]] was established, ships were visiting Sydney to trade, and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming. [[John Macarthur (wool pioneer)|John Macarthur]] and other officers were importing sheep and beginning to grow wool. The colony was still very short of skilled farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen, and the convicts continued to work as little as possible, even though they were working mainly to grow their own food.\n\nIn late 1792 Phillip, whose health was suffering, relinquished his governorship and sailed for England on the ship ''[[Atlantic (1783 ship)|Atlantic]]'', taking with him many specimens of plants and animals. He also took Bennelong and his friend [[Yemmerrawanne]], another young Indigenous Australian who, unlike Bennelong, would succumb to English weather and disease and not live to make the journey home. The European population of New South Wales at his departure was 4,221, of whom 3,099 were convicts. The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales. Phillip arrived in London in May 1793. He tendered his formal resignation and was granted a pension of \u00a3500 a year.<ref>Michael Pembroke, ''Arthur Phillip \u2013 Sailor, Mercenary, Governor, Spy,'' Melbourne, Hardie Grant Books, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nPhillip's estranged wife, Margaret, had died in 1792 and was buried in St Beuno's Churchyard, Llanycil, Bala, Merionethshire.<ref>Michael Flynn, \"New perspectives on Arthur Phillip, first Governor of New South Wales [Series of parts]: Part 1: Wives, graves and ghosts.\"  Descent, Volume 43 Issue 2 (June 2013) : 65\u201381.</ref>  In 1794 Phillip married Isabella Whitehead, and lived for a time at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. His health gradually recovered and in 1796 he went back to sea, holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the French. In January 1799 he became a Rear-Admiral. In 1805, aged 67, he retired from the Navy with the rank of [[Admiral of the Blue]], and spent most of the rest of his life at Bath. He continued to correspond with friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests with government officials.

({{lang-gd|Aonghas}}) is one of the 32 [[Local government in Scotland|local government]] [[council areas of Scotland]], a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. The council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]]. Main industries include [[agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Global pharmaceuticals company [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]] has a significant presence in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] in the north of the county.\n\nAngus was historically a [[Shires of Scotland|county]], known officially as '''Forfarshire''' from the 18th century until 1928. It remains a [[registration county]] and a [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy area]]. In 1975 some of its administrative functions were transferred to the council district of the [[Tayside]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]], and in 1995 further reform resulted in the establishment of the unitary Angus Council.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe area that now comprises Angus has been occupied since at least the [[Neolithic period]]. Material taken from [[posthole]]s from an enclosure at Douglasmuir, near [[Friockheim]], about five miles north of Arbroath has been [[radiocarbon date]]d to around 3500&nbsp;BC. The function of the enclosure is unknown, but may have been for agriculture or for ceremonial purposes.<ref name=\"Douglasmuir\">{{cite journal|last=Kendrick |first=Jill |others=contributions by Barclay, Gordon J.; Cowie, Trevor G.; Saville, Alan; illustrations by Townshend, Angela; Braby, Alan |year=1995 |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_125/125_029_067.pdf |title=Excavation of a Neolithic enclosure and an Iron Age settlement at Douglasmuir, Angus |journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland |volume=125 |pages=29\u201367 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611100003/http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_125/125_029_067.pdf |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n[[Bronze age]] archaeology is to be found in abundance in the area.

Bordering it were the kingdoms of Ce (Mar and Buchan) to the North, Fotla (Atholl) to the West, and Fib (Fife) to the South.\n\nThe most visible remnants of the Pictish age are the numerous [[Pictish stones|sculptured stones]] that can be found throughout Angus. Of particular note are the collections found at [[Aberlemno Sculptured Stones|Aberlemno]], [[St Vigeans Sculptured Stones Museum|St Vigeans]], [[Kirriemuir Sculptured Stones|Kirriemuir]] and [[Monifieth Sculptured Stones|Monifieth]].\n\nHistorically Angus shared borders with [[Kincardineshire]] to the north-east, [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] to the north and [[Perthshire]] to the west. Southwards, it faced [[Fife]] across the [[Firth of Tay]].\n\nAngus is marketed as the birthplace of Scotland. The signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] at [[Arbroath Abbey]] in 1320 marked Scotland's establishment as an independent nation. It is an area of rich history from Pictish times onwards. Notable historic sites in addition to Arbroath Abbey include Glamis Castle, Arbroath Signal Tower museum and the Bell Rock Light House.\n\n==Demography==\n\n===Population structure===\n{{Historical populations\n|title=Historical Angus population\n|type=Ireland\n|1801|65,068\n|1811|69,376\n|1821|74,436\n|1831|84,630\n|1841|106,890\n|1851|119,357\n|1911|118,748\n|1921|101,767\n|1931|93,803\n|1941|95,290\n|1951|96,777\n|1961|93,666\n|1971|90,554\n|1981|98,685\n|1991|107,866\n|2001|108,400\n|2011|116,000\n|source=<br/><ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10056755/cube/TOT_POP Vision of Britain]</ref><ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/table_page.jsp?tab_id=S1911COU_M1&u_id=10145958&show=DB&min_c=6&max_c=10 Vision of Britain: 1911 Census of Scotland, County Report]</ref>\n}}\nIn the 2001 census the population of Angus was recorded as 108,400. 20.14% were under the age of 16, 63.15% were between 16 and 65 and 18.05% were aged 65 or above.\n\nOf the 16 to 74 age group, 32.84% had no formal qualifications, 27.08% were educated to 'O' Grade/Standard Grade level, 14.38% to Higher level, 7.64% to HND or equivalent level and 18.06% to degree level.\n\n===Language in Angus===\nThe most recent available census results (2001) show that [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] is spoken by 0.45% of the Angus population.

In 1996, the two-tier local government council was abolished and Angus was established as one of the replacement single-tier [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Council Areas]]. Prior to 1974 the county had been served by Angus District Council and [[Tayside]] Regional Council. As of May 2017 there are 28 seats on the council. From the May 2017 elections the seats are held as follows \u2014 Independent 9, SNP 9, Conservative 8, Liberal Democrat 2.\n\nThe council's civic head is the Provost of Angus. There have been five Provosts since its establishment in 1996 \u2014 Frances Duncan, Bill Middleton, Ruth Leslie-Melville, Helen Oswald and Alex King. On 16 May 2017 a new provost will be appointed from the councillors elected in Angus at the 2017 elections. As Angus is a county area the [[Lord Lieutenant of Angus]] is separate role.\n\nThe council has had four Chief Executives since its formation \u2014 Sandy Watson 1996\u20132006, David Sawers 2006\u20132011, Richard Stiff 2011\u20132017 and Margo Williamson 2017 to date. Margo Williamson is the first female Chief Executive since the Council was formed. The council's main offices are located at Angus House at Orchardbank in Forfar and at Bruce House in Arbroath while council meetings are held in the Town and County Hall in central Forfar. The council's offices include the historic County Buildings in Forfar adjacent to the Sheriff Court.\n\nThe boundaries of the present council area are the same as those of the historic county minus the City of [[Dundee]].\n\nThe council area borders [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Dundee City]] and [[Perth and Kinross]].\n\n==Parliamentary representation==\n\n===UK Parliament===\n\nAngus is represented by three MPs for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]].\n\n*[[Angus (UK Parliament constituency)|Angus]] \u2014 covers most of the council area, is represented by [[Kirstene Hair]] of the [[Scottish Conservatives|Conservative]] party.\n*[[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] \u2014 mainly covers Dundee, however a small portion of eastern Sidlaw and Carnoustie areas are part of the constituency, is represented by [[Stewart Hosie]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]\n*[[Dundee West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee West]] \u2014 mainly covers Dundee, however a small portion of western Sidlaw area is part of the constituency, is represented by [[Chris Law]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]\n\n===Scottish Parliament===\n\nAngus is represented by two constituency MSPs for the [[Scottish Parliament]].\n\n*[[Angus North and Mearns (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus North and Mearns]] \u2014 covers the north of Angus and a southern portion of Aberdeenshire, is represented by [[Mairi Evans]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].\n*[[Angus South (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Angus South]] \u2014 covers the south of Angus, is represented by [[Graeme Dey]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].\n\nIn addition to the two constituency MSPs, Angus is also represented by MSPs from the North East Scotland Region\n\n==Geography==\nAngus can be split into three geographic areas. To the north and west, the [[topography]] is mountainous. This is the area of the [[Five Glens of Angus]], which is sparsely populated and where the main industry is [[hill farming]]. To the south and east the topography consists of rolling hills bordering the sea. This area is well populated, with the larger towns. In between lies [[Strathmore, Angus|Strathmore]] (''the Great Valley''), which is a fertile agricultural area noted for the growing of potatoes, soft fruit and the raising of [[Angus cattle]]. Montrose in the north east of the county is notable for its tidal basin.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Towns and villages==\n[[File:ANGUSSHIRE (Forfarshire).

He spent years working on his father's farm, where, according to his brother, Jacques, he could perform the work of three men.

Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Africa]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}}{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}<ref name=AEbio />\n\nHe made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as \"Monster Roussimoff\", wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Enterprise]].

He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life).

The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus Antonio Inoki fight and ended when Andr\u00e9 threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring and won via count out.\n\nIn 1980, he feuded with Hulk Hogan, where unlike their more famous matches in the late 1980s, Hogan was the villain and Andr\u00e9 was the hero, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's [[Showdown at Shea]] and in Pennsylvania, where after Andr\u00e9 pinned Hogan to win the match, Hogan bodyslammed Andr\u00e9 much like their legendary WrestleMania III match in 1987. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983 with their roles reversed and with Antonio Inoki also involved.\n\nIn 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wide Wrestling Federation to his son, [[Vince McMahon]], Jr.<ref>{{cite book |title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling |last=Hornbaker |first=Tim |page=193 |publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}</ref> As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him.

Hogan was still seemingly in disbelief as to what Andr\u00e9 was doing, prompting Heenan to say \"You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan\" before Andr\u00e9 ripped off the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, with the crucifix scratching Hogan's chest, causing him to bleed.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=136\u2013139}}\n\nFollowing Hogan's acceptance of Andr\u00e9's challenge on a later edition of ''Piper's Pit'', the two were part of a 20-man over-the-top rope battle-royal on the 14 March edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event results|Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]].<ref name=\"history623\">{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963\u20131989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=623 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}</ref> Although the battle royal was won by [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], Andr\u00e9 claimed to have gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF World Heavyweight Champion over the top rope.

In reality, Andr\u00e9 had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed Andr\u00e9 in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan slammed a then-face Andr\u00e9 following their match at the \"[[Showdown at Shea]]\" on August 9, 1980, though Andr\u00e9 was much lighter (around {{convert|470|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed Andr\u00e9 in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania]], a month later).<ref>{{cite AV media|title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD |publisher=[[WWE]] | date=2006}}</ref> This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen the Giant slammed (Andr\u00e9 had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[Canek (wrestler)|El Canek]] and [[Stan Hansen]], among others, to slam him).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=157}}<ref>{{cite book |title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story |last=Race |first=Harley |authorlink=Harley Race |page=90 |publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C. |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of WrestleMania III, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the Andr\u00e9\u2013Hogan match that took place then. The feud between Andr\u00e9 and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated Andr\u00e9 and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by Andr\u00e9's partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. Andr\u00e9 went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 \u2013 Main Event |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> before Hogan returned to the ring to attack Andr\u00e9 and knock him out of the ring. Andr\u00e9 later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull Andr\u00e9 away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over Andr\u00e9's back (which he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|no-sold]]) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and Andr\u00e9, and to make it seem that Andr\u00e9 was certain to win easily when they did meet.\n\nIn the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to Andr\u00e9 to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172\u2013175}} Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-Andr\u00e9 rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air 5 February 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, Andr\u00e9 won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was \"detained backstage\", and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,<ref>Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988</ref> but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),<ref>\"A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,\" ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.</ref> made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.\n\nAfter winning, Andr\u00e9 \"sold\" the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.<ref name=wwechamp>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624001310/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |archivedate=June 24, 2005 |df= }}</ref> This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], Andr\u00e9 and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that Andr\u00e9 was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, Andr\u00e9 and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.\n\nAt the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura]] as the special guest referee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref> During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], (Savage's wife Elizabeth Hulette) distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.\n\nConcurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, Andr\u00e9 was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out Andr\u00e9 with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, Andr\u00e9 regularly got the upper hand in the feud.\n\n[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|Andr\u00e9's feud with [[Jake Roberts]] derived from Andr\u00e9's [[ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].]]\nAndr\u00e9's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said Andr\u00e9 was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened Andr\u00e9; as a result, Andr\u00e9 suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during Andr\u00e9's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger Andr\u00e9.\n\nIn 1989, Andr\u00e9 and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and Andr\u00e9 as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, Andr\u00e9 engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]].

Due to his ongoing health issues, Andr\u00e9 was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging in Andr\u00e9.\n\nOn weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in Andr\u00e9's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family. However Andr\u00e9 would wrestle one more time with Haku, teaming up to face Demolition on a house show in Honolulu, HI, on April 10, Andr\u00e9 was knocked out of the ring and The Colossal Connection lost via countout.

Several of Andr\u00e9's longtime hometown friends were interviewed as well.

It was discovered in photographs taken by ''[[Voyager&nbsp;2]]'' in 1979, making it the first [[natural satellite]] to be discovered from images taken by an interplanetary [[spacecraft]], rather than through a telescope.{{sfn|IAUC 3454}} It was officially named after the mythological [[Adrasteia]], foster mother of the [[Greek god]] [[Zeus]]\u2014the equivalent of the [[Roman god]] [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].{{sfn|IAUC 3872}}\n\nAdrastea is one of the few moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Jupiter's Main Ring]] and is thought to be the main contributor of material to the [[Rings of Jupiter]]. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]], very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is [[tidally locked]] to [[Jupiter]].\n\n== Discovery and observations ==\n[[File:Adrast\u00e9e FDS 20630.png|thumb|300px|left|Discovery image of Adrastea, taken on July 8, 1979, by Voyager&nbsp;2. Adrastea is the fainter dot, in the very middle, straddling the line of the Jovian rings.]]\n\nAdrastea was discovered by [[David Jewitt|David C. Jewitt]] and [[G. Edward Danielson]] in ''[[Voyager 2|Voyager&nbsp;2]]'' probe photographs taken on July 8, 1979, and received the designation '''{{nowrap|S/1979&nbsp;J&nbsp;1}}'''.{{sfn|IAUC 3454}}{{sfn|Jewitt Danielson et al.|1979}} Although it appeared only as a dot,{{sfn|Jewitt Danielson et al.|1979}} it was the first moon to be discovered by an interplanetary spacecraft. Soon after its discovery, two other of the inner [[moons of Jupiter]] ([[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]] and [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]) were observed in the images taken a few months earlier by ''[[Voyager 1|Voyager&nbsp;1]]''. The [[Galileo spacecraft|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] was able to determine the moon's shape in 1998, but the images remain poor.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} In 1983, Adrastea was officially named after the Greek nymph [[Adrastea (mythology)|Adrastea]], the daughter of [[Zeus]] and his lover [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]].{{sfn|IAUC 3872}}\n\nAlthough the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called [[JunoCam]], it is almost entirely focused on observations of Jupiter itself. However, if all goes well should be able to capture some limited images of the Jupiter moons [[Metis (moon)|Metis]] and Adrastea.<ref>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AGUFM.P41B2066H JunoCam: Science and Outreach Opportunities with Juno<!-- Bot generated title -->] Hansen, C. J.; Orton, G. S. American Geophysical Union 12/2015</ref>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nAdrastea has an irregular shape and measures 20\u00d716\u00d714&nbsp;km across.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}} A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km<sup>2</sup>. This makes it the smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]],{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}} around 0.86&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>,{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}} its mass can be estimated at about 2{{E-sp|15}}&nbsp;kg. Amalthea's density implies that the moon is composed of water [[ice]] with a [[porosity]] of 10\u201315%, and Adrastea may be similar.{{sfn|Anderson Johnson et al.|2005}}\n\nNo surface details of Adrastea are known, due to the low resolution of available images.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}\n\n== Orbit ==\nAdrastea is the smallest and second-closest member of the [[inner satellites of Jupiter|inner Jovian satellite family]]. It orbits [[Jupiter]] at a radius of about 129,000&nbsp;km (1.806&nbsp;Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Main Ring]].{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}} Adrastea is one of only three moons in the [[Solar System]] known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day\u2014the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon [[Metis (moon)|Metis]], and [[Mars]]' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. The orbit has very small [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[inclination]]\u2014around 0.0015 and 0.03\u00b0, respectively. Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}\n\nDue to [[tidal locking]], Adrastea rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face always looking toward the planet. Its long axis is aligned towards Jupiter, this being the lowest energy configuration.{{sfn|Thomas Burns et al.|1998}}\n\nThe orbit of Adrastea lies inside [[Jupiter]]'s [[synchronous orbit]] radius (as does [[Metis (moon)|Metis]]'s), and as a result, [[tidal deceleration|tidal force]]s are slowly causing its orbit to decay so that it will one day impact Jupiter. If its density is similar to Amalthea's then its orbit would actually lie within the fluid [[Roche limit]]. However, since it is not breaking up, it must still lie outside its rigid Roche limit.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}\n\nAdrastea is the second-fastest-moving of Jupiter's moons, with an orbital speed of 31.378&nbsp;km/s.\n\n== Relationship with Jupiter's rings ==\nAdrastea is the largest contributor to material in [[rings of Jupiter|Jupiter's rings]]. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of [[Inner satellites of Jupiter|Jupiter's four small inner satellites]] by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This is due to the satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their [[Roche sphere]]s.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}\n\nIt seems that Adrastea is the most copious source of this ring material, as evidenced by the densest ring (the [[Rings of Jupiter#Main ring|Main Ring]]) being located at and within Adrastea's orbit.{{sfn|Burns Showalter et al.|1999}} More precisely, the orbit of Adrastea lies near the outer edge of Jupiter's Main Ring.{{sfn|Ockert-Bell Burns et al.|1999}}  The exact extent of visible ring material depends on the phase angle of the images: in [[light scattering|forward-scattered light]] Adrastea is firmly outside the Main Ring,{{sfn|Ockert-Bell Burns et al.|1999}} but in [[Backscatter|back-scattered light]] (which reveals much bigger particles) there appears to also be a narrow ringlet outside Adrastea's orbit.{{sfn|Burns Simonelli et al.|2004}}\n\n== Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = calculated\n| Calculated on the basis of other parameters.\n}}\n}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n'''Cited sources'''\n* {{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1110422| last1 = Anderson | first1 = J.
